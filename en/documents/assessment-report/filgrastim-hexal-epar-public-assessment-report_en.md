## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

The  current  treatment  of  cancer  with  combination  cytotoxic  therapy  targeting  proliferating  cells usually leads to bone marrow damage, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and, most importantly, neutropenia resulting  in  impaired  host  defence.  A  severe  neutropenia  will  inevitably  lead  to  serious  infections. Life-threatening gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections as well as sepsis will occur as long as the severe neutropenia prevails. This leads to delays in subsequent chemotherapy cycles. The recovery of the bone marrow is stimulated by various growth factors. The most important growth factor for the recovery of neutrophils is granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is a 20,000 Dalton glycoprotein  hormone  that  stimulates  the  proliferation  of  neutropoietic  progenitor  cells  and  their differentiation to granulocytes, and functionally activates mature neutrophils.

Human G-CSF is a single polypeptide chain protein of 174 amino acids with O-glycosylation at one threonine residue. It acts by binding to a specific transmembrane receptor (G-CSF receptor), a member of the class I cytokine receptor family expressed on various haematopoietic cells such as stem cells, multipotent  progenitors,  myeloid-committed  progenitors,  neutrophils,  and  monocytes.  This  receptor forms  homo-oligomeric  complexes  upon  ligand  binding.  Seven  membrane-bound  and  one  soluble isoform  of  the  G-CSF  receptor  have  been  isolated;  the  membrane-bound  isoforms  arise  from alternative  RNA  splicing  leading  to  differences  in  the  cytoplasmic  sequences,  but  the  extracellular, ligand-binding domains are identical. Consequently, the effects of G-CSF (and of recombinant human G-CSF, rhG-CSF) are mediated via a single affinity class of receptors. The same mechanism of action and  receptor  mediated  biological  activity  operates  in  mobilization  of  mature  neutrophils  into  the circulating neutrophil pool and acceleration of granulopoiesis.

Filgrastim is a recombinant human G-CSF produced in E. coli. Its amino acid sequence is identical to that of natural human G-CSF, except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for the expression in E. coli. Moreover, it is not glycosylated.

A marketing  authorisation  application  has  been  submitted  by  Hexal  AG  for  the  product  Filgrastim Hexal under 2001/83/EC Article 10(4) Biosimilar medicinal product.

The indications claimed are exactly the same as those of the reference product Neupogen.

-  Reduction  in  the  duration  of  neutropenia  and  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  in  patients treated  with  established  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of  chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
-  Mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells.
-  In  patients  (children  or  adults)  with  severe  congenital,  cyclic,  or  idiopathic  neutropenia  with  an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 10 9 /L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events.
-  Treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 10 9 /L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other therapeutic options are inappropriate.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Two  presentations  of  the  medicinal  product  are  provided,  30MU  (300  µg/0.5  ml),  Solution  for Injection/concentration  for  solution  for  infusion  -  pre-filled  syringe  and  48  MU  (480  µg/0.5  ml), Solution for Injection/concentrate for solution for infusion - pre-filled syringe. The reference product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is Neupogen (Amgen GmbH, Germany) also available in the same two presentations, which was used for the entire comparability exercise to demonstrate comparable quality, safety and efficacy.

## Active Substance

##  Manufacture

Filgrastim is manufactured and released at Sandoz GmbH, Kundl, Austria. Filgrastim is produced by recombinant  DNA  technology  in  bacteria  ( E.coli )  from  the  full  length  human  sequence  for  N-(LMethionyl) granulocytes colony-stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF). Native G-CSF is a glycosylated protein  but  production  in  bacteria  leads  to  a  non-glycosylated  product,  however,  this  is  still biologically active. Appropriate data have been provided to demonstrate genetic stability of the host cell  construct. E.coli are  expanded  in  fermentors  using  human  and  animal-free  growth  media. Filgrastim  is  concentrated  in E.coli inclusion  bodies  (IB)  which  are  isolated  by  cell  disruption  and centrifugation  and  then  solubilised  to  allow  protein  re-folding.  Down-stream  processing  involves chromatographic  purification  steps  to  separate  filgrastim  from  other  contaminating  proteins  and impurities. This is followed by further polishing steps. A final buffer exchange is performed to yield the active substance solution.

The E.coli are banked in a standard 2 tier banking system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and a manufacturers working cell bank (MWCB) to current guidelines. All materials used to manufacture filgrastim are controlled and of a suitable quality. Critical steps and intermediates are controlled by a range of critical process parameters (identified during development), process parameters, action limits and  acceptance  criteria.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  critical  steps,  a  validation  programme  was devised and implemented. Process validation was performed at full scale and the results used to justify the  limits  set.  Within  process  validation,  hold  times  for  intermediates  were  also  validated  as  was chromatography column re-use. Final active substance filling and shipping was validated.

During manufacturing development of active substance, key steps were investigated and optimised. Development of the purification stages included different chromatographic methods, buffer compositions, and the sequence of steps.

Filgrastim is stored in pre-sterilised non-pyrogenic bottles with screw caps.

## Characterisation

Extensive characterisation was undertaken of filgrastim as well as medicinal product and additionally Neupogen medicinal product to confirm identity and purity. Primary structure, secondary and tertiary structures were assessed using appropriate analytical techniques. Charge characteristics were assessed by  isoelectric  focussing  (IEF),  as  well  as  cation  and  anion  chromatography.  Finally,  biological characteristics were assessed by bioassay, western blotting and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (to investigate binding affinity). The characterisation programme was based on scientific advice  received  by  the  Applicant  from  the  CHMP.  Characterisation  data  supported  the  correct sequence  and  folding  of  the  recombinant  G-CSF  and  demonstrated  good  batch  reproducibility.  A series of in-house standards were prepared and used throughout characterisation and for batch release. The WHO standard for G-CSF was also used within the bioassay.

Product related impurities were identified, also using stressed samples and characterised by suitable methods in all active substance and DP batches.  Appropriate limits were set, based on batch data.

Potential process related impurities were considered and identified.  Appropriate analytical methods were  selected,  and  all  batches  tested  and  limits  set  based  on  batch  data  and  pharmacopoeial specifications.

-  Specification

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Active substance specifications and shelf-life specifications have been set, supported and justified with batch data and characterisation data. All non-pharmacopoeial methods were suitably validated.

-  Stability

Active substance stability has been determined to be 36 months at -20±5°C.

-  Comparability Exercise for Active Substance

Medicinal Product composition of Filgrastim Hexal and Neupogen are quantitatively identical except the buffer system for Filgrastim Hexal is glutamate and for Neupogen it is acetate.

The data presented confirm Filgrastim Hexal and Neupogen conform with respect to primary structure, secondary and tertiary structure, molecular mass, hydrophobicity, molecular size, charge, binding and ( in-vitro ) bioactivity.

## Medicinal Product

-  Pharmaceutical Development

The medicinal product composition was developed to be suitable both for subcutaneous injection and for intravenous infusion; furthermore, as a biosimilar medicinal product, it was developed to be similar to  the  reference  product  resulting  in  two  formulations  30  MU/0.5  ml  and  48  MU/0.5  ml.  During development a number of buffer systems were tested for stability of the active substance, concluding that: glutamate = acetate. The final composition was optimised and matched to Neupogen except for the use of glutamate rather than acetate for the buffer.  The liquid product is packaged in 1 ml prefilled syringes and can be used without further reconstitution.

For patients treated with Filgrastim Hexal diluted to concentrations &lt; 1.5 MU/ml (15 μ g/ml), human serum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml.

When diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution, Filgrastim Hexal is compatible with glass and a variety  of  plastics  including  polyvinylchloride,  polyolefin  (a  copolymer  of  polypropylene  and polyethylene) and polypropylene.

-  Adventitious Agents

No materials of animal or human origin are used to manufacture Filgrastim Hexal active substance or medicinal product. Some reagents derived from bovine milk protein are used in the manufacture of chromatography columns, but the suppliers certify these comply with requirements.

Both  the  active  substance  and  medicinal  product  manufacturing  processes  are  well  controlled  for microbiological safety. Master and working cell banks have undergone appropriate testing.

-  Manufacture of the Product

Manufacturing consists of mixing active substance with excipients and adjustment of pH followed by filtration and filling into pre-sterilised syringes. The manufacturing process is controlled by a series of in-process controls. Validation was performed on both presentations 30MU and 48MU. All excipients conform to the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.

##  Product Specification

Medicinal  product  specification  was  justified  by  characterisation  and  batch  data,  and  analyses performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Stability of the Product

Stability data from development batches supports a medicinal product shelf-life of 30 months at 5±3°C for both presentations. Photostability testing confirmed that the pre-filled syringes should be kept in the outer cartons in order to protect from light.

##  Comparability Exercise for Medicinal Product

Product related impurities were thoroughly investigated; aggregates, and truncated forms showed no significant differences. The data show a consistently lower level of deamidated and oxidised forms. The difference does not appear to impact on bioactivity ( in vitro bioassay) or stability.

In  conclusion,  the  physicochemical  and  biological  analysis  of  Filgrastim  Hexal  fully  supports  its biosimilarity  to  Neupogen.  medicinal  product  composition  of  Filgrastim  Hexal  and  Neupogen  are quantitatively identical except the buffer system for Filgrastim Hexal is glutamate and for Neupogen it is acetate.

##  GMO

## Not applicable

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality dossier for Filgrastim Hexal is well presented fulfilling the requirements of a biosimilar application.  The  physico-chemical  and  biological  comparability  studies  using  Neupogen  from  the German market as reference product were performed using a large set of state of the art analytical methods showing no significant differences. The composition of Filgrastim Hexal is identical to the reference  product  Neupogen  except  for  the  buffer  system.  Development  studies  using  a  number  of buffer  systems  led  to  the  conclusion  that  both  buffer  systems  are  equally  suitable  for  filgrastim formulations.  Pharmaceutical development led to a suitable product.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical testing strategy was aimed at comparing the marketed reference product Neupogen with filgrastim. In an in  vitro NFS-60 cell assay, filgrastim  and the reference  drug Neupogen were compared  for  ability  to  interact  with  the  G-CSF  receptor.  Filgrastim  was  also  compared  with Neupogen  in  four  animal  studies  assessing  pharmacodynamics,  toxicity,  toxicokinetics,  and  local tolerance (table 1).

Batches  used  in  nonclinical  studies  were  released  with  the  same  analytical  and  quality  control procedures  established  for  batches  in  clinical  studies.  All  batches  released  for  the  non-clinical  and clinical studies were stated to meet the criteria of equal relative dose potency compared to the G-CSF standard.

All non-clinical studies were stated to be conducted in GLP -certified contract institutions. However, an  additional  study  on  the  determination  of  G-CSF  level  'Determination  of  rhG-CSF  in  rat  serum using ELISA' (additional experiments), performed by BioProof AG, was not conducted in compliance with GLP.

## Pharmacology

##  Primary pharmacodynamics

The in vitro pharmacological  evaluation  of  filgrastim  was  performed  using  the  NFS-60  cell proliferation assay. This in vitro cell assay is based on the ability of murine myeloblastic NFS-60 cells to proliferate in response to G-CSF. The in vitro potency of all recombinant G-CSF samples produced was evaluated by a parallel-line assay format according to the European Pharmacopoeia 1997, Chapter 3.5  (Statistical  analysis  of  results  of  biological  assays  and  tests).  The  estimates  for  relative  dose potency of filgrastim and Neupogen are presented in Table 2.

* Batches starting with #N refer to Neupogen batches, all other batches are filgrastim batches. The third column depicts the activity in percent of the activity of the reference standard, whereas the sixth column lists the specific activity in units per mg. The activity of the reference standard is declared as 1.0 x 10 8 U/mg.

The in  vivo potency  of  filgrastim  was  investigated  in  normal  (part  A  of  Study  EP06-004)  and neutropenic rats (part B of Study EP06-004). In Part A of Study EP06-004, filgrastim, Neupogen or control solution were administered subcutaneously on four consecutive days (day 1-4) to male CD rats at dose levels of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160µg/kg. Blood samples were taken at approximately the same time in the morning before dosing on day 1 and on test days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12. The kinetics of the neutrophil response for filgrastim and Neupogen treatment are shown in Figure 1. The integrated effect over time of five different dose levels on neutrophil count for filgrastim and Neupogen is shown in Figure 2.

The corresponding areas under the effect curve (AUEC days 0-12) for neutrophil count of filgrastim (S) and Neupogen (N) at each dose level (10 to 160 µg/kg) are plotted side by side.

The  number  of  eosinophilic  and  basophilic  granulocytes  increased  slightly  in  all  filgrastim  and Neupogen treated groups 2-5 days after the first dosing, with the increase being more pronounced at 160  mg/kg.  Monocyte  counts  increased  in  all  filgrastim  and  Neupogen  treated  groups  in  a  dosedependent  manner  2  to  5  days  after  the  first  dosing.  While  the  number  of  LUCs  increased  in  all filgrastim- or Neupogen-treated groups, the absolute numbers of LUCs remained low.

The descriptive comparison of the AUEC by means of 95% confidence intervals for the ratio of the means for ANC and maximal neutrophil counts (E max ) are shown in Table 3.

In neutropenic rats (Part B of Study EP06-004), male CD rats were allocated to three dose groups (30, 60, and 100 µg/kg). On day 0 of the study, animals received a single intraperitoneal dose of 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CPA) inducing neutropenia. Filgrastim, Neupogen or control solution (0.9% NaCl = vehicle/diluent solution for filgrastim) were subcutaneously administered on four consecutive days (days 1-4). An additional control group of normal rats received neither CPA nor rhG-CSF. In analogy to  definitions  used  in  humans,  neutropenia  in  rats  was  defined  as  ANC  that  was  two  standard deviations below the normal mean ANC for untreated control animals, and the duration of neutropenia was compared between the groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Induction of neutropenia by CPA produced a reduction of ANCs and WBC counts with a maximum on test days 3-4 followed by recovery to normal values by days 8 (ANC) and 12 (WBC). Groups treated with either filgrastim or Neupogen showed a dosage-dependent increase in mean ANCs on days 2, 3, 5 and 6 compared to neutropenic control animals that did not receive rhG-CSF (Figure 3). Duration of neutropenia is shown in table 4.

A  4-week  repeated-dose  toxicity  study  with  a  6-week  recovery  period  (study  EP06-001)  was conducted in male and female Wistar rats to compare the toxicological endpoints of filgrastim and Neupogen. Both products were given s.c. once daily over a period of 28 days. Three groups of rats were treated with three different doses of filgrastim (20, 100 and 500 µg/kg b.w.) and 2 groups were treated with Neupogen doses corresponding to the low and high doses of filgrastim. One group was treated with vehicle (formulation buffer) and served as a control.

The  low  dose  (20µg/kg/day)  was  chosen  to  correspond  to  the  highest  human  dose  (24µg/kg/day) recommended for patients with severe chronic neutropenia. The high dose (500µg/kg/day) was chosen as  approximately  equivalent  to  20-fold  the  highest  human  dose  (24µg/kg/day)  recommended  for severe chronic neutropenia and about 50-fold above the dose for mobilization of autologous peripheral blood  progenitor  cells  (10µg/kg/day).  The  intermediate  dose  was  chosen  as  the  logarithmic  mean between the high and the low dose.

During the treatment period, the numbers of WBC and in particular the number of neutrophils were increased  above  the  normal  range  in  filgrastim  and  in  Neupogen  dose  groups  (Table  5).  For  both filgrastim and Neupogen, the increase in the WBC number was dose-dependent on days 14 and 28 and was more marked in males than in females. At the end of the recovery period (study day 70), WBC levels  had  returned  to  the  normal  range  of  variation  for  this  species.  Mean  serum  G-CSF  levels decreased from more than 300 pg/ml in the high dose groups (500µg/kg) to non-detectable levels at day 70. A relatively small but significant increase in neutrophil count was observed on day 3 in all animals treated with filgrastim, with the exception of the low-dose group females. On study day 14, the  number  of  neutrophils  had  further  increased  dose-dependently  reaching  levels  10-  to  12-fold higher  than  controls.  No  difference  was  found  between  the  genders.  On  study  day  28,  a  further increase in the number of neutrophils in males was found in the high dose filgrastim group (20-fold higher  than  controls),  with  no  change  in  respective  females.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  the number of neutrophils had returned to levels within the normal range of variation for this species. The same pattern of neutrophil kinetics was found in Neupogen treated animals.

On day 28 all rhG-CSF levels of test  items  from  the  control  group  and  those  animals  treated  with 20µg/kg rhG-CSF (either Neupogen or filgrastim), as well as all from the second withdrawal on study day 70 were below the limit of quantification. Four of ten test items from the animals treated with 100µg/kg filgrastim withdrawn on study day 28 yielded results between 88 and 159pg/ml rhG-CSF. Analysis  of  all  test  items  from  those  animals  treated  with  500µg/ml  rhG-CSF  (either  Neupogen  or filgrastim) yielded results within the calibration range of the ELISA: Neupogen-treated animals had rhG-CSF serum concentrations between 243 and 569pg/ml, whereas the concentration of rhG-CSF in serum from filgrastim-treated rats ranged from 266 and 1376pg/ml.

y  28.  This  increase  was Increased IgG levels were observed with a similar frequency in the filgrastim, Neupogen and control groups.  Immunoglobulin  A,  E,  G,  and  M  levels  were  determined  in  110  samples  at  the  end  of treatment and at the end of recovery. Samples including those from the control group showed similar IgA, IgE and IgM concentrations on study day 70 compared to study day 28. Increased IgG levels were found in the samples of day 70 compared to the samples of study da independent of the dose of filgrastim or Neupogen administered and was claimed to be in accordance with the age-dependent increase in IgG reported for rats aged 6 to 30 weeks .

No rhG-CSF was detectable at the end of the covery period. In Figure 4 the results of the rhG-CSF antibody ELISA in serum of male and female Antibodies against rhG-CSF were analyzed on day 7, at the end of the treatment period (day 28) and at the end of the recovery period (day 70) using a validated ELISA assay for the detection of anti-rhGCSF antibodies. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the assay was 60 nU/ml. At the end of the 6-week recovery period it could be excluded that active substance was present which might have interfered with the ability to detect anti-drug antibodies. re rats on study day 7, 28 and 70 in all groups are shown.

The mean concentration detected with the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA in serum of non-treated six week old rats was 330 nU/ml (baseline), a value reflecting a non-specific signal in the antibody assay. All results shown in Figure 4 were corrected by subtraction of this baseline concentration. A signal above the LLOQ was detected in 117 out of 170 samples tested on study days 7, 28 and 70. At the end of treatment week one (day 7) the signals detected in the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA were below the LLOQ in most of the female animals in all treatment groups, whereas a signal above the LLOQ could  be  detected  in  serum  of  two  to  three  males  in  all  groups.  However,  with  a  maximum  of 200 nU/ml the signal intensity of these male rats was relatively low. During the course of the study, the signal in the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA increased in all tested groups, including the control group  although  this  control  group  was  clearly  not  treated  with  the  rhG-CSF  as  the  number  of neutrophils did not increase during the course of the study. On day 28 the ELISA signals were only slightly higher than on study day 7. Increased levels were independent of drug, dose or gender and were also found in controls of both genders. At the end of the recovery period (day 70) all test items yielded results between 372 and 1499 nU/ml, including the control group. The signal intensities in the anti-rhG-CSF  ELISA  were  higher  in  females  than  in  males,  especially  in  the  high  dose  group  of

filgrastim and the low dose group of Neupogen. Throughout the study, slightly increased signals in the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA were found in both the filgrastim and the Neupogen treatment groups. However, signal intensities were comparable in both treatment groups and were also comparable to those in serum of animals from the control group.

In this study, no mortality and no significant alterations in body weight gain were found after administration of filgrastim or Neupogen. At all three dose levels of  filgrastim,  no  significant  differences  in  serum  concentrations  (Cmax)  and  a  small  increase  of  the AUC(0-14d)  were  found  between  single  and  repeated  dosing.  After  repeated  treatment  with  the  two Neupogen doses , an increase in both serum concentrations (Cmax) and A to single (Table 6).

##  Local tolerance

In study EP06-001, a local tolerance test performed in 36 female rabbits, the local tolerability of two formulations of filgrastim containing acetate buffer (Neupogen-like) and containing glutamate buffer (filgrastim-final  formulation)  was  compared  to  the  reference  product  Neupogen.  Two  groups  of animals were treated with 480 µg/0.5 ml filgrastim in two different formulations and with saline 0.9% as contralateral control and the third group was treated with 480 µg/0.5 ml Neupogen and saline 0.9% as control. The dose was administered as a single bolus injection by the i.v., paravenous (p.v.), s.c.,

astim and Neupogen Filgrastim and Neupogen showed comparable ability to interact with the G-CSF receptor in an in vitro NFS-60 cell assay. In normal and neutropenic rats, at all dose levels tested, filgr resulted  in  a  dose-dependent  increase  of  ANC.  Similar  pharmacodynamic  response  to  the  two compounds was noted in the comparative animal study across a wide dose range.

d  to  those  anticipated harmacological response. The toxicity of filgrastim was assessed in a 4-week repeated dose study conducted at doses of 20, 100 and 500 µg/kg. There were no deaths. There were overt signs of toxicity and body weight was reduced in  only  a  limited  number  of  animals.  These  effects  were  dose  dependent and gradually disappeared during the 6 weeks recovery period. The treatment related effects were limite after  G-CSF administration such as slight increase in spleen weight and myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow and probably represent an exaggerated p

The toxicokinetics confirmed that the test animals were systemically exposed to the test compounds, and there was dose-linearity in the case of filgrastim.

nce both formulations are Both filgrastim formulations showed identical local tolerance results and si composed of well known and well characterised excipients it can be expected that the tolerability of the glutamate formulation will be similar to that of the acetate formulation.

ssment,  it  is  worth  noting  that  no  difference  between  filgrastim  and  Neupogen  and The immunogenicity of filgrastim was assessed as part of the toxicity study. Increased signals in the anti-rhG-CSF antibody ELISA were detected both in filgrastim and Neupogen treated and control rats in  the  28-day  study.  Signal  intensities  were  found  to  increase  with  time  in  both  filgrastim  and Neupogen as well as in the control group and were comparable in all treatment groups including the control group. This effect was considered to be a combined phenomenon of unspecific binding and normal age-dependent increase of IgGs in rats and it may be concluded that the observed increase in ELISA reactivity was due to the assay design and no formation of anti-rhG-CSF antibodies occurred during  the  study  period.  Whilst  immunogenicity  results  in  the  rat  might  not  be  fully  predictive  for human risk asse control  animals  was  detected  in  this  study.  No  antibodies  against  filgrastim  were  reported  in  the clinical studies.

Other toxicity studies are not required for a biosimilar G-CSF development according to the respective EMEA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/31329/05).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The amino acid sequence of human filgrastim occurs naturally and is composed entirely of naturally occurring amino acids and would be expected to react like a naturally occurring protein both in vivo and  in  the  environment.  According  to  the  CHMP  guideline  on  'Environmental  risk  assessment  of medicinal products for human use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), an environmental risk assessment is not required in the cases of vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.'

## Pharmacodynamics

PD activity was based primarily on ANC peak response and ANC exposure, i.e. the whole AUC over 10 days. The results of these studies support the comparability of the test and reference products with respect to their pharmacodynamic  effect since absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  curves are superimposable whatever the route and the dose.

Based on the ELISA-dete standard acceptance inter ctable dose, the confidence intervals for all AUCs were contained within the val. As for C , it remained outside the standard acceptance interval of 80max 125% following a single s.c. dose of 2.5 μ g/kg (but not 1 μ g/kg) and a multiple dose of both 2.5 and 5 μ g/kg (shaded values).

## Elimination parameters

Equivalence of the elimination half-life was also studied. However, there is no true half-life for GCSF,  due  to  the  saturable  capture  of  the  drug  by  the  receptor  and  the  stimulation  of  the  G-CSF receptor by the drug, which is dose and time-dependent. Consequently, there is no log-linear phase over an entire concentration time profile.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At  10 μ g/kg  after  single  dose,  the  log-linear  phase  was  apparent  because  there  was  no  sampling beyond 24 hours and the receptor system was always saturated. After multiple dose administration, however, several subjects had only two points that could be used for the estimation of k el since  the concentration-time curve did not exhibit a log-linear decay for more than these timepoints. Therefore, the comparison between the two treatments was additionally carried out for the subgroup of subjects (14  out  of  32)  for  whom  the  estimates  of  k el and  t 1/2 were  based  on  at  least  three  points.  The  two treatments were compared with respect to k el and t 1/2 by means of 90% confidence intervals calculated om an ANOVA model identical to the one for the PK bioequivalence assessment. The ratios and ents in terms of the elimination 14. fr corresponding 90% CIs show the equivalence between the two treatm half-lives. The comparison of elimination parameters is shown in table

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

The primary pharmacodynamic endpoint met the predefined comparability criterion and, even if the comparability range calculated by the Applicant may be questioned, the actual results are very close. The  predefined  equivalence  boundaries  were  derived  by  the  Applicant  from  published  data  on  the effect  observed  for  Neupogen  compared  to  placebo.  It  was  assumed  that  the  smallest  clinically relevant  difference  in  PD  response  between  the  test  and  reference  product  was  15%  of  the  effect observed  for  Neupogen  compared  to  placebo  in  the  published  study.  Decreasing  this  margin  to 10%, which approximately corresponds to half the increase in AUEC between the 2.5 and 5

µg/kg doses, would result in more acceptable equivalence intervals; indeed, the 95% CI  for ANC AUEC and Emax in study EP06-103 would still fall within these tighter equivalence boundaries.

A statistically significant period effect was reported in all the cross-over studies, the ANC response in the second period being generally greater than in the first period. However, this effect was roughly the same whatever product was administered first. In addition, a post-hoc analysis restricted to the first period also supported the comparability of the ANC response.

However,  it  is  reassuring  that  the  results  after correction provide point estimates for the ratios of the intravenous infusion that are very close to 100% with CIs including 100%.

aturable pharmacokinetics of rhG-CSF, which is eliminated for a large part through binding to It is acknowledged that the apparent difference in bioavailability may be overestimated due to the non linear s its target cells, neutrophils and myeloid progenitors. Indeed, the difference in elimination characteristics at different doses may be related to the fact that receptor-mediated clearance (which is saturable)  is  predominant  at  lower  doses,  while  renal  clearance  becomes  more  important  at  higher doses.

ion.  From  these  population The Applicant also performed a modelling exercise to interpret serum concentration data in the context of the target-mediated nonlinear pharmacokinetics; this also allowed  comparing  relevant  PK parameters  which  cannot  be  estimated  through  non-compartmental  analysis,  such  as  clearances  and volumes of  distribution  (data  not  shown).  First,  an  individual  best  fit  model  was  developed  and  to further test its robustness under multiple dosing, two types of population models were developed: an empirical  population  model  directly  derived  from  the  individual  best  fit  model  and  a  mechanistic population  model  taking  into  account  the  target  mediated  drug  disposit model analyses, it  could  be  concluded  that  the  main  findings  of  the  individual  best  fit  model  were confirmed, even though these models are quite different and are built based on different assumptions and  different parameters. In either approach, all parameters  estimated satisfied  the  common bioequivalence criteria for all doses and for both routes of administration.

The  Applicant  also  pro inflation  of  the  difference  between  the  two  products  as  doses  are  decreased  or  repeated.  Since  the greatest inflation occurs when there are high levels of receptors relative to drug, the PK differences observed  in  healthy  volunteers  a neutropenic popula

In  conclusion,  the  small  differences  observed  in  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  filgrastim  are  not expected to translate into significant differences in the PD response, which is related to the amount of filgrastim bound to its target cells.

In addition, due to misunderstanding of the treatment protocol by some investigators, a small number of patients received unduly short treatment courses.

Immunogenicity data in healthy volunteers and in cancer patients showed no evidence of IgG antibody formation against rhG-CSF, a finding consistent with the known low immunogenicity of Neupogen.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  composition  of  filgrastim  and  Neupogen  is  quantitatively  similar  except  the  buffer  system  for filgrastim is glutamate and for Neupogen it is acetate. The data presented confirm that filgrastim and Neupogen  are  comparable  with  respect  to  primary  structure,  secondary  and  tertiary  structure, ize,  charge,  binding  and  ( in  vitro )  bioactivity.  Product ed. Aggregates and truncated  forms  showed  no lysis of filgrastim fully supports its biosimilarity to molecular  mass,  hydrophobicity,  molecular  s related impurities were thoroughly investigat significant  differences.  The  data  show  a  consistently  lower  level  of  deamidated  and  oxidised forms.These  differences  did  not  appear  to  impact  on  bioactivity  ( in  vitro bioassay)  or  stability.  In conclusion, the physicochemical and biological ana Neupogen.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

icity  studies  performed  by  the  Applicant  were  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  guidance  for biosimilar rhG-CSF development and CHMP scientific advice. No significant differences between the The  tox products filgrastim and Neupogen were observed.

## Safety

The  small  single-arm  trial  in  cancer  patients  submitted  allowed,  to  a any unexpected safety issue and suggests low immunogenicity of the test A direct  comparison  of  the  safety  profile  of  the  test  and  reference  products  was  possible  based  on studies in healthy volunteers. ADRs associated with filgrastim were consistent with those reported in normal donors as described  in  AMGEN  Neupogen  SPC.  Overall,  these  data  supp comparability of the prod certain extent, to rule out product.  Additional  long-term  safety  and  immunogenicity  data  will  be  collected  post-marketing  as described in the RMP.

##  User consultation

The Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) has been tested in English in accordance with Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. It was found to contain all the necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test. The CHMP considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing.

## Risk-benefit assessment

n approved . CHMP Guidance has been issued for biotechnology-derived proteins in general, -CSF in particular (non-clinical and clinical issues). The Applicant started their cterisation of This application for a recombinant human G-CSF is based on a claim of biosimilarity to a product (Neupogen) and recently for rhG development  before  the  specific  guideline  was  finalised  and  sought  for  CHMP  Scientific  Advice, which they generally followed. The primary purpose of this assessment is not the chara the  benefit/risk  profile  of  the  product  as  such  but  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  evaluation  of  the similarity  of  the  product  to  the  reference  chosen  by  the  Applicant.  The  quality,  non-clinical  and clinical data presented supported the comparability of the two products.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

## Recom mendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by ollowing indications: consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Filgrastim Hexal in the f
