## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Bipolar  disorders  are  severe  and  most  often  chronic  mental  illnesses.  They  are  associated  with considerable morbidity and mortality, and for many patients an initial episode of mania or depression evolves  into  a  life  long  illness  ( Bauer  and  Pfennig  2005 ).  Of  those  who  recover,  up  to  80%  will experience one or more syndromal recurrences over a period of 2 to 5 years ( Birmaher et al. 2009, Geller  et  al.  2008 ).  Factors  associated  with  worse  longitudinal  outcome  include  early  age  at  illness onset,  long  illness  duration,  mixed  episodes,  rapid  cycling,  psychosis,  subsyndromal  symptoms, comorbid disorders, low socioeconomic status, exposure to negative life events, lack of psychotherapy treatment, poor adherence to pharmacological treatment, and family psychopathology ( Birmaher et al. 2009 ).

Although there has been substantial research on the epidemiology of bipolar disorders in children and adolescents, there is still a striking lack of information on estimates of the prevalence and distribution of mental disorders generally in children. However, the lifetime prevalence rates for bipolar disorder estimated in a number of cross-sectional surveys have ranged from 0.4 to 1.9% for mania ( Merikangas et al. 2009 ).

The clinical differentiation of bipolar I disorder and in particular early-onset mania from other severe psychiatric conditions below age 10, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Conduct Disorder (CD), and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), can be complicated and unreliable. In children and  adolescents,  bipolar  disorder  is  characterized  by  elevated  mood  and  other  mood  disturbances, aggression, irritability, and  hyperactivity.  Additional  symptoms  can  include  extreme  emotional outbursts, depression, social withdrawal, and sleep disturbances. Bipolar disorder in both children and adolescents  is  cyclical  with  high  rates  of  rapid  cycling  and  patients  most  often  present  with  mixed episodes  (primarily  irritability  and  explosiveness).  Children  with  bipolar  disorders  can  often  have  a protracted, chronic course of illness that is difficult to treat. The degree of impairment and dysfunction often results in the loss of social and educational opportunities and thus has a lifelong impact for the patients ( AACAP 2007 ).

Current guidelines for the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder recommend firstline treatment  with atypical antipsychotics or mood  stabilizers ( AACAP  2007 ). By  2007,  the recommendation  was  based  on  data  available  for  those  agents  for  bipolar  disorder  in  adults,  as evidence  for  the  efficacy  for  these  agents  in  children  and  adolescents  was  sparse.  Despite  the significant  rise  in  the  recognition  of  paediatric  bipolar  disorder  and  the  use  of  antipsychotic  agents, there remained a lack of data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials to guide treatment decisions. The clinical  development program undertaken by the applicant was intended to address this lack of sounding evidence by investigating the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in this patient population.

In  this  type  II  variation,  the  MAH  initially  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  of  Abilify  (new indication is underlined) as follows:

'ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adults and in children and adolescents aged 10 years and older. '

During the evaluation, the MAH proposed to restrict the proposed indication to Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents aged 13 years and older.

## Discussion on non clinical aspects

No new non clinical data were submitted and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP as relevant information  related  to  juvenile  animal  studies  had  already  been  submitted  in  the  context  of  the approved variation extending the indication to the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years and older (EMA/H/C/471/II/48) and reflected in the latest approved SmPC for Abilify.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding the ERA, the CHMP agreed that no screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity is required  since  the  Log  KOW  is  &lt;4.5.  In  addition  based  on  the  lower  Kow  value  (&lt;1000)  a bioconcentration study in fish is not considered necessary.

The data submitted regarding the water sediment study (OECD 308) suggested significant shifting of the drug substance to the sediment (from day 14 on more than 10% of aripiprazole was present in sediment extracts), and because aripiprazole does not seems to be ready biodegradable (OECD 308 and  FDA  3.11  studies),  the  study  of  the  effects  on  sediment  organisms,  namely  Chironomids,  was conducted in tier B analysis. This study (OECD 308) also suggested that aripiprazole does not have adverse effects on microbial activity, but a dose response relationship cannot be established.

From the data submitted regarding screening sorption/desorption studies on aripiprazole partition to sludge, the CHMP agreed that the data indicates significant sorption to organic carbon in sludge with a Koc&gt;10 000 L/kg which implies that an environment assessment of the drug substance in terrestrial compartment should be conduct unless readily biodegradable, which does not seems to be the case. A tier  B  terrestrial  analysis  was  conducted.  By  comparing  the  PECsoil  (0.000974  mg/kg)  with  the Predicted  No  Effect  Concentrations  in  soil  (PNECsoil)  obtained  with  the  lowest  NOEC  (Collembolan reproduction) from the full battery of terrestrial studies the applicant concluded that the soil (terrestrial) is not impacted by aripiprazole entering the environment.

In  addition  the  aquatic  and  sediment  compartments  did  not  show  any  impact  from  patient  use  of aripiprazole considering the following indications: schizophrenia (authorised in the EU), bipolar disorder including paediatric population (only authorised in adults in the EU), and Major Depressive Disorders (not  authorised  in  the  EU)  as  the  corresponding  PEC/PNEC  ratios  are  below  the  threshold  value. However the surface water compartment PEC/PNEC ratio below one was only achieved when further PECsw  refinement  was  applied  in  tier  B  to  account  for  sewage  treatment  plant  removal  using  the adsorption data and the output from simple treat model, giving a PECsw.refined value of 5.524 x 10-8 mg/L instead of 2.668 x 10-4 mg/L.

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  revised  PEC  value  of  0.2668  µg/L  corresponds  to  76%  (because  of  the human  metabolism)  of  the  PEC  value  obtained  using  a  refined  Fpen  value  of  0.0234.  This higher refined Fpen than the default one, was calculated using annual prevalence of bipolar disorders (1% includes the target pediatric population of this application), of schizophrenia (0.35%) and of MDD (1%)). In addition there is no requirement to refine the default Fpen, and there is no requirement to use a refined Fpen when it is above the default value, as in this case. If the PECsw value (0.15 µg/L) obtained with default Fpen (1%) value is used the PEC/PNECsw ratio obtained is below 1 (0.58). So it is likely that the margin between PEC and PNEC to be considerable higher as the PECsw was estimated very  conservatively,  using  a  Fpen  higher  than  the  default  one  and  not  accounting  for  depletion  via sorption to sludge in a sewage treatment plant, it is therefore not expected that aripiprazole should pose a risk to the surface water compartment.

Finally, the precautionary and safety measures taken in order to reduce any risk to the environment by including the general statement on the SmPC and PL have been applied which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

The development program completed to support the proposed extension of indication consisted of:

- -two Phase I studies to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of aripiprazole in children and adolescent patients  with  a  primary  schizophrenia  spectrum  diagnosis,  bipolar  spectrum  diagnosis,  or  other

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

paediatric psychiatric disorders between the age of 10 - 17 years (Study 31-03-238 ) and in children and adolescents with conduct disorders between the age of 6 - 17 years (Study CN138014 );

- -a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4 week study ( 31-03-240 ) of two fixed oral doses of aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg in the treatment of child and adolescent patients, aged 10-17 years, with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features with a 6 month extension period;
- -a  phase  III,  multi-center,  open-label  ( study  31-03-241 )  designed  to  provide  additional  long  term safety data of aripiprazole in the paediatric population. Patients who had completed study 31-03-239 (adolescents  with  schizophrenia)  or  had  withdrawn  from  the  double  blind  study  31-03-240  were offered to continue in the open-label, flexible-dose study 31-03-241 for an additional 26 weeks.

Additional  pharmacokinetic  analysis (study  31-05-242) was  performed  and  included  a  comparison with historical data from adults.

All of the above studies were previously submitted to the CHMP. Studies 31-03-238, CN138014, 3103-240  and  31-03-241  were  submitted  in  the  context  of  the  approved  variation  extending  the indication to the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 15 years and older (EMA/H/C/471/II/48) and  study  31-03-240  was  submitted  in  accordance  with  the  article  46  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation 1901/2006.

The applicant claimed that the above clinical development program has been designed in accordance with  the  'Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  in  the  Treatment  of Bipolar Disorder', (CPMP/EWP/567/98).

## 1.3.1. Pharmacokinetics

Based  on  studies  31-03-238  and  CN138014,  the  linearity  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of aripiprazole in children and adolescents was considered as established. In the paediatric population, Cmax levels were generally higher compared to those reported from studies with adults. However, when values were normalized for body weight, apparent oral clearance was similar in children, adolescents, and adults. The CHMP noted that steady-state was attained after 14 days of oral daily (QD) dosing of aripiprazole;  similarily  to  the  time  to  steady-state  observed  in  studies  with  adults.    Aripiprazole accumulation after 14 days of dosing was similar between children and adolescents i.e 2.4- to 6.4-fold and adults i.e 3 to 5 fold. The overall metabolic profile following oral dosing of aripiprazole was similar in children and adolescents, with dehydro-aripiprazole as the predominant circulating metabolite.

Given  the  similar  pharmacokinetic  profile,  the  main  efficacy  study  31-03-240  investigated  the  full range of available doses by testing the 10 mg and 30 mg doses (see further discussion on 2.3.2.4).

## 1.3.2. Clinical efficacy

## 1.3.2.1. Main efficacy study

Study 31-03-240 is the main efficacy study to support the indication applied for and was submitted in accordance with the article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006.

## METHODS

## Study design

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This was a multicenter, randomized, 30 week double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial conducted in 59 centres in the United States (US).

## Objective

The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of two fixed doses of aripiprazole (10 mg and 30 mg) compared to placebo in children  and  adolescents,  aged  10  to  17  years,  with  a  Diagnostic  and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features.

## Main inclusion criteria

Male and female subjects, 10 to 17 years of age, with a manic or mixed episode associated with bipolar I disorder were eligible to participate in this study.

The main inclusion criterion was a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episode, with or without psychotic features (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The DSM-IV diagnosis was also independently confirmed by a separate, trained clinician administering the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders  and  Schizophrenia  for  School  Aged  Children:  Present  and  Lifetime  Version  (K-SADS-PL) (Kaufman et al. 1996), which is a semi-structured interview of patients and parents/caregivers by an adequately trained clinician. Co-morbid diagnoses were permitted including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  Conduct  Disorder  (CD),  Oppositional  Defiant  Disorder  (ODD),  and anxiety disorders (except Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD] and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder [OCD]).

The  initial  diagnosis  was  made  by  an  adequately  trained  clinician  (ie,  board  certified  child  and adolescent  psychiatrist  [CAP]  or  board  eligible  CAP),  and  then  confirmed  by  an  adequately  trained utilizing the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children: Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) at screening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment period

There were two phases in this study, a 4-week acute phase and a 26-week extension period. Each subject  had  the  potential  to  participate  in  this  study  for  a  total  of  up  to  30  weeks  of  double-blind treatment, including a 4-week acute phase with a 6-month extension period, preceded by a screening phase of up to 28 days.

Both  phases  of  the  study  could  be  conducted  either  on  an  outpatient  basis  (with  the  option  for inpatient hospitalization, if needed), or in a partial or full inpatient basis at any given time of the study.

On Day 1 of the acute Phase, subjects were randomized to either 10 mg or 30 mg of oral aripiprazole or placebo treatment. Subjects reached their target dose through a forced titration schedule of up to 13 days and proceeded with treatment at their target dose.

If the subject reached week 4 of the acute Phase, they continued into the extension phase, a 26-week double-blind treatment period, beginning at the same dose as taken at the end of the acute phase. The investigator had the option to down-titrate a subject's dose only one time during the extension phase to half the target dose for tolerability reasons. Following a dose reduction, investigators could also uptitrate one time as needed to enhance efficacy to 20 mg from 15 mg in the 30 mg arm, and to 10 mg from 5 mg in the 10 mg arm. Subjects who discontinued during the acute phase for lack of efficacy, or for any reason, were offered an alternative rescue medication for 4 to 8 weeks.

Subjects who received at least one dose of study medication in the extension Phase of the study were eligible to roll-over to an open-label study (Study No. 31-03-241) if they dropped out of this phase due to tolerability reasons.

## Primary efficacy endpoint

The primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline to week 4 in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Total Score. Subjects who completed the week 4 visit were defined as completers of the acute phase.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

Secondary  efficacy  variables  included  the  change  from  baseline  (evaluated  at  each  visit  up  to  30 weeks)  in  the  YMRS  total  score;  the  Children's  Global  Assessment  Scale  (CGAS)  score,  the  clinical Global  Impressions  Scale-Bipolar  Version  (CGI-BP)  severity  score;  the  Children's  Depression  Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) score, the General Behavior Inventory Scale (GBI) score; the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) score and Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (P-Q-LES-Q translated into different languages when applicable).

In addition, subject response to treatment (defined as a 50% or higher reduction from baseline in YMRS  total  score);  change  from  preceding  phase  score  on  the  CGI-BP  and  P-Q-LES-Q;  time  to discontinuation due to all reasons were also measured as secondary efficacy variables.

Subjects who completed the week 30 visit were defined as completers for the entire study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical method

The core data set for all efficacy analyses was the intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset, which contains data from all  randomized subjects. In order to handle missing data and restrictions imposed by different types of analyses (e.g., change from baseline analysis), other data sets derived from the ITT data set were used for the efficacy analyses, such as the observed cases (OC) data set and the last observation carried forward (LOCF) datasets as described below.

For change from baseline analysis, only subjects who had both baseline and post-baseline values were included in the OC and LOCF data sets. LOCF data sets were the primary analysis data sets. The OC data set corresponding to a visit consists of data from all subjects who were evaluated at that visit on the efficacy variable under analysis, i.e., subjects with missing data due to dropout or other reasons were not included in the OC data set. In the LOCF data set, missing data at a post-baseline visit were imputed with the value obtained at the nearest preceding visit, except that baseline values were not carried forward to impute missing values at a post-baseline visit.

Nominal overall significance level of 0.05 (two-tailed) was used in testing the statistical significance of the comparisons between aripiprazole 10 mg target dose versus placebo and aripiprazole 30 mg target dose  versus  placebo.  For  the  primary  treatment  comparisons  of  a  dose  group  versus  placebo, adjustment  in  testing  due  to  multiple  comparisons  was  handled  by  an  overall  F-test.  Descriptive statistics  for  the  YMRS  Total  Scores  and  change  from  baseline  scores  were  presented  by  treatment group for week 1 through week 4 for both OC and LOCF datasets. The change scores were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a factor, and baseline YMRS Total Score as a covariate. For comparing YMRS Total Scores between treatment groups at Baseline, only treatment  was  included  in  the  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  model  with  baseline  value  as  the dependent variable. The least squares (LS) means obtained from a type III analysis using SAS were used for the treatment comparisons. Two-tailed student's t-tests were used to test differences between the LS means within the ANCOVA or ANOVA model.

The  CGAS,  CGI-BP  severity,  CDRS-R,  GBI,  ADHD-RS-IV,  and  P-QLES-Q  Total  Score  were  analyzed similarly to the YMRS. The proportion of subjects responding to treatment was analyzed using a chisquare  test,  with  95%  confidence  intervals  for  differences  in  response  rates.  Changes  from  the preceding phase score in the CGI-BP and P-QLES-Q overall score were analyzed using the CochranMantel-Haenszel row mean score statistic by week. Time to discontinuation was analyzed by plotting the Kaplan-Meier curves and testing for significance of the differences in survival curves using the logrank test for each active group versus the placebo group.

## Sample size

The study is designed to have 85% power given a difference between aripiprazole and placebo of -5.1 for  the  change  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS  total  Score  at  week  4  (LOCF).  The  difference  of  -5.1  was estimated from two bipolar mania trials in adult populations. A pooled standard deviation of 11.1 was used  in  these  computations.  Based  on  these  estimates  and  using  a  two-sided  alpha  of  0.025,  87 patients per treatment arm with a total 261 patients are required for 85% power. An evaluable patient is  defined as one having a baseline and a post-baseline value of Y-MRS total assessment. Maximum 300 patients were to be enrolled for screening to maintain the power of the study.

All randomized subjects were included in the efficacy analyses (randomized subjects evaluated for at least one primary or secondary efficacy parameter).

A high rate of retention (237/296 [80.1%] subjects overall) was observed for the acute phase of the study: 84/98 (85.7%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 77/99 (77.8%) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 76/99 (76.8%) in the placebo arm.

A total of 68/296 (23.0%) subjects completed the entire study: 34/98 (34.7%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 22/99 (22.2%) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 12/99 (12.1%) in the placebo arm.

Study 31-03-241 was submitted in the context of the approved variation extending the indication to the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adolescents  15  years  and  older  (EMA/H/C/471/II/48).  It  was designed  to  provide  additional  long  term  safety  data  of  aripiprazole  in  the  paediatric  population. Patients who had completed study 31-03-239 (adolescents with schizophrenia) or had withdrawn from the double blind study 31-03-240 were offered to continue in the open-label, flexible-dose study 3103-241 for an additional 26 weeks.

The  results  obtained  in  these  two  different  patient  populations  were  evaluated  separately.  For  the purpose of the present application, only relevant methodological aspects and efficacy results obtained in the population of adolescents and children with bipolar I disorder who had withdrawn from study 3103-240 are presented.

## METHODS

## Treatment period

Subjects  enrolled  in  the  study  were  eligible  to  receive  up  to  a  total  of  6  months  (cumulative  with exposure in the parent study) of open-label aripiprazole treatment at daily doses of 2 mg to 30 mg. The  open-label  trial  overlapped  with  the  parent  study  31-03-240  for  1  day.  The  End  of  Treatment evaluations conducted at the last office visit of the parent study served as Baseline (Day 0) evaluation for this open-label trial.

On Day 0 of open-label treatment in Study 31-03-241, patients from all treatment groups of the parent study 31-03-240 received an up-titration blister card for treatment Days 1 through 6. Up-titration to the target dose of 10 mg was done in the following manner for all patients: Days 1 and 2: 2 mg/day; Days 3 and 4: 5 mg/day; Days 5 and 6: 10 mg/day. If the subject was unable to tolerate the titration during  this  fixed  up-titration  phase,  the  subject  was  withdrawn  from  the  study.  On  Day  7,  the investigator had the option to continue the dose escalation up to a maximum of 30 mg/day, or, for tolerability issues, to reduce the dose of aripiprazole to no less than 2 mg/day for subjects with bipolar I  disorder.  To  escalate  the  dose,  subjects  received  15  mg  for  a  minimum  of  2  days,  20  mg  for  a minimum of 2 days, 25 mg for a minimum of 2 days, and then 30 mg for 2 days as the highest dose. Dose escalation could stop at any dose level that the investigator felt was tolerable for the subject. Dose reduction, if necessary based on clinical judgment in regard to tolerability, occurred at a rate that was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  appropriate  for  the  subject.  Following  the  initial  dose reduction, the investigator could escalate the subject's dose again based on clinical judgment at a rate that was considered by the investigator to be appropriate for the subject. Once a subject's dose had been escalated following the initial dose reduction, no further dose reductions were permitted. Failure to tolerate the medication after dose reduction to the minimal allowable dose level, or to the escalated dose level afterwards, resulted in removal of the subject from the study.

The open-label safety study was conducted on an outpatient basis with clinic visits at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 26.

## Efficacy endpoints

The  efficacy  variables  for  subjects  with  bipolar  I  disorder  (manic  or  mixed  episode  with  or  without psychotic features) were: mean change from Baseline on the YMRS score; the CGI-BP severity score; the GBI score and the ADHD-RS-IV score.

Other outcome variable included the P-QLES-Q Total score (translated into different languages when applicable). PL-QLES-Q was completed by each subject at Baseline (Day 0) and End of Treatment/Early Termination (week 26).

## RESULTS

A total of 86 child and adolescent subjects with bipolar I disorder from the parent study 31 03 240 were enrolled receiving an average daily dose of aripiprazole of 15.1 mg (range 4.9 - 17.7 mg).

All 86 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A total of 57 patients completed the study (see Table 8).

## 1.3.2.3. Ancillary analyses

At the CHMP request, comparative data up to 12 weeks were provided by the MAH to further support the maintenance of the effect. The MAH presented these data for lower and higher age groups (10-12 and 13-17 years old) since the MAH proposed to revise the indication applied for from 10-17 years old to 13-17 years old due to the CHMP concerns over the safety profile in the younger population (see 2.3.3).

In addition, subgroup analyses were also provided to evaluate the efficacy in patients with or without comorbidities  including  the  effect  on  symptoms  specific  to  mania  in  these  population  subgroups. Patients  characteristics  from  2  publications  were  presented  to  address  the  CHMP  concern  over  the generalisibility of the pivotal study results (31-03-240) to the EU population since it included only US patients.

## Maintenance of the effect

At  week  12,  approximately  half  of  the  subjects  receiving  aripiprazole  remained  in  the  double-blind study, compared with about one quarter of subjects receiving placebo. Of the 77 subjects on placebo who left the double-blind study by week 12, over half of them (n = 42, 54.5%) left because of lack of efficacy. In contrast, of the 103 subjects receiving aripiprazole who discontinued by week 12, only 23 (22.3%) left because of lack of efficacy.

## Efficacy in patients with or without comorbidities

The analysed subgroups (patients with or without any psychiatric comorbidity, with or without ODD, with or without ADHD) were of small sizes to provide a robust statistical analysis. Results indicated that the presence of any psychiatric comorbidity did not seem to influence the YMRS changes at weeks 4 and 12 (see Figure 3), this being less evident with patients with or without ADHD at both week 4 and 12 for the 30 mg dose. According to the MAH, the smaller effect observed in patients without ADHD versus patients with ADHD could be explained by a stronger placebo response obtained in the patients without  ADHD  as  compared  to  patients  with  ADHD.  To  further  address  this  point,  a  new  subgroup analysis  was  performed  by  the  MAH  including  'ongoing  ADHD'  instead  of  'ADHD'  with  the  aim  of evaluating whether this would lead to an effect on the total YMRS (see Tables 14-17, Figure 4).

## 1.3.2.4. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The pivotal 31-03-240 study had a single primary efficacy endpoint in acute phase: the mean change from  baseline  to  week  4  in  the  YMRS  total  score.  Bipolar  disorders  in  children  and  adolescents  are being  increasingly  reported  and  the  need  for  adequate  diagnosis  and  treatment  is  important, particularly  since  most  prescribed  treatments  are  based  in  small  studies  and  there  is  a  lack  of authorised  treatment  for  this  disorder.  The  MAH  developed  a  training  and  certification  program ensuring that it would be rigorously applied. For a rater to be considered certified on the YMRS, they were first prequalified using a rater experience survey and then were required to successfully complete the  didactic  training  and  certification  process.  All  raters  were  required  to  demonstrate  inter-rater reliability  before  rating  subjects  in  this  trial.  Furthermore,  two  'recalibration'  ratings  had  to  be performed at 6- and 12- month intervals after initial rater certification.

YMRS total score has been considered as a valid instrument to assess bipolar disorders and has been used in clinical practice since its development in 1978, including paediatric population ( J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2002 Nov;41(11):1350-9. Discriminative validity of a parent version of the Young

Mania Rating Scale. Gracious BL, Youngstrom EA, Findling RL, Calabrese JR. ). A definition of clinically significant mean value difference of YMRS total score has not been pre-specified in the study design. Only responder definition was settled a priori and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The study was conducted in 59 centres in the US. Demographic characteristics of the population may be significantly different from European population, both physical, psychological and cultural. Given the difference of opinion between the US and the EU about the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, and the discrepancies reported in the literature in terms of disease on-set between US and EU bipolar I patient populations, the validity of extrapolating the results of the USbased studies to the EU population was questioned by the CHMP. Data on 2 EU studies conducted in Spain  and  Italy  in  patients  with  Bipolar  I  disorder  however  showed  similar  patients  characteristics regarding severity of illness and age of onset (see Table 18). Differences were noted on the presence of any psychiatric comorbidity with even lower rates of comorbidities in the US patients, although the ADHD  diagnosis  was  more  frequently  observed  in  study  31-03-240  with  51.7%  versus  21.1%  and 37.8%, respectively, in Spain and Italy. Bipolar I disorder population is more prone to co-morbidities than  schizophrenic  population,  and  overall  the  CHMP  considered  that  these  data  were  sufficiently supporting the extrapolation of study 31-03-240 to the intended European population.

The study was a double blind placebo controlled consisting of an acute 4 week phase and a 26 week maintenance phase. The duration of the study was therefore longer than the recommended 12 week maintenance  trial  as  referred  in  the  'Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Bipolar Disorder', (CPMP/EWP/567/98).

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the acute phase, treatment with aripiprazole resulted in statistically significant improvements (LOCF) compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint YMRS Total Score at week 4  in both 10 mg (  5.99, CI:-8.49;-3.50, p&lt;0.0001) and 30 mg (-8.26, CI:-10.7;-5.77, p&lt;0.0001).

This efficacy was maintained through week 30 showing a statistically significant sustained improvement over placebo in both 10 mg (-5.89, CI:-8.70;-3.08, p&lt;0.0001) and 30 mg (-6.73, CI:9.53;-3.94, p&lt;0.0001). Mean changes in YMRS Total Scores at week 30 using LOCF data were -14.1 in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, -14.9 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and -8.2 in the placebo arm.

Significant improvements were also documented for the secondary efficacy endpoints: CGAS, CGI-BP Severity Score for mania and for overall bipolar illness, GBI Total Score for mania and for the ADHD rating scale. For efficacy endpoints evaluating the effect of treatment on depressive symptoms (CGI-BP Severity  Score  for  depression,  GBI  Total  Score  for  depression  and  CDRS)  no  statistically  significant superiority of aripiprazole over placebo treatment was observed.

Both  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  and  30  mg  arms  had  significantly  higher  percentages  of  responders compared to the placebo arm at every treatment week during both at week 4 and and at week 30 using the LOCF data set, thus showing maintenance of the effect of treatment. At week 4, percentages of  responders were 44.79 % and 63.64% for 10 and 30 mg group as compared to 26.09% for the placebo group. At week 30, percentages of responders were around 50% and 55.56% for 10 and 30 mg group as compared to 26.6% for the placebo group

In study 31-03-240, the placebo effect was always high and particularly significant in the acute phase, but it did not reduce with time in the double blind extension phase. In addition, the number of patients who  completed  the  26  week  extension  phase  was  low:  34,  22  and  12  patients  respectively  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

10 mg  ,  30  mg  doses  of  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups.  During  the  oral  explanation,  the  MAH presented further analysis of the drop out rates showing that  discontinuation with aripiprazole 10 mg due to lack of efficacy or lack of tolerability was low [at week 4: 2 (3%); at week 12: 11 (16.7%)] and more  frequent  with  placebo  [at  week  4:  4  (6.7%);  at  week  12:  26  (43%)].  Among  the  drop  outs occurring between week 4 and week 12, half of the patients treated with aripiprazole 10 mg went into the open label study and all of them were completers at week 12 as compared to 70% of patients treated  with  placebo  and  85.7%  of  them  were  completers  at  week  12.  It  was  also  noted  that discontinuation rates were of similar magnitude of studies conducted in adults with Bipolar I disorder.

An  analysis  of  the  time  to  discontinuation  due  to  all  reasons  revealed  that  statistically  significant differences  were  noted  between  both  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm  versus  placebo  (p  &lt;  0.0001)  and 30 mg  arm  versus  placebo  (p  =  0.0124).  For  both  aripiprazole  doses,  the  proportions  of  subjects remaining in the study (as measured by the Kaplan-Meier curve) were superior to that of placebo. The median times that subjects remained in the study were 109 days for the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 66 days  for  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  and  37  days  for  the  placebo  arm.  With  regard  to  time  to discontinuation  for  all  reasons,  both  aripiprazole  doses  showed  statistically  significantly  superior retention  profiles  over  the  30-week  study  (in  Kaplan-Meier  curves),  i.e.,  proportions  of  subjects remaining in the study at different time points, compared to placebo.

At the CHMP request, subgroup analyses on efficacy for patients aged 13-14 years versus 15-17 years were performed as the proposed choice to restrict the age to 13-17 years due to safety concerns (see 2.3.3) was not based on clinical milestones. However, these data did not show any differences on the positive trends of improvement on YRMS and CGI-BP scores. The CHMP also acknowledged that further interpretation of such analysis is limited in the absence of statistical power.

## Efficacy in patients with and without comorbidities

Following  the  CHMP  concern  over  the  patient  population  included  in  the  study  31-03-240  (mixing Bipolar I disorder with other comorbidity conditions), a number of post-hoc analyses were performed by the MAH. Results showed that the population without comorbid disorders did not differ significantly in  mean change of YMRS in both 10 mg aripiprazole and placebo by week 4 thus questioning as to whether aripiprazole  may  act  mainly  in  symptoms  common  to  ADHD  /  ODD  and  not  specifically  on Bipolar  Disorder  type  I.  Additional  subgroup  analyses  however  indicated  that  the  presence  of  any comorbidity  did  not  seem  to  influence  the  YMRS  changes  at  weeks  4  and  12,  this  was  being  less evident with patients with or without ADHD at both weeks 4 and 12 for the 30 mg dose.

In  a  further  subgroup  analysis  of  patients  with  or  without ADHD,  the  CHMP noted that the selected patients included 'ongoing ADHD' instead of 'ADHD' with the aim of evaluating whether this would lead to an effect on the total YMRS. Only 'current comorbid ADHD' were selected: subjects with either a  current  diagnosis  of  ADHD  or  who  discontinued  medication  for  ADHD  in  the  run-in  phase  were included in this definition. Previous ADHD comorbidity definition relied on the post hoc analysis of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective disorders, and had 'unknown' values for 59 subjects. This new 'current ADHD' definition  was  considered  more  inclusive  by  the  CHMP  and  may  therefore  better  reflect  real ADHD comorbidity in this population. Almost half of patients with ADHD were included in the 10-12 years old group. Nevertheless, the effect of ADHD in the 13-17 years old group was still significant, with  a  difference  of  &gt;2  points  improvement  (as  compared  to  baseline)  in  the  YMRS  total  score  in patients with ADHD versus no ADHD, but placebo had also more pronounced improvement in the older patients  (see  Table  15).  The  trend  towards  better  reduction  of  YMRS  total  score  was  present  in  all treatment groups and age ranges, despite the small sample in the subgroup analysis, both at 4 and 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weeks. The CHMP further noted a very clear placebo effect increasing with age, both at weeks 4 and week 12, and the difference in response to placebo between ADHD and no ADHD patients was kept constant  in  the  3  different  age  groups  (10-12,  13-14  and  15-17,  Table  16).  Therefore,  the  CHMP concluded that 15-17 age group had clearly a more pronounced placebo effect, rendering aripiprazole treatment effect less evident.

During the oral explanation, the MAH presented the data for the 10 mg dose showing same directional improvements  on  the  YRMS  score  at  weeks  4  and  12  (Figure  3)  in  patients  with  or  without  any comorbidities  and  the  subgroup  analysis  showing  that  ADHD  status  did  not  change  the  10  mg treatment effect significantly, particularly at week 12, where the use of ADHD medication was already permitted and favoured aripiprazole effect independently the presence of ADHD or ADHD medication (Figure 4).

## Maintenance of the effect

At week 12, 53% and 42% of patients treated respectively with aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg were still receiving treatment. Mean changes in YMRS score in placebo, 10 mg and 30 mg were respectively -8.2, -15.7 and -16.5.

When compared to the placebo at week 12, the efficacy was maintained with a statistically significant differences over the placebo for both 10 mg and 30 mg  on the YRMS score total score and in both analysed age groups. In the 10-12 years old group, mean changes in YMRS Total Scores at week 12 using LOCF data were: -16.2 in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, -15.9 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, an d -6.9 in  the  placebo  arm  using  LOCF  data  (for  both  doses,  p&lt;0.05).  In  the  13-17  years  old  group, mean changes in YMRS Total Scores at week 12 using LOCF data were: -15.6 in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, -16.8 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and -9.7 in the p lacebo arm using LOCF data (for 10 mg: p&lt;0.05, for 30 mg: p&lt;0.001). Similar findings were obtained for the secondary endpoints using LOCF data. However, the OC analysis failed to show statistical significant over the placebo for both doses on all analysed efficacy endpoints for both age groups. Considering the number  of discontinuation  (77/99  patients),  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  OC  analysis  did  not  provide  any relevant findings apart that a significant percentage of patients did improve spontaneously by week 12, suggesting that the treatment should not be prolong longer than 12 weeks. The CHMP was therefore of the  opinion  that  the  efficacy  was  demonstrated  up  to  12  weeks  only  and  the  treatment  should  be therefore limited to this duration.

Having considered the written responses and oral explanation given by the MAH, the CHMP considered that  the  presented  efficacy  data  were  sufficiently  supportive  of  an  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  on  manic episodes in the paediatric Bipolar I disorder population.

## Dosing recommendation

The  MAH  initially  proposed  to  recommend  10  mg  /day  as  aripiprazole  dose  for  the  treatment  of paediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with bipolar I disorder. Treatment initiation was proposed to start at 2 mg titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after two additional days. When  appropriate,  subsequent  dose  increases  should  be  administered  in  5  mg  increments.  The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. Since 5 mg had been tested in schizophrenia and 10 mg were the lowest efficacious dose in adults, this was the lowest dose chosen. For the highest range the MAH choose the highest tolerated dose in trials CN138-014 and 31-03-238.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, the CHMP considered that enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated when comparing results from the 10 mg and 30 mg groups (See Tables 5 and 6). In addition, taking into consideration the safety profile in this paediatric population, (see section 2.3.3), the use of the 30 mg dose was not recommended by the CHMP, and an increase over 10 mg should  only  be  performed  under  strict  surveillance.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  following  SmPC information regarding the posology in the paediatric Bipolar I disorder population:

'Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg.

The treatment duration should be the minimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated with a substantially higher incidence of significant undesirable effects including EPS related events, somnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore only be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).

Younger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. Therefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).'

## 1.3.3. Clinical safety

The  safety  of  aripiprazole  in  the  treatment  of  bipolar  I  disorder  in  children  and  adolescents  was evaluated in the two clinical studies that were already discussed in clinical efficacy: Study 31-03-240 and  Study  31-03-241.  No  pooling  with  other  clinical  trials  regarding  children  and  adolescents  with bipolar disorder was performed and the safety data presented below relates to both study 31-03-240 and 31-03-241.

## 1.3.3.1. Patient exposure

A total of 296 subjects with bipolar I disorder were enrolled in Study 31-03-240. Thereof, 86 subjects rolled  over  to  the  open-label  Study  31-03-241.  The  total  number  of  children  and  adolescents  with bipolar I disorder exposed to aripiprazole in Study 31-03-240 and 31-03-241 was 233.

Of the 296 subjects randomized, a total of 197 subjects were exposed to aripiprazole: 98 in the 10 mg arm, with an average dose of 8.6 mg overall (8.3 mg in the acute Phase and 9.3 mg in the extension phase), and 99 in the 30 mg arm, with an average dose of 22.1 mg (19.5 in the acute phase and 27.5 in  the  extension  phase).  A  total  of  99  subjects  were  randomized  to  placebo  (2  subjects  from  the placebo  arm  did  not  receive  study  drug).  The  percentages  of  subjects  exposed  to  study  medication beyond the planned 26-week double blind extension phase treatment period were 14.3%, 10.2%, and 5.1% in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg and the placebo arm, respectively.

## 1.3.3.2. Adverse events

## Study 31-03-240

During the entire study period, a total of 376 TEAEs were experienced by 78/98 (79.6%) subjects in the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm;  366  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  84/99  (84.8%)  subjects  in  the aripiprazole 30 mg arm; and 164 TEAEs were experienced by 64/97 (66.0%) subjects in the placebo arm.

The most common TEAEs reported at an incidence rate of ≥ 5% in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm were somnolence  (24.5%),  headache  (20.4%),  fatigue  (18.4%),  nausea  (13.3%),  vomiting  (13.3%), extrapyramidal disorder (12.2%), vision blurred (10.2%), nasal congestion (10.2%), upper abdominal pain (9.2%), akathisia (9.2%), increased weight (8.2%), increased appetite (8.2%), upper respiratory tract  infection  (8.2%),  decreased appetite (7.1%), nasopharyngitis (7.1%), cough (7.1%), dizziness (7.1%), insomnia (6.1%), back pain (5.1%), anxiety (5.1%), dysmenorrhea (5.1%), and pharyngolaryngeal pain (5.1%).

The most common TEAEs reported at an incidence rate of ≥ 5% in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm were extrapyramidal disorder (28.3%), somnolence (27.3%), headache (23.2%), nausea (14.1%), akathisia (13.1%), fatigue (12.1%), vomiting (8.1%), vision blurred (8.1%), increased appetite (8.1%), salivary hypersecretion (8.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (6.1%), stomach discomfort (6.1%), bipolar disorder (6.1%), upper abdominal pain (5.1%), increased weight (5.1%), dizziness (5.1%), diarrhoea (5.1%), and dystonia (5.1%). In the placebo arm during the entire study, the most common TEAEs were headache (18.6%), vomiting (9.3%), bipolar disorder (5.2%), and nausea (5.2%).

From the acute phase to the extension phase there did not appear to be any unexpected increases in the incidence of the most common TEAEs associated with aripiprazole.

Following CHMP concerns over the safety profile in Bipolar I disorder paediatric patients (younger than the authorised paediatric indication for schizophrenia), the MAH presented a comparison of the safety profile for 10-12 years and 13-17 years to support their proposal to revise the indication applied for from 10-17 years to 13-17 years.  Overall AE profile is presented in Table 17. Other safety subgroup analyses (10-12 years versus 13-17 years) are presented under the relevant sections together with the other additional safety data requested by the CHMP comparing 13-14 years to 15-17 years (see EPS related symptoms, weight gain related events).

## Extrapyramidal Syndrome (EPS) related symptoms

The  overall  incidence  of  any  extrapyramidal  event  was  25.8%  (51/197  subjects)  in  the  combined aripiprazole group (10 mg and 30 mg) and 5.1% (5/97 subjects) in the placebo group during the acute phase.  The  most  commonly  reported  EPS-related  symptoms  were  Parkinsonism  events  (21.8%  and 4.1% in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, respectively, during the acute phase). Akathisia events occurred in 10.1% (20/197 subjects) of the combined aripiprazole group and 2.0% (2/97 subjects) of the placebo group during the acute phase. There was no notable increase in akathisia events following the acute phase (up to week 30). Over the entire study period, the incidence of any extrapyramidal events (excluding akathisia) was 36.3% (36/99 subjects) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, 20.4% (20/98 subjects) in the 10 mg arm, and 5.1% (3/97 subjects) in the placebo arm.

In  study  31-03-240,  the  overall  rate  of  EPS  symptoms  (including  akathisia)  was  34.5  %,  salivary hypersecretion and drooling were observed in 6% of the subjects.

EPS-SAS  (SAS:  Simpson  Angus  Scale)  and  EPS-AIMS  (AIM:Abnormal  Involuntary  Movement  Scale Scale) mean changes are presented for 10-12 years and 13-17 years groups in Tables 22 and 23.

When comparing 13-14 and 15-17 age groups, akathisia was the most significant AE:  4 patients in the 13-14 years old group (but all resolved by week 12) and 4 patients in the 15-17 years old group (one led to discontinuation).  Dystonia was not reported in the 13-14 years old group, while there was one case in the 15-17 years old group. There were 2 patients experiencing Parkinsonian symptoms in the 13-14 year old group, one led to drug discontinuation and another resolved by week 12; in the 15-17 years old group there were 4 reports of Parkinsonism, both resolved by week 12.

## Seizures related events

One subject experienced a grand mal convulsion in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm during the acute phase. No other TEAEs related to seizures occurred.

## Suicide related events

Two subjects experienced suicidal ideation, 1/98 (1%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 1/99 (1%) in the 30 mg arm in the acute phase of the study.

## Intentional self-injury related events

Intentional self-injury was reported in 2/98 (2.0%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, in 1/99 (1.0%) in the 30 mg arm, and in 1/97 (1.0%) in the placebo arm during the acute phase. Self mutilation was reported in 1/98 (1%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 1/99 (1%) in the 30 mg arm.

## Weigth gain related events

There were no significant differences in weight change between aripiprazole and placebo in the end of the acute phase (at week 4).

The mean changes in weight at week 4 were 0.82, 1.08, and 0.56 kg for the aripiprazole 10 mg, 30 mg, and placebo arms, respectively (p = 0.3488 and p = 0.1276 for the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively, versus placebo). Mean changes from baseline in weight were significantly greater in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 30 mg arms versus placebo at week 12 through week 30 and at the last visit. The mean changes in weight at the end of the study (Last Visit) were 3.20, 2.85, and 0.98 kg for the aripiprazole 10 mg, 30 mg, and placebo arms, respectively (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0019 for the 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively, versus placebo).

The  percentages  of  subjects  who  experienced  a  potentially  clinically  significant  weight  gain  (≥  7% weight gain compared to baseline) at their Last Visit were 35.8% (34/95 subjects) in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 29.2% (28/96 subjects) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 9.8% (9/92 subjects) in the placebo arm. The differences from placebo in the incidence of potentially clinically significant weight gain were statistically significant at the Last Visit for both the aripiprazole 10 mg arm and 30 mg arm (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0009, respectively), at week 30 for the 10 mg arm (p=0.0487), and at week 16 for the 30 mg arm (p = 0.0337).

At baseline 25.5%, 25.3%, and 21.6% in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and placebo  arm,  respectively,  had  a  weight  z  -score  ≥  95th  percentile.  This  proportion  of  subjects increased to 27.4%, 29.2%, and 22.8% in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and placebo arm, respectively, at the Last Visit. It was noted that a few subjects had shifts in weight zscores from normal at baseline to abnormal at the last visit: 4 subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 5 subjects in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 2 subjects in the placebo arm.

Mean weight and BMI changes are presented for 10-12 years and 13-17 years groups in Tables 24 and 25.

When comparing 13-14 and 15-17 age groups, mean weight changes were significant with aripiprazole 10 mg in both age groups by week 12. In the OC analysis, increase weight of 2.7 Kg (placebo: 1.4 Kg) by week 12 in the 13-14 years old group versus 2.5 Kg (placebo 1.1 Kg) in the 15-17 years old group. Similar results were obtained using LOCF analysis. BMI index followed the same pattern.

## Study 31-03-241.

A total of 214 TEAEs were experienced by 65/86 (75.6%) of subjects with bipolar I disorder in Study 31-03-241.  The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  6/86  (7.0%)  of  subjects experienced SAEs.

The most commonly reported TEAEs by 5 % or greater incidence included: diarrhoea (5.8%), nausea (10.5%),  Irritability  (5.8%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (8.1%),  weight  increased  (7.0%), akathisia  (8.1%),  dizziness  (7.0%),  headache  (16.3%),  somnolence  (10.5%),  nasal  congestion (5.8%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Extrapyramidal Syndrome (EPS) related symptoms

Parkinsonism were reported for 6/86 (6.9%) children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder in Study 31-03-241. Akathisia were reported for 7/86 subjects (8.1%). The majority of EPS-related AEs were mild to moderate in severity. None of the EPS-related AEs led to discontinuation. On subject reported dystona (1.1%).

## Seizures related events

No seizures were reported in study 31-03-241.

## Suicide related events

No cases of suicide ideation were reported in study 31-03-241 for subjects with bipolar I disorder.

## Intentional self injury related events

In two out of eighty-six  subjects (2.3%),  intentional self-injury was reported as TEAE.

## Weigth gain related events

At the Last Visit, the percentage of subjects who experienced a potentially clinically significant weight gain (≥ 7% compared to baseline) was 36/86 (44.2%).

## Somnolence related events

At week 12, the incidence of somnolence was 20.0% and 34.1% in subjects 13-14 and 15-17 years, respectively, after treatment with aripiprazole 10 mg, compared to an incidence of 6.5% and 3.7%, respectively, after treatment with placebo. Sedation was not reported for any of the patients treated with aripiprazole 10 mg or placebo in subjects 13-14 and 15-17 years of age.

## 1.3.3.3. Serious adverse events and deaths

No deaths were reported in studies 31-03-240 and 31-03-241.

## Study 31-03-240

A total of 18/294 (6.1%) subjects with Bipolar I disorder experienced SAEs.

The  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  during  the  entire  study  were  bipolar  disorder  (9/294  subjects; 3.1% overall) and bipolar I disorder (3/294 subjects, 1.0% overall). During the acute phase, bipolar disorder was reported as serious in 2 subjects (2.0%) of the aripiprazole 30 mg arm and in 4 subjects (4.1%) of the placebo arm. An additional 3 subjects in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (for a total 5.1% in that group for the entire study) had SAEs of bipolar disorder after week 4. An SAE of bipolar I disorder was  also  reported  in  2  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm  after  week  4,  and  1  subject  in  the placebo arm during the acute Phase.

Other SAEs reported during the acute phase were fatigue (1 subject in the 10 mg arm), accidental overdose (1 subject in the 10 mg arm), grand mal convulsion (1 subject in the 10 mg arm), aggression (2 subjects in the 10 mg arm), oppositional defiant disorder (1 subject in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm), suicidal ideation (1 subject in the 10 mg arm), and respiratory arrest (1 subject in the 10 mg arm). Additional SAEs that were reported after week 4 were:  increased libido (1 subject in the 30 mg arm) and mania (1 subject in the placebo arm).

Overall,  6  subjects  experienced  SAEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  study  medication:  in  the aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  1  subject  was  discontinued  due  to  suicidal  ideation,  and  1  subject  was discontinued  due  to  aggression  and  fatigue;  in  the  aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  3  subjects  were discontinued due to bipolar disorder; and in the placebo arm, 1 subject was discontinued due to bipolar I disorder.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  relevant  differences  on  the  SAE  profile  were  observed  between  the  age  groups  of  10-12  years versus 13-17 years.

## Study 31-03-241

A total of 6/86 (7.0%) patients experienced SAEs. The majority of these SAEs were severe in intensity. The following SAEs were reported: aggression (n=2), bipolar disorder (n=3), depression (n=1), and intentional self-injury (n=1).

## 1.3.3.4. Laboratory, Vital and Physical findings

Although, CPK elevation was identified as potential significant laboratory changes, no clinically relevant changes were noted in enzyme or serum chemistry elevations or changes in hematology parameters.

In  study  31-03-240, one of 98 (1.0%) subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm showed glycolysated haemoglobin  increased  during  the  acute  phase.  None  was  reported  in  study  31-03-241.  However, significant changes in prolactin levels were observed and further details are provided below.

No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  mean  QT  or  QTc  intervals,  or  other  ECG  abnormalities,  were observed.  In  study  31-03-241,  an  ECG  abnormality  (abnormal  ECG)  was  reported  as  TEAE  in  one subject. This TEAE was not an SAE nor did it result in a discontinuation of study medication.

In both studies, pyrexia was reported: 3 subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg and 4 subjects in the 30 mg arm in  study  31-03-240  and  4/86  (437%)  subjects  in  study  31-03-241.  In  addition  significant orthostatic  changes  were  noted.  These  were  defined  as  a  decrease  of  at  least  20  mmHg  in  systolic blood pressure accompanied by an increase in heart rate of at least 25 bpm when changing from a supine to a standing position: 2 subjects in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm and 2 subjects in the placebo arm,  corresponding  to  an  incidence  2.1%,  0.0%,  and  2.1%  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  the aripiprazole  30  mg  arm,  and  the  placebo  arm,  respectively  in  study  31-03-240  and  5/86  (5.8%) subjects in study 31-03-241.

## Prolactin levels

## Study 31-03-240

Mean decreases in prolactin levels relative to baseline were observed in the two aripiprazole treatment arms in male subjects, and in both of the aripiprazole arms and the placebo arm in female subjects. The mean changes from baseline to the last visit in prolactin levels(in ng/ml) were -2.58, -3.39, and 0.72 in the aripiprazole 10 mg, aripiprazole 30 mg, and placebo arms, respectively, in male subjects.

The incidence of low prolactin levels (less than 3 ng/dL in females and less than 2 ng/dL in males) during the acute phase was greatest in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (35/89, 39.3%), followed by the aripiprazole 10 mg arm (22/87, 25.3%), and then by the placebo arm (2/85, 2.4%). For males, the total incidence of low prolactin levels was 38/89 (38.8%) in the aripiprazole arms and 2/47 (4.3%) in the  placebo  arm.  For  females,  the  total  incidence  of  low  prolactin  levels  was  19/87  (21.8%)  in  the aripiprazole  arms  and  0/38  (0.0%)  in  the  placebo  arm.  During  the  entire  study  period,  the  overall incidence of low prolactin levels was greatest in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm (41/92, 44.6%), followed by the aripiprazole 10 mg arm (34/93, 36.6%), and then by the placebo arm (2/86, 2.3%). A higher proportion  of  males  experienced  decreased  prolactin  levels  than  females  in  both  dose  groups.  For males, the total incidence of low prolactin levels was 49/92 (53.3%) in the aripiprazole arms and 2/47 (4.3%) in the placebo arm. For females, the total incidence of low prolactin levels was 26/93 (28.0%) in the aripiprazole arms and 0/39 (0.0%) in the placebo arm. None of these events were reported as TEAEs or SAEs or resulted in discontinuation of study medication.

## Study 31-03-241

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A decrease in prolactin levels relative to baseline was observed in children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder. The mean changes from baseline to the last visit in prolactin levels (in ng/ml) were: -1.55 at  week  8;  -1.24  ng/ml  at  week  18;  -0.74  at  week  26  and  -0.88  at  the  last  visit.  For  females  the decreases in prolactin levels  were  smaller  than  for  males.  The  incidence  of  low  prolactin  levels  was 38/83 (45.8%). For females, the incidence of low prolactin levels was 9/34 (26.5%), for males 29/49 (59.2%). None of these events were reported as TEAEs or SAEs or resulted in discontinuation of study medication.

## 1.3.3.5. Discontinuation due to AES

## Study 31-03-240

During  the  acute  phase,  a  total  of  16/294  (5.4%)  subjects  discontinued  study  medication  due  to  a TEAE: 6/98 (6.1%) in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, 8/99 (8.1%) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 2/97 (2.1%) in the placebo arm. During the entire 30-week study, a total of 30/294 (10.2%) subjects discontinued  study  medication  due  to  a  TEAE:  9/98  (9.2%)  in  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  arm,  19/99 (19.2%) in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and 2/97 (2.1%) in the placebo arm.

No relevant  differences  on  the  rates  of  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  were  observed  between  the  age groups of 10-12 years versus 13-17 years.

## Study 31-03-241

One out of Eighty six (1.2%) subjects with bipolar I disorder discontinued study medication due to a TEAE : auditory hallucination.

## 1.3.3.6. Post marketing experience

During the six-month period from 17 July 2010 through 16 January 2011, among files for which the age of  the  patient  was  reported,  there  were  a  total  of  234  healthcare  professional  confirmed  cases (221 initial and 13 follow up) of AEs occurring in patients 17 years of age or younger. Of these cases, 223 were spontaneous cases and 11 were derived from published literature. Furthermore, 73 cases were  classified  as  serious.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  experienced  in  the  paediatric population  were  Weight  increased  (26),  Tardive  dyskinesia  (14),  Dystonia  (13),  Akathisia  (12), Dizziness (8), Somnolence  (8),  Tremor  (7),  Vomiting  (7), Nausea  (6), Drug  ineffective (5), Extrapyramidal disorder (5), Muscle rigidity (5), Premature baby (5), Small for dates baby (5), Swollen tongue (5), and Vision blurred (5).

The MAH performed a supplementary search of the most common AEs from the CARES (BMS Corporate Adverse  Events  Reporting  and  Evaluation  System)  database,  by  August  7,  2012.  The  estimated worldwide postmarketing aripiprazole exposure for patients aged 0-17 years was 1,451,600 patients, most on the schizophrenia indication. There were 151 cases of somnolence or sedation (131 reports from  healthcare  professionals,  20  from  published  literature).  Of  these  cases,  39  were  considered serious. The events reported to be similar across different pediatric age groups. There were 217 cases that  fell  under  'Weight  increased'.  Of  these  cases,  214  were  spontaneous  cases,  and  3  were  from published literature. Thirty of the 217 cases were considered serious. The 217 cases which met criteria for inclusion in this search described 94 males and 86 females (gender not provided in 37 cases). The nature of the reported  events related to weight increased was similar across different pediatric age groups. There were 442 cases of 'Dyskinesias and movement disorders' or 'Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism' which included 444 events. Of these cases, 1 case was from a clinical trial, 409 were spontaneous cases, and 14 cases were from published literature. Ninety-two of the 442 cases were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered serious. reported events related to extrapyramidal disorder was similar across different age groups in the pediatric population (age range 7 months to 17 years old, mean 13 years old).

## 1.3.3.7. Discussion on clinical safety

The  safety  profile  from  the  two  clinical  studies  supportive  of  the  intended  indication  in  Bipolar  I disorders  (10  years  and  older)  appeared  to  be  similar  in  events  to  the  one  observed  in  the  adult population. The short and medium term features of the studies, however did not allow to make any conclusions,  particularly  for  the  high  rate  of  EPS  symptoms  and  of  weight  gain  observed  in  this population.

In the pivotal study 31-03-240, the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Neurologic gastrointestinal AEs and psychiatric AEs not related to lack of efficacy (including aggression, bipolar disorder,  libido  increased,  oppositional  defiant  disorder  and  suicidal  ideation)  were  mainly  reported. However, somnolence and fatigue were commonly reported (24.5% and 11.8% , respective) and are of concern in the proposed population, younger than the authorised paediatric indication for schizophrenia.

The percentage of subjects who experienced severe TEAEs during the entire study was higher in the aripiprazole arms compared to the placebo arm. The percentage of subjects who discontinued study medication due to TEAEs was greatest in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, followed by the aripiprazole 10 mg  and  the  placebo  arm.  For  the  majority  of  TEAEs,  no  dose-relationship  could  be  established, however, EPS symptoms were very significant AEs and dose dependent, with more than quarter of the patients experiencing EPS in the 30 mg aripiprazole arm.

According to previous discussion on efficacy (see 2.3.2.4), the CHMP considered that the MAH proposal to have a maximum daily dose of 30 mg was not acceptable, especially given its safety profile and the intended use in a population, younger than the authorised paediatric indication for schizophrenia.

Weight gain is possibly the most significant AE reported, particularly in bipolar disorders. Although in the acute phase the difference is not statistically significant, there is nonetheless a difference, which appeared clinically relevant, meaning that for most patients weight gain / increased appetite started immediately after initiation of treatment. Increased weight in such short time cannot be attributed to growth, and even small weight increases may represent a significant percentage of weight increase in lighter subjects. At week 30, there was a mean 6.5 Kg increase in aripiprazole treatment arms versus 3.0 Kg increase in placebo.

Potentially clinically significant weight gain (≥ 7% weight gain compared to baseline), was over 30% and reached 44% in studies 31-03-240 and 31-03-241, respectively.

On the basis of further analyses performed at the CHMP request, a clear weight increase over time of &gt;3.5 Kg as compared to placebo by week 30 was observed  for completers. Weight gain was higher in the  10-12  years  old  particularly  on  the  30  mg  aripiprazole  arm  (even  taking  in  consideration  the increase in placebo arm the difference is 4.9 Kg), but the sample  size was small and lacked statistical significance. Patients whose weight increased most were non baseline overweight. Although the sample sizes  were  small,  same  trend  of  weight  increased  were  observed  in  all  analyses  performed.  BMI showed a similar pattern to weight gain, with the placebo arm also increasing slightly in the younger group,  and  the  greatest  BMI  increased  in  the  treatment  arms.  One  of  98  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the aripiprazole 10 mg arm showed glycolysated haemoglobin increased during the acute phase. None was reported  in  study  31-03-241.  Hyperglycaemia  /  diabetes  usually  takes  longer  to  develop  than  the duration of the  studies, therefore no conclusions on these AEs can be made, although this event has been identified as potential concern. In the 30 week period, other metabolic effects were not overly seen, apart from an increase in triglycerides but with high intersubject variability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to address the CHMP concerns over the AE profile observed in the bipolar I disorder population aged 10 years and older, ie high frequency of EPS related symptoms, somnolence and weight gain related events, the MAH presented a comparison of the safety profile for 10-12 years and 13-17 years to  support  their  proposal  to  revise  the  indication  applied  for  from  10-17  years  to  13-17  years  (see Table  21).    This  analysis  provided  further  evidence  that  the  frequency  of  EPS,  weight  gain  and somnolence reported in the 10-12 years old group precluded an indication in this younger population. Most AEs occurred with 30 mg aripiprazole than with 10 mg dose.

Comparative data on EPS, sedation, somnolence and weight/BMI changes between age groups of 1314 years versus 15-17 years did not show any significant differences in AE profiles, suggesting that a restriction to 15-17 years population would not be an appropriate measure to minimise these risks.

Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  safety  profile  was  unfavourable  for  the  10-12  age  group  and therefore agreed to restrict the indication to the adolescents aged 13 years and older, as proposed by the applicant. ). Long term studies are also ongoing that will collect further data to monitor the safety profile of the product in this population.

The CHMP also recommended that educational materials are provided to patients/caregivers to ensure the safe and effective use of Abilify in this new paediatric indication (see 2.3.4).

## 1.3.4. Risk management plan

| Increased mortality and CVA in elderly patients with dementia                       | Routine PV as listed in the current RMP        | Warnings & Precautions, section 4.4 of SmPC: \"Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature. Cerebrovascular adverse reactions: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients |

Neonates exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully.

## 2. BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT

## 2.1.1. Benefits

## 2.1.1.1. Beneficial effects

Results  from  study  31-03-240,    a  large  randomised  controlled  trial  conducted  in  children  and adolescents  aged  10  years  and  older,  showed  that  aripiprazole  is  effective  in  the  treatment  of moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes,  as  demonstrated  by  statistically  significant  improvement compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline to week 4 in the total YMRS score. The study was a double blind placebo controlled consisting of an acute 4 week phase and a 26 week maintenance phase. The duration of the study was therefore longer than the recommended  12  week  maintenance  trial  as  referred  in  the  'Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Clinical Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  in  the  Treatment  of  Bipolar  Disorder',  (CPMP/EWP/567/98). Significant improvements were also documented for the secondary efficacy endpoints: CGAS, CGI-BP Severity Score for mania and for overall bipolar illness, GBI Total Score for mania and for the ADHD rating scale.

In the acute phase, treatment with aripiprazole resulted in statistically significant improvements (LOCF) compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint YMRS Total Score at week 4  in both 10 mg (5.99, CI:-8.49;-3.50, p&lt;0.0001) and 30 mg (-8.26, CI:-10.7;-5.77, p&lt;0.0001).

This efficacy was maintained through week 30 showing a statistically significant sustained improvement over placebo in both 10 mg (-5.89, CI:-8.70;-3.08, p&lt;0.0001) and 30 mg (-6.73, CI:9.53;-3.94, p&lt;0.0001). Mean changes in YMRS Total Scores at week 30 using LOCF data were -14.1 in the aripiprazole 10 mg arm, -14.9 in the aripiprazole 30 mg arm, and -8.2 in the placebo arm.

Significant improvements were also documented for the secondary efficacy endpoints: CGAS, CGI-BP Severity Score for mania and for overall bipolar illness, GBI Total Score for mania and for the ADHD rating scale

Both  the  aripiprazole  10  mg  and  30  mg  arms  had  significantly  higher  percentages  of  responders compared to the placebo arm at every treatment week during both at week 4 and at week 30 using the LOCF  data  set,  thus  showing  maintenance  of  the  effect  of  treatment.  At  week  4,  percentages  of responders  were  44.79  %  and  63.64%  for  10  and  30  mg  groups  as  compared  to  26.09%  for  the placebo  group.  At  week  30,  percentages  of  responders  were  around  50%  and  55.56%  for  10  and 30 mg groups as compared to 26.6% for the placebo group.

## 2.1.1.2. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

In a post-hoc analysis, the population without comorbid disorders did not differ significantly in mean change of YMRS in both 10 mg aripiprazole and placebo by week 4 thus questioning as to whether aripiprazole  may  act  mainly  in  symptoms  common  to  ADHD  /  ODD  and  not  specifically  on  Bipolar Disorder  type  I.  Additional  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  indicating  that  the  presence  of  any comorbidity did not seem to influence the YMRS changes at weeks 4 and 12. However, the persistence of effect was less evident in patients with or without ADHD at both weeks 4 and 12 for the 30 mg dose.

When compared to the placebo at week 12, the OC analysis failed to show statistical significant over the placebo for both doses on all analysed efficacy endpoints for both age groups. Considering the high rates  of  discontinuation,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  OC  analysis  did  not  provide  any  relevant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

findings  apart  that  a  significant  percentage  of  patients  did  improve  spontaneously  by  week  12, suggesting that the treatment should not be prolong longer than 12 weeks.

For  efficacy  endpoints  evaluating  the  effect  of  treatment  on  depressive  symptoms  (CGI-BP  Severity Score for depression, GBI Total Score for depression and CDRS) no statistically significant superiority of aripiprazole over placebo treatment was observed.

## 2.1.2. Risks

## 2.1.2.1. Unfavourable effects

The safety profile from the two clinical studies supportive of the intended initial indication in Bipolar I disorders  (10  years  and  older)  appeared  to  be  similar  in  events  to  the  one  observed  in  the  adult population.  High rate of EPS symptoms and weight gain and somnolence are of particular concern in the proposed population.

Potentially clinically significant weight gain reached 30% in study 31-03-240 and 44% in study 31-03241, reflecting a very high risk of weight gain associated with a morbid status, particularly in a bipolar population.

EPS  symptoms,  particularly  parkinsonism  was  very  frequent  and  dose  dependent  to  aripiprazole.  If moderate or severe, these symptoms will be a stigma to subjects, and slowness of movements and thought will have impact in patient's activities of daily living and quality of life.

Somnolence/fatigue was also very frequent and can have a deleterious effect on school attendance and school achievements.

## 2.1.2.2. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No paediatric data on the long term effect of aripiprazole (e.g on weight gain and EPS) are currently available. Long term safety studies are ongoing to monitor the safety profile in this population.

## 2.1.2.3. Balance

## 2.1.2.4. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Efficacy was demonstrated over placebo in Bipolar I disorder patients aged 10-17 years old at week 4 as shown by statistically significant improvement on the total YRMS score. This efficacy was maintained through week 30 showing a statistically significant sustained improvement over placebo in both 10 mg and  30  mg.  However,  when  compared  to  the  placebo  at  week  12,  the  OC  analysis  failed  to  show statistical significant over the placebo for both doses on all analysed efficacy endpoints for both age groups of 10-12 and 13-17 years. Given the high number of discontinuation, this finding suggested that the treatment should not be prolong longer than 12 weeks.

Whilst the CHMP noted the standardised measures put in place for diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria, a post-hoc analysis showed that the population without comorbid disorders did not differ significantly in mean  change  of  YMRS  in  both  10  mg  aripiprazole  and  placebo  by  week  4  thus  questioning  as  to whether aripiprazole might act mainly in symptoms common to ADHD / ODD and not specifically on Bipolar  Disorder  type  I.  However,  additional  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  indicating  that  the presence of any comorbidity did not seem to influence the YMRS changes at weeks 4 and 12, this was being less evident with patients with or without ADHD at both weeks 4 and 12 for the 30 mg dose. In addition,  further  analysis  were  presented  showing  that  ADHD  status  did  not  change  the  10  mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment effect significantly, particularly at week 12, where the use of ADHD medication was already permitted and favoured aripiprazole effect independently the presence of ADHD or ADHD medication.

The  available  data  to  date  raised  safety  concerns  regarding  mostly  weight  gain,  EPS  symptoms, especially in the young Bipolar I disorder population aged 10-12 years.  Most AEs occurred with 30 mg aripiprazole than with 10 mg dose. Since enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, the use of the 30 mg dose was not recommended by the CHMP, and an increase over 10 mg should only be performed under strict surveillance.

## 2.1.2.5. Benefit-risk balance

Considering  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  across  paediatric  age  groups  from  10-17  years,  the  CHMP noted  that  the  safety  profile  was  not  favourable  for  the  younger  population  (10-12  years)  and therefore  concluded  that  the  benefit  -risk  balance  was  positive  in  the  paediatric  Bipolar  I  disorder population aged 13 years and older. In order to minimise the risks of dose-related AEs occurrence, the use of the 30 mg dose is not recommended by the CHMP, and an increase over 10 mg should only be performed under strict surveillance. In addition, educational material will be provided to patients and caregivers to ensure the safe and effective use of Abilify in this new paediatric indication.

## 2.2. Conclusions

The overall benefit-risk balance of Abilify is positive for the following indication: 'ABILIFY is indicated for  the  treatment  up  to  12 weeks  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  Disorder  in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1)'.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore  recommends  ,  by  a  majority  of  24  out  of  28  votes,  the  variation(s)  to  the  terms  of  the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change(s):

## Appendix

Divergent Positions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## DIVERGENT POSITIONS

The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP's positive opinion recommending the variation to the marketing authorisation to add the following indication: 'ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1).' The reasons for divergent opinion were the following:

- The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes of type 1 bipolar mood  disorder  has  not  been  shown;  the  treatment  effects  largely  disappeared  after exclusion of psychiatric comorbid disorders suggesting the effect is mediated by a possibly aspecific effect on symptoms due to comorbidity hence at least questioning the effect on symptoms of mania in adolescents;
- The  safety  profile  (occurrence  of  EPS  symptoms,  weight  gain  and  somnolence)  is unfavourable in younger patients aged 13 years and older with manic episode, especially taking the above into account.
