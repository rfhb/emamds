## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for exenatide, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

Thirtytwo  cases  of  pancreatitis  have  been  reported  cumulatively  with  once  weekly-treated  patients. 25/32 cases were reported during the period of review for this PSUR, of which positive de-challenge was reported in 13 of the cases.  Therefore as data is now available for patients treated with onceweekly exenatide (Bydureon), section 4.8 of the SmPC of Bydureon should be updated to add 'acute pancreatitis'  under  the  SOC  Gastrointestinal  disorders  with  a  frequency  'not  known'  (as  postmarketing  experience  for  Bydureon,  table  1,  while  removing  'acute  pancreatitis'  as  reflecting experience from Byetta only, table 2). The Package leaflet should be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Bydureon the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance exenatide is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information of Bydureon.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation of Bydureon should be varied.
