## Information on Paediatric requirements

Not applicable

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

| The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to Imraldi on | 27 June 2019       |

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Problem statement

Imraldi is a biosimilar adalimumab with the EU Humira as the reference medicinal product. Imraldi was approved by the European Commission in August 2017. Adalimumab is a genetically engineered recombinant human immunoglobulin IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Imraldi is currently available only as single dose 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) or pen. However, in accordance with the reference medicinal product Humira Imraldi was also authorised  in  paediatric  indications  for  which  doses  lower  than  40mg  should  be  given.  Therefore,  the introduction of the vial presentation that allows dosing lower than 40 mg dose is justified from a clinical point of view.

There are no changes to the pharmaceutical form, route of administration, and proposed indications compared to the currently licensed strengths. Therefore no additional nonclinical or clinical studies have been performed.

The Product Information (PI) is revised for pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen to be in the line with the line extension application so that dosing instructions to the paediatric patients are included.

## 2.1.1. Disease or condition

The line extension for 40 mg solution for injection vial presentation of Imraldi applies to the following indications:

- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis polyarticular (JIA):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Paediatric plaque psoriasis
- Paediatric Crohn's disease
- Adolescent Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)
- Paediatric uveitis.

## 2.1.2. Epidemiology

No new data were submitted in this application.

## 2.1.3. Biologic features

Adalimumab neutralises the biological function of both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors and modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration.

## 2.1.4. Clinical presentation, diagnosis

TNF-α has been shown to be elevated in several disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (PsO),  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA),  ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  axial  spondyloarthritis  without  radiographic evidence of AS, Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). In addition, elevated serum TNF-α levels seem to be positively correlated with recurrent episodes of uveitis of idiopathic origin. Biological therapies have well-documented efficacy, rapid onset of action, and good acute tolerability.

## 2.1.5. Management

## About the product

Imraldi, a biosimilar to Humira, is currently indicated in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, paediatric plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn's disease, paediatric Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis. The extension of indication in paediatric uveitis has been recently approved in February 2019 for Imraldi (EMEA/H/C/004279/IB/0020).

The active substance of Imraldi is adalimumab, a chimeric human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody. It binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  Imraldi is authorised for two single dose 40 mg solution for injection presentations, as a pre-filled syringe since initial marketing authorisation granted in August 2017 and as a pre-filled pen since September 2018 (EMEA/H/C/004279/II/0002/G).

The current application is an extension application to the marketing authorisation for Imraldi (EMEA/H/C/004279) to add a new strength of 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection (in vial). The product will be administered via s.c. injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Type of Application and aspects on development

Imraldi is a biosimilar product to the EU-approved Humira reference medicinal product. The marketing authorisation for Imraldi was granted in September 2017 under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC and Article 3(3) of Regulation 726/2004/EC, with reference to Humira 40 mg solution for injection (EU/1/03/256/001) and Humira 40 solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (EU/1/03/256/003,005). Imraldi is currently marketed as 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen.

The purpose of the present application is to seek approval for Imraldi 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection in vial to allow dosing in paediatric patients.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Imraldi, also referred to as SB5, is a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody, adalimumab, directed against tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. From cell banking up to the manufacturing process of SB5 active  substance  and  finished  product,  materials  of  animal  origin  were  used  only  during  early  cell  line development.

SB5 finished product is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale brown, sterile and preservative-free solution for injection. SB5 is currently presented as a single-use pre-filled syringe (PFS) or single-use pre-filled pen (PFP) containing 40 mg adalimumab in 0.8 mL to be administered via subcutaneous injection.

The scope of this line extension application is to add a new strength of 40 mg/0.8 mL solution for injection in vial, to allow the administration to paediatric patients that require less than a full 40 mg dose. The excipients remain unchanged: sodium citrate, citric acid monohydrate, histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, polysorbate 20 and water for injections.

This new presentation is presented as one pack of 2 boxes each containing 1 vial (0.8 ml sterile solution), 1 empty sterile injection syringe, 1 needle, 1 vial adapter and 2 alcohol pads.

Additionally,  within  this  application,  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  would  like  to  register  a manufacturing/Quality Control testing site for the Imraldi 40 mg/0.8 mL vial finished product.

The MAH also submitted a Type IB variation together with the line extension application to update the Product Information for pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen to be in the line with the line extension application.

Only data supportive of the proposed extension application is submitted. For all other sections, reference is made to the currently approved dossier of Imraldi.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

In section 3.2.S.4.5, only contents describing the finished product container closure has been updated from 'per syringe' to 'per container' since glass vial has been added as Imraldi finished product container closure. The other sections of Module 3.2.S remain unchanged.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Description of the product and pharmaceutical development

## Manufacturing process development

A thorough pharmaceutical development was conducted by exploring the changes needed for finished product manufacturing site transfer and by comparing the changes needed for in-process controls (IPC) and in-process tests. The MAH presented process changes proposed for facility fit and container closure difference. In addition some changes are introduced in the IPC tests. The process changes were confirmed by validation and considered as technical adaptation of the equipment and facility.

The MAH compared the finished product physicochemical and biological characteristics after the transfer. The MAH demonstrated comparability of the vial product to PFS product. The results show that the finished product manufacturing site addition and vial filling process do not impact product quality in terms of physicochemical and biological attributes.

It is confirmed that the new facility is capable of producing a finished product comparable to the finished product from the already approved manufacturing sites.

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

The vial manufacturing process involves thawing, pooling, and mixing of the active substance, followed by sterile filtration and aseptic vial filling, stopper placement, and capping. The SB5 vial finished product contains formulated SB5 active substance at a nominal concentration of 50 mg/mL. The only processing that occurs between active substance and finished product is sterile filtration and aseptic filling into vials, and thus the composition of the finished product is identical to the composition of the active substance.

The manufacturing process is adequately described and it was demonstrated that the controls in place are sufficient to produce a product of acceptable quality. The control strategy defining the critical and non-critical process  steps  is  agreed.  Both  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  and  key  process  parameter  (KPPs)  have operating ranges and action limits because they can respectively affect product quality or process performance or consistency. The non-KPPs are unlikely to affect either process performance or product quality, and as such only have operating ranges. Likewise critical in-process controls (CIPCs) and critical in-process tests (CIPTs) are the subset of IPCs and IPTs which have action limits or in-process specifications. In-process measurements are used to assess process consistency and/or measured to evaluate process scale-up, but do not have action limits.

The presented validation of the manufacturing steps has been successfully completed, meeting the defined specifications. The proposed validation ranges are appropriate for control of product and ensure no adverse impact on the critical quality attributes (CQAs).

## Container closure

The primary packaging materials for SB5 vial presentation are a sterile Type I borosilicate glass vial, a sterile chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium crimping cap. The glass vial and the stopper are of compendial quality.  The  container  closure  system  is  adequately  presented  and  all  components  have  a  CE-mark  and declaration of conformity. In these certificates the supplier of the device is stated. The information is included in the dossier Section 3.2.P.7 as well. In addition the sterilisation method for primary packaging components is presented in detail.

Extractables and leachables studies were performed on the vial presentation, which demonstrate compatibility of SB5 with the container closure system.

The new vial presentation was demonstrated to be safe and to fulfill the requirements set for the container closure. The MAH addressed the risk of trace element impurities as required by ICH Q3D.

## Product specification

The release and shelf life  specifications  for  the  SB5  finished  product  are  presented  and  include  control  of identity, purity and impurity, biological activity and other general tests.

## Batch analysis

Details of batches including batch size, manufacturing site and conditions, and use in SB5 development were presented together with the results. All the batches complied with the specifications.

## Stability of the product

Stability data provided in this submission for the vial presentation are available at long-term, at accelerated, and at stress storage conditions.. All results met the acceptance criteria.

It can be concluded that the vial presentation does not change the stability of the finished product substantially and hence the proposed shelf life for the vial finished product of 36 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C is acceptable. The vial should be kept in the outer carton in order to protect it from light.

In accordance with EU GMP guidelines ( 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union ), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

## Conclusion

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.0 is acceptable.

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.7. Product information

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Humira 40mg/0.8ml solution for injection. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Imraldi is authorised in all indications in accordance with its reference medicinal product Humira. For paediatric indications doses lower than 40mg should be given to patients 10kg to &lt;30kg but Imraldi was so far only available as single dose 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) or pen. The present line extension is to add a new strength Imraldi 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection in a vial to allow weight adapted dosing in paediatric patients requiring less than a full 40mg dose.

The review of the quality data indicates that the extension of marketing authorisation is approvable. No clinical or non-clinical data were submitted.

Accordingly the PI for Imraldi is updated to add the strength 40mg/0.8ml solution for injection in a vial and to include dosing instructions pertaining to the paediatric patients for whom lower dose than 40mg based on body weight can be needed. The product information has been updated to include also the recently approved paediatric uveitis indication (IB/0023). Minor additional amendments to the SmPC and PL are also made to align the PI with Humira (the reference product).

The RMP v3.0 has been updated to include the new strength 40mg/0.8ml solution for injection in a vial and to align with the latest approved version for Humira.

## 3.1. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Imraldi is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Imraldi new strength is favourable in the following indications:

- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis polyarticular (JIA):
- Paediatric plaque psoriasis
- Paediatric Crohn's disease
- Adolescent Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)
- Paediatric uveitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Imraldi subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2).

## Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## Periodic Safety Update Reports

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## Additional risk minimisation measures

Prior to launch of Imraldi in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority. The educational program consists of a Patient Reminder Card.

## The Patient Reminder Cards should contain the following key elements:

- serious infections
- tuberculosis
- cancer
- nervous system problems
- vaccinations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, CHMP recommends the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variations approved   | Variations approved                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.z                 | C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation | Type IB | I and IIIB         |

Extension application to introduce a new strength of 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection in a vial, to allow the administration to paediatric patients requiring less than a full 40mg dose.
