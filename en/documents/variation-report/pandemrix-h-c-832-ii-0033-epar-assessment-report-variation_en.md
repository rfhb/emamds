## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisations in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following the declaration of the pandemic by WHO, the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The  vaccine  also  contains  the  marketing  authorisation  holder's  (MAH)  proprietary  adjuvant  AS03, which is composed of squalene, DL- -tocopherol and polysorbate 80. This variation initially proposed to update the SPC and PL with the post-dose 1 immunogenicity and the post-dose 1+2 safety data from study 010 in children aged 3-17 years who have received two adult doses of Pandemrix (H1N1). However, the CHMP requested post-dose 1 HI and safety data in children aged 3-9 years who have received a half adult dose of Pandemrix (H1N1) in study H1N1-023 during the procedure. The CHMP considered that changes could only be made to the current SPC regarding children aged 39 years until these additional data have been reviewed and assessed, which has been done during this procedure. However, study 010 also provided post-dose 1 data with the adult dose in subjects aged 10-17 years. Since these data in subjects aged 10-17 years from study 010 are pertinent to the use of adult doses, it was agreed that the information on use of the adult dose in subjects aged 10-17 years have been added to the SPC and PL in the variation II/032 that received a positive Opinion in December 2009. In  submitting  the  above  mentioned  data  from  study  H1N1-010  the  MAH  also  fulfilled  the  Specific Obligation 'to provide an abridged report for a post dose 2 abridged report from study D-PAN H1N1010' (SOB 057). In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update Annex II with the current status of Specific Obligations Study  H1N1-010 provided  also  post-dose  1  data  with  the  adult  dose  in  subjects  aged  10-17  years. Since these data in subjects aged 10-17 years from study H1N1- 010 are pertinent to the use of adult doses,  the  information  on  use  of  the  adult  dose  in  subjects  aged  10-17  years  including  the  newly available safety data from this population was added to the SPC and PL previously in variation II/32. 3.1 Clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

D-PAN H1N1-010 is an ongoing study that commenced on 10 September 2009 at five study sites in Spain.

The study planned to enrol 200 subjects aged 3-17 years with stratification by age groups 3-5, 6-9 and 10 to 17 years in a ratio of 1:1:2.

All subjects were to receive two doses of Pandemrix three weeks apart, given into the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. The vaccine comprised the following content and lots:

AS03A: GSK Biologicals' proprietary adjuvant containing the oil-in-water SB62 emulsion, consisting of an oil phase containing DL- -tocopherol and squalene, and an aqueous phase containing the non-ionic detergent Tween 80

The sequential co-primary objectives are:

-  To evaluate whether the humoral immune response after two doses meets or exceeds the CHMP criteria  (as  applied  to  adults  age  18-60  years  and  to  seasonal  influenza  vaccines)  at  day  42  in children aged 3 to 17 years.

 To evaluate superiority in terms of HI response to a 6-month booster compared to the D42  response.  The  criteria  for  success  require  a  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95% confidence interval (CI) for the geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio (at seven days after a 6-month booster after 2-dose primary vaccination / 21 days after the first dose) &gt; 2.0. The secondary objectives are:  To assess HI responses at D21, D42 and M6  To assess HI responses 7 days, six months and one year after the booster  To describe the response by age strata  To describe the NA response at each time point in a subset of sera  To evaluate safety in terms of selected biochemistry safety parameters at Day 0, 21, 42, at Month 6, and Month 6 + 7 days.  To evaluate safety and reactogenicity after each dose in terms of 7-day solicited local and general symptoms, unsolicited AEs, medically attended AEs (MAEs), AEs of specific interests (AESIs) or potential Immune Mediated Diseases (pIMDs) and SAEs Exploratory  objectives  include  evaluation  of  the  CMI  response  and  immune  responses  to  drifted variants. Also, to describe the occurrence of lab-confirmed (H1N1)v cases (including drifted variant cases) during the entire study period. HI  antibody  is  determined  in  GSK  Biologicals'  central  laboratory  (SSW,  Dresden,  Germany)  as previously described. The total vaccinated cohort (TVC) and according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort are defined as in all other GSK studies. The analysis of immunogenicity presented in this summary was performed on the TVC in order to provide preliminary post Dose 1 results based on non-cleaned data.

## Results reported as of 18 November 2009

There were 210 subjects aged 3 to 17 years enrolled and vaccinated, including 53 in the 3-5 years group, 57 in the 6-9 years group and 100 in the 10-17 years group.

Of  these,  207  subjects  completed  (53,  57  and  97  in  respective  age  groups).  For  the  three  noncompleters in the 10-17 years group parental consent for participation was withdrawn and the reason for withdrawal was not due to an AE.

The mean age at the time of the first vaccination was 9.2 years. Females slightly outnumbered males in this study (44% vs. 56%).

As  shown  above,  at  Day  21  the  overall  HI  responses  exceeded  the  CHMP  and  CBER  regulatory acceptance criteria for seasonal influenza vaccines for adults. The observed HI SCR was 98.5% (range from 96.9 to 100% in the three age cohorts), SCF was 60.2 (range from 49.9 to 69.1 per cohort) and SPR was 100%. When  viewed  by  age  stratum,  four  children  aged  6-9  years  and  17  aged  10-17  years  were seroprotected at D0 compared to all children in each stratum seroprotected at D21. The D21 SCRs were 100% in the two younger strata and 97% in the 10-17 years group while SCFs were 50, 56 and 69 in ascending age strata. The MAH also supplied the data according to age cohorts 3-9 years and 10-17 years for comparison with the SPC recommendations according to these age groups. As shown in the four tables below the only difference between these two age cohorts was in the final GMTs, being twice as high in the older children. In subjects aged 10-17 years the GMT after a single full adult dose was comparable with that observed in young adults.

Randomisation was to be stratified by age in a ratio 1:1:2 for 3 to 5 years, 6 to 9 years and 10 to 17 years. All subjects will receive two doses of Pandemrix H1N1 containing 1.9 µg of HA antigen and AS03B on days 0 and 21 plus a booster dose at Month 6.

Flu A/CAL/7/09.HA1 Ab SPR at PI (D21) stratified by 3-9 years and 10-17 years and overall (Total vaccinated cohort) Flu A/CAL/7/09.HA1 Ab Post-dose 1 HI data in children aged 3-9 years (half adult dose) from study H1N1-023 D-PAN  H1N1-023 is  a  phase  III,  non-randomised,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and immunogenicity of a prime-boost schedule of Pandemrix H1N1 (using 1.9 µg HA and AS03 B i.e. half adult doses) administered to subjects aged 3 to 17 years. The full study design is summarised in the figure. Currently the MAH reports only the safety and immunogenicity data observed up to D21 of the study from blood sampling group 1 (BS 1). However, in addition to the request specifically for the data in children aged 3-9 years to verify the current SPC recommendations the MAH also provides the data for the older cohort of 10-17 years. The study planned to randomised children (total 232 in 1:1 ratios) to one of the two blood sampling schedules:  BS1 = Day 0, Day 21, Day 42 and Month 6 for schedule 1  BS2 = Day 42, Month 6, Month 6+7 days and Month 12 for schedule 2. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  study  has  actually  enrolled  122  subjects  into  each  of  the  blood  sampling  schedule  groups, comprising a total of 61 aged 3-5 years, 65 aged 6-9 years and 118 aged 10-17 years. Five subjects withdrew between D0 and D21 due to the withdrawal of the consent (3), non-serious AEs (1) and in one case for unknown reasons.

For the total vaccinated cohort from the BS1 group the details of ages at the time of enrolment and gender per age stratum are as shown below.

The HI data are currently reported at D0 and D21 for the BS1 group. The MAH provided a full summary of the data by and across the three age strata and also according to baseline serostatus. Despite the high seasonal influenza vaccination rates the baseline HI seropositivity rates were low in children aged 3-5 years (10%) and 6-9 years (3%) but one third (20/60) aged 10-17 years were already seropositive  at  D0.  Only  one  child  aged  3-9  years  was  seroprotected  at  baseline  compared  to  7/60 (12%) aged 10-17 years. The HI response at D21 greatly exceeded all three CHMP criteria applied to young adults for seasonal influenza vaccinations. In  the  3-9  years  strata  all  children  seroconverted  and  were  seroprotected  at  D21  regardless  of  their baseline serostatus. In each of the 3-5 and 6-9 years strata the GMT was higher and the SCF was lower in the subsets seropositive at baseline. A single  half  adult  dose  was  also  highly  immunogenic  in  the  stratum  aged  10-17  years.  Only  one subject was not seroprotected and two had not seroconverted at D21. The GMT was higher and the SCF was lower for the subset seropositive at baseline and in each case the 95% CI did not overlap with those for the baseline seronegative subset. The GMTs were comparable between the 3-5 and 6-9 years strata within each subset according to baseline serostatus. These GMTs were much lower than those observed in children aged 10-17 years in  the  corresponding  subsets  and  the  95%  CI  did  not  overlap  for  any  comparison.  The  reverse cumulative  distribution  (RCD)  curve  shown  below  demonstrates  the  difference  between  age  strata. However, this figure shows that the divergence in curves becomes apparent only from titres of 1:160 upwards. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In each age stratum and in each subset according to baseline serostatus the GMTs at D21 were lower than the corresponding GMTs observed after a single adult dose in study 010. History of seasonal influenza vaccination Approximately half of the children in each age stratum of the BS1 group had a history of seasonal influenza vaccination. The  MAH provided tabulations  of  D0  and  D21  HI  data  according  to  history  of  seasonal  influenza vaccination in order to confirm that the results at D21 may be extrapolated to other populations with much lower prior exposure to seasonal vaccination.

Overall the HI responses in subjects aged 10-17 years generally resemble those in young adults. In addition, in the table proposed in section 5.1 of the SPC the MAH showed the HI responses separately for  children  aged  10-17  years  who  were  seronegative  at  baseline.  As  expected,  these  data  show satisfactory  responses  in  this  subset  that  far  exceeded  the  CHMP  criteria  applied  to  adults.  On  this basis  the  CHMP considers that it is  very  reasonable  that  the  SPC  should  continue  to  recommend  a single adult dose from 10 years upwards.

While  the  GMTs  were  variable,  and  for  the  table  according  to  vaccination  within  three  seasons suggested higher GMTs in those with no such history (but all 95% CI overlapped), the SCFs met the minimum required. Discussion on immunogenicity The  CHMP  considered  that  the  extrapolation  of  the  CHMP  and  CBER  criteria  in  adults  to  the responses to a pandemic vaccine in children and adolescents carries several uncertainties. Nevertheless,  in  the  children  and  adolescents  from  10-17  years  the  baseline  status  was  comparable with that observed in adults in studies 007 and 008. The GMT reported in study 010 in this age group closely resembles that reported at D21 in subjects aged 18-40 years in studies 007 and 008 (561 and 607). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  children  aged  3-9  years  the  SPC  currently  (following  II/028)  recommends  one  or  two  half  adult doses given at least 3 weeks apart based on the safety and immunogenicity data obtained previously with H5N1/AS03 in children in this same age range and taking into account the post-dose 2 safety data from study 009 and the reported safety experience thus far in older children during routine use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP highlighted that in the H5N1/AS03 study children did not mount an immune response to the first dose of either half or full adult doses. The immune response to the second dose against the H5N1 vaccine strain  was  comparable  for  HI  and  NA  between  the  half  and  full  adult  dose  groups. Therefore the H5N1 data cannot be considered supportive in assessing whether one or two half adult doses  would  be  suitable  for  children  aged  3-9  years  but  suggest  that  there  may  not  be  a  marked difference between the two.

The HI data against H1N1v suggest a very robust immune response to a single adult dose in children aged 3-9 years. The data in this age group after a single half adult dose has also been provided during the procedure and also provided a sufficient immune response that exceeded the CHMP criteria.

The CHMP agrees with the MAH that it would not be appropriate based on current evidence, and taking into account the safety data reported below, to recommend the alternative of a single adult dose in children aged from 3-9 years at this time. The D21 data after a half adult dose in children aged 3-9 years from study H1N1-023 has also been provided during the procedure. In the 10-17 years age group the HI data from study 023 suggest that a single half adult dose might well be sufficient. However, the MAH considers that the benefit for a half vs. full adult dose in terms of adverse reactions is limited and therefore proposes to maintain the current recommendation for a single full adult dose at least until such time that more data are available (i.e. microneutralisation assay results, persistence results and heterologous immune response data). Meanwhile the MAH proposes to amend section 5.1 of the SPC to include a table that directly compares the D21 HI data from study 023 with those from study 010. The CHMP agrees with this proposal (see the Annex). In the 3-9 years age group the HI data from study 023 also suggest that a single half adult dose might be  sufficient  although  the  absence  of  additional  serological  data  as  outlined  above  limits  the confidence that can be placed in the results. Nevertheless, the data lend support to the current dose recommendation in the SPC for this age group, which was made on grounds of caution following the reactogenicity observed after the second half adult dose in children aged 6-35 months in study H1N1009 (variation II/028) and also taking into account the safety of the first adult dose in children aged 39 years reported from study 010. On these grounds, the post-dose 2 safety data from study 023 will be revealing since they may or may not confirm that reactogenicity in children aged 3-9 years is higher after the second half adult dose as was seen in children aged 6-35 months. Meanwhile, with higher GMTs after a full adult dose in study 010 vs a half adult dose in study 023 in this  age  group  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  post-dose  1  rates  of  local  reactions  were  higher  for children aged 3-5 and 6-9 years in study 010 vs study 023 and that rates of general reactions were higher  in  study  010  for  the  6-9  years  stratum.  Overall,  the  assessor  does  not  consider  that  current evidence indicates any merit in changing the dose recommendations for children aged 3-9 years. It can be agreed that the additional safety data from study 023 should replace the data relating to the H5N1 vaccine in section 4.8 of the SPC and the post-dose 1 HI data from study 023 should appear in section 5.1.

The baseline seropositivity rates in study 023 were low in children aged 3-9 years despite the fact that about half had received prior seasonal influenza vaccination. However, it cannot be ruled out that a proportion of these children could have been primed even though they had no detectable HI at D0. The submission does not provide the HI responses according to influenza vaccination history In particular the  GMTs  and  SCFs  are  required  since  the  SPRs  and  SCRs  were  anyway  at  or  near  100%.  The assessor considers that these tabulations should be provided before reaching a final opinion on this variation  in  order  to  confirm  that  the  results  at  D21  may  be  extrapolated  to  other  populations  with much lower prior exposure to seasonal vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH further provided results of D0 and D21 HI data according to history of seasonal influenza vaccination  which  confirmed  that  the  results  at  D21  may  be  extrapolated  to  other  populations  with much lower prior exposure to seasonal vaccination.

Concerning  the  MAH's  plans  to  obtain  NA  data  after  half  and  full  adult  doses  in  children,  the submission of homologous neutralising antibody (NA) response in at least one third of the subjects at each sampled time point in all paediatric studies (D-Pan-H1N1-009, D-Pan-H1N1-010, D-Pan-H1N1012 and D-Pan-H1N1-023) will be further discussed within the follow up to the respective Specific Obligation (SOB 049).

## Clinical Safety

H1N1-010 Local and systemic symptoms after the first dose of Pandemrix (H1N1) Reporting rates for local and general symptoms were lower in the youngest age group and comparable between the two older age cohorts. Most symptoms were considered to be vaccine-related. Incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) reported during the 7-day post-vaccination period (Total vaccinated cohort) The rate of Grade 3 local symptoms increased with age but there was no age-related trend for Grade 3 general symptoms. Incidence and nature of grade 3 symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) reported during the 7-day post-vaccination period (Total vaccinated cohort) Across all age groups, pain at the injection site was the most frequent reported solicited local adverse event with rates that increased with age. The highest reporting of Grade 3 pain (8.2%) was also in the 10-17 years group. The median durations of injection site pain of any grade and of Grade 3 were 3 days and 1 day, respectively. Any and Grade 3 swelling and redness were reported less frequently than pain and only swelling appeared to be more common in the oldest stratum. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  reported  incidence  of  general  solicited  symptoms  was  lower  than  for  local  symptoms.  The majority of general symptoms resolved within 1-2 days. Across all age groups, the incidence of grade 3 solicited general symptoms was low and did not exceed 4.1%. In the 3-5 years group the most frequently reported solicited general symptoms were loss of appetite, irritability and fever, each reported with an incidence of 26.4%. One subject in the 3-5 years age group reported grade 3 fever. In the 6-9 years and 10-17 years groups the pattern of general symptoms more closely resembled that in adults but rates were mostly lower, the most frequently reported general symptom being headache.

The rate of any fever decreased slightly with increasing age. The rate in the oldest stratum was higher than observed in adults but there were no fevers over 39 0 C. Only one child (in the 3-5 years group) received prophylactic antipyretic medication in this study. Local and systemic symptoms after the second dose of Pandemrix (H1N1) The MAH also provided preliminary safety data after the second adult dose administered to children aged  from  3-17  years  in  study  H1N1-010  in  the  Clinical  Summary  and  Overview  submitted  with variation II/033. The discussion that follows compares the reactogenicity of first and second doses. As  shown  in  the  table  on  the  next  page  the  rates  of solicited  local  symptoms showed  an  almost consistent  trend  for  higher  local  reactogenicity  after  the  second  dose,  the  only  exception  being swelling in the 3-5 years age group. Only pain showed a trend to be higher in older children but this may reflect the ability of older children to complain. Grade 3 pain was reported by 6.3% and 12.6% of subjects after the first and second dose, respectively. The incidence of grade 3 pain at post Dose 1 was highest in the 10-17 years age group (8.2%) and at post Dose 2 it was highest in the 6-9 years age group (14.3%). Swelling and redness were reported at lower frequencies. Incidence of redness was 24.0% post Dose 1 with 3.8% of grade 3 intensity, and 30.7% post Dose 2 with 4.0% of grade 3 intensity. Incidence of swelling was 36.1% post Dose 1 with 4.8% of grade 3 intensity and 46.2% post Dose 2 with 2.5% of grade  3  intensity.  After  the  second  dose,  the  frequency  of  swelling  tended  to  be  lower  in  younger children aged 3- 5 years (30.8%) compared to children aged 6-9 years and 10-17 years (46.4% and 54.9%).

Solicited general symptoms in children aged 3- 5 years were fever, irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, sweating,  shivering,  diarrhoea/vomiting  and  loss  of  appetite,  and  in  older  children  aged  6-17  years were fatigue, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, shivering, sweating, and fever.

The number and percentage of doses followed by solicited general symptoms within the 7 day postvaccination  period  after  the  first  and  after  the  second  vaccine  dose  are  presented  in  the  table  that follows by age category.

In children aged 3-5 years, fever was the predominant solicited general symptom (26.4% and 48.1% after  the  first  and  second  dose,  respectively),  followed  by  loss  of  appetite  (26.4%  and  40.4%), drowsiness (20.8% and 32.7%) and irritability (26.4% and 28.8%), with a trend for higher incidences after the second dose compared to incidences after the first dose. Grade 3 solicited general symptoms after the first dose were infrequent (e.g. there was only one report of Grade 3 fever). After the second dose, solicited general symptoms of Grade 3 intensity were reported at higher incidences (5.8% for irritability and loss of appetite, 3.8% for fever and drowsiness and 1.9% for shivering).

In subjects aged 6 to 17 years old, fatigue, headache and myalgia were the most frequently reported symptoms. A trend for a higher incidence of general symptoms post Dose 2 compared to post Dose 1 was also observed in this age group. In  children  aged  6-9  years,  respective  incidences  after  the  first  and  second  dose  were  43.9%  and 44.6% for headache, 36.8% and 51.8% for fatigue and 26.3% and 28.6% for myalgia. In children aged 10-17 years, incidences after the first and second dose were 49.0% and 54.9% for headache, 44.9% and 54.9% for fatigue and 35.7% and 51.6% for myalgia. The respective incidences of fever after the first and second dose were 22.8% and 33.9% in the 6-9 years age category and 17.3% and 24.2% in the 10-17 years category, which tends to be lower than in the  younger  age  category  aged  3-5  years  (26.4%  and  48.1%  after  the  first  and  second  dose, respectively). The incidence of Grade 3 solicited general symptoms after the first dose was low and did not exceed 4.1%. An overall higher incidence of Grade 3 general symptoms was noted after the second dose, with the highest frequency observed for headache (7.1%) in the group aged 6-9 years.

The data for fevers are summarised in the table and figure below, which provides estimates of any fever, 38.1-39.1 0 C and over 39.1 0 C. The figure also compares the findings to administration of two full doses of H5N1/AS03 as previously reported from study 023. These data clearly show that there is an increment in fever rates after the second dose of Pandemrix H1N1 in each age group but fever rates after the first dose are comparable across age groups whereas rates after the second dose decrease with increasing age.

In  addition,  the  table  on  the  next  page  provides  a  side  by  side  comparison  of  the  solicited  general symptom rates considered related to vaccination after each dose and by age strata. This table also demonstrates the clear trend for increases for most symptoms with the second dose. Rates  for  any  related  fever  are  lower  and  more  comparable  across  age  strata  after  the  first  dose compared to  the  second  dose,  where  there  is  a  trend  to  decreasing  fever  rates  with  increasing  age. Even in the youngest children the rate is not as high as seen in the children aged &lt;3 years after the second half adult dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No specific  clinical  pattern  of  unsolicited  AEs  could  be  identified  in  the  different  age  groups.  The most frequently reported unsolicited AE was upper respiratory tract infection. There was one case of urticaria  reported  in  a  child  in  the  6-9  years  group  but  this  does  not  seem  to  have  been  considered related  to  vaccination.  The  proportion  of  unsolicited  AEs  resulting  in  a  medically  attended  visit decreased with increasing age. Unsolicited AEs with medically attended visit (TVC) The percentage of events considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination was low (2.9% across all age groups) and there were none in the youngest age stratum.

Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were infrequent (maximum 5.7% in the 3-5 years group). Two grade 3 events considered related to vaccination were reported in one subject only (in the 6-9 years group). As shown in the tables above and below this was the child who had abdominal pain and vomiting.

Grade 3 unsolicited adverse events within the 21-day post-vaccination period (TVC)

The overall incidence of unsolicited AEs resulting in a medically attended visit was 14.3%, with more cases in the youngest age stratum 3-5 years (30.2%) than the two older strata (10.5% in 6-9 years and 8.0% in 10-17 years). No AESIs/pIMDs or SAEs were reported up to time-point D21. There have been no withdrawals due to adverse events, no SAEs and no pregnancies. Statistical analysis of selected serum biochemistry safety parameters was not available at the time of finalization of this report. However, a review of the raw data of the available serum biochemistry has been done and no safety signal was detected. Statistical analysis will be provided as soon as available. Breakdown of fevers in children aged 3-9 years The total fever rate increased in all age strata from dose 1 to dose 2. Rates of fever over 38 0 C in the age group for which an adult dose is recommended (10-17 years) showed a modest increase from dose 1 to dose 2 and only one subject had a fever 39.1 0 C after the second dose.

It  should  be  noted  that  a  single  adult  dose  is  the  standard  recommendation  for  children  aged  10-17 years and that a half adult dose is the current recommendation in the age group 3-9 years of age and that administration of a second dose is left open.

The  largest  increase  in  fevers  over  38 0 C  from  dose  1  to  dose  2  was  observed  in  the  youngest  age stratum (3-5 years) with a smaller difference for the 6-9 years group. Even here only two subjects aged 3-5 and one subject aged 6-9 years had fever over 39.1 0 C after the second dose.

## H1N1-023

## The safety data have also been summarised by age strata .

Overall,  the  reporting  rates  for  all,  local  and  general  symptoms  did  not  show  a  consistent  trend  to increase or decrease with age but rates for Grade 3 symptoms increased with age, mainly reflecting the local symptom data and higher rates of reporting pain and swelling in the oldest children (see third table below).

Numbers with unsolicited symptoms are summarised below. URTI predominated. The single reports of rash and urticaria were not considered to be vaccine-related. Only two subjects (aged 10-17 years) had a Grade 3 unsolicited symptom (upper respiratory tract infection in one).

Global Summary of unsolicited adverse events reported within the 21-day (Days 0-20) post dose 1 period (Total vaccinated cohort)

Two subjects had SAEs - a case of fracture and a case of UTI. The data from study 023 for children aged 3-5 years and aged 6-9 years have been summarised by the MAH in the table below and compared with the data in these same age groups reported with half adult doses  of  D-Pan  H5N1.  Such  comparisons  between  different  studies  must  be  viewed  with  caution. Nevertheless, almost all the comparisons of post-dose 1 data between studies suggest that the H1N1 version of the vaccine is more reactogenic than the H5N1 version and this observation applies for both the 3-5 years and 6-9 years strata.

In addition, the MAH has compared the solicited general symptoms reported after the first half adult dose in study 023 for the 10-17 years age stratum with corresponding data after a full adult dose in study 010 in the figure below. Only rates of arthralgia, fatigue and myalgia show a notable possible advantage for use of a half adult dose in this age range.

## Discussion on safety

The safety data indicate that a first adult dose of Pandemrix H1N1 results in approximately the same safety profile between children aged 10-17 years and young adults. If an authority chose to administer a second dose to this age group, as would be covered as an option by the SPC, the safety profile would not preclude this possibility. Therefore the data raise no particular concerns in this age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the children aged 3-9 years the safety profile associated with a first adult dose could be considered acceptable. However, the second dose is clearly much more reactogenic and results in much higher rates  of  fevers.  In  this  context  it  should  be  noted  that  some  of  the  spontaneous  reports  of  febrile convulsion have occurred in children aged 5-6 years. Therefore the safety profile would not preclude the  option  of  a  single  adult  dose  in  this  age  group.  However,  the  situation  that  would  apply  of  an uthority  were  to  give  a  second  dose  would  likely  raise  concerns  comparable  to  those  recently a discussed by CHMP in context of a second half adult dose in children aged 6-35 months.

he MAH further provided an analysis of fevers according to any, over 38 0 C, over 38.5 0 C and over T 39 0 C for each age stratum and after each dose during the procedure.

- o In  addition,  Annex  II  was  updated  to  reflect  the  current  status  of  SOBS  as  agreed  by  the meeting. CHMP during its January 2010 plenary
- ated the reactogenicity in children 10 to 17 years of age who received  two  doses  of  0.5  ml  of  Pandemrix  H1N1.  No  increased  reactogenicity  after  the 9.1 0 C occurred after a second dose in only one subject and since febrile onvulsions are not a feature of children aged over 10 years the CHMP considered that there is no ed to is report. Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following mation on results in 10-17 year old subjects were initially proposed within this procedure, r old subjects was splitted into one section on 10formation on half dose vs full dose immunogenicity results 'Another clinical study evalu second dose was observed.'

Changes to the Product Information The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/Annex II/ /PL attach th changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH: o Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC were updated to reflect information from study H1N1-023. o Infor but have already been included in variation II-32, including related changes in section 4.2. and 4.4. o Section 4.8 was revised to present the safety data in different age categories more clearly, and a  comparison  of  3-5  and  6-9  year  old  children  was  added.  In  addition,  information  on  the frequency of adverse events after the 2 nd (full) dose (an increase in injection site reactions and general symptoms after the second dose compared to the first dose) was included. o In  section  5.1  the  information  on  H5N1  results  was  summarised  and  the  more  detailed description of the H5N1 data was replaced with H1N1 data. A statement was included that additional data from the H5N1 studies can be found in the Product Information of Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.

ged 3-5 and 6-9 years. Overall, there seems no reason to amend the current osology for children aged 3-9 years but the CHMP agreed to add safety and HI data to the SPC as dicated in the Annex. The  data  from  study  023  after  a  half  adult  dose  and  from  study  010  after  a  full  adult  dose  have demonstrated a very robust HI response to a single dose of Pandemrix in children from 3-9 years  with an advantage for the adult dose only in terms of GMTs and hence SCFs. The safety profiles associated with the first half or full adult doses were broadly acceptable but there was some advantage for a half adult dose in children a p in nuary 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the mendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.
