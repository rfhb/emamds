1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet).

The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Product Information: sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC were updated to reflect the findings of the study submitted. The update is being reflected in the PL.

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority

B.I.a.2.a - Changes in the manufacturing process of the AS - Minor change in the manufacturing process of the AS

In a phase 2 clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone as the first¬ line therapy in patients with Stage IV metastatic squamous NSCLC, an increased rate of infections was observed early after start of treatment, which led to subsequent infectious complications such as pneumonia and/or sepsis.  A similar observation was made in a clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin versus pemetrexed and cisplatin alone as the first line therapy in patients with advanced non squamous NSCLC. Special attention should be given to patients with clinical evidence of concomitant infectious conditions including early signs of active infections.  Treatment of any infection should be initiated according to local standards.

In a phase 2 clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (106 versus 55 patients, 2:1 randomisation) as the first line therapy in patients with Stage IV metastatic squamous NSCLC, a higher rate of death, including death due to infection, was observed for the necitumumab plus paclitaxel/carboplatin arm during the first 4 months (see also section 4.4), with a later trend towards improved survival after 4 months.  The overall survival hazard ratio [HR] was 0.83 [0.55, 1.52]. The PL was amended accordingly.
