<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Individuals from 4 years of age

Qdenga should be administered as a 0.5 mL dose at a two-dose (0 and 3 months) schedule.

The need for a booster dose has not been established.

## Other paediatric population (children &lt;4 years of age)

The safety and efficacy of Qdenga in children aged less than 4 years has not yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥60 years of age. See section 4.4.

## Method of administration

After complete reconstitution of the lyophilised vaccine with the solvent, Qdenga should be administered by subcutaneous injection preferably in the upper arm in the region of deltoid.

Qdenga must not be injected intravascularly, intradermally or intramuscularly.

The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or other parenteral medicinal products.

For instructions on reconstitution of Qdenga before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

-  Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or hypersensitivity to a previous dose of Qdenga.
-  Individuals with congenital or acquired immune deficiency, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as high doses of systemic corticosteroids (e.g. 20 mg/day or 2 mg/kg body weight/day of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to vaccination, or any other medicinal product with known immunosuppressive properties including chemotherapy. The time to avoid vaccination after immunosuppressive treatment should be considered on an individual basis.
-  Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection or with asymptomatic HIV infection when accompanied by evidence of impaired immune function.
-  Pregnant women (see section 4.6).
-  Breast-feeding women (see section 4.6).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

## Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis has been reported in individuals who have received Qdenga. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of a rare anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine.

## Review of medical history

Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the individual's medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible hypersensitivity reactions which occurred after vaccination).

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination with Qdenga should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in a deferral of vaccination.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

A protective immune response with Qdenga may not be elicited in all vaccinees against all serotypes of dengue virus and may decline over time (see section 5.1). It is currently unknown whether a lack of protection could result in an increased severity of dengue. It is recommended to continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination. Individuals should seek medical care if they develop dengue symptoms or dengue warning signs.

There are no data on the use of Qdenga in subjects above 60 years of age and limited data in patients with chronic medical conditions.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Women of childbearing potential

As with other live attenuated vaccines, women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy for at least one month following vaccination (see sections 4.6 and 4.3).

## Other

Qdenga must not be administered by intravascular, intradermal or intramuscular injection.

## Excipients

Qdenga contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

Qdenga contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassiumfree'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

For patients receiving treatment with immunoglobulins or blood products containing immunoglobulins, such as blood or plasma, it is recommended to wait for at least 6 weeks, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

preferably for 3 months, following the end of treatment before administering Qdenga, in order to avoid neutralisation of the attenuated viruses contained in the vaccine.

Qdenga should not be administered to subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as high doses of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to vaccination, or any other medicinal product with known immunosuppressive properties including chemotherapy (see section 4.3). The time to avoid vaccination after immunosuppressive treatment should be considered on an individual basis.

## Use with other vaccines

If Qdenga is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites.

Qdenga may be administered concomitantly with a hepatitis A vaccine . Coadministration has been studied in adults.

Qdenga may be administered concomitantly with a yellow fever vaccine. In a clinical study involving approximately 300 adult subjects who received Qdenga concomitantly with yellow fever 17D vaccine, there was no effect on yellow fever seroprotection rate. Dengue antibody responses were decreased following concomitant administration of Qdenga and yellow fever 17D vaccine. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

Qdenga may be administered concomitantly with a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (see section 5.1).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy for at least one month following vaccination. Women who intend to become pregnant should be advised to delay vaccination (see sections 4.4 and 4.3).

## Pregnancy

Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

There is limited amount of data from the use of Qdenga in pregnant women. These data are not sufficient to conclude on the absence of potential effects of Qdenga on pregnancy, embryo-foetal development, parturition and post-natal development.

Qdenga is a live attenuated vaccine, therefore Qdenga is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Qdenga is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

Qdenga is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3).

## Fertility

Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). No specific studies have been performed on fertility in humans.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Qdenga has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported reactions in subjects 4 to 60 years of age were injection site pain (50%), headache (35%), myalgia (31%), injection site erythema (27%), malaise (24%), asthenia (20%) and fever (11%).

These adverse reactions usually occurred within 2 days after the injection, were mild to moderate in severity, had a short duration (1 to 3 days) and were less frequent after the second injection of Qdenga than after the first injection.

## Vaccine viraemia

In clinical study DEN-205, transient vaccine viraemia was observed after vaccination with Qdenga in 49% of study participants who had not been infected with dengue before and in 16% of study participants who had been infected with dengue before. Vaccine viraemia usually started in the second week after the first injection and had a mean duration of 4 days. Vaccine viraemia was associated with transient, mild to moderate symptoms, such as headache, arthralgia, myalgia and rash in some subjects that may also occur with dengue. Vaccine viraemia was rarely detected after the second dose. Dengue diagnostic tests may be positive during vaccine viraemia and cannot be used to distinguish vaccine viraemia from wild type dengue infection.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions associated with Qdenga obtained from clinical studies and post-authorisation experience are tabulated below ( Table 1 ).

The safety profile presented below is based on data generated in placebo-controlled clinical studies and post-authorisation experience.

## Paediatric population

## Paediatric data in subjects 4 to 17 years of age

Pooled safety data from clinical trials are available for 13839 children (9210 aged 4 to 11 years and 4629 aged 12 to 17 years). This includes reactogenicity data collected in 3042 children (1865 aged 4 to 11 years and 1177 aged 12 to 17 years).

Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children were largely consistent with those in adults. Adverse reactions reported more commonly in children than in adults were fever (11% versus 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (11% versus 3%), nasopharyngitis (6% versus 0.6%), pharyngotonsillitis (2% versus 0.3%), and influenza like illness (1% versus 0.1%). Adverse reactions reported less commonly in children than adults were injection site erythema (2% versus 27%), nausea (0.03% versus 0.8%) and arthralgia (0.03% versus 1%).

The following reactions were collected in 357 children below 6 years of age vaccinated with Qdenga:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreased appetite (17%), somnolence (13%) and irritability (12%).

## Paediatric data in subjects below 4 years of age, i.e. outside the age indication

Reactogenicity in subjects below 4 years of age was assessed in 78 subjects who received at least one dose of Qdenga of which 13 subjects received the indicated 2-dose regimen. Reactions reported with very common frequency were irritability (25%), fever (17%), injection site pain (17%) and loss of appetite (15%). Somnolence (8%) and injection site erythema (3%) were reported with common frequency. Injection site swelling was not observed in subjects below 4 years of age.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No cases of overdose have been reported.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX04

## Mechanism of action

Qdenga contains live attenuated dengue viruses. The primary mechanism of action of Qdenga is to replicate locally and elicit humoral and cellular immune responses against the four dengue virus serotypes.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical efficacy of Qdenga was assessed in study DEN-301, a pivotal Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study conducted across 5 countries in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama) and 3 countries in Asia (Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Philippines). A total of 20,099 children aged between 4 and 16 years were randomised (2:1 ratio) to receive Qdenga or placebo, regardless of previous dengue infection.

Efficacy was assessed using active surveillance across the entire study duration. Any subject with febrile illness (defined as fever ≥38°C on any 2 of 3 consecutive days) was required to visit the study site for dengue fever evaluation by the investigator. Subjects/guardians were reminded of this requirement at least weekly to maximise the detection of all symptomatic virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) cases. Febrile episodes were confirmed by a validated, quantitative dengue RT-PCR to detect specific dengue serotypes.

## Clinical efficacy data for subjects 4 to 16 years of age

The Vaccine Efficacy (VE) results, according to the primary endpoint (VCD fever occurring from 30 days to 12 months after the second vaccination) are shown in Table 2 . The mean age of the per protocol trial population was 9.6 years (standard deviation of 3.5 years) with 12.7% subjects in the 4-5 years, 55.2% in the 6-11 years and 32.1% in the 12-16 years age-groups. Of these, 46.5% were in Asia and 53.5% were in Latin America, 49.5% were females and 50.5% were males. The dengue serostatus at baseline (before the first injection) was assessed in all subjects by microneutralisation test (MNT50)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to allow Vaccine Efficacy (VE) assessment by baseline serostatus. The baseline dengue seronegativity rate for the overall per protocol population was 27.7%.

| Vaccine efficacy (95% CI) (%) p-value | 80.2 (73.3, 85.3) <0.001 |                      |

VE results according to the secondary endpoints, preventing hospitalisation due to VCD fever, preventing VCD fever by serostatus, by serotype and preventing severe VCD fever are shown in Table 3 . For severe VCD fever, two types of endpoints were considered: clinically severe VCD cases and VCD cases that met the 1997 WHO criteria for Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF). The criteria used in Trial DEN-301 for the assessment of VCD severity by an independent 'Dengue Case severity Adjudication Committee' (DCAC) were based on the WHO 2009 guidelines. The DCAC assessed all cases of hospitalisation due to VCD utilizing predefined criteria which included an assessment of bleeding abnormality, plasma leakage, liver function, renal function, cardiac function, the central nervous system, and shock. In Trial DEN-301 VCD cases meeting the WHO 1997 criteria for DHF were identified using a programmed algorithm, i.e., without applying medical judgment. Broadly, the criteria included presence of fever lasting 2 to 7 days, haemorrhagic tendencies, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of plasma leakage.

Additionally, VE in preventing DHF caused by any serotype was 70.0% (95% CI: 31.5%, 86.9%) and in preventing clinically severe VCD cases caused by any serotype was 70.2% (95% CI: -24.7%, 92.9%).

VE in preventing VCD was shown for all four serotypes in baseline dengue seropositive subjects. In baseline seronegative subjects, VE was shown for DENV-1 and DENV-2, but not suggested for DENV-3 and could not be shown for DENV-4 due to lower incidence of cases ( Table 4 ).

A year-by-year analysis until four and a half years after the second dose was conducted ( Table 5 ).

No clinical efficacy study has been conducted in subjects from 17 years of age. The efficacy of Qdenga in subjects from 17 years of age is inferred from the clinical efficacy in 4 to 16 years of age by bridging of immunogenicity data (see below).

## Immunogenicity

In the absence of correlates of protection for Dengue, the clinical relevance of immunogenicity data remains to be fully understood.

## Immunogenicity data for subjects 4 to 16 years of age in endemic areas

The Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) by baseline dengue serostatus in subjects 4 to 16 years of age in study DEN-301 are shown in Table 6 .

The bridging of efficacy is based on immunogenicity data and results from a non-inferiority analysis, comparing post-vaccination GMTs in the baseline dengue seronegative populations of DEN-301 and DEN-304 (Table 8) . Protection against dengue disease is expected in adults although the actual magnitude of efficacy relative to that observed in children and adolescents is unknown.

## Long-term persistence of antibodies

The long-term persistence of neutralising antibodies was shown in study DEN-301, with titres remaining well above the pre-vaccination levels for all four serotypes, up to 51 months after the first dose.

## Co-administration with HPV vaccine

In study DEN-308 involving approximately 300 subjects aged 9 to 14 years who received Qdenga concomitantly with a 9-valent HPV vaccine, there was no effect on the immune response to the HPV vaccine. The study only tested co-administration of the first doses of Qdenga and the 9-valent HPV vaccine. Non-inferiority of the Qdenga immune response, when Qdenga and the 9-valent HPV vaccine were co-administered, has not been directly assessed in the study. In the dengue seronegative study population, dengue antibody responses after co-administration were in the same range as those observed in the Phase 3 study (DEN-301) where efficacy against VCD and hospitalised VCD was shown.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with Qdenga.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single dose, local tolerance, repeated dose toxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development. In a distribution and shedding study, there was no shedding of Qdenga RNA in faeces and urine, confirming a low risk for vaccine shedding to the environment or transmission from vaccinees. A neurovirulence study shows that Qdenga is not neurotoxic.

Although no relevant hazard was identified, the relevance of the reproductive toxicity studies is limited, since rabbits are not permissive for dengue virus infection.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## Instructions for reconstitution of the vaccine with the solvent presented in vial

Qdenga is a 2-component vaccine that consists of a vial containing lyophilised vaccine and a vial containing solvent. The lyophilised vaccine must be reconstituted with solvent prior to administration.

Use only sterile syringes for reconstitution and injection of Qdenga. Qdenga should not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

To reconstitute Qdenga, use only the solvent (0.22% sodium chloride solution) supplied with the vaccine since it is free of preservatives or other anti-viral substances. Contact with preservatives, antiseptics, detergents, and other anti-viral substances is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine.

Remove the vaccine and solvent vials from the refrigerator.

Following reconstitution, the resulting solution should be clear, colourless to pale yellow, and essentially free of foreign particulates. Discard the vaccine if particulates are present and/or if it appears discoloured.

-  Remove the caps from both vials and clean the surface of stoppers on top of the vials using an alcohol wipe.
-  Attach a sterile needle to a sterile 1 mL syringe and insert the needle into the solvent vial. The recommended needle is 23G.
-  Slowly press the plunger completely down.
-  Turn the vial upside down, withdraw the entire contents of the vial and continue to pull plunger out to 0.75 mL. A bubble should be seen inside of the syringe.
-  Invert the syringe to bring the bubble back to the plunger.
-  Insert the needle of the syringe assembly into the lyophilised vaccine vial.
-  Direct the flow of the solvent toward the side of the vial while slowly depressing the plunger to reduce the chance of forming bubbles.
-  Release your finger from the plunger and, holding the assembly on a flat surface, gently swirl the vial in both directions with the needle syringe assembly attached.
-  DO NOT SHAKE. Foam and bubbles may form in the reconstituted product.
-  Let the vial and syringe assembly sit for a while until the solution becomes clear. This takes about 30-60 seconds.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reconstituted vaccine

<!-- image -->

-  Withdraw the entire volume of the reconstituted Qdenga solution with the same syringe until an air bubble appears in the syringe.
-  Remove the needle syringe assembly from the vial.
-  Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards, tap the side of the syringe to bring the air bubble to the top, discard the attached needle and replace with a new sterile needle, expel the air bubble until a small drop of the liquid forms at the top of the needle. The recommended needle is 25G 16 mm.
-  Qdenga is ready to be administered by subcutaneous injection.

Qdenga should be administered immediately after reconstitution. Chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for 2 hours at room temperature (up to 32.5°C) from the time of reconstitution of the vaccine vial. After this time period, the vaccine must be discarded. Do not return it to the refrigerator. From a microbiological point of view Qdenga should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.

## Instructions for reconstitution of the vaccine with solvent presented in pre-filled syringe

Qdenga is a 2-component vaccine that consists of a vial containing lyophilised vaccine and solvent provided in the pre-filled syringe. The lyophilised vaccine must be reconstituted with solvent prior to administration.

## Qdenga should not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

To reconstitute Qdenga, use only the solvent (0.22% sodium chloride solution) in the pre-filled syringe supplied with the vaccine since it is free of preservatives or other anti-viral substances. Contact with preservatives, antiseptics, detergents, and other anti-viral substances is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine.

Qdenga is a vaccine. It is used to help protect you or your child against dengue. Dengue is a disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Qdenga contains weakened versions of these 4 dengue virus serotypes so it cannot cause dengue disease.

Qdenga is given to adults, young people and children (from 4 years of age).

Qdenga should be used according to official recommendations.

## How the vaccine works

Qdenga stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). This helps to protect against the viruses that cause dengue if the body is exposed to these viruses in the future.

## What dengue is

Dengue is caused by a virus.

-  The virus is spread by mosquitos (Aedes mosquitos).
-  If a mosquito bites someone with dengue it can pass the virus on to the next people it bites.

Dengue is not passed directly from person to person.

Signs of dengue include fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, feeling or being sick (nausea and vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. Signs of dengue usually last for 2 to 7 days. You can also be infected with dengue virus but show no signs of illness.

Occasionally dengue can be severe enough for you or your child to have to go to hospital and in rare cases it can cause death. Severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe abdominal (belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the stomach, bleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ failure.

## 2. What you need to know before you or your child receive Qdenga

To make sure that Qdenga is suitable for you or your child, it is important to tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if any of the points below apply to you or your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse to explain.

## Do not use Qdenga if you or your child

-  are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Qdenga (listed in section 6).
-  had an allergic reaction after receiving Qdenga before. Signs of an allergic reaction may include an itchy rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face and tongue.
-  have a weak immune system (the body's natural defences). This may be due to a genetic defect or HIV infection.
-  are taking a medicine that affects the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids or chemotherapy). Your doctor will not use Qdenga until some time after you stop treatment with this medicine.
-  are pregnant or breast-feeding.

Do not use Qdenga if any of the above applies.

## Warnings and precautions

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Qdenga if you or your child:

-  have an infection with fever. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until recovery.
-  have ever had any health problems when given a vaccine. Your doctor will carefully consider the risks and benefits of vaccination.
-  have ever fainted from an injection. Dizziness, fainting, and sometimes falling, can happen (mostly in young people) following, or even before, any injection with a needle.

## Important information about the protection provided

As with any vaccine, Qdenga may not protect everybody who receives it and protection might decrease over time. You may still get dengue fever from mosquito bites, including severe dengue illness. You must continue to protect yourself or your child against mosquito bites even after vaccination with Qdenga.

After vaccination, you should consult a doctor if you or your child believe you might have a dengue infection, and develop any of the following symptoms: high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, tiredness, restlessness and blood in vomit.

## Additional protection precautions

You should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites. This includes using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and using mosquito nets.

## Younger children

Children less than 4 years of age must not receive Qdenga.

## Other medicines and Qdenga

Qdenga can be given with a hepatitis A vaccine, yellow fever vaccine or human papillomavirus vaccine at a separate injection site (another part of your body, usually the other arm) during the same visit.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are using, have recently used, or might use any other vaccines or medicines.

In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking any of the following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Medicines that affect your body's natural defences (immune system) such as high-dose corticosteroids or chemotherapy. In this case, your doctor will not use Qdenga until some time after you stop treatment. This is because Qdenga might not work as well.
-  Medicines called 'immunoglobulins' or blood products containing immunoglobulins, such as blood or plasma. In this case, your doctor will not use Qdenga until 6 weeks, and preferably not for 3 months after you stop treatment. This is because Qdenga might not work as well.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use Qdenga if you or your daughter are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you or your daughter:

-  are of child-bearing age, you must take necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for one month after Qdenga vaccination.
-  think you or your daughter may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before using Qdenga .

Qdenga should be used according to official recommendations.

## Instructions for preparing the vaccine intended for medical and healthcare professionals are included at the end of the leaflet.

## If  you or your child miss an injection of Qdenga

-  If you or your child miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed injection. It is important that you or your child follow the instructions of your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about the follow-up injection.
-  If you forget or are not able to go back at the scheduled time, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice.

If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## Other sources of information

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: https://www.ema.europa.eu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

-  As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of Qdenga.
-  Qdenga must not be mixed with other medicinal products or vaccines in the same syringe.
-  Qdenga must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances.
-  Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous injection preferably in the upper arm in the region of the deltoid. Qdenga should not be administered by intramuscular injection.
-  Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling and to manage syncopal reactions.

Instructions for reconstitution of the vaccine with the solvent presented in vial:

Qdenga is a 2-component vaccine that consists of a vial containing lyophilised vaccine and a vial containing solvent. The lyophilised vaccine must be reconstituted with solvent prior to administration.

Use only sterile syringes for reconstitution and injection of Qdenga. Qdenga should not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

To reconstitute Qdenga, use only the solvent (0.22% sodium chloride solution) supplied with the vaccine since it is free of preservatives or other anti-viral substances. Contact with preservatives, antiseptics, detergents, and other anti-viral substances is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine.

Remove the vaccine and solvent vials from the refrigerator.

Solvent vial

<!-- image -->

-  Remove the caps from both vials and clean the surface of stoppers on top of the vials using an alcohol wipe.
-  Attach a sterile needle to a sterile 1 mL syringe and insert the needle into the solvent vial. The recommended needle is 23G.
-  Slowly press the plunger completely down.
-  Turn the vial upside down, withdraw the entire contents of the vial and continue to pull plunger out to 0.75 mL. A bubble should be seen inside of the syringe.
-  Invert the syringe to bring the bubble back to the plunger.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lyophilised vaccine vial

Reconstituted vaccine

<!-- image -->

Following reconstitution, the resulting solution should be clear, colourless to pale yellow, and essentially free of foreign particulates. Discard the vaccine if particulates are present and/or if it appears discoloured.

Reconstituted vaccine

<!-- image -->

-  Withdraw the entire volume of the reconstituted Qdenga solution with the same syringe until an air bubble appears in the syringe.
-  Remove the needle syringe assembly from the vial.
-  Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards, tap the side of the syringe to bring the air bubble to the top, discard the attached needle and replace with a new sterile needle, expel the air bubble until a small drop of the liquid forms at the top of the needle. The recommended needle is 25G 16 mm.
-  Qdenga is ready to be administered by subcutaneous injection.

Qdenga should be administered immediately after reconstitution. Chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for 2 hours at room temperature (up to 32.5°C) from the time of reconstitution of the vaccine vial. After this time period, the vaccine must be discarded. Do not return it to the refrigerator. From a microbiological point of view Qdenga should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.

Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

-  Insert the needle of the syringe assembly into the lyophilised vaccine vial.
-  Direct the flow of the solvent toward the side of the vial while slowly depressing the plunger to reduce the chance of forming bubbles.
-  Release your finger from the plunger and, holding the assembly on a flat surface, gently swirl the vial in both directions with the needle syringe assembly attached.
-  DO NOT SHAKE. Foam and bubbles may form in the reconstituted product.
-  Let the vial and syringe assembly sit for a while until the solution becomes clear. This takes about 30-60 seconds.

## 1. What Qdenga is and what it is used for

Qdenga is a vaccine. It is used to help protect you or your child against dengue.  Dengue is a disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Qdenga contains weakened versions of these 4 dengue virus serotypes so it cannot cause dengue disease.

Qdenga is given to adults, young people and children (from 4 years of age).

Qdenga should be used according to official recommendations.

## How the vaccine works

Qdenga stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). This helps to protect against the viruses that cause dengue if the body is exposed to these viruses in the future.

## What dengue is

Dengue is caused by a virus.

-  The virus is spread by mosquitos (Aedes mosquitos).
-  If a mosquito bites someone with dengue it can pass the virus on to the next people it bites.

Dengue is not passed directly from person to person.

Signs of dengue include fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, feeling or being sick (nausea and vomiting), swollen glands or skin rash. Signs of dengue usually last for 2 to 7 days. You can also be infected with dengue virus but show no signs of illness.

Occasionally dengue can be severe enough for you or your child to have to go to hospital and in rare cases it can cause death. Severe dengue can give you a high fever and any of the following: severe abdominal (belly) pain, persistent sickness (vomiting), rapid breathing, severe bleeding, bleeding in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the stomach, bleeding gums, feeling tired, feeling restless, coma, having fits (seizures) and organ failure.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: https://www.ema.europa.eu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

-  As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of Qdenga.
-  Qdenga must not be mixed with other medicinal products or vaccines in the same syringe.
-  Qdenga must not be administered by intravascular injection under any circumstances.
-  Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous injection preferably in the upper arm in the region of the deltoid. Qdenga should not be administered by intramuscular injection.
-  Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury from falling and to manage syncopal reactions.

## Instructions for reconstitution of the vaccine with solvent presented in pre-filled syringe:

Qdenga is a 2-component vaccine that consists of a vial containing lyophilised vaccine and solvent provided in the pre-filled syringe. The lyophilised vaccine must be reconstituted with solvent prior to administration.

Qdenga should not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

To reconstitute Qdenga, use only the solvent (0.22% sodium chloride solution) in the pre-filled syringe supplied with the vaccine since it is free of preservatives or other anti-viral substances. Contact with preservatives, antiseptics, detergents, and other anti-viral substances is to be avoided since they may inactivate the vaccine.

Remove the vaccine vial and pre-filled syringe solvent from the refrigerator.

Lyophilised vaccine vial

<!-- image -->

-  Remove the cap from the vaccine vial and clean the surface of stopper on top of the vial using an alcohol wipe.
-  Attach a sterile needle to the pre-filled syringe and insert the needle into the vaccine vial. The recommended needle is 23G.
-  Direct the flow of the solvent toward the side of the vial while slowly depressing the plunger to reduce the chance of forming bubbles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reconstituted vaccine

<!-- image -->

Following reconstitution, the resulting solution should be clear, colourless to pale yellow, and essentially free of foreign particulates. Discard the vaccine if particulates are present and/or if it appears discoloured.

Reconstituted vaccine

<!-- image -->

-  Withdraw the entire volume of the reconstituted Qdenga solution with the same syringe until an air bubble appears in the syringe.
-  Remove the needle syringe assembly from the vial.
-  Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards, tap the side of the syringe to bring the air bubble to the top, discard the attached needle and replace with a new sterile needle, expel the air bubble until a small drop of the liquid forms at the top of the needle. The recommended needle is 25G 16 mm.
-  Qdenga is ready to be administered by subcutaneous injection.

Qdenga should be administered immediately after reconstitution. Chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for 2 hours at room temperature (up to 32.5°C) from the time of reconstitution of the vaccine vial. After this time period, the vaccine must be discarded. Do not return it to the refrigerator. From a microbiological point of view Qdenga should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.

Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

-  Release your finger from the plunger and, holding the assembly on a flat surface, gently swirl the vial in both directions with the needle syringe assembly attached.
-  DO NOT SHAKE. Foam and bubbles may form in the reconstituted product.
-  Let the vial and syringe assembly sit for a while until the solution becomes clear. This takes about 30-60 seconds.
