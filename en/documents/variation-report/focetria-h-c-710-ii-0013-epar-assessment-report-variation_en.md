## Introduction

Focetria  is  a  pandemic  H1N1v  vaccine.  The  strain  change  of  the  mock-up  vaccine  from  H5N1  to H1N1v was approved on 29/09/09 (EMEA/H/C/710/PU/05).

The  current  information  on  interaction  with  other  medicinal  products,  in  particular  regarding co-administration with non-adjuvanted subunit seasonal influenza vaccines of Focetria reflected in the product  information  was  based  on  data  from  the  mock-up  H5N1  vaccine.  The  current  pandemic  is caused by an A/H1N1 viral strain. Therefore, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) is conducting a clinical trial (study V111\\_04) to address the immunogenicity and safety of concomitant vaccination with H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines. The study was designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of 2 injections of 7.5µg HA A/H1N1 2009 in adult and elderly subjects previously exposed to 2009/10 northern hemisphere (NH) formulation of seasonal influenza vaccine and in those not yet vaccinated.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The submission of the abridged clinical report of study V111\\_04, post day 1 fulfils one of the MAH's specific obligations (SOB 27.2). The MAH applied for a variation to update the product information to include the results of this study. Clinical immunogenicity and safety Study design Study V111\\_04 is an ongoing, phase II, open label study to evaluate the immunogenicity, tolerability and  safety  of  a  MF59-adjuvanted,  inactivated  novel  swine  origin  A/H1N1  monovalent  subunit influenza virus vaccine (Focetria) in healthy subjects aged 18 years and above. The study is aimed to investigate concomitant and sequential administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine with seasonal influenza vaccines in adults aged 18-60 years and to obtain additional data in subjects above 60 years of age with history of seasonal vaccination. Two  dosages  of  pandemic  H1N1  vaccine  were  used  (half  dose  or  full  dose)  in  healthy  subjects, however  the  3.75\\_half  MF59  group  is  not  discussed  in  this  report  as  this  dose  formulation  is  not authorised. For completeness, some results are presented. The study included five groups: 1. Group Agr → Foc subjects from both the 18-60 years and ≥ 61 years age strata, had previously received  in  an  earlier  clinical  study  (V71\\_10S)  a  vaccination  with  Agrippal  (seasonal formulation for 2009/10 for the Northern Hemisphere), in June or early July 2009. 2. Group Fluad → Foc,  all  aged ≥ 65  years,  had  previously  received  in  an  earlier  clinical  study (V70\\_09S) the adjuvanted seasonal vaccine Fluad (seasonal formulation for 2009/10 for the Northern Hemisphere), all in June 2009. In study V111\\_04, which commenced in late August 2009, both groups received 2 vaccinations with Focetria 3 weeks apart. 3. Group Foc; subjects who had not been previously vaccinated with a 2009/10 seasonal vaccine and received 2 vaccinations with Focetria 3 weeks apart. 4. Group  Conc,  all  aged  18  to  60  years,  received  concomitant  vaccination  of  Focetria  in  the deltoid  muscle  of  the  non-dominant  arm  and  seasonal  Agrippal  in  the  other,  followed  by  a second vaccination with Focetria 3 weeks later.

5. Group of subjects received a half-dose of Focetria concomitantly with Agrippal. This group is not discussed or analysed in this report

Immunogenicity was assessed at baseline (before the first vaccination) and 3 weeks afterwards. Safety was assessed until 3 weeks after the first vaccination.

## Objectives

The study is designed to enable comparisons of:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 1) H1N1 responses in subjects previously exposed to the 2009/10 NH formulation of Agrippal or Fluad, and in those not yet vaccinated
- 2) H1N1 responses in subjects receiving Agrippal concomitantly with the first Focetria vaccination
- 3) Responses to the seasonal strains in subjects receiving the first vaccination with Focetria concomitantly with Agrippal (i.e., group Conc only).

The  safety  of  the  study  vaccine  was  assessed  based  on  the  number  of  subjects  exposed  and  with reported local and systemic reactions, as well as the number of subjects with reported adverse events by vaccine and age groups. Immunogenicity and safety data after the first vaccination (i.e., up to day 22) are presented in this report.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Study population The study population consisted of male and female healthy subjects aged ≥ 18 years who had not had H1N1sw influenza vaccination or documented H1N1sw influenza disease. Those with immunosuppressive conditions, including chronic use of oral or systemic steroids, were not included. Female  subjects  of  reproductive  potential,  who  must  have  used  birth  control  measures  for  at  least 2 months before study participation and committed to use birth control measures during at least the first 3 weeks after last study vaccination, were included. The  study  is  conducted  in  419  healthy  adult  subjects,  264  between  18  and  60  years  of  age  and 155 above 61 years of age. Subjects were allocated to 5 vaccine groups. The table below show the different vaccine groups and the number of subjects enrolled per group. Enrolled subjects per vaccine group The sample size per each arm was consistent with the requirements set for seasonal trials. The age of the  various  study  groups was  slightly  different, and  this could  be  expected  especially  in those  with positive history of TIV. No subjects above 80 years of age were included. The demographic and other baseline characteristics are shown below (concomitant administration is shown in bold; only adults 18-60 years of age were studied): a Agrippal  NH  2009-2010, b Focetria, c Concomitant  administration  of  Focetria  into  deltoid  muscle  of  nondominant  arm  and  Agrippal  into  deltoid  muscle  of  dominant  arm. d NA=not  applicable;  study  group  not discussed in this report. e All subjects ≥ 65 years of age.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Immunogenicity The populations analysed were the full analysis set (FAS). Nearly all enrolled subjects (96 to 100% across  vaccine  and  all  age  groups)  were  included  in  the  immunogenicity  analysis  at  day  22.  In particular, for the concomitant group 7.5\\_fullMF59, the full analysis population was 99% (N=70). The  table  below  shows  the  overall  results  for  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  for  haemagglutination inhibition (HI) against the pandemic A/H1N1 2009 strain at day 22. Geometric mean ratios (GMR), seroconversion and seroprotection are shown for the different groups (half dose not shown). The CHMP criteria (GMR &gt; 2.5, Seroconversion &gt; 40%, Seroprotection &gt; 70%) were also met for the three seasonal strains at day 22, after concomitant vaccination with 7.5\\_fullMF59, as shown below. a Agrippal NH 2009-2010, b Focetria, c Concomitant administration of Focetria into deltoid muscle of non-dominant arm and Agrippal into deltoid muscle of dominant arm.

## Adults 18-60 years of age

At baseline (day 1), across all the vaccine groups, similar proportions of subjects were seroprotected (HI ≥ 1:40,  7% to 11%) except for the TIV → 7.5\\_fullMF59 group, where 26% were seroprotected at baseline.  Baseline  geometric  mean  titres  (GMTs)  ranged  between  8.04  and  11.  Proportion  with

Across  vaccine  groups,  from  7%  to  15%  subjects  were  seroprotected  at  baseline.  Baseline  GMTs ranged between 10 and 14.

After  one  vaccination  with  7.5\\_fullMF59,  all  CHMP  criteria  were  met  against  pandemic  H1N1 antigen strain, regardless of whether subjects had been vaccinated previously with TIV, adjTIV or had not  received  the  2009/2010  seasonal  vaccination.  There  were  no  clear  or  consistent  tendencies  for higher immune responses across the immunogenicity endpoints (seroconversion, seroprotection, and GMR) in any of the vaccine groups.

## Safety

Medicinal product no longer authorised Percentages (95%CI) of adults over 60 years seroprotected after the first vaccination GMTs and GMRs (95%CI) in adults over 60 years after first vaccination

The safety analyses included 418 of the 419 enrolled subjects (264 adults aged 18-60 years and 154 adults  over  60  years:  one  enrolled  subject  was  not  exposed  to  the  vaccine).  Safety  data  is  only available up to day 22.

All  subjects  were  instructed  to  complete  a  diary  card  to  record  local  (i.e.,  ecchymosis,  erythema, induration, swelling and pain at injection site) and systemic reactions (i.e., chills, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia,  headache,  sweating,  nausea  and  fatigue),  axillary  temperature  (fever  was  defined  as  an axillary temperature ≥ 38°C), and use of analgesic/antipyretic medications on the day of vaccination (after 6 hours) and each of the 6 days following vaccination. All other adverse events (AEs) including serious AEs (SAEs) were collected up to day 22. All SAEs and AEs necessitating a physician's visit or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consultation  and/or  leading  to  withdrawal  from  the  study  will  be  collected  for  the  entire  study duration.

Other  adverse  events  were  experienced  by  between  6%  (TIV → 7.5\\_full  MF59)  and  35%  of  18  to 60 year  subjects  (3.75\\_halfMF59  +  TIV).  At  least  possibly  related  AEs  were  reported  by  between 0% (TIV → 7.5\\_full MF59) and 6% of subjects (7.5\\_full MF59 + TIV). Oropharyngeal pain was the most common adverse event overall (range, 1% to 7%) while injection site haemorrhage was the most common event that was judged at least possibly related to the study vaccine (range, 0% to 3%). Only one subject had a serious adverse event (influenza, 3.75\\_halfMF59+TIV). It onset on day 5, led to premature withdrawal from the study, and was judged as not related to the study vaccine. No other adverse event led to premature withdrawal from the study and no deaths were reported.

Adults 18 to 60 years Solicited  local  reactions  and  systemic  reactions  to  the  pandemic  vaccine  were  experienced  by 64% (TIV → 7.5\\_fullMF59 group) to 77% (7.5\\_fullMF59) of the vaccine groups (see table above). Percentages of subjects experiencing each local reaction to the pandemic and seasonal vaccines were similar,  with  the  exception  of  pain  (pain  ranged  from  39%  to  44%  after  TIV  and  from  50%  to 61% after the pandemic vaccinations). The most commonly reported local reaction was pain and, the most commonly reported systemic reactions were headache and fatigue. Local and systemic reactions were typically mild or moderate in severity and were of short duration. Severe local reactions were infrequent, with only 1% of the subjects reporting severe pain. No subject reported fever ≥ 38°C.

Arthralgia was the most common adverse event overall (range, 0% to 4%) while headache was the most common event that was judged at least possibly related to the study vaccine (range, 0% to 4%). No over 60 year subject withdrew from the study due to an adverse event. No serious adverse event and no death were reported in this age stratum.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Previous vaccination with seasonal vaccine In  those  groups  who  had  not  received  a  seasonal  (NH  2009-10  formulation)  vaccination  before entering the study, similar percentages of subjects in both age groups reported AEs (other than local and systemic reactions reported above), regardless of their assessment of relatedness, within 21 days of vaccination with Focetria. Percentages of subjects reporting AEs were very similar for the group receiving Focetria concomitantly with seasonal Agrippal (the Conc group), and the Foc group, who received Focetria alone (see table below). Those groups who had received a seasonal (NH 2009-10 formulation) vaccination previously, tended to have lower percentages of reported AEs. Across vaccination and age groups, between 2% to 6% of subjects experienced AEs judged as possibly or probably related to vaccination. a Agrippal  NH  2009-2010, b Focetria,  The  number  (N)  in  the  header  are  the  total  number  of  subjects  with  documented reactions.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Changes to the Product Information The proposed changes to sections 4.5 and 5.1 were reviewed and initially not agreed with. A revision of the wording was submitted taking into account the results of the assessment and this was agreed with by the CHMP. The PL was updated accordingly. Annex II was amended to reflect the fulfilment of specific obligations. Overall discussion and benefit risk assessment The results of study V111\\_04 up to day 22 were presented. In adults aged 18 to 60 years the immune responses to one vaccination of 7.5 µ g H1N1 antigen formulated with 100% MF59 (Focetria) met all three CHMP  criteria for the pandemic  H1N1  strain when  administered concomitantly with unadjuvanted  licensed  seasonal  influenza  vaccine  (2009/2010  season)  in  subjects  who  had  not received  a  previous  (2009/2010  season)  seasonal  influenza  vaccine.  In  addition,  the  licensed unadjuvanted seasonal vaccine met all three CHMP criteria for all three seasonal strains in previously unvaccinated adults' subjects suggesting that it can be administered concomitantly with the pandemic vaccine.  Additionally,  when  administered  alone  or  several  weeks  after  the  unadjuvanted  seasonal influenza vaccine, Focetria met all three CHMP criteria for 18 to 60 year subjects. In  adults  over  60  years  of  age,  all  three  CHMP  criteria  were  met  by  the  7.5 µ g  H1N1  antigen formulated with 100% MF59 regardless of whether it was administered alone or several weeks after the licensed adjuvanted or unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. In both age strata there was no indication that the reactogenicity profiles were affected by sequential or concomitant administration of the pandemic and seasonal vaccines. Results in adults aged 18 to 60 years indicate that Focetria may be administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine. Results in adults also indicated that previous administration of adjuvanted or  non-adjuvanted  seasonal  vaccines  and  Focetria  does  not  interfere  with  the  immune  response  to Focetria. The product information was updated to reflect these findings. a Agrippal NH 2009-2010, b Focetria, c Concomitant administration of Focetria into deltoid muscle of non-dominant arm and Agrippal into deltoid muscle of dominant arm.
