## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

London, 29 August 2007

Product Name: Arixtra EMEA/H/C/403/X/25

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

This  line  extension  pertains  exclusively  to  the  2.5  mg  strength,  where  the  Applicant  is  seeking authorisation  for  a  new  intravenous  route  of  administration  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) who are managed with thrombolytics or who initially are to receive no other form of reperfusion therapy.

The  related  application  EMEA/H/C/403/II/24,  presenting  the  results  of  the  pivotal  clinical  trials  to support the use of fondaparinux in the treatment of patients with Unstable Angina or non-ST segment elevation myocardial  infarction  (UA/NSTEMI) ACS  and  patients  with  STEMI  ACS,  has  been reviewed in parallel.  Under  the  proposed  clinical  dosing  regimen,  patients  with  ACS  will  routinely receive 2.5 mg fondaparinux once daily via the established subcutaneous route for up to 8 days. In addition,  in  patients  with  STEMI,  the  first  2.5 mg  dose  will  be  given  by  the  intravenous  route. Intravenous doses will be administered either by syringe via an existing intravenous access or as  a rapid infusion over 1 to 2 minutes via a small volume (25 or 50 ml) 0.9% saline minibag.

This  report  will  only  cover  the  new  intravenous  route  of  administration.  The  clinical  discussion pertaining  to  the  new  indication  is  reflected  in  the  assessment  report  for  the  type  II  variation (EMEA/H/C/403/II/24).

## 1.2 Quality aspects

The existing 2.5mg pre-filled syringe, as used for the approved subcutaneous route of administration, is to be used for the intravenous (i.v.) route of administration. The product is to be administered by infusion via an existing i.v. line by direct access or an isotonic sodium chloride solution (0.9%) mini bag.

Compatibility  studies  were  carried  out  in  order  to  ascertain  the  suitability  of  the  i.v.  route  of administration via mini bags. Four mini bags from three different suppliers (Perfuflex and Freeflex 50 ml  from  Fresenius  Kabi,  Bioperf  50  ml  from  Aguettant  and  Viaflex  25  ml  from  Baxter)  were evaluated. One or two syringes were injected into the bag and the compatibility studies (assay, pH, colour,  clarity  and  particulate  matter)  were  performed  over  a  period  of  48  hours  at  ambient temperature.

The  study  results  demonstrate  the  compatibility  of  the  drug  product  with  the  mini  bags  tested. Degradation products were always below their respective detection limit.

It  may be concluded that there are no compatibility problems between Arixtra solution for injection diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride, and the mini bags tested. Storing the product in mini bags over a 24 hours time period is acceptable.

## 1.3 Non-clinical aspects

To support the original indication, fondaparinux underwent a comprehensive number of non-clinical studies  which  were  submitted  as  part  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorization.  No  new  non-clinical studies were submitted for the current application.

Since the human systemic exposure is lower with 2.5 mg IV than with the already approved 7.5 mg SC no additional toxicity studies were deemed necessary in respect of systemic exposure.

Non-clinical  data  reveal  no  special  risk  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.

The previously submitted toxicological program sufficiently addresses the IV route and no additional data  was  considered  necessary  to  allow  toxicological  characterization  following  IV  administration. Therefore the application can be approved from a non-clinical point of view.

## 1.4 Clinical aspects

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

No new pharmacokinetic data were submitted with this application. The clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux were summarized previously in the original MAA (EMEA/H/C/403) for prophylaxis of VTE in patients  undergoing  major  orthopaedic  surgery  of  the lower limbs (MOSLL). The present application concerns intravenous administration of fondaparinux to rapidly achieve antithrombotic concentrations in patients with critical ischaemia. The pharmacokinetics following i.v. bolus and s.c. administration of fondaparinux have been characterised previously in healthy elderly subjects (Study 63106). Maximum concentrations of fondaparinux were achieved  rapidly  following  i.v.  bolus  administration  (with  a  median  Tmax  of  5  minutes,  the  first sampling time point)  compared  to  s.c.  administration  (median  Tmax  2 hours)  with  the  mean  Cmax following a 4 mg i.v. bolus dose approximately 1.8-fold higher than that observed following the 4 mg s.c. dose (0.86 mg/L vs 0.48 mg/L, respectively). Other pharmacokinetic parameters were similar for the  two routes of administration. The mean AUC(0-inf) observed following the i.v. bolus dose was 10.0 mg*h/mL compared to 9.7 mg*h/L following the s.c. dose with mean elimination half-lives of 19.2 and 20.3 hours, respectively.

In OASIS  6 (a  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  controlled  trial  comparing  the  safety  and efficacy  of  2.5mg  fondaparinux  versus  a  control  of  usual  care  (UFH  or  Placebo)  in  subjects  with STEMI), i.v. bolus administration of fondaparinux was performed using the marketed 2.5 mg syringe via existing intravenous access, using an IN stopper with male luer lock. As an alternative method of administration, fondaparinux could be administered as a rapid i.v. infusion via a 0.9% saline mini-bag. In  order  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  infusion  duration  on  the  plasma  concentration-time  profile  for fondaparinux, pharmacokinetic simulations were performed.

As shown in Figure 2, predicted maximum concentrations (Cmax) of fondaparinux were similar for i.v. infusion of 2.5 mg fondaparinux over 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 minutes relative to an i.v. bolus dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As all of these infusion rates achieve comparable predicted maximum concentrations of fondaparinux, it  becomes  clinically  more  important  to  consider  the  time  required  to  achieve  these  maximum concentrations  since  the  ultimate  goal  is  to  reach  antithrombotic  levels  as  soon  as  possible.  It  is therefore recommended  as an alternative to i.v. bolus administration, that fondaparinux be administered as a rapid infusion over 1-2 minutes via a small volume (25 or 50 ml) 0.9% saline minibag. This is reflected in section 4.2 of the SPC.

## Pharmacodynamics

No new data was submitted nor was it considered necessary.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical development program for fondaparinux in ACS included a total of 34,071 subjects who participated in 6 clinical studies. Four were phase II studies (PENTUA, PENTALYSE, ASPIRE and ACT 2445) and two were phase III studies (OASIS 5, conducted in unstable angina (UA) and non STsegment  elevation  myocardial  infarction  (NSTEMI)  and  OASIS  6  in  patients  with  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients).

UHF unfractionated heparin

PENTUA and PENTALYSE provided some evidence on which dose to select for further investigation in  phase  III.  The  other  phase  II  studies, ASPIRE and ACT2445 provided  data  primarily  on  the tolerability of an i.v. bolus of fondaparinux administered during coronary interventions (PTCA/PCI) and are discussed below in detail.

The  two  main  phase  III  trials  ( OASIS  5 and OASIS 6)  were  conducted  in  a  total  of  over  32,000 patients. These studies are pivotal in providing the data to support the registration of fondaparinux for patients diagnosed with ACS and are discussed in the context of variation II/24.

## Study ACT2445:

The ACT2445 was an open-label, uncontrolled study to assess the efficacy and safety of a single i.v. bolus injection of fondaparinux 12 mg administered prior to PTCA. The study enrolled male and postmenopausal females who had a history of stable or unstable  angina,  or  of  MI  who  had  stenosis  of ≥ 70% in at least one coronary artery selected for balloon angioplasty. Subjects with either an MI or UA symptoms within the previous 7 days were excluded. Seventy-one subjects were included in the study,  but  ten  subjects  had  a  stent  implanted  shortly  after  PTCA  and  received  ticlopidine.  These subjects were excluded from the per-protocol (PP) population.

The  primary  end  point  was  the  occurrence  of  abrupt  vessel  closure  (AVC)  during  or  after  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

procedure as assessed by coronary angiography at 24 hours post-PTCA. The duration of AVC should be  at  least  10  minutes  and  not  relieved  by  intracoronary  or  sublingual  nitroglycerin  and  associated with ischemic pain and ECG changes. Success of treatment was defined as the Bayesian probability point  of  95%  (P)  that  the  AVC  rate  (x)  was  less  than  10%.  [P  (x  &lt;  0.10)  =  0.971  if  2  AVC  in  60 evaluable subjects.

## Results

Two of the 61 evaluable subjects experienced the primary end point (AVC), giving a percentage of closure of 3.28% [0.04%, 11.35%], which was less than the preset 10% criteria for efficacy. The rate of AVC observed was within the range of previously reported rates with heparin. There were two nonfatal SAEs, both haemorrhagic events (hematoma and cerebral hemorrhage). Hemorrhagic events were reported in 17 subjects (23.9%), the majority of which were haematomas at the arterial injection site. The results from this pilot study were further evaluated in ASPIRE .

## ASPIRE :

ASPIRE was  a  randomised  blinded  pilot  trial  of  fondaparinux  versus  UFH  in  addition  to  standard therapy in a broad range of patients undergoing PCI. The objectives were to obtain experience in the use of fondaparinux as the primary anticoagulation strategy during PCI by evaluating the safety and efficacy of two dosages of fondaparinux compared with UFH. Two dosages of fondaparinux (2.5 mg and 5 mg i.v.) were used with UFH as the comparator. Randomisation was stratified by use of i.v. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. A single i.v. dose of investigational product was administered after randomisation and prior to the PCI procedure.

The study recruited 350 subjects scheduled for PCI at 22 centers in 3 countries. Subjects with active or potential  bleeding  complications  or  undergoing  thrombolysis  for  STEMI  within  previous  24  hours were excluded. There were 118 subjects randomized to fondaparinux 2.5 mg, 115 to 5 mg and 117 to UFH, Fiftyeight percent of subjects received GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Treatment was administered by an independent unblinded coordinator.

The primary efficacy outcome was the first occurrence of any component of the composite of all-cause death,  re-MI,  urgent  revascularization,  or  need  for  bailout  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitor  within  48  hours  of randomization.  The  primary  safety  outcome  was  major  or  minor  bleeding  within  48 hours  of randomization.

The sample size was based on the estimated event rate for the composite of major and minor bleeding in the UFH group. The estimated rate expected for the UFH group was 3%, which would provide 80% power to show a difference if the hazard ratio  between  the  combined  fondaparinux  groups  and  the UFH group was 4.8.

## Results

There was no statistically significant difference between the combined fondaparinux group (6.0%) and the UFH group (6.0%) in reducing the composite endpoint in subjects undergoing PCI (HR 1.02; 95% CI [0.41, 2.54]; p=0.97). The incidence of events was higher in the fondaparinux 5 mg group (7.8%) than in the fondaparinux 2.5 mg group (4.2%) and UFH group (6.0%).

## Clinical safety

In ASPIRE , there were no significant differences in the incidence of major or minor bleedings between the  combined  fondaparinux  group  (6.4%)  and  the  UFH  group  (7.7%),  (HR  0.81,  95%  CI  [0.352, 1.840], p=0.61). The majority of the bleeding events in both the fondaparinux and UFH groups were minor  and  occurred  mainly  within  the  initial  48  hours  of  randomization  in  subjects  receiving concomitant  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitors.  There  were  only  four  major  bleeding  events  in  fondaparinux subjects; all in subjects receiving concomitant GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

There was a non-significant trend towards a lower rate of bleeding in the fondaparinux 2.5 mg group (3.4%) compared with the higher fondaparinux 5 mg group (9.6%). There were two cardiovascularrelated deaths, both in the fondaparinux 5 mg group; only one of these deaths occurred on-therapy. The incidence of SAEs to Day 30 was low and similar across the treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The profile and incidence of AEs to Day 2 was similar across the treatment groups (fondaparinux 2.5 mg 31%, fondaparinux 5 mg 34% and UFH, 27% subjects. The most frequently reported AEs were puncture  site  haemorrhage,  and  angina  pectoris  With  the  exception  of  puncture  site  haemorrhage (fondaparinux 2.5 mg 3%, fondaparinux 5 mg 8% and UFH, 7% subjects), no other AE was reported by more than 5% subjects in any treatment group.

In the uncontrolled ACT2445 , there were only three subjects with bleeding events on i.v. fondaparinux. All three bleeding events were at the sheath site and did not require any transfusions.

Nineteen subjects (26.8%) reported at least one AE. Most of the AEs reported were platelet bleeding and clotting disorders (13 subjects, 18.3%); predominantly haematomas (13 subjects, 18.3%) and one cerebral haemorrhage. Most of the haematomas were at the arterial injection site and were judges as mild.

## Laboratory findings

There were no reports of thrombocytopenia in PENTALYSE and ACT2445 , only one in the PENTUA study and three in ASPIRE in the fondaparinux 2.5 mg group and one report in the UFH group.

## 1.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

According to the MAH, the two pivotal trials ( OASIS 5 and OASIS 6 ), have shown that fondaparinux is either as effective as, or superior to, current standard therapy in UA/NSTEMI and STEMI subjects. Importantly,  in  both  studies  fondaparinux  was  associated  with  a  clinically  relevant  and  statistically significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  all  cause  mortality.  Other  than  in  STEMI  subjects  undergoing primary  PCI,  the  relative  efficacy  of  fondaparinux  to  control  was  seen  across  a  range  of  key  subgroups indicating the applicability of these data to a broad range of subjects with ACS.

The MAH also claims that fondaparinux 2.5 mg was well tolerated in subjects with UA/NSTEMI and STEMI. Fondaparinux was generally associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared to enoxaparin ( OASIS 5 ) or control ( OASIS 6 ). Further, fondaparinux had comparable or slightly lower incidences of AEs, SAEs (total and drug-related), and AEs leading to withdrawal compared to enoxaparin ( OASIS 5 ) or  control  ( OASIS 6 ).  Other  than  in  STEMI  subjects  undergoing  primary  PCI,  a  satisfactory  safety profile  of  fondaparinux  to  control  was  consistently  seen  across  a  range  of  important  subgroups, indicating the applicability of these data to a broad range of subjects with ACS. Fondaparinux was also well tolerated in phase II studies at i.v. doses up to 12 mg and results from the supporting phase II studies are broadly in alignment with the phase III studies.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  the proposed pharmacovigilance activities were adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Arixtra in the treatment of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients who are managed with thrombolytics or who initially are to receive no other  form  of  reperfusion  therapy,  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the
