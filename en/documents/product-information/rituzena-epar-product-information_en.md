<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Rituzena 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each vial contains 100 mg of rituximab. Each mL of concentrate contains 10mg of rituximab. Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody representing a glycosylated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 constant regions and murine light -chain and heavy -chain variable region sequences. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cell suspension culture and purified by affinity chromatography and ion exchange, including specific viral inactivation and removal procedures. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for solution for infusion. Clear, colourless liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rituzena is indicated in adults for the following indications: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Rituzena is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. Rituzena monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. Rituzena is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Only limited data are available on efficacy and safety for patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including Rituzena or patients refractory to previous Rituzena plus chemotherapy.

See section 5.1 for further information.

## Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis

Rituzena, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in adult patients with severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).

<!-- image -->

4.2 Posology and method of administration Rituzena should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare professional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see section 4.4). Premedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and diphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Rituzena. In patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL, premedication with glucocorticoids should be considered if Rituzena is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) or microscopic polyangiitis, methylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose of 1000 mg per day is recommended prior to the first infusion of Rituzena (the last dose of methylprednisolone may be given on the same day as the first infusion of Rituzena). This should be followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible based on clinical need) during and after Rituzena treatment. Posology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Combination therapy The recommended dose of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of previously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m 2 body surface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. Rituzena should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous administration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. Monotherapy · Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma The recommended dose of Rituzena monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m 2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. For retreatment with Rituzena monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment with Rituzena monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: 375 mg/m 2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks (see section 5.1).

Diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

Rituzena should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is 375 mg/m 2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after intravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP. Safety and efficacy of Rituzena

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

have not been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

## Dose adjustments during treatment

No dose reductions of Rituzena are recommended. When Rituzena is given in combination with chemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be applied.

Patients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). Patients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or hypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory tests and, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be restarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest X-ray findings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the previous rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the treatment should be seriously considered on a case by case basis.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Prophylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to start of therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For CLL patients whose lymphocyte counts are &gt; 25 x 10 9 /L it is recommended to administer prednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before infusion with Rituzena to decrease the rate and severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. The recommended dosage of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m 2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m 2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total. The chemotherapy should be given after Rituzena infusion. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Patients treated with Rituzena must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. The recommended dosage of Rituzena for induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total). Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis during and following Rituzena treatment, as appropriate. Special populations Elderly No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged &gt;65 years). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Rituzena in children below 18 years has not been established. No data are available. Method of administration The prepared Rituzena solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (section 4.8) usually respond to a reduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of symptoms.

## First infusion

<!-- image -->

The recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. Subsequent infusions All indications Subsequent doses of Rituzena can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by 100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. 4.3 Contraindications Contraindications for use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in section 6.1. Active, severe infections (see section 4.4). Patients in a severely immunocompromised state. Contraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in section 6.1. Active, severe infections (see section 4.4). Patients in a severely immunocompromised state. Severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease (see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) All patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. The alert card contains important safety information for patients regarding potential increased risk of infections, including PML. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Very rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following the use of rituximab. Patients must be monitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. Consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated.

If any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered.

The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not notice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. If a patient develops PML the dosing of rituximab must be permanently discontinued. Following reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, stabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML and suspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Infusion related reactions Rituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from acute hypersensitivity reactions. This set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. Severe infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use of the rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after starting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and in some cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). Severe cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by bronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This syndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute respiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or oedema, visible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours of initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumour infiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with increased caution. Patients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion interrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients should be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or ruled out. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients with a high tumour burden or with a high number ( ≥ 25 x 10 9 /L) of circulating malignant cells such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release syndrome, should only be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored throughout the first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for the first infusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any subsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is still &gt;25 x 10 9 /L.

Infusion related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in 10 % of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic, and, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine release syndrome above for severe reactions.

<!-- image -->

Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous administration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity reactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should   be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of rituximab. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of the cytokine release syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been reported less frequently than those attributed to cytokine release. Additional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary oedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion. Cardiac disorders Angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or myocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore, patients with a history of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. Haematological toxicities Although rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with neutrophils &lt; 1.5 x 10 9 /L and/or platelet counts &lt; 75 x 10 9 /L as clinical experience in this population is limited . Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable reduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. Regular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during rituximab therapy. Infections Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious infection (see section 4.8). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that rituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.

Very rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during post-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant.

## Immunisations

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been studied for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. Patients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, with non-live vaccines response rates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL who received rituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate of response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for &gt;2-fold increase in antibody titer). For CLL patients similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but that has not been investigated in clinical trials.

<!-- image -->

Mean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza A, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. Skin reactions Severe skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. Rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Methotrexate (MTX) naïve populations with rheumatoid arthritis The use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-naïve patients since a favourable benefit risk relationship has not been established. Infusion related reactions Rituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Premedication consisting of an analgesic/anti-pyretic medicinal product and an anti-histaminic medicinal product, should always be administered before each infusion of rituximab. In rheumatoid arthritis premedication with glucocorticoids should also be administered before each infusion of rituximab in order to reduce the frequency and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the post-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials were mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like headache, pruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, the proportion of patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion than following the second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with subsequent courses (see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction in rate, or interruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, and, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Closely monitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue rituximab. In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50 % reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have completely resolved. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Medicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of rituximab.

There are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) or severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been observed, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, and those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions the risk of cardiovascular complications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with rituximab and patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion.

<!-- image -->

IRRs for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis were similar to those seen for rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Cardiac disorders Angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or myocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion related reactions, above). Infections Based on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important role in maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following rituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8).Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely immunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious infection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin levels are determined prior to initiating treatment with rituximab. Patients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of rituximab treatment, patients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. Very rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported following use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. Hepatitis B Infections Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. Late neutropenia Measure blood neutrophils prior to each course of rituximab, and regularly up to 6-months after cessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Skin reactions

Severe skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunisation

Physicians should review the patient's vaccination status and follow current immunisation guidelines prior to rituximab therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first administration of rituximab.

<!-- image -->

Patients with human anti-mouse antibody or human anti-chimeric antibody (HAMA/HACA) titres may have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. Therefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on rituximab or whilst peripherally B cell depleted. Patients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, response rates to non-live vaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), reduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal antibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after rituximab as compared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be required whilst receiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next course of rituximab. In the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the proportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, rubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. Concomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis The concomitant use of rituximab and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the rheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. There are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other DMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). The available data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such therapies are used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely observed for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab therapy. Malignancy Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of limited experience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data do not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the development of solid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Currently, there are limited data on possible medicinal product interactions with rituximab. In CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. Co-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic DMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

rituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment with the biologic DMARD.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Contraception in males and females

Due to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following treatment with rituximab. Pregnancy IgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. B cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in clinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, however transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to mothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). For these reasons rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. Breast-feeding Whether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is excreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women should not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. Fertility Animal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects of rituximab on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, although the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that rituximab would have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) The overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL is based on data from patients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either with rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction treatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were IRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after eight doses of rituximab. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Infectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of patients during clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials in patients with CLL

The most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions were:

-  IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Infections, see section 4.4.
-  Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4.

Other serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.)

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

<!-- image -->

The frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy are summarised in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Localised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in the rituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about 4% of patients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, including grade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up to 2 years when compared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of infections reported over a 2 year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections either new, reactivated or exacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with rituximab treatment. The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem cell transplant. Examples of these serious viral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and retreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation,have been reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with

Rarely fatal cases reported 5  signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of rituximab therapy 6  observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated with infusion-related reactions 7 includes fatal cases The following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, were reported at a similar or lower incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control arms: haematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, pyrexia. Description of selected adverse reactions Signs and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% of patients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the first one to two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related reactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary oedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions such as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower or unknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially with subsequent infusions and is &lt;1% of patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab-containing treatment. Infections Rituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients.

cytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 hepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs 0% FC. Progression of Kaposi's sarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with preexisting Kaposi's sarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority of patients were HIV positive.

## Haematologic adverse reactions

Cardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of patients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade 3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during infusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders was  comparable  between  patients  treated  with  rituximab  and  observation.  Cardiac  events  were reported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular failure,  myocardial  ischaemia)  in  3%  of  patients  treated  with  rituximab  compared  to  &lt;1%  on observation.  In  studies  evaluating  rituximab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  the  incidence  of grade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia and atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the CHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab infusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial infarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP and CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart failure,  myocardial  disease  and  manifestations  of  coronary  artery  disease.  In  CLL,  the  overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC).

In clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities occurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) neutropenia was reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. During rituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and neutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to observation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (&lt;1% , grade 3/4) and was not different between treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), neutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in previously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were usually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the higher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not associated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established that in up to 25% of patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil count remaining below 1x10 9 /L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late onset (defined as neutrophil count below 1x10 9 /L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with no previous prolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with rituximab plus FC. There were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of late neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. In the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade ¾ thrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in the FC group. In studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in serum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with hyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least baseline level within 4 months. Cardiovascular adverse reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.

## Neurologic disorders

During the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight cycles), four patients (2 %) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced thromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference between the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three patients (1.5 %) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the follow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% FC).

Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients' underlying disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. Gastrointestinal disorders Gastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving rituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was administered with chemotherapy. IgG levels In the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (&lt;7 g/L) after induction treatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG level subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The proportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group throughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after 2 years). A small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term immunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric patients are unknown. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported very rarely. Patient subpopulations - rituximab monotherapy Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years): The incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3 /4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared to younger patients (&lt;65 years). Bulky disease There was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients without bulky disease (25.6 % vs. 15.4 %). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these two groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Re-treatment

The percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was similar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 ADRs).

Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years)

The incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients compared to younger patients (&lt;65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL.

The overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. The safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is summarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3,100 patients received at least one treatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; approximately 2,400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1,000 having received 5 or more courses. The safety information collected during post-marketing experience reflects the expected adverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). Patients received 2 x 1,000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to methotrexate (10-25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion of 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Frequencies are defined as very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) and very rare (&lt;1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab were IRRs. The overall incidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent infusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during the initial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like reaction have been reported during post marketing experience.

## Multiple courses

Multiple courses of treatment are associated with a similar ADR profile to that observed following first exposure. The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first 6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the first treatment course), RA exacerbation and infections all of which were more frequent in the first 6 months of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infusion-related reactions

The most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs. Among the 3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1,135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR with 733/3,189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to rituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than 1% (17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no deaths due to IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events, and of IRRs leading to withdrawal decreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with intravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the postmarketing setting.

In a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious IRR during or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic therapy for RA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent with that observed historically. No serious IRRs were observed. Infections The overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated patients. The infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious or required IV antibiotics, was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections did not show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control arms. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported following use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid arthritis and off-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. In patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Reactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving rituximab (see section 4.4). Cardiovascular adverse reactions Serious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated patients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients experiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. Neurologic events Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients' underlying disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy.

## Neutropenia

Events of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the administration of rituximab (see section 4.4).

In placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.27% (2/731) of placebo-treated patients developed severe neutropenia.

Neutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported in the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported very rarely.

Laboratory abnormalities Hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA patients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections after the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). A small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term immunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric patients are unknown. Summary of the Safety Profile (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis) In the clinical trial in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangitis, 99 patients were treated with rituximab (375 mg/m 2 , once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). Tabulated list of adverse reactions The ADRs listed in Table 3 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% in the rituximab group.

## Malignancies

Description of selected adverse drug reactions Infusion related reactions IRRs in the GPA and MPA clinical trial were defined as any adverse event occurring within 24 hours of an infusion and considered to be infusion-related by investigators in the safety population. Ninety nine patients were treated with rituximab and 12% experienced at least one IRR. All IRRs were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs included cytokine release syndrome, flushing, throat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in combination with intravenous glucocorticoids which may reduce the incidence and severity of these events. Infections In the 99 rituximab patients, the overall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years (95% CI 197-285) at the 6-month primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. The rate of serious infections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently reported serious infection in the rituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The incidence of malignancy in rituximab treated patients in the granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis clinical study was 2.00 per 100 patient years at the study common closing date (when the final patient had completed the follow-up period). On the basis of standardised incidence ratios, the incidence of malignancies appears to be similar to that previously reported in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiovascular adverse reactions

Cardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 per 100 patient years (95% CI 149-470) at the 6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious cardiac events was 2.1 per 100 patient years (95% CI 3-15). The most frequently reported events were tachycardia (4%) and atrial fibrillation (3%) (see section 4.4).

Limited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation is available from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in humans to date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m 2 ), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No additional safety signals were identified.

Neurologic events Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients' underlying disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. Hepatitis B reactivation A small number of cases of hepatitis B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the postmarketing setting. Hypogammaglobulinaemia Hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients treated with rituximab. At 6 months, in the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial, in the rituximab group, 27%, 58% and 51% of patients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline, had low IgA, IgG and IgM levels, respectively compared to 25%, 50% and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections in patients with low IgA, IgG or IgM. Neutropenia In the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial of rituximab in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, 24% of patients in the rituximab group (single course) and 23% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or greater neutropenia. Neutropenia was not associated with an observed increase in serious infection in rituximab-treated patients. The effect of multiple rituximab courses on the development of neutropenia in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients has not been studied in clinical trials. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported very rarely. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely

monitored.

In the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had no reported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with a dose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab.

5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies , ATC code: L01XC02 Rituzena is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. Rituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on &gt;95 % of all B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. CD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalize upon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can recruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fc γ receptors on the surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. Peripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. In patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, although in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-induction therapy). In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased to &lt;10 cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m 2 , and remained at that level in most patients up to the 6 month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with counts &gt;10 cells/μL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. Clinical experience in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Follicular lymphoma Monotherapy Initial treatment, weekly for 4 doses Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall response rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48 % (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% complete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to progression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was higher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% vs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was &lt; 5 cm vs. &gt; 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. 38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

duration of response &lt; 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. Neither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence or absence of bulky disease, normal or high LDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher's exact test) on response to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response rates and bone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded compared to 59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not supported by a stepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as prognostic factors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and bulky disease.

The difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant clinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were 80.9% for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1 % for patients in the CVP group ．

Initial treatment, weekly for 8 doses In a multicentre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The ORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% - 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected median TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). Initial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses In pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single lesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36 % (CI95% 21% - 51%; CR 3%, PR 33%) with a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). Re-treatment, weekly for 4 doses In a multicentre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular B cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were re-treated with 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the patients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course in the study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the ORR was 38% (CI95 % 26% - 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for responding patients of 17.8 months (range 5.4 - 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP achieved after the prior course of rituximab (12.4 months). Initial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy In an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m 2 /day on days 1 -5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m 2 in combination with CVP (RCVP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 R-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow up of patients was 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, time to treatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of patients with a tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p&lt; 0.0001 Chi-Square test) in the R-CVP group (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment with R-CVP significantly prolonged the time  to disease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months and 14.7 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was 37.7 months in the R-CVP group and was 13.5 months in the CVP group (p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Results from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy regimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferonα) have also demonstrated significant improvements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival. Key

EFS - Event Free Survival TTP - Time to progression or death PFS - Progression-Free Survival TTF - Time to Treatment Failure OS rates - survival rates at the time of the analyses Diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma In a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 years) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m 2 /day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or rituximab 375 mg/m 2 plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Rituzena was administered on the first day of the treatment cycle. The final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a median follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well balanced in baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that RCHOP treatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in the duration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse or progression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p = 0.0001). Kaplan Meier estimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm compared to 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41 %. At 24 months, estimates for overall survival were 68.2 % in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4 % in the CHOP arm. A subsequent analysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up duration of 60 months, confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), representing a risk reduction of 32 %.

The analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free survival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The complete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2 % in the R-CHOP group and 62.4 % in the CHOP

group (p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46 % and the risk of relapse by 51 %. In all patients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 microglobulin, LDH, albumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk ratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than 0.83 and 0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and low-risk patients according to age adjusted IPI.

Clinical laboratory findings Of 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of 356 patients evaluated for HACA, 1.1 % (4 patients) were positive. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia In two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m 2 , days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in combination with FC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m 2 during the first cycle one day prior to chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m 2 on day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle. Patients were excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had previously been treated with monoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to achieve a partial remission for at least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total of 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 5a and Table 5b) and 552 patients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the relapsed/refractory study (Table 6) were analysed for efficacy. In the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 months in the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of overall survival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone (p = 0.0319, log-rank test) (Table 5a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most patient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 5b).

In the relapsed/refractory study, the median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) was 30.6 months in the R-FC group and 20.6 months in the FC group (p=0.0002, log-rank test). The benefit in terms of PFS was observed in almost all patient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline. A slight but not significant improvement in overall survival was reported in the R-FC compared to the FC arm.

These studies support the use of rituximab with any chemotherapy. Data in approximately 180 patients pre-treated with rituximab have demonstrated clinical benefit (including CR) and are supportive for rituximab re-treatment.

Clinical experience in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and microscopic polyangiitis

A total of 197 patients aged 15 years or older with severely, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(75%) and microscopic polyangiitis (24%) were enrolled and treated in an active-comparator, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial.

Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral cyclophosphamide daily (2mg/kg/day) for 3-6 months or rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) once weekly for 4 weeks. All patients in the cyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy during follow-up. Patients in both arms received 1000mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose glucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 mg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of study treatment.

The primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off glucocorticoid therapy. The prespecified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was 20%. The trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete remission (CR) at 6 months (Table 7). Efficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing disease (Table 8). Table 7 Percentage of patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months (Intent-to-treat population*) -CI = confidence interval. -* Worst case imputation a Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound ( -3.2%) was higher than the pre-determined non-inferiority margin ( -20%). b The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis.

From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the rituximab group compared with four in the cyclophosphamide group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Retreatment with rituximab

Based upon investigator judgment, 15 patients received a second course of rituximab therapy for treatment of relapse of disease activity which occurred between 6 and 18 months after the first course of rituximab. The limited data from the present trial preclude any conclusions regarding the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy of subsequent courses of rituximab in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis.

Continued immunosuppressive therapy may be especially appropriate in patients at risk for relapses (i.e. with history of earlier relapses and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or patients with reconstitution of B-lymphocytes in addition to PR3-ANCA at monitoring). When remission with rituximab has been achieved, continued immunosuppressive therapy may be considered to prevent relapse. The efficacy and safety of rituximab in maintenance therapy has not been established.

Laboratory evaluations A total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients in the trial tested positive for HACA by 18 months. None of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were HACA positive at screening. The clinical relevance of HACA formation in rituximab-treated patients is unclear. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or multiple infusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied rituximab doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m 2 ), the typical population estimates of nonspecific clearance (CL1), specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and central compartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, respectively. The estimated median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, 6.1 to 52 days). Baseline CD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions contributed to some of the variability in CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion for 4  weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts or tumour lesions had a higher CL2. However, a large component of inter-individual variability remained for CL2 after correction for CD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. V1 varied by body surface area (BSA) and CHOP therapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) contributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m 2 ) and concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were relatively small. Age, gender and WHO performance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. This analysis suggests that dose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates is not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. Rituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 at weekly intervals for 4 doses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth infusion of 486 µg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of patients 3 - 6 months after completion of last treatment. Upon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly intervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive infusion, spanning from a mean of 243 µg/mL (range, 16 - 582 µg/mL) after the first infusion to 550 µg/mL (range, 171 - 1177 µg/mL) after the eighth infusion. The pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m 2 in combination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

Rituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m 2 increased to 500 mg/m 2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL patients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 µg/mL (range, 97 - 764 µg/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/ m 2 infusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 - 62 days).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rheumatoid arthritis

Following two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean terminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day (range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 L). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic clearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger volume of distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender- related pharmacokinetic differences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not required. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Developmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the foetus due to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the lymphoid organs of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied by a decrease in IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these animals within 6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation.

The pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were dose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion ranged from 157 to 171 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 µg/mL for 2 x 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 µg/mL for the2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 µg/mL for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 x 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for the 2 x 1000 mg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared to the first infusion for both doses. The pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg upon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion was 170 to 175 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 µg/mL for 2 x 1000 mg dose. Cmax following second infusion, was 207 µg/mL for the 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 µg/mL for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, following the second course, was 19 days for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. PK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the same dosage regimen (2 x 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum concentration of 369 µg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m 2 rituximab once weekly for four doses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). Rituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 L/day) and 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in these patients appear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Rituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion of B cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue.

Standard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant for this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of rituximab.

Specific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or females were observed.

<!-- image -->

4.2 Posology and method of administration Rituzena should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare professional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see section 4.4). Premedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and diphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Rituzena. In patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL, premedication with glucocorticoids should be considered if Rituzena is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) or microscopic polyangiitis, methylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose of 1000 mg per day is recommended prior to the first infusion of Rituzena (the last dose of methylprednisolone may be given on the same day as the first infusion of Rituzena). This should be followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible based on clinical need) during and after Rituzena treatment. Posology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Combination therapy The recommended dose of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of previously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m 2 body surface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. Rituzena should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous administration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. Monotherapy · Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma The recommended dose of Rituzena monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m 2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. For retreatment with Rituzena monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment with Rituzena monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: 375 mg/m 2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

have not been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

## Dose adjustments during treatment

No dose reductions of Rituzena are recommended. When Rituzena is given in combination with chemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be applied.

Patients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). Patients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or hypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma should then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory tests and, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be restarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest X-ray findings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the previous rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the treatment should be seriously considered on a case by case basis.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Prophylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to start of therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For CLL patients whose lymphocyte counts are &gt; 25 x 10 9 /L it is recommended to administer prednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before infusion with Rituzena to decrease the rate and severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. The recommended dosage of Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m 2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m 2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent cycle for 6 cycles in total. The chemotherapy should be given after Rituzena infusion. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Patients treated with Rituzena must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. The recommended dosage of Rituzena for induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total). Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis during and following Rituzena treatment, as appropriate. Special populations Elderly No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged &gt;65 years). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Rituzena in children below 18 years has not been established. No data are available. Method of administration The prepared Rituzena solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (section 4.8) usually respond to a reduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of symptoms.

## First infusion

The recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. Subsequent infusions All indications Subsequent doses of Rituzena can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by 100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. 4.3 Contraindications Contraindications for use in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in section 6.1. Active, severe infections (see section 4.4). Patients in a severely immunocompromised state. Contraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in section 6.1. Active, severe infections (see section 4.4). Patients in a severely immunocompromised state. Severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease (see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) All patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. The alert card contains important safety information for patients regarding potential increased risk of infections, including PML. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Very rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following the use of rituximab. Patients must be monitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. Consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated.

If any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered.

The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not notice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. If a patient develops PML the dosing of rituximab must be permanently discontinued. Following reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, stabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML and suspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Infusion related reactions Rituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from acute hypersensitivity reactions. This set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. Severe infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use of the rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after starting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and in some cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). Severe cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by bronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This syndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute respiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or oedema, visible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours of initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumour infiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with increased caution. Patients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion interrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients should be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or ruled out. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients with a high tumour burden or with a high number ( ≥ 25 x 10 9 /L) of circulating malignant cells such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release syndrome, should only be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored throughout the first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for the first infusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any subsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is still &gt;25 x 10 9 /L.

Infusion related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in 10 % of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic, and, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine release syndrome above for severe reactions.

Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous administration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity reactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should   be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of rituximab. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of the cytokine release syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been reported less frequently than those attributed to cytokine release. Additional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary oedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion. Cardiac disorders Angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or myocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore, patients with a history of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. Haematological toxicities Although rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with neutrophils &lt; 1.5 x 10 9 /L and/or platelet counts &lt; 75 x 10 9 /L as clinical experience in this population is limited . Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable reduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. Regular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during rituximab therapy. Infections Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious infection (see section 4.8). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that rituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.

Very rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during post-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant.

## Immunisations

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been studied for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. Patients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, with non-live vaccines response rates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL who received rituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate of response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for &gt;2-fold increase in antibody titer). For CLL patients similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but that has not been investigated in clinical trials.

Mean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza A, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. Skin reactions Severe skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. Rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Methotrexate (MTX) naïve populations with rheumatoid arthritis The use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-naïve patients since a favourable benefit risk relationship has not been established. Infusion related reactions Rituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Premedication consisting of an analgesic/anti-pyretic medicinal product and an anti-histaminic medicinal product, should always be administered before each infusion of rituximab. In rheumatoid arthritis premedication with glucocorticoids should also be administered before each infusion of rituximab in order to reduce the frequency and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the post-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials were mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like headache, pruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, the proportion of patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion than following the second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with subsequent courses (see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction in rate, or interruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, and, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Closely monitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue rituximab. In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50 % reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have completely resolved. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Medicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of rituximab.

There are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) or severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been observed, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, and those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions the risk of cardiovascular complications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with rituximab and patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion.

<!-- image -->

IRRs for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis were similar to those seen for rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials (see section 4.8). Cardiac disorders Angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or myocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion related reactions, above). Infections Based on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important role in maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following rituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8).Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely immunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious infection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin levels are determined prior to initiating treatment with rituximab. Patients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of rituximab treatment, patients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. Very rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported following use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. Hepatitis B Infections Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. Late neutropenia Measure blood neutrophils prior to each course of rituximab, and regularly up to 6-months after cessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8).

## Skin reactions

Severe skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued.

## Immunisation

Physicians should review the patient's vaccination status and follow current immunisation guidelines prior to rituximab therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first administration of rituximab.

Patients with human anti-mouse antibody or human anti-chimeric antibody (HAMA/HACA) titres may have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. Therefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on rituximab or whilst peripherally B cell depleted. Patients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, response rates to non-live vaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), reduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal antibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after rituximab as compared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be required whilst receiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next course of rituximab. In the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the proportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, rubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. Concomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis The concomitant use of rituximab and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the rheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. There are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other DMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). The available data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such therapies are used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely observed for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab therapy. Malignancy Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of limited experience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data do not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the development of solid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Currently, there are limited data on possible medicinal product interactions with rituximab. In CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. Co-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic DMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on

rituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment with the biologic DMARD.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Contraception in males and females

Breast-feeding

Infectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of patients during clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials in patients with CLL

Due to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following treatment with rituximab. Pregnancy IgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. B cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in clinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, however transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to mothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). For these reasons rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. Whether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is excreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women should not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. Fertility Animal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects of rituximab on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, although the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that rituximab would have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) The overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL is based on data from patients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either with rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction treatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were IRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after eight doses of rituximab. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions were:

-  IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Infections, see section 4.4.
-  Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4.

Other serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.)

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy are summarised in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). The ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could not be estimated, are listed under 'not known'.

Localised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in the rituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about 4% of patients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, including grade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up to 2 years when compared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of infections reported over a 2 year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections either new, reactivated or exacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with rituximab treatment. The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem cell transplant. Examples of these serious viral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and retreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation,have been reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with

Rarely fatal cases reported 5  signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of rituximab therapy 6  observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated with infusion-related reactions 7 includes fatal cases The following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, were reported at a similar or lower incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control arms: haematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, pyrexia. Description of selected adverse reactions Signs and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% of patients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the first one to two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related reactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary oedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions such as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower or unknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially with subsequent infusions and is &lt;1% of patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab-containing treatment. Infections Rituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients.

cytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 hepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs 0% FC. Progression of Kaposi's sarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with preexisting Kaposi's sarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority of patients were HIV positive.

## Haematologic adverse reactions

Cardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of patients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade 3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during infusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders was  comparable  between  patients  treated  with  rituximab  and  observation.  Cardiac  events  were reported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular failure,  myocardial  ischaemia)  in  3%  of  patients  treated  with  rituximab  compared  to  &lt;1%  on observation.  In  studies  evaluating  rituximab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  the  incidence  of grade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia and atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the CHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab infusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial infarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP and CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart failure,  myocardial  disease  and  manifestations  of  coronary  artery  disease.  In  CLL,  the  overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC).

In clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities occurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) neutropenia was reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. During rituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and neutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to observation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (&lt;1% , grade 3/4) and was not different between treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), neutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in previously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were usually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the higher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not associated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established that in up to 25% of patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil count remaining below 1x10 9 /L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late onset (defined as neutrophil count below 1x10 9 /L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with no previous prolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with rituximab plus FC. There were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of late neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. In the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade ¾ thrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in the FC group. In studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in serum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with hyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least baseline level within 4 months. Cardiovascular adverse reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.

## Neurologic disorders

During the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight cycles), four patients (2 %) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced thromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference between the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three patients (1.5 %) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the follow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% FC).

Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients' underlying disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. Gastrointestinal disorders Gastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving rituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was administered with chemotherapy. IgG levels In the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (&lt;7 g/L) after induction treatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG level subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The proportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group throughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after 2 years). A small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term immunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric patients are unknown. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported very rarely. Patient subpopulations - rituximab monotherapy Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years): The incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3 /4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared to younger patients (&lt;65 years). Bulky disease There was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients without bulky disease (25.6 % vs. 15.4 %). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these two groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Re-treatment

The percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was similar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 ADRs).

## Patient subpopulations - rituximab combination therapy

Elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years)

The incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients compared to younger patients (&lt;65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL.

The overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. The safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is summarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3,100 patients received at least one treatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; approximately 2,400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1,000 having received 5 or more courses. The safety information collected during post-marketing experience reflects the expected adverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). Patients received 2 x 1,000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to methotrexate (10-25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion of 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Frequencies are defined as very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) and very rare (&lt;1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab were IRRs. The overall incidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent infusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during the initial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like reaction have been reported during post marketing experience.

## Multiple courses

Multiple courses of treatment are associated with a similar ADR profile to that observed following first exposure. The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first 6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the first treatment course), RA exacerbation and infections all of which were more frequent in the first 6 months of treatment.

## Infusion-related reactions

The most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs. Among the 3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1,135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR with 733/3,189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to rituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than 1% (17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no deaths due to IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events, and of IRRs leading to withdrawal decreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with intravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the postmarketing setting.

In a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious IRR during or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic therapy for RA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent with that observed historically. No serious IRRs were observed. Infections The overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated patients. The infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious or required IV antibiotics, was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections did not show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control arms. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported following use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid arthritis and off-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. In patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Reactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving rituximab (see section 4.4). Cardiovascular adverse reactions Serious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated patients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients experiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. Neurologic events Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients' underlying disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy.

## Neutropenia

Events of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the administration of rituximab (see section 4.4).

In placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.27% (2/731) of placebo-treated patients developed severe neutropenia.

Neutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported in the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported very rarely.

Laboratory abnormalities Hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA patients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections after the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). A small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term immunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric patients are unknown. Summary of the Safety Profile (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis) In the clinical trial in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangitis, 99 patients were treated with rituximab (375 mg/m 2 , once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). Tabulated list of adverse reactions The ADRs listed in Table 3 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% in the rituximab group.

## Malignancies

Description of selected adverse drug reactions Infusion related reactions IRRs in the GPA and MPA clinical trial were defined as any adverse event occurring within 24 hours of an infusion and considered to be infusion-related by investigators in the safety population. Ninety nine patients were treated with rituximab and 12% experienced at least one IRR. All IRRs were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs included cytokine release syndrome, flushing, throat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in combination with intravenous glucocorticoids which may reduce the incidence and severity of these events. Infections In the 99 rituximab patients, the overall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years (95% CI 197-285) at the 6-month primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. The rate of serious infections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently reported serious infection in the rituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The incidence of malignancy in rituximab treated patients in the granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis clinical study was 2.00 per 100 patient years at the study common closing date (when the final patient had completed the follow-up period). On the basis of standardised incidence ratios, the incidence of malignancies appears to be similar to that previously reported in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiovascular adverse reactions

Cardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 per 100 patient years (95% CI 149-470) at the 6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious cardiac events was 2.1 per 100 patient years (95% CI 3-15). The most frequently reported events were tachycardia (4%) and atrial fibrillation (3%) (see section 4.4).

Limited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation is available from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in humans to date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m 2 ), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No additional safety signals were identified.

Neurologic events Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients' underlying disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. Hepatitis B reactivation A small number of cases of hepatitis B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the postmarketing setting. Hypogammaglobulinaemia Hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients treated with rituximab. At 6 months, in the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial, in the rituximab group, 27%, 58% and 51% of patients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline, had low IgA, IgG and IgM levels, respectively compared to 25%, 50% and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections in patients with low IgA, IgG or IgM. Neutropenia In the active-controlled, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial of rituximab in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, 24% of patients in the rituximab group (single course) and 23% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or greater neutropenia. Neutropenia was not associated with an observed increase in serious infection in rituximab-treated patients. The effect of multiple rituximab courses on the development of neutropenia in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients has not been studied in clinical trials. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell's Syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported very rarely. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely

monitored.

In the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had no reported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with a dose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab.

5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies , ATC code: L01XC02 Rituzena is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. Rituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on &gt;95 % of all B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. CD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalize upon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can recruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fc γ receptors on the surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. Peripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. In patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, although in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-induction therapy). In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased to &lt;10 cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m 2 , and remained at that level in most patients up to the 6 month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with counts &gt;10 cells/μL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. Clinical experience in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Follicular lymphoma Monotherapy Initial treatment, weekly for 4 doses Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall response rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48 % (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% complete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to progression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was higher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% vs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was &lt; 5 cm vs. &gt; 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. 38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

duration of response &lt; 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. Neither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence or absence of bulky disease, normal or high LDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher's exact test) on response to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response rates and bone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded compared to 59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not supported by a stepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as prognostic factors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and bulky disease.

The difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant clinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were 80.9% for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1 % for patients in the CVP group ．

Initial treatment, weekly for 8 doses In a multicentre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The ORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% - 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected median TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). Initial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses In pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single lesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36 % (CI95% 21% - 51%; CR 3%, PR 33%) with a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). Re-treatment, weekly for 4 doses In a multicentre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular B cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were re-treated with 375 mg/m 2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the patients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course in the study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the ORR was 38% (CI95 % 26% - 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for responding patients of 17.8 months (range 5.4 - 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP achieved after the prior course of rituximab (12.4 months). Initial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy In an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m 2 /day on days 1 -5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m 2 in combination with CVP (RCVP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 R-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow up of patients was 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, time to treatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of patients with a tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p&lt; 0.0001 Chi-Square test) in the R-CVP group (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment with R-CVP significantly prolonged the time  to disease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months and 14.7 months, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was 37.7 months in the R-CVP group and was 13.5 months in the CVP group (p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Results from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy regimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferonα) have also demonstrated significant improvements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival. Key

EFS - Event Free Survival TTP - Time to progression or death PFS - Progression-Free Survival TTF - Time to Treatment Failure OS rates - survival rates at the time of the analyses Diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma In a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 years) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m 2 /day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or rituximab 375 mg/m 2 plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Rituzena was administered on the first day of the treatment cycle. The final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a median follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well balanced in baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that RCHOP treatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in the duration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse or progression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p = 0.0001). Kaplan Meier estimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm compared to 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41 %. At 24 months, estimates for overall survival were 68.2 % in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4 % in the CHOP arm. A subsequent analysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up duration of 60 months, confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), representing a risk reduction of 32 %.

The analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free survival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The complete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2 % in the R-CHOP group and 62.4 % in the CHOP

group (p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46 % and the risk of relapse by 51 %. In all patients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 microglobulin, LDH, albumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk ratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than 0.83 and 0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and low-risk patients according to age adjusted IPI.

Clinical laboratory findings Of 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of 356 patients evaluated for HACA, 1.1 % (4 patients) were positive. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia In two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m 2 , days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in combination with FC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m 2 during the first cycle one day prior to chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m 2 on day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle. Patients were excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had previously been treated with monoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to achieve a partial remission for at least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total of 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 5a and Table 5b) and 552 patients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the relapsed/refractory study (Table 6) were analysed for efficacy. In the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 months in the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p &lt; 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of overall survival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone (p = 0.0319, log-rank test) (Table 5a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most patient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 5b).

In the relapsed/refractory study, the median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) was 30.6 months in the R-FC group and 20.6 months in the FC group (p=0.0002, log-rank test). The benefit in terms of PFS was observed in almost all patient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline. A slight but not significant improvement in overall survival was reported in the R-FC compared to the FC arm.

These studies support the use of rituximab with any chemotherapy. Data in approximately 180 patients pre-treated with rituximab have demonstrated clinical benefit (including CR) and are supportive for rituximab re-treatment.

Clinical experience in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and microscopic polyangiitis

A total of 197 patients aged 15 years or older with severely, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(75%) and microscopic polyangiitis (24%) were enrolled and treated in an active-comparator, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial.

Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral cyclophosphamide daily (2mg/kg/day) for 3-6 months or rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) once weekly for 4 weeks. All patients in the cyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy during follow-up. Patients in both arms received 1000mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose glucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 mg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of study treatment.

The primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off glucocorticoid therapy. The prespecified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was 20%. The trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete remission (CR) at 6 months (Table 7). Efficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing disease (Table 8). Table 7 Percentage of patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months (Intent-to-treat population*) -CI = confidence interval. -* Worst case imputation a Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound ( -3.2%) was higher than the pre-determined non-inferiority margin ( -20%). b The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis.

From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the rituximab group compared with four in the cyclophosphamide group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Retreatment with rituximab

Based upon investigator judgment, 15 patients received a second course of rituximab therapy for treatment of relapse of disease activity which occurred between 6 and 18 months after the first course of rituximab. The limited data from the present trial preclude any conclusions regarding the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy of subsequent courses of rituximab in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis.

Continued immunosuppressive therapy may be especially appropriate in patients at risk for relapses (i.e. with history of earlier relapses and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or patients with reconstitution of B-lymphocytes in addition to PR3-ANCA at monitoring). When remission with rituximab has been achieved, continued immunosuppressive therapy may be considered to prevent relapse. The efficacy and safety of rituximab in maintenance therapy has not been established.

Laboratory evaluations A total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients in the trial tested positive for HACA by 18 months. None of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were HACA positive at screening. The clinical relevance of HACA formation in rituximab-treated patients is unclear. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or multiple infusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied rituximab doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m 2 ), the typical population estimates of nonspecific clearance (CL1), specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and central compartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, respectively. The estimated median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, 6.1 to 52 days). Baseline CD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions contributed to some of the variability in CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion for 4  weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts or tumour lesions had a higher CL2. However, a large component of inter-individual variability remained for CL2 after correction for CD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. V1 varied by body surface area (BSA) and CHOP therapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) contributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m 2 ) and concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were relatively small. Age, gender and WHO performance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. This analysis suggests that dose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates is not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. Rituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 at weekly intervals for 4 doses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth infusion of 486 µg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of patients 3 - 6 months after completion of last treatment. Upon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly intervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive infusion, spanning from a mean of 243 µg/mL (range, 16 - 582 µg/mL) after the first infusion to 550 µg/mL (range, 171 - 1177 µg/mL) after the eighth infusion. The pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m 2 in combination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

Rituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m 2 increased to 500 mg/m 2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL patients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 µg/mL (range, 97 - 764 µg/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/ m 2 infusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 - 62 days).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rheumatoid arthritis

Following two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean terminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day (range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 L). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic clearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger volume of distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender- related pharmacokinetic differences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not required. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

Developmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the foetus due to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the lymphoid organs of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied by a decrease in IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these animals within 6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation.

The pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were dose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion ranged from 157 to 171 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 µg/mL for 2 x 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 µg/mL for the2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 µg/mL for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 x 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for the 2 x 1000 mg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared to the first infusion for both doses. The pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg upon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion was 170 to 175 µg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 µg/mL for 2 x 1000 mg dose. Cmax following second infusion, was 207 µg/mL for the 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 µg/mL for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, following the second course, was 19 days for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the 2 x 1000 mg dose. PK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the same dosage regimen (2 x 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum concentration of 369 µg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m 2 rituximab once weekly for four doses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). Rituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 L/day) and 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in these patients appear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Rituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion of B cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Standard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant for this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of rituximab.

Specific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or females were observed.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Rituzena 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion rituximab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

<!-- image -->

Rituzena is used for inducing remission in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. B-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions.

Read this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you. · Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. · If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. · If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet: 1. What Rituzena is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use Rituzena 3. How to use Rituzena 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Rituzena 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Rituzena is and what it is used for What Rituzena is Rituzena contains the active substance 'rituximab'. This is a type of protein called a 'monoclonal antibody'. It is designed to stick to a type of white blood cell called 'B-Lymphocyte'. When sticking to the surface of this cell, rituximab causes the cell to die. What Rituzena is used for Rituzena may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. Your doctor may prescribe Rituzena for the treatment of: a) Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma This is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects B-Lymphocytes. Rituzena can be given alone or with other medicines called 'chemotherapy'. b) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects B-lymphocytes, which originate in the bone marrow and develop in the lymph nodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. The spread of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2. What you need to know before you use Rituzena

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not take Rituzena if:

- you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- you have a severe active infection at the moment
- you have a weak immune system
- you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis.

<!-- image -->

Do not have Rituzena if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena if: · you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, Rituzena could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. Patients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection. · you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing problems. If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena. Your doctor may need to take special care during your treatment with Rituzena. If you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis also tell your doctor · if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected by Rituzena help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you are given Rituzena. Also please tell your doctor if you have had a lot of infections in the past or suffer from severe infections. · if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations for travel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Rituzena or in the months after you receive Rituzena. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines before you receive Rituzena. Children and adolescents Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are under 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of Rituzena in children and young people. Other medicines and Rituzena Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Rituzena can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Rituzena works. In particular, tell your doctor: if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other medicines 12 hours before you are given Rituzena. This is because some people have a fall in their blood pressure while they are being given Rituzena.

- if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system - such as chemotherapy or immune-suppressive medicines.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

You must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. This is because Rituzena can transfer across the placenta and may affect your baby.

If you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while using Rituzena. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with Rituzena.

Do not breast-feed while you are being treated with Rituzena. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months after your last treatment with Rituzena. This is because Rituzena may pass into breast milk.

## Infusion reactions

During or within the first 2 hours of the first infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less frequently, some patients may get pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness, tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these infusion reactions might get worse. Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you develop any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional treatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can be continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion. Your doctor may decide to stop your Rituzena treatment if these reactions are serious.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Rituzena 500 mg concentrate for solution for infusion rituximab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. Read this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you. · Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. · If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. · If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet: 7. What Rituzena is and what it is used for 8. What you need to know before you use Rituzena 9. How to use Rituzena 10. Possible side effects 11. How to store Rituzena 12. Contents of the pack and other information 7. What Rituzena is and what it is used for What Rituzena is Rituzena contains the active substance 'rituximab'. This is a type of protein called a 'monoclonal antibody'. It is designed to stick to a type of white blood cell called 'B-Lymphocyte'. When sticking to the surface of this cell, rituximab causes the cell to die. What Rituzena is used for Rituzena may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. Your doctor may prescribe Rituzena for the treatment of: d) Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma This is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects B-Lymphocytes. Rituzena can be given alone or with other medicines called 'chemotherapy'. e) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects B-lymphocytes, which originate in the bone marrow and develop in the lymph nodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. The spread of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. Rituzena in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## f) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis

Rituzena is used for inducing remission in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. B-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 8. What you need to know before you use Rituzena

## Do not take Rituzena if:

- you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other medicines 12 hours before you are given Rituzena. This is because some people have a fall in their blood pressure while they are being given Rituzena.

· you have a severe active infection at the moment · you have a weak immune system · you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis. Do not have Rituzena if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena if: · you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, Rituzena could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. Patients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection. · you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing problems. If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena. Your doctor may need to take special care during your treatment with Rituzena. If you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis also tell your doctor · if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected by Rituzena help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you are given Rituzena. Also please tell your doctor if you have had a lot of infections in the past or suffer from severe infections. · if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations for travel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Rituzena or in the months after you receive Rituzena. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines before you receive Rituzena. Children and adolescents Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are under 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of Rituzena in children and young people. Other medicines and Rituzena Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is because Rituzena can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way Rituzena works. In particular, tell your doctor: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system - such as chemotherapy or immune-suppressive medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rituzena.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

You must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. This is because Rituzena can transfer across the placenta and may affect your baby.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

If you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while using Rituzena. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with Rituzena. Do not breast-feed while you are being treated with Rituzena. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months after your last treatment with Rituzena. This is because Rituzena may pass into breast milk.

They will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any side effects. You will always be given Rituzena as a drip (intravenous infusion). Medicines given before each Rituzena administration Before you are given Rituzena, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or reduce possible side effects. How much and how often you will receive your treatment d) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma · If you are having Rituzena alone Rituzena will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks.
