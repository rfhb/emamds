## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Biogen Idec Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 11 March 2015 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|

Extension of Indication to include new indication for Tysabri

As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the SmPC are updated in order to provide physicians with more options for treating RRMS patients with high disease activity who fail an initial disease modifying therapy (DMT). Consequential changes to sections 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 and Package Leaflet in Sections 2 and 3 are also proposed.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/0252/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0252/2012 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Tysabri  is  a  selective  adhesion  molecule  inhibitor.  It  specifically  exerts  its  immunologic  effects  by targeting the α4β1 integrin receptor, which has a key role in the migration of leucocytes, most notably lymphocytes, from the peripheral blood into inflamed tissue. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the rationale for natalizumab therapy is to taper off the transmigration of mononuclear leukocytes from the bloodstream across  the  endothelium  into  inflamed  parenchymal  tissue,  included  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS) parenchyma, by specifically targeting α4β1, or very-late-activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).

Tysabri  is  currently  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing  remitting multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups:

-  Adult patients aged 18 years and over with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta interferon or glatiramer acetate.

These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'non-responder' could  also  be  defined  as  a  patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

or

-  Adult patients aged 18 years and over with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more  disabling  relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a  significant  increase  in  T2  lesion  load  as  compared  to  a previous recent MRI.

The recommended dose of Tysabri is 300 mg administered by intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks.

At the time of the initial marketing authorization application, the efficacy of Tysabri in patients with RRMS has  been  established  in  two  pivotal  controlled  studies,  one  (AFFIRM)  conducted  in  monotherapy  in patients naïve to previous disease modifying treatments (patients were excluded if they had a history of ≥ 6  months  on  interferon  or  other  prior  immunomodulatory  or  immunosuppressant  therapy)  and  the other (SENTINEL) conducted as add-on to Avonex, (patients had to be on Avonex treatment for at least one  year  and  had  to  show  active  disease  despite  this  active  treatment).  SENTINEL  was  stopped approximately one month early, on February 2008, because of two reports of PML.

In  both  studies,  Tysabri  was  associated  with  a  significant  reduction  in  the  rate  of  clinical  relapse  in sustained progression of disability and in other MRI measures of MS disease activity. The reduction in the relapse rate compared to placebo at one year was 68% in monotherapy and 53% as add on to Avonex. The decrease in the risk of disability progression, when compared to placebo over a 2-year period was 42% in monotherapy and 24% as add on to Avonex.

In EU, natalizumab is under additional monitoring because reports of serious adverse event represented by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), occurring on patients diagnosed with MS and under natalizumab treatment, increased with post-marketing experience and lengthening of patients' exposure to Tysabri. A formal request of reviewing the benefit/risk profile of Tysabri was issued by the CHMP on 22 October 2009 and the European Commission has consequently requested CHMP opinion in order to ensure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the safe use of Tysabri according to a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. By the end of this procedure on 20 January 2010, the CHMP concluded that the benefit still outweighed the risks related to Tysabri treatment, but the MAH was committed to further activities for risk minimization.

In November 2012, the application for the extension of indication in RRMS population with high disease activity  with  the  introduction  of  glatiramer  acetate  as  an  additional  example  of  treatment  failure  was endorsed  by  the  CHMP.  The  other  extension  of  indication  requested  in  November  2012  -to  Relapsing Remitting  Multiple  Sclerosis  (RRMS)  patients  without  high  disease  activity  and  negative  for  anti-JCV Antibodies - was withdrawn by the MAH in May 2013 on the basis that additional data were required and these were considered still provisional.

At  the  time  of  initial  marketing  authorization  of  Tysabri  the  only  first-line  therapies  approved  for  the treatment  of  patients  with  relapsing  MS  were  IFN-β  and  GA.  Until  a  few  years  ago,  patients  with inadequate  or  insufficient  response  to  IFN-β  and  GA  were  switched  to  natalizumab  or  fingolimod (Gilenya), which is an oral therapy administered once daily.

Newer MS drugs, dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), a twice daily oral capsule, teriflunomide (Aubagio), a once  daily  oral  tablet,  and  alemtuzumab  (Lemtrada),  administered  by  intravenous  infusions,  received positive opinions by the CHMP recommending the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for their use in RRMS population.  The  European  Commission  Decisions  on  the  Marketing  Authorisation  were  issued  in August and September 2013 for Aubagio and Lemtrada, and in January 2014 for Tecfidera.

The purpose of this variation is to extend the approved indication for Tysabri, currently restricted to nonresponders  to  IFN-β  or  GA,  to  include  patients  who  are  non-responders  to  other  first-line  diseasemodifying  treatments.  The  application  is  based  on  an  interim  clinical  study  report  with  data  from  the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP, study IMA-06-02).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which  was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The  efficacy  of  Tysabri  in  patients  with  RRMS  has  been  established  in  2  controlled  studies,  namely, Studies C-1801 and C-1802 [Polman 2006; Rudick 2006]. In both studies, Tysabri was associated with a significant reduction in sustained progression of disability; the rate of clinical relapse; and other measures of MS disease activity, such as reduction in the accumulation of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and T1 hypointense lesions.

Tysabri  is  currently  indicated  as  second-line  therapy  in  patients  with  highly  active  relapsing  remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and high disease activity or those who have failed to respond to an adequate course of beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate (GA). At the time of the initial marketing authorisation for Tysabri, the only other treatment options for patients with RRMS were beta-interferons and GA. However, more recently an increasing number of alternative DMTs have been approved in the European Union (EU) for patients with RRMS e.g. fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and teriflunomide. However, the current

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

wording  of  the  Tysabri  indication  statement  only  allows  patients  who  continue  to  have  high  disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon or GA to switch to Tysabri.

## GCP

The MAH has provided a statement that the observational study TOP is being conducted in accordance with  the  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation  guidelines,  Good  Clinical  Practice  guidelines,  local regulations, and recommendations contained in the Declaration of Helsinki.

## Study title: Tysabri® Observational Program (TOP)

TOP is  an  ongoing  multinational,  multicentre,  epidemiological  observational  study  of  patients  receiving Tysabri, with each patient to be followed for approximately 10 years. This study is designed to address the  long-term  safety  profile  and  the  long-term  effect  on  disease  activity  and  disability  progression  of Tysabri  with  marketed  use  and  to  provide  supportive  evidence,  in  the  absence  of  formal  switching studies, for the effectiveness of Tysabri for patients that have previously failed GA, beta-interferon and fingolimod. In TOP, efficacy and safety data were collected at 6-month intervals to coincide with regular clinic visits and routine clinical practice.

The submitted documents cover the analyses of data on 5623 MS patients from 391 study sites based on a  data  cut-off  of  01  May  2014.  The  highest  proportion  of  patients  was  from  Germany  (30.3%).  The median age of the study population was 37 years and the ratio of female to male patients was 2.57 to 1.0. Similar demographics were seen in subgroups of patients whose last therapy before Tysabri infusion was glatiramer acetate, beta-interferon, or fingolimod.

## Study participants

The study enrolled patients with RRMS, who were naïve to Tysabri at the initiation of Tysabri treatment and who met the criteria defined in the indication statement for prescription in their respective countries.

## Principles of enrolment into TOP were as follows:

-  Must have given written informed consent and provided all authorisations required by local law.
-  Decision to treat with Tysabri must have preceded enrolment.
-  Must have had no more than 3 Tysabri infusions prior to enrolment.

## Patient  characteristics  and  contraindications  to  treatment  with  Tysabri  in  accordance  with  prescribing information were as follows:

-  Documented diagnosis of RRMS.
-  Must have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year and must have satisfied the locally approved therapeutic indications for Tysabri.
-  Males or females whose age was within the Tysabri indication statement.
-  Must not have had a history of positive anti-natalizumab antibodies.
-  Must not have had a history of PML or other opportunistic infections, or an increased risk for such infections.
-  Must  not  have  received  concomitant  immunomodulatory  or  immunosuppressive  therapy  during therapy with Tysabri.
-  Must not have been immunocompromised at the time of enrolment.
-  Must not have been suffering from known active malignancies (patients with cutaneous basal cell carcinoma that has been completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible).
-  Must not have shown a known hypersensitivity to Tysabri or to any of the excipients.
-  Female patients must have been postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically  sterile  (does  not include  tubal  ligation),  or  willing  to  practice  effective  contraception  (as  defined  by  the  treating physician) while receiving Tysabri.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Women must not have been breastfeeding or pregnant.

## Treatments

Patients were treated with Tysabri according to the prescribing information.

## Objectives

The objectives of TOP are to evaluate the long-term safety and impact on disease activity and progression of Tysabri as a single disease-modifying agent in patients with RRMS in a clinical practice setting. The safety of Tysabri is being assessed by collecting data on the incidence of non-MS-related serious adverse events (SAEs), including all serious infections, regardless of causality. The effect of Tysabri on disability progression and disease activity is being assessed by using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and evaluating the frequency of clinical relapses.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

The primary endpoint is long-term safety (incidence and pattern of SAEs) in patients receiving Tysabri.

## Secondary Endpoints

-  MS disease activity as determined by the occurrence of clinical relapses (annualised relapse rate [ARR], distribution of the total number of relapses up to 10 years, time to first relapse, proportions of patients with and without relapse).
-  Disability progression as determined by EDSS (based on neurological examination, 'physical EDSS').
-  Evaluation  of  baseline  disease  characteristics  as  prognostic  indicators  for  disease  activity  and disability progression over time. Such baseline disease characteristics include the following:
- o EDSS
- o disease duration at Baseline
- o number of relapses during 1 and 2 years before Baseline
- o previous use of DMTs
- o age, gender, and any other characteristics available for the total population or sufficiently large  subgroups  to  be  defined  by  the  Study  Steering  Committee  as  putative  prognostic indicators to be studied
-  Evaluation of short-term (1 year) disease outcomes as prognostic indicators for disease activity and disability progression over time. Such short-term outcomes include the following:
- o EDSS progression during the first 12 months
- o occurrence of relapses during the first 12 months
- o others to be defined by the Study Steering Committee as putative prognostic indicators to be studied

## Additional Endpoint

An additional  endpoint  for  this  study  was  the  evaluation  of  anti-JC  virus  (JCV)  antibody  prevalence  in patients with MS for the duration of the study.

## Sample size

Sample size of the TOP study is not based on statistical considerations. The actual sample size is based on the data cut-off date of 01 May 2014.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

All patients enrolled in TOP receiving at least 1 dose of Tysabri were included in the evaluation of safety and efficacy.

Data were summarised by statistical characteristics (continuous data: # of observations, mean, standard deviation, median and range; categorical data: absolute and relative frequencies).

Patients'  baseline  information  was  summarised  and  included  demographics  (e.g.,  age  and  gender), disease  characteristics  (EDSS,  anti-JCV  antibody  status,  number  of  relapses,  and  MS  duration),  and medical history (immunomodulator or immunosuppressant use and duration of use). Number of Tysabri infusions received was also summarised. Safety was assessed by incidence of patients experiencing at least 1 SAE. Patterns of SAEs over time were investigated. MS disease activity was assessed by:

-  ARR
-  distribution of the total number of relapses up to 10 years
-  time to first relapse
-  proportions of patients with relapse

ARR including  its  95%  CI  was  estimated  using  a  Poisson  model  with  a  robust  covariance  matrix.  This analysis was repeated for different time intervals. In addition ARR in various subgroups was calculated. The time to first relapse was evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, with the estimated cumulative risk of relapse reported at each time point of interest.

EDSS was used to describe disease progression. Post-baseline longitudinal EDSS scores were summarised for  all  patients  and  subgroups  of  patients  with  baseline  and  post-baseline  data.  Time  to  sustained progression  and  time  to  sustained  improvement  were  both  analysed  using  Kaplan-Meier  analysis. Sustained progression was defined as an increase in EDSS, sustained for at least 24 weeks, of at least 0.5 points from a baseline EDSS score ≥ 6.0, at least 1.0 points from a baseline EDSS score of 1.0 to &lt;6.0, or at least 1.5 points from a baseline EDSS score of 0. Sustained improvement was defined as at least a 1point decrease in EDSS sustained for at least 24 weeks for patients with baseline EDSS scores ≥ 2.

The prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies in patients with MS was estimated as the number of patients with anti-JCV antibodies detected by the total number of patients with reported results. Once a patient tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies, she/he was considered positive for the remainder of the study.

An interim analysis was performed when the following milestones were achieved:

-The first 500 patients completed 1 year of observation.

-The first 1000 patients completed 1 year of observation.

Data analyses were performed on a biannual basis thereafter. The results for this clinical study report were based on a data cutoff date of 01 May 2014.

## Table 4 Summary of DMT Use Duration (years) Prior to Tysabri Infusion

<!-- image -->

## Sequence of treatments and duration of exposure (Patients ≥ 2 prior DMT)

Of  the  2539  patients  that  had  received ≥ 2  DMTs  prior  to  treatment  with  Tysabri  in  TOP,  the  most common treatment sequences  were  an  initial  treatment  with  interferon  beta  (1-a  or  1-b)  followed  by treatment  with  glatiramer  acetate  (N=535,  21%  of  patients).  The  three  most  common  treatment sequences  within  this  group  were:  (1)  initial  treatment  with  interferon  beta  1-a  (Rebif)  followed  by treatment  with  glatiramer  acetate  (Copaxone)  (N=214);  (2)  initial  treatment  with  interferon  beta  1-b (Betaferon or Betaseron or Extavia) followed by treatment with Copaxone (N=164); (3) initial treatment with  interferon  beta  1-a  (Avonex)  followed  by  treatment  with  Copaxone  (N=157).  Other  common sequences included switching between two different betainterferons before treatment with Tysabri, such as initial treatment with Avonex followed by treatment with Rebif (N=156), and switching from glatiramer acetate  to  beta-interferon,  prior  to  Tysabri  treatment  (N=191).  Though  less  common,  it  is  also noteworthy,  that  65  patients  switched  from  either  beta-interferon  or  glatiramer  acetate  to  fingolimod before treatment with Tysabri.

Although the most common treatment sequences prior to Tysabri treatment comprise an initial treatment with interferon followed by treatment with glatiramer acetate, there are many different prior treatment sequences for patients entering TOP. In some cases, patients received up to 6 or 7 DMT switches before entering  TOP  where  they  subsequently  received  Tysabri.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  number  of patients  represented  by  each  of  these  multi-DMT  treatment  sequences  is  small  and  thereby  precludes derivation of meaningful trends in benefit/risk. In fact, there are 293 patients who have unique treatment sequences in TOP.

## Update TOP efficacy data (up to 01 May 2015)

As of 01 May 2015, only a small number of patients enrolled in the TOP study had switched from dimethyl fumarate  (DMF)  or  teriflunomide  to  Tysabri  (5  and  7  patients,  respectively).  The  small  size  of  these subgroups combined with the limited length of exposure preclude meaningful efficacy analysis.

The pretreatment ARR of 1.98 (95% CI: 1.93, 2.03) in patients whose last therapy was GA decreased to 0.24 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.27) while on Tysabri therapy. In patients whose last therapy was beta interferon, the pretreatment ARR of 1.98 (95% CI: 1.94, 2.01) decreased to 0.21 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.22) while on Tysabri therapy.

Data is accumulating in TOP for patients who have switched from fingolimod to Tysabri. As of May 2015, there is adequate fingolimod to Tysabri switch data (1-3 years Tysabri treatment) related to ARR, relapse number  and  sustained  EDSS  progression  or  improvement,  discussed  forthwith  and  Figure  1  show  a summary of ARR and relapse count in patients who received fingolimod as last therapy prior to switching

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to Tysabri (n=147). For prior fingolimod patients, the mean ARR at baseline (1 year prior to the first dose of  Tysabri)  was  2.05;  it  decreased  to  0.41,  0.3  and  0.37  during  the  first,  second  and  third  years  of Tysabri treatment, respectively. During the fourth year of treatment, there was an increase in ARR to a mean  0.77,  though  the  sample  size  during  Year  4  was  considerably  smaller  (N=18),  and  precludes meaningful interpretation.

Figure 1 ARR by Tysabri Treatment Duration in Patients with Fingolimod as Last Prior Therapy

<!-- image -->

During the first  year  of  Tysabri  treatment,  80.3% (57/71)  of  patients  who  received  fingolimod  as  last therapy  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  were  relapse-free.  During  the  second  year  on  Tysabri,  85.9% (61/71) of patients were reported to be relapse-free and during the third year on Tysabri, 77.3% (17/22) of patient were reported to be relapse-free. As of May 2015, the number of patients with &gt;3 years of follow up is too small to conduct a meaningful analysis.

The probability of confirmed EDSS worsening for patients who were on fingolimod and switch to Tysabri at  year  1,  2  and  3  of  treatment  were  4.17%,  11.74%  and  15.01%  respectively.  The  probability  of confirmed EDSS improvement for patients who were on fingolimod and switch to Tysabri at year 1, 2 and 3 of treatment were 13.02%, 18.89% and 20.92% respectively. Therefore, the probability of sustained EDSS  improvement  on  Tysabri  outweighs  the  probability  of  EDSS  worsening  for  patients  in  TOP  who received fingolimod as last therapy prior to switching to Tysabri.

##  Numbers analysed

5623 subjects were included in the efficacy evaluation. All of these subjects had received at least one dose of Tysabri.

To  estimate  the  extent  to  which  extended  interval  dosing  (EID)  might  be  present  in  TOP,  the  MAH examined the treatment exposure in the subgroup who indicated not receiving Tysabri every month for the past 6 months as compared to the subgroup that indicated receiving monthly infusions. The exposure characteristics  of  the  subgroup  identified  as  receiving  Tysabri  every  month  and  subgroup  that  did  not receive Tysabri every month were highly similar, having mean (median) exposures of 29.8 (27.0) and 29.4 (27.0) infusions over total treatment durations of 29.4 (26.2) and 31.1 (28.5) months, respectively. Moreover,  the  total  person-years  of  exposure  in  the  group  that  did  not  receive  Tysabri  every  month divided by the overall total person-years of exposure is 0.390, which closely matches the proportion of subjects in this subgroup. Thus, subjects in the subgroup that did not receive Tysabri every month, as a whole,  received  a  similar  exposure  to  the  subgroup  of  patients  identified  as  receiving  Tysabri  every month. These data demonstrate most of the patients in this subgroup were not consistently  receiving Tysabri with EID (Table 6). In fact, current data suggests that only a small percentage of patients receive an EID regimen.

Table  6  Exposure  to  TYSABRI  as  of  the  end  of  the  Current  Reporting  Period  by Tysabri Received

Included patients: 1) Consent provided; 2) Criteria met; 3) &lt;=3 doses of Tysabri at enrollment.

[l]Exposure to TYsABRI was based on time from first dose to date of discontinuation/withdrawal/last visit, assuming doses

[2] Person-year Was calculated as (Total number of days exposed to Tysabri) /365.25; Total person-years is the sum of person-year over all patients.

A new CRF was implemented in November 2014 to collect information on dosing schedule (q4 weekly, q6 weekly, q8 weekly or other) and infusion dates. Since introduction of this new CRF and as of May 2015, additional data on dosing regimen and infusion dates are available for 2198 of 5770 (38.1%) patients. Of these 2198 patients, 96.8% (2127) were reported as being on a Tysabri dosing regimen of q4w while 1.0% (23), 0.3% (7) and 1.9% (41) were reported to be on a Tysabri dosing regimen of q6w, q8w, or other regimen, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that only 3.2% (71) of patients in TOP are receiving dosing other than q4w.

Only 71 patients have contributed confirmed EID data as indicated in the new CRF and the available data for these patients is limited to 7 months (from November 2014 to May 2015). In the 71 confirmed EID patients in TOP, over this limited observation period, there have been no cases of PML and 5 patients (7%) have experienced a relapse.

TOP data on EID (in relation to Abstract presented at the American Academy of Neurology in Washington (Herbert et al, 2015),The MAH claimed that there were insufficient data in either source to allow for any conclusions on the potential for EID to mitigate PML risk while maintaining the efficacy profile of Tysabri. Herbert  and  colleagues  conducted  a  retrospective  analysis  of  886  patients  from  10  large  MS  Centers across the US who received standard dose (defined as q4w± 2days with &lt; 2 consecutive missed monthly infusions) or EID of Tysabri. EID was defined as an interval ranging from 4 weeks and 3 days (q4w3d or 31 days) to 8 weeks and 5 days (q8w5d or 61 days) for ≥ 3 consecutive doses. There were no significant differences  in  annual  relapse  rate,  proportion  of  patients  with  MRI  activity,  and  NEDA  (no  evidence  of disease activity) between the standard dose (SD) and EID groups. No major unexpected adverse effects and no cases of PML were reported in the EID cohort as compared to 2 cases of PML in the standard dosing cohort. The authors concluded '1) extending the Tysabri dosing schedule to q5-8 weeks does not appear to affect the excellent efficacy profile of drug as seen by the comparison to the standard dose cohort, and 2) although the PML trend is favorable, it has not yet achieved statistical significance. If the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

zero-PML trend continues to significance, it would support the concept of a dosing 'safety zone' which is protective of MS relapse but is also non-permissive of JC Virus activation.' There are, however, several limitations in the design of this study that prevent the results from informing on the hypothesis that EID can achieve comparable efficacy while reducing PML risk.

##  Outcomes and estimation

The main objectives of this study were to determine the long-term safety and impact on disease activity and progression of Tysabri as a single disease-modifying agent in patients with RRMS in a clinical practice setting. Safety was evaluated by incidence and pattern of SAEs. For further information please refer to Section 2.5 Clinical Safety of this AR. Efficacy evaluation is documented below.

## Annualised Relapse Rate (ARR)

There was a significant reduction in ARR for patients starting on natalizumab therapy. The overall ARR decreased  from  1.99  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI]:  1.96,  2.01)  in  the  pretreatment  year  to  0.22 (95% CI:  0.21,  0.24)  while  on  natalizumab  therapy  (p &lt; 0.0001)  and  remained  stable  over  5 years (Figure 2).

ARR = annualised relapse rate; CI = confidence interval; TOP = Tysabri Observational Program.

A  significant  reduction  in  ARR  with  natalizumab  occurred regardless  of  the  number  of  prior  DMTs used, with greater reductions seen in patients who were either DMT naïve or had taken only 1 DMT prior to dosing with natalizumab. The pretreatment ARR of 2.07 (95% CI: 1.99, 2.16) in DMT-naïve patients decreased to 0.18 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.22) while on natalizumab therapy (p &lt; 0.0001). In patients who had taken 1 DMT, the pretreatment ARR of 2.00 (95% CI: 1.96, 2.04) decreased to 0.19 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.20) while on natalizumab therapy (p &lt; 0.0001). In patients who had taken &gt;1 DMT, the pretreatment ARR of 1.95 (95% CI: 1.92, 1.99) decreased to 0.27 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.29) while on natalizumab therapy (p &lt; 0.0001).

A significant reduction in ARR with natalizumab occurred regardless of the last therapy received prior to dosing with natalizumab (p &lt; 0.0001). The pretreatment ARR of 1.98 (95% CI: 1.93, 2.03) in patients whose last therapy was GA decreased to 0.24 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.27) while on natalizumab therapy. In patients  whose  last  therapy  was  beta  interferon,  the  pretreatment  ARR  of  1.98  (95%  CI:  1.94,  2.01)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreased to 0.21 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.22) while on natalizumab therapy. In patients whose last therapy was fingolimod, the pretreatment ARR of 2.06 (95% CI: 1.88, 2.26) decreased to 0.38 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.52) while on natalizumab therapy. As with the total population, the reduction in ARR remained stable over 5 years for the subgroups of patients whose last therapy prior to dosing with natalizumab was GA or beta  interferon.  For  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with  natalizumab  was  fingolimod,  the reduction  in  ARR  remained  stable  over  3  years  (given  later  market  entry)  ( Figure 3 ),  with  more variability  observed  than  in  the  other  subgroups  due  to  the  small  sample  size  (n ≤ 130).  Data  for  the fingolimod subgroup after the 3 year period are less meaningful due to the smaller sample size (n ≤ 4).

In  the  overall  study  population,  the  reduction  in  ARR  after  natalizumab  treatment  was  significant regardless of baseline EDSS score, with slightly greater reductions seen in patients with lower baseline EDSS scores. In patients with an EDSS score of &lt;3, the pretreatment ARR decreased from 2.00 (95% CI: 1.96, 2.05) to 0.18 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.20) while on natalizumab therapy (p&lt;0.0001). In patients with a baseline EDSS score of ≥ 3,  the  pretreatment ARR decreased from 1.97 (95% CI: 1.94, 2.01) to 0.25 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.27) while on natalizumab therapy (p &lt; 0.0001).

For  the  group  of  patients  who  received  interferon  as  the  last  therapy  before  switching  to  Tysabri (N=695), the mean ARR during the baseline period was 1.99. After initiation of Tysabri, the ARR dropped dramatically and remained constant at 0.19 over the first 3 years of treatment with Tysabri, then dropped slightly to 0.15 in the fourth year (month 36 to 48).

For  the  group  of  patients  who  received  Copaxone  as  the  last  therapy  before  switching  to  Tysabri (N=252), the mean ARR during the baseline period was 2.09. After initiation of Tysabri, the ARR dropped significantly after the first 12 months of treatment to 0.22, and remained low over 4 years of treatment, ranging from 0.19 to 0.25.

For the group of patients who received fingolimod as the last therapy before switching to Tysabri (N=71), the mean ARR during the baseline period was 2.27. After 12 months of treatment with Tysabri the ARR dropped to 0.23. The available data is limited to 12 months of fingolimod exposure prior to Tysabri. For

Given  the  limitations  of  sample  size  and  subject-years  followed,  the  interpretation  of  these  findings  is limited.

## EDSS

Mean EDSS scores were similar from Baseline (3.5) to Year 5 (3.2) in patients treated with natalizumab. Similar  results  were  seen  for  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with natalizumab was GA or beta interferon. For the fingolimod subgroup, mean EDSS scores were also similar from Baseline to Year 2 ( Figure 4 ).  Data  for  the  fingolimod  subgroup  after  the  2  year  period  are  less meaningful due to the smaller sample size (n ≤ 4).

For  the  fingolimod  subgroup,  mean  EDSS  scores  were  also  similar  from  Baseline  to  Year  2  (see Figure 5 ).  Data  for  the  fingolimod  subgroup  after  the  2  year  period  are  less  meaningful  due  to  the smaller sample size (n ≤ 4).

## Time to Sustained EDSS Progression and Improvement

The  time  to  sustained  progression  and  time  to  sustained  improvement  based  on  EDSS  scores  were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The cumulative probabilities of sustained progression or improvement were estimated for multiple time points. At all time points, the cumulative probability of sustained improvement was higher than the cumulative probability of sustained progression (30.34% and 19.70%, respectively, at 5.5 years).

Similarly, the cumulative probability of sustained improvement was higher than the cumulative probability of  sustained  progression  at  all  time  points  for  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to dosing with natalizumab was GA, beta interferon,  or fingolimod. For the GA subgroup, the cumulative probabilities  of  sustained  improvement  or  progression  at  5.5  years  were  31.43%  and  15.87%, respectively. For the beta interferon subgroup, the cumulative probabilities of sustained improvement or progression  at  5.5  years  were  29.43%  and  21.44%,  respectively.  For  the  fingolimod  subgroup,  the cumulative probabilities of sustained improvement or progression at 24 months were 23.02% and 5.53%, respectively.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Study IMA-06-02 (TOP) is an observational study of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)  receiving  natalizumab  as  a  single  disease-modifying  agent  in  a  clinical  practice  setting,  with patients followed for approximately 10 years. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety profile  of  natalizumab  and  the  long-term  effect  of  natalizumab  on  disease  activity  and  disability progression  in  clinical  practice  for  patients  have  previously  failed  GA,  beta-interferon  and  fingolimod. Eligible patients had a documented diagnosis of RRMS, with at least 1 relapse in the previous year, and were naïve to natalizumab at the initiation of natalizumab treatment (must not have had &gt;3 natalizumab infusions prior to enrolment).

5623  MS  patients  from  391  study  sites  were  analysed  based  on  a  data  cut-off  of  01  May  2014.  The highest proportion of patients was from Germany (30.3%). The median age of the study population was 37 years and the ratio of female to male patients was 2.57 to 1.0. Similar demographics were seen in subgroups of patients whose last therapy before Tysabri infusion was glatiramer acetate, beta-interferon, or fingolimod.

Of the total patient population (n = 5623), prior to entry into this study, 547 patients (9.7%) were naïve to DMTs, 5076 patients (90.3%) had received ≥ 1 DMTs, and 2539 patients (45.2%) had received ≥ 2 DMTs.

Of the 5076 patients who received prior DMT(s), 3210 patients (57.1%) received beta interferon as their last  therapy  before  dosing  with  natalizumab,  1354  patients  (24.1%)  received  GA  as  their  last  therapy before dosing with natalizumab, and 130 patients (2.3%) received fingolimod as their last therapy before dosing with natalizumab.

The patients dosed in this study received a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 29.6 (18.81) natalizumab infusions and a median of 27 natalizumab infusions (range: 1 to 90). Similar natalizumab exposure was seen  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  before  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta  interferon. Fewer natalizumab infusions were seen in the fingolimod subgroup, with a mean (SD) of 14.2 (10.29) natalizumab infusions and a median of 13 natalizumab infusions (range: 1 to 59). Natalizumab exposure in the fingolimod subgroup was lower since its approval in Europe was more recent (i.e., 2011) than the other DMTs.

The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  long-term  safety  (incidence  and  pattern  of  SAEs)  in  patients receiving Tysabri. The chosen efficacy endpoints included clinical relapse rate (ARR), degree of disability (EDSS) and evaluation of baseline disease characteristics as prognostic indicators for disease activity and disability progression over time. An additional endpoint for this study was the evaluation of anti-JC virus (JCV) antibody prevalence in patients with MS for the duration of the study. The chosen endpoints are considered appropriate.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

As RRMS is characterized by unpredictable relapses the evaluation of ARR is deemed meaningful. The data from TOP showed a reduction in annualised relapse rate (ARR) from baseline at every time point tested. The pretreatment ARR (95% Confidence Interval (CI) decreased from 1.99 (1.96, 2.01) to 0.22 (0.21,  0.24)  on  Tysabri  therapy  (p&lt;0.0001)  and  remained  stable  over  time.  The  effect  size  for  the subgroup of patients whose last therapy was fingolimod is similar to the effect sizes for the subgroups of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients whose last therapy was GA or beta-interferon (which serve as internal controls).

For  all  subgroups,  treatment  with  Tysabri  significantly  decreased  the  ARR  (p  &lt;  0.0001).  The  pretreatment ARR (95% CI) of 1.98 (1.93, 2.03) in patients whose last therapy was GA, decreased to 0.24 (0.22, 0.27) during Tysabri therapy. In patients whose last therapy was all commercially available betainterferon, the pre-treatment ARR (95% CI) of 1.98 (1.94, 2.01) decreased to 0.21 (0.19, 0.22) during Tysabri  therapy.  In  patients  whose  last  therapy  was  fingolimod,  the pre-treatment  ARR of  2.06  (1.88, 2.26) decreased to 0.38 (0.28, 0.52) during Tysabri therapy.

In  the  total  TOP  population,  the  reduction  in  ARR  remained  stable  over  5  years  for  the  subgroup  of patients whose last therapy prior to Tysabri infusion was GA or beta-interferon. For patients whose last therapy  prior  to  Tysabri  infusion  was  fingolimod,  the  reduction  in  ARR  remained  stable  over  2  years (given later market entry). Data for the fingolimod subgroup after the 2 year period are less meaningful due to the smaller sample size (n=22 at 3 years; n ≤ 4 after 3 years).

EDSS  evolution  was  used  to  assess  disease  progression.  Sustained  progression  was  defined  as  an increase  in  EDSS,  sustained  for  at  least  24  weeks,  of  at  least  0.5  points  from  a  baseline  EDSS  score ≥ 6.0, at least 1.0 points from a baseline EDSS score of 1.0 to &lt;6.0, or at least 1.5 points from a baseline EDSS score of 0. Sustained improvement was defined as at least a 1-point decrease in EDSS sustained for at least 24 weeks for patients with baseline EDSS scores ≥ 2.

Mean  EDSS  scores  were  similar  from  Baseline  (3.5)  to  Year  5  (3.2)  in  patients  treated  with  Tysabri. Similar  results  were  seen  for  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with natalizumab was GA or beta interferon. For the fingolimod subgroup, less meaningful conclusions may be drawn due to the limited sample size ad due to the shorter Tysabri exposure (n=51 at year 1, n=15 at year 2 and n ≤ 4 after the 2 year period). From the limited data available, mean EDSS scores were similar from Baseline to Year 2. The time to sustained progression and time to sustained improvement based on EDSS scores were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. For the overall study population the cumulative probability of sustained EDSS improvement was evaluated and observed to be higher than the cumulative probability of sustained EDSS progression, (30.34% and 19.70%, respectively) at 5.5 years.

Similarly,  the  cumulative  probability  of  sustained  EDSS  improvement  was  higher  than  the  cumulative probability of sustained EDSS progression at all timepoints for the subgroup of TOP patients whose last therapy prior to Tysabri infusion was GA, beta-interferon, or fingolimod. For the fingolimod subgroup, the cumulative  probability  of  sustained  improvement  at  24  months  was  23.02%,  and  the  cumulative probability  of  sustained  progression  at  24  months  was  5.53.  For  the  GA  subgroup,  the  cumulative probability  of  sustained  improvement  at  5.5  years  was  31.43%,  and  the  cumulative  probability  of sustained  progression  at  5.5  years  was  15.87%.  For  the  beta-interferon  subgroup,  the  cumulative probability  of  sustained  improvement  at  5.5  years  was  29.43%,  and  the  cumulative  probability  of sustained progression at 5.5 years was 21.44%. Due to the open label nature of the TOP study and due to  the  very  high  dropout rate,  no  conclusion  may be drawn on an endpoint such as time to sustained improvement on EDSS.

The aim of the TOP interim analyses performed by the MAH was to demonstrate that, in a clinical practice setting, the type of prior treatment does not impact the safety or efficacy profile in patients with RRMS who  are  subsequently  treated  with  natalizumab.  However  the  majority  of  patients  treated  with natalizumab  in  the  TOP  study  did  not  receive  new  DMTs  prior  to  Tysabri  treatment  and  were  mainly (81%) treated with either beta interferon (n= 3210, 57%) or glatiramer acetate (GA) (n= 1354, 24%) as last treatment prior to starting Tysabri. Fingolimod was administered, as last treatment prior to starting Tysabri, to only 130 patients, while very few patients received teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate prior to Tysabri (6 and 5 patients, respectively). Furthermore, the subgroup of patients who received fingolimod as last therapy before natalizumab was exposed to a lower number of Tysabri infusions (mean 14.29) compared to the subgroups of patients whose last therapy before natalizumab was GA or beta interferon

(mean respectively 29 and 31 natalizumab infusions ). Results from the TOP study may thus provide only limited evidence of similar efficacy of Tysabri when administered after fingolimod. In addition, both the length of exposure to different DMTs prior to Tysabri as well as the sequence of treatments in patients (45%) who have assumed ≥ 2 prior DMTs prior to the first Tysabri infusion are currently not specified. Similarly, frequency and reasons for Tysabri discontinuation and withdrawal from TOP study according to different MS drugs used prior to switching to Tysabri have not been stated and discussed. An update of the TOP efficacy data in the year after the cut-off date should be provided on the subgroup of patients who previously received a DMT different from GA or IFN beta.

Having highlighted the several limitations of the data derived from the TOP study, it is noted that overall efficacy data from the interim analysis presented in support of the present variation confirm the known efficacy profile of Tysabri and do not appear to raise new efficacy concerns.

Of note:

-  Fingolimod is indicated for the same state of disease as Tysabri (highly active RRMS)
-  The current indication for fingolimod is identical to the proposed new Tysabri indication (at least one disease modifying therapy (DMT)).
-  Data for the fingolimod cohort are limited (N=130)
-  No data are available for patients switching from prior DMF or teriflunomide therapy to Tysabri
-  DMTs  have  different  mechanisms  of  action  compared  to  Tysabri.  Efficacy  of  Tysabri  could therefore be possible in patients who failed prior DMT therapy.

The MAH argued that according to the current indication of Tysabri patients in need for treatment of their highly active RRMS treated with other DMTs than GA and beta-interferon would need to be switched to beta-interferon  or  GA  before  being  considered  for  treatment  with  Tysabri.  For  patients  with  moderate RRMS who started treatment with teriflunomide or DMF and subsequently experienced a worsening of their MS this would result in a prolongation of insufficient (mild to moderate) treatment although these patients  were  in  need  of  a  treatment  for  highly  active  disease  to  reduce  the  risk  of  exacerbations (relapses) and to slow the accumulation of disability.

In principle, this argumentation can be followed and while it is clear that the efficacy data from the TOP study are not adequate to clearly prove that the efficacy of Tysabri is not influenced by the type of DMT administered  in  the  first  line  setting,  there  is  however  no  reason  to  think  that  Tysabri  would  not  be efficacious after failing of different first-line DMTs. The CHMP was of the view that there was a reasonable scientific plausibility that even if treatment with teriflunomide and/or dimethyl fumarate failed due to lack of efficacy, the treatment with fingolimod would be effective. Given the current situation and the available therapeutic  options  in  clinical  practice,  the  CHMP  considered  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect separate data to be provided in patients treated with each of the marketed drugs.

However,  the  main  concern  with  Tysabri  use  after  new  DMTs,  all  endowed  with  immunosuppressive properties,  is  the  increased  risk  of  PML.  A  recent  abstract  presented  at  the  American  Academy  of Neurology  in  Washington  (Herbert  et  al,  2015)  discussed  preliminary  data  coming  from  a  multicentre retrospective study of extended dosing of natalizumab in 886 patients, suggesting that increasing Tysabri dosing interval may be a strategy for mitigating risk of PML while maintaining efficacy. In this regard, it is of note that 2,211 out of 5,623 patients (39.3%) in the TOP study did not receive Tysabri every month. Further data have been requested on this subgroup of patients, with regard to dosing schedule, efficacy and safety, in order to understand if Tysabri safety profile could be favourable affected by changing in the schedule and if further studies addressing the issue should be required post-approval.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH stated that the current request of extension of indication is not advocating earlier treatment of patients with Tysabri than indicated in the current approved label, and this was agreed by CHMP.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

A reduction of the ARR was found following treatment with Tysabri after failure of at least one DMT for patients who failed prior therapy with GA and beta-interferon. Switching to Tysabri resulted in a reduction in  ARR  compared  to  the  pre-treatment  ARR.  A  similar  trend  could  be  seen  in  patients  with  prior fingolimod therapy even though numbers are limited.

A further efficacy parameter in TOP was EDSS to evaluate disease progression. Mean EDSS scores were similar  from  Baseline  (3.5)  to  Year  5  (3.2)  in  patients  treated  with  Tysabri.  For  the  overall  study population the cumulative probability of sustained EDSS improvement was evaluated and observed to be higher than the cumulative probability of sustained EDSS  progression, (30.34%  and 19.70%, respectively)  at  5.5  years.  The  EDSS  scale  has  been  questioned  in  the  past  for  its  ability  to  detect clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  disability.  Sustained  EDSS  as  potential  indicator  of  neurological improvement has been evaluated, although further research is needed to validate its use as an MS clinical outcome (Phillips et al, 2011). Due to the open label nature of the TOP study and due to the very high dropout rate, no conclusion may be drawn on a untested endpoint such as time to sustained improvement on EDSS.

Taking into account that fingolimod and Tysabri are both indicated for highly active forms of RRMS and a switch  from  fingolimod  to  Tysabri  showed  a  positive  trend  towards  efficacy  it  could  be  assumed  that patients with prior teriflunomide and DMF therapy would benefit from a switch to Tysabri especially as these DMTs are indicated for less severe forms of RRMS. However, the TOP study did not provide any efficacy  data  for  patients  switching  from  prior  teriflunomide  and  DMF  therapy  to  Tysabri  and  in  the absence of a control group the observed treatment effects are prone to bias and have to be interpreted with caution.

The MAHs proposal to extend the indication for Tysabri is comprehensible considering the introduction of new  therapeutic  options  in  the  MS  treatment  over  the  past  years  and  the  corresponding  changes  to current MS treatment guidelines.

Tysabri is one of the most efficacious DMTs currently available in patients with RRMS. From a biological perspective, there is no reason why Tysabri efficacy should be different according to the type of first line DMT.  Overall  the  data  presented  support  the  MAH's  view  that  beneficial  effect  of  Tysabri  is  observed irrespective of initial first line treatment, even though it must be emphasized that only limited data are available (in terms of number of patients and time of exposure) for patients switching from fingolimod to Tysabri.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The safety profile of Tysabri has been evaluated extensively in clinical trials, post-marketing observational studies and postmarketing passive surveillance. In placebo-controlled trials in 1,617 MS patients treated with natalizumab for up to 2 years (placebo: 1,135), adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy occurred in 5.8% of patients treated with natalizumab (placebo: 4.8%). Over the 2-year duration of the studies, 43.5% of patients treated with natalizumab reported adverse reactions (placebo: 39.6%). The highest  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  identified  from  placebo-controlled  trials  in  multiple  sclerosis patients with natalizumab given at the recommended dose, are reported as dizziness, nausea, urticaria

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and rigors associated with infusions.

The  major  safety  concern  remains  the  risk  of  developing  PML  (and  IRIS).    As  a  safety  precaution physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of Tysabri therapy with the patient and provide them with a Patient Alert Card.

Prior  immunosuppressants use  was  originally  identified  as  a  risk  factor  for  PML  development  based  on data from the global TYGRIS study, which showed that Tysabri-treated patients with prior immunosuppressants use have a 4-fold greater risk of PML than patients with no prior immunosuppressants  use.  Because  prior  immunosuppressants  status  was  not  available  for  all  Tysabritreated  patients  in  the  post-marketing  setting,  data  on  prior  immunosuppressants  use  in  the  TYGRIS study  was  utilized  with  the  assumption  that  it  would  be  representative  of  the  overall  Tysabri-treated population. Further characterization of prior immunosuppressants use on the risk of PML events following Tysabri administration obtained from a combined clinical study dataset from STRATA, TOP, and TYGRIS studies failed to identify any pattern or trend with regard to PML risk associated with type and duration of immunosuppressants treatment, or length of washout period. It is thus not possible at present to assume that a long washout period may decrease the risk of PML associated with prior use of immunosuppressants. In parallel to this assessment, at the request of the European Commission, under Article  20  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  a  procedure  was  started  to  assess  if,  in  view  of  existing evidence, there was a need to update the product information and/or the risk management plan, or to take any other regulatory measure for Tysabri in relation to PML risk. As scientific evidence on PML is rapidly growing, there was a need to assess whether, in view of current knowledge, the risk of PML is adequately  described  and  risk  minimisation  measures  were  optimal.  The  procedure  was  finalized  in February 2016 and the Committees concluded that:

-  PML which is clinically asymptomatic at diagnosis represents more frequently localised disease in MRI, with a higher survival rate and better clinical outcome as compared to symptomatic PML. Early diagnosis of PML appears to be associated with improved outcomes.
-  As a consequence, it was recommended that more frequent MRI screening for PML (e.g. every 36 months) using an abbreviated MRI protocol should be considered in patients at higher risk of development of PML.
-  In patients who have not received prior immunosuppressant therapy and are anti-JCV antibody positive, the level of anti-JCV antibody response (index) is associated with risk of developing PML. Current evidence suggests that risk increases with increasing antibody index but there is no clear cut off value. In patients treated for longer than 2 years, the risk of PML is low at index values of 0.9 or less, and increases substantially at values above 1.5.
-  It was recommended that patients with low anti-JCV antibody index who have not received prior immunosuppressant  therapy  should  be  retested  every  six  months  once  they  reach  the  2-year treatment point.
-  It was considered necessary to update the existing educational material, particularly in relation to the risk estimates for development of PML in Tysabri-treated patients.

Other important identified risks with natalizumab are:

##  Opportunistic infections

In 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients, the rate of infection was approximately 1.5 per patientyear in both natalizumab- and placebo-treated patients. The nature of the infections was generally similar in  natalizumab- and placebo-treated patients. A case of cryptosporidium diarrhoea was reported in MS clinical trials. In other clinical trials, cases of additional opportunistic infections have been reported, some

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  which  were  fatal.  In  clinical  trials,  herpes  infections  (Varicella-Zoster  virus,  Herpes-simplex  virus) occurred  slightly  more  frequently  in  natalizumab-treated  patients  than  in  placebo-treated  patients.  In post marketing experience, there have been reports of serious cases, including one fatal case of herpes encephalitis.

##  Immunogenicity

In 10% of patients antibodies against natalizumab were detected in 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients.  Persistent  anti-natalizumab  antibodies  (one  positive  test  reproducible  on  retesting  at  least  6 weeks later) developed in approximately 6% of patients. Antibodies were detected on only one occasion in an additional 4% of patients. Persistent antibodies were associated with a substantial decrease in the effectiveness  of  TYSABRI  and  an  increased  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Additional  infusionrelated reactions associated with persistent antibodies included rigors, nausea, vomiting and flushing.

##  Hepatic events

Spontaneous  cases  of  serious  liver  injuries,  increased  liver  enzymes,  hyperbilirubinaemia  have  been reported during the post marketing phase.

An important potential risk with the use of Tysabri is malignancies (see relevant sections of the SmPC and of the RMP).

In a different ongoing procedure the MAH submitted data from the Pregnancy Registry (101MS401) which is a category 3 MEA study listed in the Risk Management Plan. In this procedure the MAH was requested to update Section 4.6 of the SmPC with regards to available data from the pregnancy registry and the risk for transient effect on haematological parameters for newborns of mothers exposed to Tysabri during pregnancy.

## Adverse events

Adverse  events  associated  with  the  use  of  Tysabri  include  fatigue,  allergic  reaction,  hypersensitivity reactions, anxiety, pharyngitis, sinus congestion, and peripheral oedema. In this trial focus was  put on the evaluation of the incidence and pattern of SAEs.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In  TOP  the  safety  of  Tysabri  is  being  assessed  by  collecting  data  on  the  incidence  of  non-MS-related serious adverse events (SAEs), including all serious infections, regardless of causality.

Prescribers  of  Tysabri  were  aware  of  the  possibility  that  PML  and  other  opportunistic  infections  could occur  during  this  therapy.  Therefore,  opportunistic  infections  were  considered  in  their  differential diagnosis  of  all  infections  and  any  new  or  worsening  neurological  symptoms  that  occurred  in  Tysabritreated patients. For this purpose, Biogen Idec established Tysabri MS patient management algorithms ('Physician Information and Management Guidelines for MS Patients on Tysabri Therapy'). The clinician evaluated the patient to determine whether the symptoms were indicative of neurological dysfunction, and  if  so,  whether  these  symptoms  were  typical  of  MS  or  possibly  suggestive  of  PML  or  other opportunistic infections. If they were suggestive of PML, or if any doubt existed, further evaluation was considered, including an MRI scan (compared with MRI prior to therapy), cerebrospinal fluid testing for JCV  DNA,  and  repeat  neurological  assessments.  If  new  neurological  symptoms  suggestive  of  PML occurred, further Tysabri dosing was to be suspended until PML had been excluded. Once the clinician had excluded PML, dosing of Tysabri could resume.

Overall, 550 of 5623 patients (9.8%) experienced at least 1 SAE, and 197 patients (3.5%) experienced at least  1  SAE  that  was  considered  related  to  natalizumab.  The  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  with  the highest  incidence  of  SAEs  were  infections  and  infestations  (160  patients,  2.8%)  and  nervous  system disorders (96 patients, 1.7%). No single SAE occurred in more than 0.5% of patients. The most common SAEs  were  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  (30  patients  [26  confirmed  and  4 suspected], 0.5%), hypersensitivity (26 patients, 0.5%), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (20 patients, 0.4%), pneumonia (16 patients, 0.3%), spontaneous abortion (16 patients, 0.3%), herpes zoster (15 patients, 0.3%), multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse (15 patients, 0.3%), depression (14 patients, 0.2%), MS (11 patients, 0.2%), and epilepsy (11 patients, 0.2%). Nineteen of 20 patients with IRIS also had PML.

The SAE data for the GA and beta interferon subgroups were similar to the safety data observed for the total population. In the fingolimod subgroup, a lower incidence of SAEs was observed (7 of 130 patients, 5.4%) than in the total population (550 of 5623 patients, 9.8%). The SAEs reported by the 7 patients comprised 12 preferred terms (PTs). As in the total TOP population, the highest incidence of SAEs in the fingolimod subgroup was observed in the infections and infestations SOC, with 3 patients reporting SAEs within  5  PTs  (cystitis,  infectious  enterocolitis,  herpes  zoster,  septic  encephalopathy,  and  urinary  tract infection). In the nervous system disorders SOC, 3 patients reported SAEs within 3 PTs (dementia, MS relapse, and neuralgia). The following events were also reported in 1 patient each: gastritis, neutralising antibodies, intervertebral disc protrusion, and spontaneous abortion. No SAE was reported in more than 1 patient.

The overall PML incidence rate was 4.6/1000 (95% confidence interval: 3, 6.8) based on confirmed cases of  PML.  The  median  number  of  natalizumab  infusions  prior  to  the  report  of  PML  (both  confirmed  and suspected  cases)  was  36.5,  with  number  of  infusions  ranging  from  11  to  54.  Twenty  five  of  the  30 reported PML cases occurred in patients receiving natalizumab for more than 2 years. Anti-JC virus (JCV) antibody status was available for 10 of the patients with PML, and all 10 patients were anti-JCV antibody positive.  Eight  PML  patients  previously  used  immunosuppressants,  3  within  the  last  24  months  before

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receiving natalizumab.

<!-- image -->

There were 60 patients (1.1%) diagnosed with a neoplasm, and 41 of these events in 39 patients (0.7%) were malignant. The most frequently reported malignancy was breast cancer (n = 11). Leukaemia was diagnosed  in  5  patients:  2  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (CLL),  2  with  chronic  myeloid leukaemia, and 1 with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Thyroid cancer, renal carcinoma (1 patient also had  CLL  and  1  patient  also  had  colon  cancer),  and  melanoma  (1  in  situ  and  1  ocular)  were  each diagnosed  in  3  patients.  Lung  carcinoma,  cervical  cancer  (1  in  situ),  and  colon  cancer  were  each diagnosed  in  2  patients.  The  other  cancer  diagnoses  (carcinoma  of  ampulla  of  Vater,  ovarian  cancer, testicular  cancer,  rectal  cancer,  basal  cell  carcinoma,  Waldenstrom  macroglobulinemia,  gliobastoma, oligodendroglioma,  chordoma,  and  bladder  cancer)  each  occurred  in  1  patient.  The  distribution  of  the type  of  malignancies  in  natalizumab-treated  TOP  patients  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  general population [Ferlay 2013].

Seventeen deaths (0.3% of patients) occurred during the TOP study as of 01 May 2014. Six deaths were attributed to suicide; 2 deaths were attributed to pulmonary embolism; and 1 death each was attributed to  colon  cancer,  lung  cancer,  IRIS  following  PML  (patient  had  brain  oedema),  urosepsis  (patient  had ongoing  PML),  autonomic  nervous  system  imbalance,  respiratory  failure  (patient  had  ongoing  PML), drowning, benzodiazepine overdose, and unknown cause. With the exception of PML-related deaths, the reported  deaths  in  TOP  appear  to  be  consistent  with  the  fatal  events  observed  in  the  general  MS population.

Updated Safety information: Patients switching from fingolimod to Tysabri (147 patients as of May 2015; previously 130 patients)

For  the  SOCs  with  the  greatest  number  of  events  overall  (e.g.,  3  events  each  in  infections  and infestations,  nervous  system  disorders),  the  SAE  incidence  rates  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  who previously  received  fingolimod  are  comparable  to  the  prior  GA  and  prior  interferon  subgroups.  The incidence  rates  for  SAEs  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations  in  patients  who  previously  received fingolimod,  GA  and  interferon  were  1.41,  1.32  and  1.19  per  100  patient  years,  respectively.  The incidence  rates  for  previous  fingolimod,  GA  and  interferon  subgroups  for  the  SOC  of  Nervous  system disorders were 1.41, 0.84 and 0.67 per 100 patient years, respectively. For the remaining SOCs which contained only a single SAE, the incidence rates were somewhat less similar among subgroups who last used fingolimod, GA or interferon. While subject year adjusted incidence rates (instead of percentages) generally provides a reliable means for comparison of safety across studies of longer duration when the rates are stable, the SAE rates for patients last exposed to fingolimod are less stable due to the relatively small sample size (N=147) compared with the GA (N=1384) and interferon (N=3255) groups, and the small number (e.g., 3 or fewer) of events within each SOC for patients last exposed to fingolimod. For instance,  the  SOC  of  pregnancy,  puerperium  and  perinatal  conditions  for  patients  who  received  prior fingolimod  had  a  single  event  among  212  patient  years  which  provides  a  less  stable  estimate  of  the incidence (e.g., each additional event results in a greater change in the rate), as compared to the prior interferon subgroup which had 19 events among 8889 patient years.

Updated  Safety  Information:  Patients  switching  from  teriflunomide  (7  cases  as  of  01  May  2015, previously 6), and dimethyl fumarate (still 5 cases as before) to Tysabri.

For the 5 patients who switched to Tysabri from dimethyl fumarate, there were no SAEs reported. For the 7 patients who switched to Tysabri from teriflunomide, one SAE occurred (PT: sepsis and urinary tract infection). This single SAE with a PT of sepsis and urinary tract infection in the subgroup last exposed to teriflunomide  (subject  year  exposure  =  16  patient  years)  results  in  an  incidence  rate  of  6.21  per  100 patient years for the infections and infestations SOC. Although this rate is greater than the incidence rate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for those previously exposed to the more established DMTs of GA and interferon (1.32 and 1.19 per 100 patient years, respectively), this likely reflects variation attributable to the relatively small sample size of those last exposed to teriflunomide. Therefore, the incidence rate does not appear meaningful.

The subgroup(s)  of patients in TOP who last received treatment with teriflunomide included 7 patients with  a  mean  and  median  exposure  to  teriflunomide  of  26.1  (±19.87)  months  and  28.2  months, respectively (range 4.4 to 50 months). A subset of these 7 patients also received other therapies prior to teriflunomide (6 patients received IFN, 3 received GA).

The  subgroup  of  patients  enrolled  in  TOP  who  last  received  dimethyl  fumarate  prior  to  switching  to Tysabri included 5 patients with mean and median exposure to dimethyl fumarate of 13.1 (±8.04) and 14.2 months, respectively (range 4.4 to 22.9 months). Of these 5 patients, a subset of these patients also previously received other therapies prior to dimethyl fumarate (4 patients received IFN, 2 patients received GA, 1 patient received fingolimod).

Exposure to NATALIZUMAB was based on time from first dose to date of discontinuation/withdrawal/last visit,  assuming  doses  every  28  days,  and  including  NATALIZUMAB  infusions  received  prior  to  TOP enrollment. Missed doses were subtracted out. Exposure to Tysabri for patients whose last medication was teriflunomide had a mean and median of 30.6 and 26.0 respectively (range from 1.0 to 73.0 months) which is similar to Tysabri exposure for patients last exposed to dimethyl fumarate (mean and median of 31 and 36.0 respectively, range 9.0 to 52.0 months).

In summary, the small sample size for prior teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate patient subgroups, most probably due to the recent approval of these DMTs and the closure date of enrollment for TOP, precludes meaningful  analysis.  Nonetheless,  the  data  reflect  useful  experience  to  date  for  patients  previously treated with these recently approved DMTs switching to Tysabri for efficacy reasons.

## Additional safety data from ongoing studies

Spontaneously reported post marketing data collected outside the US are extremely limited as prior DMT use  is  not  typically  reported.  Within  the  US,  all  patients  receiving  Tysabri  are  enrolled  in  the  TOUCH Prescribing Program where the last MS therapy received prior to starting Tysabri is routinely collected. Therefore, the MAH has performed a review of the safety data in patients switching from other DMTs to Tysabri in TOUCH. Regarding TYGRIS (Tysabri Global Observational Program in Safety), the enrollment closed in 2009 prior to the marketing authorizations of fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and alemtuzumab and therefore all patients in TYGRIS who had prior DMT use before starting Tysabri had received interferon-beta and/or glatiramer acetate.

## Review  of  Safety  Data  from  MS  Patients  Ever  Enrolled  in  TOUCH  Stratified  by  Prior  DMT  used  before starting Tysabri

The Tysabri global safety database was searched for HCP confirmed serious adverse events (SAEs) from MS patients ever enrolled in the TOUCH Prescribing Program as of 01 May 2015. The data were stratified based  on  the  last  DMT  received  by  the  patient  before  enrolling  in  TOUCH  as  provided  on  the  TOUCH Enrollment Form. The TOUCH Enrollment Form has been updated over time to include patients switching from  the  newer  approved  DMTs;  however,  information  on  patients  switching  from  alemtuzumab  to Tysabri is not available yet as the Enrollment Form is currently in the process of being updated to include prior  treatment  with  alemtuzumab.  Given  the  mechanism  of  action  of  alemtuzumab  and  its  prolonged impact on immune function, it  is  not  anticipated  that  there  will  be  many  patients  switching  from  that therapy to Tysabri unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk for the patient. The current analysis from TOUCH will focus on safety data in patients switching from the following DMTs to Tysabri: fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide. Comparison of the SAEs by MedDRA (version 18.0) System Organ

Classes (SOC) is shown in Table 12

## SAEs in the overall TOUCH population

As of 01 May 2015, there were 73,968 MS patients (192,641 person-years) ever enrolled in the TOUCH program since  it  started  in  June  2006.  Of  these  patients,  7,672  patients  (3.98  per  100  person-years) experienced  at  least  1  SAE.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest  frequencies  of  SAEs  were  nervous  system disorders (2,438 patients, 1.27 per 100 person-years), infections and infestations (2,292 patients, 1.19 per 100 person-years), and general disorders and administration site conditions (1,164 patients, 0.60 per 100 person-years).The most common SAEs reported in all TOUCH patients were multiple sclerosis relapse (1,092 patients, 0.57 per 100 person-years), urinary tract infection (567 patients, 0.29 per 100 personyears), and pneumonia (442 patients 0.23 per 100 person-years).

## SAEs in Patients Who Switched from Fingolimod to Tysabri

As shown in Table 12, 1,710 patients (2,691 person-years) switched from fingolimod to Tysabri within TOUCH, and of those, 97 patients (3.60 per 100 person-years) experienced at least 1 SAE. Similar to that reported for  the  overall  TOUCH  population,  the  SOCs  with  the  highest  frequencies  of  SAEs  in  patients switching  from  fingolimod  to  Tysabri  included  nervous  system  disorders  (31  patients,  1.15  per  100 person-years),  infections  and  infestations  (17  patients,  0.63  per  100  person-years),  and  general disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (15  patients,  0.56  per  100  person-years).  The  most frequently  reported  SAEs  included  multiple  sclerosis  relapse  (16  patients,  0.59  per  100  person-years), multiple sclerosis (6 patients, 0.22 per 100 personyears), and death (5 patients, 0.19 per 100 personyears; listed as an event with cause of death unknown).

There was 1 confirmed case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) reported in a patient who switched from fingolimod to Tysabri. To date there have only been 3 cases of confirmed PML with prior fingolimod exposure and of those, only 1 case was reported from the US (Case ID 2014BI037626). This patient had received prior immunosuppressant (mycophenolate concurrently with IFN-beta) before switching to fingolimod for approximately 2-3 years from 2011 to 2013. The patient was then switched to Tysabri in Feb 2013, which was administered concurrently with etanercept for 3 months, and then the patient received Tysabri monotherapy for the last dose received in Oct 2014.

## SAEs in Patients Who Switched from Dimethyl Fumarate to Tysabri

There were 1,783 patients (2,691 person-years) who switched from dimethyl fumarate (DMF) to Tysabri within TOUCH (Table 12). Of these patients, 88 patients (3.27 per 100 person-years) experienced at least 1  SAE.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest  frequencies  of  SAEs  were  similar  to  that  for  the  overall  TOUCH population and included nervous system disorders (28 patients, 1.04 per 100 person-years), followed by infections and infestations (18 patients, 0.67 per 100 personyears), general disorders and administration site conditions, injury, poisoning and procedural complications and surgical and medical procedures (10 patients in each, 0.37 per 100 personyears).

The most frequently reported SAEs were multiple sclerosis relapse (11 patients, 0.41 per 100 person-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years), pneumonia (6 patients, 0.22 per 100 person-years), multiple sclerosis and urinary tract infection (5 patients in each, 0.19 person-years). No PML cases were reported for this subgroup.

## SAEs in Patients Who Switched from Teriflunomide to Tysabri

Of  the  274  patients  (309  person-years)  who  switched  from  teriflunomide  to Tysabri  within  TOUCH,  10 patients (3.23 per 100 person-years) had at least 1 SAE. The number of patients with reported SAEs who had switched from teriflunomide to Tysabri is very small; however the SOCs with the highest frequencies of SAEs were similar to that for the overall TOUCH population and included nervous system disorders (4 patients, 1.29 per 100 person-years), infections and infestations, and general disorders and administration site conditions (3 patients each, 0.97 per 100 person-years). The most frequently reported SAE (reported in more than 2 patients) was multiple sclerosis relapse (3 patients, 0.97 per 100 personyears). No PML cases were reported for this subgroup.

## PML

As of 01 May 2015, there were 35 confirmed cases of PML reported from the TOP study. The baseline demographics and characteristic of these cases are summarized in the following Table 13.

## Prior DMTs received by patients with confirmed PML in the TOP study

Of  the  35  PML  patients  in  the  TOP  study,  33  (94.3%)  reported  prior  use  of  at  least  one  DMT  before initiating Tysabri. Of the 33 patients with prior DMT use, 11 patients had received ≥ 2 DMTs (33.3%).

The  most  frequently  used  DMTs  were  interferon  beta  products  in  29  patients.  The  duration  of  prior interferon beta therapy in PML patients varied widely with a median of at least 26.1 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were 11 patients who received prior glatiramer acetate with a duration that ranged from 3.2 to 81.6 months and a mean and a median of 25.9 and 15.3 months, respectively. Of the 33 PML patients who  received  prior  DMTs,  none  of  them  received  fingolimod,  dimethyl  fumarate,  teriflunomide  or alemtuzumab at any time prior to initiating Tysabri.

## Prior IS therapies received by patients with confirmed PML in the TOP study

In the initial variation submission, with a data cut of 01 May 2014, the MAH reported 30 cases of PML in the TOP study including 26 confirmed cases and 4 suspect cases. Prior IS use was reported in 8 of these 30 patients. However, 2 of these 8 patients were cases of suspect PML at the time of the submission. Since that time, PML was ruled out in one case on 03 Jun 2014 (based on negative CSF JCV DNA, MRI finding  inconsistent  with  PML  and  an  alternative  diagnosis)  and  a  second  case  was  assessed  as  low suspect  for  PML  (based  on  MRI  findings  suspicious  for  PML  but  CSF  JCV  DNA  that  tested  negative). Therefore, these two cases were not included in the updated prior IS analysis that follows.

Based on the updated review as of 01 May 2015, of the 35 confirmed cases of PML in the TOP study, 6 (17.1%) received prior IS therapy. As shown in Table 14, the prior IS therapies included mitoxantrone in 4  patients,  azathioprine  in  3  patients  and  cyclophosphamide  in  1  patient.  Two  patients  received  more than one IS therapy including 1 patient who received cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, and another patient who received mitoxantrone and azathioprine. One patient received 2 different treatment regimens of mitoxantrone (approximately 31.5 months apart).

Duration  and  washout  periods  of  prior  treatment  with  mitoxantrone  and  azathioprine  in  these  PML patients varied widely. Only 1 patient had received cyclophosphamide. No specific pattern or trend was identified in the small number of PML patients with regard to their prior IS use.

## Other prior therapies received by patients with confirmed PML in the TOP study

Two  of  the  35  confirmed  PML  patients  from  the  TOP  study  reported  the  chronic  use  of  systemic corticosteroids prior to initiation of Tysabri, which was categorized as 'other' therapies in the previous submission. Additionally, in the initial submission, a third patient (a suspect PML case) with chronic use of systemic  corticosteroids  prior  to  Tysabri  was  also  included  in  the  'other'  category.  This  case  is  not included in the current analysis since PML was assessed as a low suspect based on MRI finding suspicious for PML but CSF JCV that tested negative.

Duration of Tysabri therapy at the time of PML diagnosis in patients with or without prior IS use

The mean and median durations of Tysabri received at the time of PML diagnosis in the 6 PML patients with prior IS use are compared with those in the 29 PML patients without prior IS use as shown in Table 15.

| With prior IS use (N = 6)     | Mean (SD): 29.8 (11.4) Median: 30.5 Minimum: 12: Maximum: 43       |
| Without prior IS use (N = 29) | Mean (SD): 38.3 (13.7) Median: 40.0 Minimum: 11; Maximum: 62       |

The mean and median durations of Tysabri treatment at the time of PML diagnosis appear to be greater in patient without prior IS.

In  the  2  PML  patients  with  no  prior  IS  use  who  had  received  chronic  systemic  corticosteroids  before initiation  of  Tysabri,  the  durations  of  Tysabri  treatment  at  the  time  of  PML  diagnosis  were  44  and  24 months.

Prior DMT, IS or other therapies use in the non-PML population in the TOP study

As of 01 May 2015, there were 5735 non-PML patients in the TOP study. The majority of the patients (5543/5735, 96.7%) had received one of the interferon beta products  prior to initiating Tysabri, which included  Avonex  in  1813/5735  patients  (31.6%),  Betaferon/Betaseron/Extavia  in  1671/5735  patients (29.1%) and Rebif in 2059/5735 patients (35.9%). There were 2003/5735 (34.9%) patients who had received glatiramer acetate.

A small number of patients had received the newer DMTs, which included fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide (Table 16). None of the patients had received alemtuzumab prior to Tysabri.

A 28-daymonth is used in this summary.

Of the non-PML patients who had received the newer DMTs prior to the initiation of Tysabri, the duration of  the  washout  period  of  the  therapies  varied  with  a  wide  range.  Since  none  of  the  PML  patients  had received  these  newer  DMTs,  no  comparisons  can  be  made  with  regards  to  the  duration  and  washout periods between these 2 populations.

There were 805 non-PML patients who had received prior IS before starting Tysabri. These IS therapies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

included  mitoxantrone,  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  cyclophosphamide,  mycophenolate,  cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rituximab and cladribine. The duration and washout period for these prior IS therapies in nonPML patients from TOP are summarized below.

A 28-day month is used in this summary.

Among the IS used by the non-PML patients, azathioprine was the most commonly used. Duration of the IS therapies and washout periods varied with a wide range.

As  shown  in  Table  17  that  compares  the  type  and  duration  of  prior  IS  between  PML  and  non-PML patients,  there  were  3  IS  including  azathioprine,  mitoxantrone  and  cyclophosphamide  that  had  been received by both PML and non-PML patients. With azathioprine, the proportion of non-PML patients who had received the therapy was similar to that of PML patients (8.1% versus 8.6%). With mitoxantrone, the proportion of patients who had received the therapy appeared to be higher (11.4%) in PML than in nonPML  patients  (4.6%).  However,  given  the  small  number  of  PML  patients,  whether  mitoxantrone  is associated with higher risk of PML cannot be concluded. The duration of the IS therapies varied in both non-PML and PML patients with a wide range. No specific pattern or trend was identified regarding the type or duration of prior IS therapy and the occurrence of PML.

The washout periods from the last dose of the 3 IS therapies to the start of Tysabri for the non-PML and

PML patients in TOP were also compared, and are shown below.

The washout periods for the 3 prior IS therapies received by non-PML and PML patients in TOP varied with a wide range. No specific pattern or trend was observed.

Additionally,  there  were  299  non-PML  patients  (299/5735,  5.2%)  in  TOP  who  had  received  chronic systemic  corticosteroids,  71  patients  (71/5735,  1.2%)  who  had  received  prednisone,  111  patients (111/5735,  1.9%)  who  had  received  immunoglobulins,  and  59  patients  (59/5735,  1.0%)  who  had received 'other' therapies prior to starting Tysabri as reported and specified by the investigators on the Case  Report  Form  (CRF).  These  'other'  therapies  included  DMTs  other  than  various  interferon  beta products, glatiramer, fingolimod, teriflunomide and DMF; immunosuppressive/antineoplastic medications other than those specified in Table 7;  and steroids/immunoglobulins other than those specified on the CRF.

Potential  increased  risk/cumulative  effect  for  the  development  of  PML  in  patients  switching  from fingolimod and dimethylfumarate

The MAH performed an analysis of all confirmed PML cases in Tysabri-treated patients as of 27 July 2015. There  were  a  total  of  580  confirmed  Tysabri-treated  PML  patients;  476  patients  had  prior  disease modifying therapy (DMT) status available before initiating Tysabri, of which 450 (95%) reported prior use of at least one DMT. Of the 450 PML cases who reported prior DMT use, 30 cases did not specify the type of DMT received. Of the 420 cases that provided the type of prior DMT received, all 420 cases reported prior interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and/or glatiramer acetate (GA), with 3 of these cases also reporting prior fingolimod use and no cases reporting prior use of DMF.

The fact that all 420 PML cases with available information reported prior use of IFN-beta and/or GA is not surprising given that these are first line agents for the treatment of MS commonly used over the last two decades. Although both medications have immunomodulatory mechanisms of action, there is no evidence that prior use of IFN-beta or GA before switching to Tysabri is associated with a higher risk of PML.

The prior MS therapies received by the 3 Tysabri-associated PML cases with prior fingolimod exposure (Case IDs 2014BI003698, 2014BI037626, and 2014BI124637) are shown below in Table 19.

Two of the 3 PML cases (Case IDs 2014BI003698 and 2014BI124637) initially received Tysabri and then switched to fingolimod, and subsequently switched back to Tysabri prior to PML onset.

## Comparability of the US and EU populations

Following the request from the CHMP the MAH has also reviewed the Tysabri-treated patient populations in the US and the EU with regards to demographics, disease characteristics and frequency of known risk factors  using  data  derived  from  post-marketing  and  observational  studies.  A  comparison  of  the demographic characteristics of US and EU patient-subgroups included in STRATIFY-2 (all patients from US), TOP (all patients from EU), and TYGRIS (Tysabri Global Observational Program in Safety - including patients  from  EU  and  US)  is  shown  in  Table  20.  The  average  age of  Tysabri-treated  patients  in  these studies  is  lower  in  the  EU  patient  population  compared  to  those  in  the  US.  The  gender  distribution  in these studies appears comparable between EU and US patient populations, with some minor betweenstudy variation. The MAH has previously shown that age and gender are not risk factors for PML using the proportional  hazards  model  on  Tysabri  exposure  time.  Consequently,  although  there  are  demographic differences  between  Tysabri-treated  patients  in  the  EU  and  the  US  based  on  these  postmarketing  and observational studies, the MAH believed that these differences were sufficiently small to have no impact on any conclusions that may be drawn about the PML risk in patients switching from the newer DMTs using a US-only patient population.

## Disease characteristics

As the baseline disease characteristics (as measured by EDSS and ARR) data have not been collected within TOUCH, a direct comparison of these characteristics between the EU and the US patient population within the TYGRIS study or between the TOP (all patients from EU) and the STRATIFY-2 (all patients from US)  studies  is  not  possible.  However,  the  MAH  has  evaluated  whether  differences  in  these  baseline disease characteristics impact the overall risk of PML. An assessment of data available from EU patients in the  TOP  and  TYGRIS  studies  (see  Table  21)  demonstrates  that  baseline  EDSS  score,  and  number  of relapses in the year prior to starting Tysabri treatment, are comparable between the PML and non-PML Tysabri-treated patients. Regardless of PML status, patients in TOP and TYGRIS experienced a median of 2 relapses during the year prior to Tysabri initiation. Baseline EDSS was also similar among patients with and without PML (median 3.0 vs 3.5; respectively). Furthermore, there is currently no available literature to  suggest  that  EDSS  and  ARR  at  baseline  are  risk  factors  for  PML  or  confounders  in  the  association between Tysabri exposure and PML.

The MAH believed that whilst a direct comparison of the baseline disease characteristics in the EU and US patient  population  is  not  possible,  any  variations  that  may  exist  between  the  two  patient  populations should not contribute to any differences in PML risk. Their proposal is to provide the necessary safety data using the TOUCH patient cohort.

## PML Risk Factors in US and EU Tysabri Treated Populations

A review of the data from STRATIFY-2, TYGRIS and TOP of the three known risk factors for PML in Tysabri treated  patients  (positive  anti-JCV  antibody  status,  prior  immunosuppressant  use  and  duration  of treatment) show that there is some between-study and between-geographic variation (see Table 22). In particular the proportion of prior IS use recorded within the TYGRIS study is lower in the US than in EU. This is likely to reflect medical practice in the EU where immunosuppressants were more widely used to treat MS prior to the approval of Tysabri, and is not seen to the same extent in the TOP patient cohort. The mean and median Tysabri exposure also shows between-study variation but the range within the EU patient populations overlaps with the US and is broadly consistent across the two geographies.

In  summary, it is clear that the populations are not identical and some variations exist. However,  the MAH considered that  the small  differences  in  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  are  unlikely  to impact or confound the estimated risk of PML in Tysabri-treated patients. On the other hand, differences between geographic regions in terms of the known risk factors of PML could be addressed by the stratified PML risk estimates. Stratifying adjusts the analysis to account for the known differences that impact the precision of the risk estimate and therefore allows valid conclusions to be drawn from the data that are applicable  to  all  Tysabri-treated  patients,  irrespective  of  geographical  location.  For  example,  the  risk estimates for anti-JCV antibody positive patients remain valid regardless of the seroprevalence rate in a given geographic region.

Similarly,  the  risk  estimate  for  year  3  of  Tysabri  treatment  remains  valid  regardless  the  proportion  of patients  treated  for  3  years  or  more  in  a  given  geographic  region.  The  proposed  stratification  by  risk factors is shown in Table 23 below. This stratification of the analysis will present the PML risk estimates, determined  using  the  life  table  method,  by  yearly  exposure  interval  for  each  prior  DMT,  for  anti-JCV antibody positive patients without prior IS exposure.

The time to PML following initiation of Tysabri treatment can also be assessed using Kaplan Meier curves for each prior DMT among anti-JCV antibody positive patients without prior IS exposure.

## Central nervous system herpes simplex Type I and II and herpes zoster

Cumulatively, as of 31 May 2015, a total of 4 cases of CNS herpes infections have been reported in TOP. From these, 2 events were caused by herpes simplex virus and 2 by varicella zoster virus. In all 4 cases, patients presented with typical signs and symptoms such as acute onset of fever, headache and seizures. In  all  4  cases,  diagnosis was made by detecting the viral (VZV or HSV) DNA in the CSF; 2 cases also reported  brain  MRIs  showing  lesions  consistent  with  herpes  encephalitis.  Treatment  for  the  event  of meningitis and outcome was not provided in one case (2014BI071512); in all other cases it was reported these  patients  recovered  upon  discontinuation  of  Tysabri  and  initiation  of  acyclovir/valacyclovir.  There were  three  patients  who  received  previous  MS  therapies.  From  these,  one  had  previous  exposure  to interferon beta 1-a, other to mycophenolate mofetil, and other to systemic corticosteroids.

The  incidence  of  herpes  appears  to  be  higher  in  the  TOP  population  (13.27/100,000  patient-years) compared to the estimated incidence of HSV encephalitis worldwide (0.22 per 100,000 person years). Prior PSURs report rates were 4.9 - 5.22 per 100,000 patient-years. However, due to the limited set of data no definite conclusion can be drawn.

In  the  context  of  the  evaluation  of  additional  data  submitted  in  a  different  procedure  SmPC  changes were endorsed to add CNS herpes simplex and herpes zoster to the list of adverse reactions.

## Anemia/autoimmune haemolytic anemia

Cumulatively as of 31 May 2015, a total of 5 cases of anemia (3 non-hemolytic and 2 hemolytic) have been  reported  in  TOP.  Cases  retrieved  by  the  haematopoietic  erythropenia  SMQ  identified  cases  of anemia that are likely  due  to  decreased  RBC  (red  blood  cell)  production  while  the  SMQ  of  haemolytic disorders identified those cases with possible peripheral destruction of RBCs.

| SMQ   | Haematopoietic erythropenia     | No.Events   |

| Total | Total                           | 6           |

Of  the  3  cases  within  the  haematopoietic  erythropenia  SMQ,  1  case  had  limited  information  for  a comprehensive assessment and 2 cases reported concurrent conditions likely responsible for the event of anemia.  Exposure  to  other  DMTs  prior  to  Tysabri  included  interferon  beta  in  2  cases;  another  case reported prior immunoglobulin therapy. There were no reports of previous exposure to immunosuppressant therapies. Time between last DMT (interferons) to the first dose of Tysabri was 1 and 4 months.

With regard to the 2 cases identified within the SMQ of haemolytic disorders, one case  presented with hemolysis but without anemia. There were no laboratory results provided for markers of hemolysis (e.g. bilirubin  and  LDH)  with  the  exception  of  haptoglobin,  which  was  slightly  decreased.  The  diagnosis  of autoimmunity in this case was made based on a slightly positive direct coombs. Follow up CBC and direct coombs results were from tests performed a year after the diagnosis, and at that time, these were all negative; the event of anemia was considered resolved.

Despite  the  higher  rate  of  amenic  events  in  TOP  it  has  to  be  considered  that  the  incidence  rate  of hemolytic  anemia  in  the  overall  MS  population  (10.06  per  100,000  person-years)  is  also  higher compared  to  non-MS  patients  (5.45  per  100,000  person-years,  gender-adjusted:  1.85  per  100,000 person-years). Moreover, the incidence rates of anemia and haemolytic anemia seem to be comparable to recent PSUR data.

## Temporal pattern of cases of anaphylaxis/anaphylactic shock and pneumonia

17 SAEs based on the specified anaphylaxis search criteria were identified in 13 patients in the TOP study as of 31 May 2015. Upon medical review of the individual reports, 3 SAEs from 2 patients were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 14 SAEs identified in 11 patients had Preferred Terms (PT) that are summarized in Table 26. These events included anaphylactic reaction reported in 3 patients, anaphylactic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

shock reported in 4 patients, anaphylactoid reaction reported in 3 patients, and 4 other events of chest discomfort, dyspnea, erythema and angioedema each reported in 1 patient.

| PreferredTerm         |   NumberofEvent |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Anaphylactic shock    |               4 |

| Erythema              |               1 |
| Angioedema            |               1 |

Last DMT received prior to switching to Tysabri included interferon-beta in 7 patients: (Betaferon/Betaseron/Extavia in 4 patients, Avonex in 2 patients, and Rebif in 1 patient) and glatiramer acetate  in  2  patients.  Additionally,  the  use  of  an  IS  (mitoxantrone)  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  was reported in 1 patient and the use of chronic systemic corticosteroids prior to switching to Tysabri was reported in another patient.

For 7 of 11 patients, the anaphylactic reactions occurred within approximately 30 minutes after the start of  the  Tysabri  infusion;  in  4  of  11  patients,  the  specific  time  of  the  anaphylactic  reaction  and  the relationship to the Tysabri infusion was not provided. All 11 patients recovered from the event.

The incidence rate for anaphylactic reactions in TOP was estimated to be 0.2% (11 out of 5,770 patients) and is comparable to incidence rates in Tysabri clinical trials.

## Pneumonia

33  SAEs  based  on  the  specified  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  search  criteria  were  identified  in  32 patients in the TOP study as of 31 May 2015. Upon medical review of the individual reports, 8 SAEs in which there was no confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 25 SAEs identified in 24 patients had Preferred Terms (PT) that are summarized in Table 27.

| Lobarpneumonia       |                 |

Baseline  demographics  and  characteristics  are  available  for  24  patients  with  pneumonia  from  the  TOP study.  The  last  DMT  received  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  included  interferon-beta  in  16  patients: (Avonex  in  3  patients,  Rebif  in  4  patients,  Betaferon/Betaseron/Extavia  in  9  patients),  and  glatiramer acetate  in  4  patients.  Additionally,  the  use  of  an  IS  (mitoxantrone)  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  was reported  in  1  patient,  and  the  use  of  immunoglobulins  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  was  reported  in another patient. In 2 patients, no prior DMT or IS therapy was reported.

Causality was assessed as 'Related' in 9 cases, 'Possible' in 3 cases, 'Unrelated' in 11 cases, and not provided in 2 cases. Outcome was reported as 'Recovered' in 20 cases, 'Recovered with sequelae in 1 case, 'Not recovered' in 3 cases, and 'Fatal' in 1 case.

To  further  assess  the  association  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  (LRTI)  in  patients  with  MS  and specifically in those treated with Tysabri, the MAH conducted an insurance claims study (Mini-Sentinel, modular program 3) using data from 01 Jan 2004 through 31 Dec 2012. The results are presented in Table 12 and report the incidence rate (and incidence rate ratio) for LRTI among the following groups: 1) All MS patients; 2) MS patients on any disease modifying therapy (DMT); 3) MS patients on DMTs other than Tysabri; 4) MS patients treated with Tysabri; 5) MS patients never treated with a DMT.

## Malignancies

A  search  of  the  global  Tysabri  safety  database  was  performed  on  31  May  2015  using  the  SMQ (Standardized MedDRA Query) of malignant tumors (MedDRA version 18.0). The search yielded a total of 39 cases with 41 events.

All  39  cases  reported  a  primary  site  for  the  malignancy;  in  addition  to  this  primary  site,  two  cases (2012BI040805  and  2011BI000789)  had  associated  metastatic  events  also  coded  within  the  case  (1 metastatic event per case) accounting for the 41 total events. For the TOP malignancy incidence rates and  analysis,  only  primary  tumors  were  included  leaving  a  total  of  39  events.  Among  the  reported malignancies in TOP, breast cancer was the most common, affecting 12 patients (all female). Leukemia was diagnosed in 5 patients: (acute promyelocytic leukemia (1 patient), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (2 patients) and chronic myeloid leukemia (2 patients). Thyroid cancer was also diagnosed in 5 patients; colon cancer in 4 patients; lung cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma were diagnosed in 2 patients each; these include one cervical and one melanoma cancer in situ. All other cancers (skin, brain, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], bladder, kidney, and liver/biliary) occurred in one patient each.

Investigator  causality  was  assessed  as  unrelated  in  29  cases,  unlikely  related  or  possibly  related  in  2 cases each, and related in 5 cases; causality was not assessed in 1 case. The outcome was provided in 38 of the 39 cases. Of these, the outcome was not recovered/not resolved for 20 patients, recovered/resolved for 12 patients, recovered with sequelae in 4 patients, and fatal in 2 patients. See Appendix A for a summary of the case characteristics for the reported malignancies in  TOP. The  fatal malignancy cases are described in more detail later in this response.

In 9 cases, the Investigator reported that the patients did not have risk factors for the malignancy or a family  history  of  malignancy,  and  in  24  cases,  it  was  unknown  if  the  patients  had  risk  factors  as  no information was provided.

Prior treatment with DMTs (disease modifying therapies) before starting Tysabri included interferon beta

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(19  patients)  and  glatiramer  acetate  (12  patients);  some  patients  received  more  than  one  prior  DMT. There  were  no  reports  of  patients  who  received  the  newer  DMTs  (e.g.  fingolimod,  dimethylfumarate, teriflunomide)  before  Tysabri  and  then  developed  a  malignancy.  In  addition,  1  patient  had  received CDP323  in  a  clinical  trial;  CDP323  is  an  oral  α4-integrin  inhibitor  no  longer  in  development.  Other treatments  received  prior  to  starting  Tysabri  in  these  patients  included  immunoglobulins  and  chronic systemic steroids. There were no patients who reported receiving immunosuppressants (IS) as the last therapy before initiation of Tysabri; however, 5 cases did have a history of prior IS use. Of these, 4 cases reported the use of one IS therapy (cychophosphamide, azathioprine or mitoxantrone) while one case reported the use of three prior IS therapies (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide).

The 2 malignancy cases with a fatal outcome involved the following events: Colon cancer metastatic and lung neoplasm malignant .

There  were  two  cases  of  melanoma  reported  in  TOP.  These  cases  corresponded  to  events  of  ocular melanoma and in situ melanoma. There were no cases reported of invasive skin melanoma. Onset of melanoma in these cases was after 14 and 35 infusions for each case, respectively.

There was one case of lymphoma reported in the TOP study.

There were five cases of leukemia reported in TOP. Two were reports of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), two were reports of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and one was a report of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Time to onset in these cases ranged from 9 to 31 infusions with a mean of 21.8 and a median of 21 infusions.

Cumulative  incidence  rates  for  malignancies  in  TOP  stratified  by  gender  were  compared  to  the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) incidence rates in the general population.

## Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis

The MAH performed a medical review of the 8 SAEs of pulmonary embolism (PE) including the 2 fatal PE cases,  and  the  5  SAEs  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  reported  from  the  TOP  study.  The  MAH  also performed a search of the Tysabri global safety database to identify any additional cases of PE and DVT from the TOP study captured under the MedDRA (version 18.0) SMQ of \"Embolic and Thrombotic Events' as of 31 May 2015. The search identified 2 additional cases of PE, but no new cases of DVT. Narratives on the 2 fatal cases of PE, and available data for the SAEs of PE and DVT from the TOP study as of 31 May 2015 are provided below.

## Pulmonary embolism

There were 10 patients with the reported event of PE. Baseline demographics and characteristics of the 10 patients with PEs are summarized in the Table 29 below.

As shown in the Table 30 above, risk factors for thromboembolic disease were present in all 10 patients with a PE. These risk factors included history or concurrent DVT (3 patients), superficial vein thrombosis or  thrombophlebitis  (3  patients),  lower  limb  venous  insufficiency  (1  patient),  history  of  malignancy  (2 patients), bone fracture with surgical repair (1 patient), use of contraceptives (2 patients) and smoking history (1 patient). Severity of the PE was assessed by the Investigator as moderate in 5 patients, severe in 2 patients and not reported in 3 patients. Causality was assessed as unrelated by the Investigator in all cases. Six of the 10 patients with PEs recovered from the event, and 2 patients recovered with sequelae. There were 2 patients with a fatal outcome. Narratives of these 2 fatal PE cases are provided below.

## First case

A  50-year-old  female  patient  from  the  Czech  Republic  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  was enrolled in the TYSABRI Observational Program (IMA-06-02) and received 2 doses of Tysabri (300 mg IV QM)  on  06  Apr  2011  and  09  May  2011.  She  experienced  a  PE  and  died  on  14  Oct  2011  at  home, approximately  5  months  after  her  last  dose  of  Tysabri.  Per  the  autopsy  report  performed  on  an unspecified  date,  the  cause  of  death  was  PE,  which  was  assessed  by  the  Investigator  as  unrelated  to Tysabri treatment. The patient's expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and Karnofsky scores were not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported.  Medical  history  included  Grawitz  tumor  of  the  right  kidney  (grade  III)  diagnosed  on  25  Aug 2011, and a nephrectomy of the right kidney was performed on 12 Sep 2011. It was unknown if the patient had a history of cigarette smoking. No concomitant medications were reported. Prior therapies received before starting Tysabri included unspecified chronic systemic corticosteroids received from Nov 2008 to Mar 2011, glatiramer acetate received from Mar 2009 to Mar 2010 and interferon beta-1a (Rebif) from Mar 2010 to Mar 2011.

## Second case

A  54-year-old  female  patient  from  the  Czech  Republic  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  was enrolled in the TYSABRI Observational Program (IMA-06-02) and received 15 doses of Tysabri (300 mg IV QM) from 16 Oct 2009 to 21 Dec 2010. Five months after her last dose of Tysabri, she was hospitalized on 21 May 2011 due to a pathological fracture of the right humerus and had osteosynthesis performed on 22 May 2011. She experienced a PE and sudden death on 28 May 2011. No autopsy was reported. The Investigator assessed the event of PE as unrelated to Tysabri treatment.

The  patient's  EDSS  and  Karnofsky  scores  were  not  reported.  Relevant  medical  history  included  colon carcinoma with liver metastasis diagnosed on16 Mar 2011(reported in Case ID 2011BI018797). It was unknown  if  the  patient  had  a  history  of  cigarette  smoking.  No  concomitant  medication  was  reported. Previous  therapies  received  before  starting  Tysabri  included  chronic  systemic  corticosteroids  from  Jul 2009 to Sep 2009 for unknown indications.

## Deep Vein Thrombosis

There  were  5  patients  with  the  reported  event  of  DVT  in  the  TOP  study,  including  1  case  that  also reported a PE (Case ID 2012BI017603). Baseline demographics and characteristics of the 5 patients with DVTs are summarized in the Table below.

Table 31 Baseline Demographics and Characteristics of the patients with DVTs (N = 5)

As shown in Table 32, risk factors for thromboembolic disease were present in 3 of the 5 patients with DVT. The risk factors included use of contraceptives (2 patients) and use of an anti-HIV drug (Kaletra) known  to  be  associated  with  DVTs  (Kaletra  Prescribing  Information,  2013).  Severity  of  the  DVT  was assessed by the Investigator as severe in 2 patients, moderate in 2 and mild in 1. Outcome of the event at the time of the SAE report was 'Recovered' in 1 patient, 'Recovered with sequelae' in 2 patients, and 'Not recovered' in 2 patients. The event was assessed as unrelated in 4 patients and as possibly related in 1 patient by the Investigator.

## Laboratory findings

Anti-JC virus (JCV) antibody status was available for 10 of the patients with PML, and all 10 patients were anti-JCV antibody positive .

## Safety in special populations

As the proposed extension of indication is only related to prior disease modifying therapies the target population remains the same with regards to age.

## Elderly

Whilst the Clinical Trial safety database contains adequate patient numbers to assess any effect of gender or age up to 55 years on the safety profile, there are inadequate numbers of patients over this age to determine the safety profile in this older group of patients.

## Pediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only a small number of adolescents and children have been studied. Therefore, safety in the paediatric population  has  not  been  established,  although  an  open-label  repeat-dose  PK  and  safety  study  in paediatric patients aged 10 to less than 18 years old has been agreed with the Paediatric Committee at the EMA in relation to the paediatric investigation plan for natalizumab. The last patient completed this study in June 2014.

## Pregnant or breast feeding women

Immunohistological  studies  indicate  natalizumab  binds  to  the  placenta  and  foetal  tissues,  indicating  a potential  for  teratogenic  and/or  abortifacient  activity.  A  reproductive  toxicology  study  evaluating  the effects of natalizumab demonstrated no fetotoxicity or drug-related teratogenic effects.

The  Tysabri  pregnancy  exposure  registry  initially  enrolled  376  women  with  pregnancies  exposed  to Tysabri and outcome data from 355 completed pregnancies were obtained. There were 316 live births with  birth  defects  being  reported  in  29  of  these  infants.  An  additional  birth  defect  was  detected  in  a pregnancy which ended in elective termination. The rate of major birth defects in infants born to subjects with MS or CD exposed to Tysabri in the Registry was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.2%, 11.4%). The birth defects were  reviewed  at  the  end  of  the  study  by  an  Advisory  Committee  of  external  experts  in  relevant specialities  of  teratology,  epidemiology  and  maternal  and  foetal  medicine.  The  Advisory  Committee determined that 16 infants had defects which met criteria used by the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defect Program (MACDP), the comparator for the study, and the Committee's definition of major defects. These 16 infants from 317 pregnancies (316 live births plus defect in one elective termination) reflect a birth  defect  rate  of  5.05%  (95% CI: 2.9%, 8.1%). While this rate is higher than that reported in the MACDP (2.67%), the Advisory Committee did not observe patterns of defects that were suggestive of an unusual distribution and found no specific signals of concern.

There  were  32  spontaneous  abortions  reported  in  the  pregnancy  registry.  The  spontaneous  abortion reporting  rate  among  the  339  completed  pregnancies  enrolled  into  the  registry  prior  to  22  weeks gestation  was  9.4%  (95%  CI:  6.6%,  13.1%)  which  is  comparable  to  background  rates  of  15%-17% reported in the general population in the literature. (Anokute 1987, Ventura 2009).

Among the 840 serious adverse events reported for female patients in the TOP study as of May 1, 2015, there were a total of 25 events in 22 patients coded to the MedDRA (version 18.0) Preferred Term (PT) of spontaneous abortion.

The  25  spontaneous  abortions  (SA)  included  2  patients  with  multiple  SA  events  (one  patient  with  2 reports of SA and one patient with 3 reports of SA). Maternal age for these SA events ranged from 22 36 years (mean and median of 30.6 and 31, respectively). The distribution of events by country included 11 SA events reported from Germany, 6 from the Czech Republic, 2 from the Netherlands, and 1 for each of the following countries: Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom.

Five of the 22 patients did not have prior disease modifying therapy (DMT) reported. Of the 17 patients who  reported  prior  treatment  with  one  or  more  DMTs,  all  but  one  of  these  patients  received  prior interferon-beta and/or glatiramer acetate, and one patient received prior fingolimod.

Further detail on the Tysabri exposure in pregnancies that resulted in spontaneous abortion is provided in Table 34. The mean Tysabri exposure was similar for the SA events in which the last exposure to Tysabri occurred  prior  to  conception  and  those  in  which  the  last  exposure  to  Tysabri  occurred  at  less  than  8 weeks of gestation; however, the median exposure varied.

There were 215 pregnancies in the TOP study based on the number of pregnancies reported during the follow up visit. The rate of spontaneous abortions in TOP, using the number of reported pregnancies in the  denominator,  is  25/215  or  11.6%.  This  rate  is  consistent  with  the  rate  of  spontaneous  abortions estimated from the following populations:

1. Tysabri Pregnancy Registry (9% for all pregnancies and 15.9% for those pregnancies enrolled in the Registry prior to week 22 of gestation) (101MS401 CSR EMEA/H/C/000603/II/0074),
2. MS populations treated with glatiramer acetate and interferon beta (10 to 17% Alwan et al 2015; Coyle et al 2003, Coyle et al 2013, Richman et al 2012; Sandberg-Wollheim 2011)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. General population (15.9 to 17%, Anokute 1987; Ventura 2009).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

A total of 2104 subjects discontinued Tysabri (37.4%). Among those 2104 patients discontinued Tysabri, 1246 patients stayed on study, 855 withdrew from TOP, and 3 discontinued Tysabri after withdrew from TOP as of the date cut-off.  131  patients  (2.3%)  discontinued  due  to  Non-Serious  Adverse  Events,  62 patients (1.1%) discontinued due to Serious/Other Serious Adverse Event.

The overall rate of complete withdrawal from the study was 21.3%. For comparison the discontinuation rates in other EU registries such as Sweden, Austria and Denmark in 2014 were reported to be 48%, 38% and 42%, respectively.

The 5 most common reasons for discontinuation of Tysabri, in order of descending frequency were:

1. positive anti-JCV antibody status (14.1% of patients enrolled)
2. patient decision (7.7% of patients enrolled)
3. medication change (7.0% of patients enrolled)
4. insufficient efficacy (6% of patients enrolled)
5. physician decision (4.6% of patients enrolled)

The 5 most common reasons for withdrawal from TOP, in order of descending frequency were:

1. patient decision (4.8% of patients enrolled)
2. lost to follow up (3.1% of patients enrolled)
3. medication change (3.0% of patients enrolled)
4. withdrawal of consent (2.8% of patients enrolled)
5. positive anti-JCV antibody status (2.7% of patients enrolled)

The  reasons  for  discontinuation  and  the  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinue  Tysabri  treatment appeared to be similar across groups and independent of the previous DMT used before initiating Tysabri treatment

## Post marketing experience

Natalizumab is available in USA and all EU markets. In addition the drug is also approved in Australia, New Zealand,  Canada,  Israel,  India,  Russia,  Switzerland,  Japan  and  some  Middle  East,  North  African, South  American  and  South  East  Asian  countries.  In  USA  the  drug  is  also  approved  for  the  indication Crohn's Disease.

With  regards  to  identified  and  potential  risks  several  safety  postmarketing  actions  have  been  initiated which include conduct of clinical trials, MS Re-dosing protocol, TOUCH Surveillance Programme, TYGRIS Observational  Cohort  Study  and  a  Pregnancy  registry.  Furthermore  local  country  specific  registries (Sweden,  Denmark,  Italy,  France,  Austria,  Ireland)  are  being  performed  in  Europe,  with  the  majority being run by independent investigators.

As a result risk minimisation measures have been implemented, e.g. Updates to SmPC, Package Leaflet and Educational Guidance, Revisions to the Patient Alert Card and Implementation of Treatment Initiation and Continuation forms to be used prior to the start of treatment and at the 2-year treatment point.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The  TOP  study  patient  population  was  generally  well  balanced  between  the  subgroups  with  regard  to patient and disease characteristics.

The  MAH  presented  data  from  an  interim  analysis  (up  to  01  May  2015)  to  update  the  current  safety dataset. However, the updated safety data did not significantly increase the relevant safety dataset, likely

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

due  to  the  closure  date  for  enrollment  from  TOP  (December  2013,  except  for  Mexico  and  the  Czech republic where enrollment continues) compared to the recent EMA marketing authorization for the new DMT  [Teriflunomide  (August  2013);  Dimethyilfumarate  (January  2014);  Alemtuzumab  (September 2013)]: the number of patients who switched from teriflunomide to Tysabri increased from 6 to 7; the number of patients who switched from dimethyl fumarate to Tysabri remained 5; the number of patients who switched from fingolimod to Tysabri increased from 130 to 147. The total person-years of Tysabri exposure in the subgroup of patients who switched from fingolimod increased from 135.56 to 212. There were  no  subjects  enrolled  in  TOP  with  previous  exposure  to  alemtuzumab.    For  the  SOCs  with  the greatest number of SAEs (infections and infestations and in nervous system) 3 events each occurred in the  fingolimod  subgroup.  SAEs  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations  in  patients  who  previously received fingolimod, GA and interferon were 1.41, 1.32 and 1.19 per 100 patient years, respectively. The incidence rates for the SOC of Nervous system disorders were 1.41, 0.84 and 0.67 per 100 patient years, respectively.  For  the  remaining  SOCs  which  contained  only  a  single  SAE,  the  incidence  rates  were somewhat less similar among subgroups who last used fingolimod, GA or interferon.

For the 5 patients who switched to Tysabri from dimethyl fumarate, there were no SAEs reported. For the 7 patients who switched to Tysabri from teriflunomide, one SAE occurred (PT: sepsis and urinary tract infection). This single SAE with a PT of sepsis and urinary tract infection in the subgroup last exposed to teriflunomide  (subject  year  exposure  =  16  patient  years)  results  in  an  incidence  rate  of  6.21  per  100 patient years for the infections and infestations SOC. Although this rate is considerably greater than the incidence rate for those previously exposed to GA and interferon (1.32 and 1.19 per 100 patient years, respectively), it is acknowledged that due to the small sample size of those last exposed to teriflunomide it is not possible to draw conclusions on this comparison.

The distribution of the type of malignancies as well as the rate of spontaneous abortions in natalizumabtreated TOP patients was in general comparable to that observed in a general population.

In the initial submission, with a data cut of 01 May 2014, the MAH reported 30 cases of PML in the TOP study including 26 confirmed cases and 4 suspect cases. Based on the updated review as of 1 May 2015, 35  confirmed  cases  of  PML  have  been  reported  from  the  TOP  study.  None  of  the  35  confirmed  PML patients in TOP received fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide or alemtuzumab at any time prior to  initiating  Tysabri.      However  -due  to  the  limited  exposure  to  these  new  DMTs  in  the  overall  TOP population - this provides only very limited reassurance.

Safety findings were generally consistent with the current safety profile of Tysabri.

However, only a limited group of MS patients (147) in the TOP study received fingolimod prior to Tysabri and  only  7  and  5  patients  were  treated  with  teriflunomide  and  dimethyl  fumarate  prior  to  Tysabri, respectively. 3.8% of patients (n=215) received 'traditional' immunosuppressants (mitoxantrone, n=77, azathioprine,  n=  90,  cyclophosphamide,  n=24)  as  last  treatment  prior  to  starting  Tysabri.  The  small number  of  patients  and  the  low  natalizumab  exposure  to  new  DMTs  prevents  a  conclusive  safety evaluation.

As potential source of additional safety data in patients switching from other disease modifying therapies (DMT) to Tysabri the MAH identified the TOUCH prescribing program in the US and proposed that data from  it  be  used.  The  MAH  provided  data  on  SAEs  by  SOC  and  by  PT  listed  for  the  overall  TOUCH population (73.968 patients, total person years of Tysabri exposure: 192.641) and for the subgroup of patients who switched from fingolimod (1.710 patients, total person years of Tysabri exposure: 2.691), for  the  subgroup  who  switched  from  Dimethyl  fumarate  (1.783  patients,  total  person  years  of  Tysabri exposure: 2.691) and for the subgroup of patients who switched from Teriflunomide (274 patients, total person years of Tysabri exposure: 309).

TOUCH data provide only a rough safety estimate as no information has been provided with regard to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient  and  disease  characteristics,  thus  it  is  unknown  whether  the  patient  population  is  balanced between subgroup with regard to patient and disease characteristics.

The  incidence  density  of  at  least  1  SAE  was  similar  in  the  Overall  TOUCH  population  (3.98  per  100 patients-years)  and  in  the  subgroups  according to prior  DMT  (switched  from  fingolimod:  3.60  per  100 patients-years; switched from dimethyl fumarate 3.27 per 100 patients-years; switched from teriflunomide 3.23 per 100 patients-years).

The incidence density of SAEs by  SOCs in the subgroups of patients who switched from fingolimod or from Dimethyl fumarate do not seem to exceed those of the overall TOUCH population; the Applicant states that the incidence of SAEs by SOC in the subgroup of patients who switched from teriflunomide is less  comparable  due  to  due  to  the  relatively  small  sample  size  (N=274)  compared  to  the  overall  TOP population (N=73.968) and the small number of events (4 or fewer) of events within each SOC and this is acknowledged.

The comparison of SAEs by PT in the three above mentioned subgroups compared to the overall TOUCH population is difficult due to the small number of events within each PT in the prior fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide subgroups, thus no conclusions may be drawn.

The major safety concern elicited by the therapy with new DMTs, all endowed with immunosuppressive activity, prior to switching to Tysabri is the occurrence of opportunistic infections, and above all the risk of developing PML.

Indeed  PML  cases  have  been  recently  recorded  also  in  patient  treated  with  fingolimod  and  dimethyl fumarate containing products, independently of Tysabri exposure.

Post  marketing data indicate that PML occurs in about 0.1/1000 in JCV negative patients treated with natalizumab and ranges from 1 to 11/1000 in JCV positive patients according to treatment duration and prior  immunosuppressant  use.  In  addition,  natalizumab  withdrawal  because  of  progressive  multifocal leukoencephalopathy almost always triggers an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome that may lead to neurological complications or even death.

35 PML confirmed cases were recorded in the TOP study. 6 patients (17.1%) received prior IS therapy. The prior IS therapies included mitoxantrone in 4 patients, azathioprine in 3 patients and cyclophosphamide in 1 patient. Two patients received more than one IS therapy including 1 patient who received  cyclophosphamide  and  azathioprine,  and  another  patient  who  received  mitoxantrone  and azathioprine. One patient received 2 different treatment regimens of mitoxantrone (approximately 31.5 months  apart).  None  of  the  35  PML  patients  in  TOP  received  prior  fingolimod,  dimethyl  fumarate  or teriflunomide at any time prior to initiation of Tysabri.

Of the 35 confirmed PML patients in the TOP study, 25 patients (71.4%) had anti-JCV antibody testing performed  prior  to  the  PML  diagnosis  and  all  tested  positive;  3  patients  had  anti-JCV  antibody  tested positive at an unspecified time; and 7 PML patients did not have available anti- JCV antibody test results. In these 7 PML patients (all from the EU), the diagnosis of PML occurred before the anti-JCV antibody assay became commercially available in the EU.

As  a  risk  minimization  measure  for  PML,  the  MAH  proposed  to  insert,  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC, information on the need to consider the half-life and mode of action of the previous DMT when switching patients from another DMT to Tysabri, in order to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time minimising the risk of disease reactivation. Furthermore, the MAH proposed to list the 5 specific IS therapies  (mitoxantrone,  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  cyclophosphamide  and  mycophenolate  mofetil) used more frequently among PML and non-PML Tysabri-treated patients in the TOP, TYGRIS and STRATA studies. A Complete Blood Count is recommended prior to initiating Tysabri to ensure that immune effects of  the  previous  therapy  (i.e.  cytopenia)  have  resolved.  As  alemtuzumab  has  a  profound  prolonged

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immunosuppressive effect and as the actual duration  of  these  effects is  unknown,  initiating  treatment with Tysabri after alemtuzumab will not be recommended.

In principle, the proposed risk minimization measures are deemed appropriate. However, for the moment it  is  unknown  whether  use  of  new  DMTs  with  an  immunosuppressive  mechanism  of  action  prior  to switching to Tysabri is associated with the same increased PML risk as 'traditional immunosuppressants'. Indeed,  complete  safety  information  on  a  rare  event  such  as  PML  may  be  acquired  only  with  post marketing clinical experience over years, and thus it is impossible to evaluate and quantify at present the added risk of new DMTs to the development of PML following Tysabri exposure.

As acknowledged by the Applicant in previous PSURs, the available information on prior IS use in the overall Tysabri treated population and in confirmed PML cases is very limited. The limited data available do not allow to identify any pattern or trend with regard to PML risk and the specific types of IS therapies. In this regard, the addition of 5 specific IS therapies in the SmPC and Educational material is considered inappropriate.

Based on the available PSUR data (coming from STRATA, TOP and TYGRIS), no specific pattern or trend on  duration  of  the  wash-out  period  for  'traditional  immunosuppressants'  therapy  prior  to  Tysabri  has been observed. PML risk appears to be present with both short and long wash-out periods.

In line with these previous findings, the TOP data submitted for this variation show that the frequency of ever prior 'traditional immunosuppressants' use in PML patients enrolled in the TOP study was 26.7%, compared to 13.8% in the overall TOP population. Conversely, the frequency of 'traditional immunosuppressants' use as last therapy prior to switching to Tysabri was similar between PML patients (3.3%) and overall TOP population (3.6%). At present, this is accounted for in the Tysabri SmPC by a dedicated warning in section 4.4.

It is at present not known if ever prior use of new DMTs is a risk factor for PML occurrence after Tysabri treatment  independently  of  the  time  at  which  the  exposure  occurred.  The  proposed  risk  minimisation measures (to consider the half-life and mode of action of the other therapy in order to avoid an additive immune effect) are endorsed. However, it is currently unknown if these measures are sufficient to avoid an increased PML risk in patients treated with new DMTs. Furthermore, lymphocyte cell count alone may not be a sufficient risk minimisation measure. Also number and/or function of lymphocyte subsets may be important for immune function recovery to occur. Only future additional data coming from post-marketing activities will allow to determine whether further specific risk minimization measures will be necessary for instance to better evaluate patients' immunocompetence status.

The MAH provided on request from the CHMP a comparative analysis on the similarity between US and EU patients on Tysabri. The comparison provided by the MAH of the US and EU patient-subgroups included in STRATIFY-2 (all patients from US), TOP (all patients from EU) and TYGRIS (patients from EU and US) showed  some  differences  in  demographic  characteristics  between  EU  and  US  patient  population; furthermore,  between-study  and  between-geographic  variation  was  observed  for  the  three  known  risk factors for PML in Tysabri treated patients (positive anti-JCV antibody status, prior immunosuppressant use  and  duration  of  treatment),  in  particular  for  the  proportion  of  prior  IS  use  in  the  TYGRIS  EU population.  A  direct  comparison  of  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  in  the  EU  and  US  patient population is not possible from available data, as the baseline disease characteristics (as measured by EDSS and ARR) data have not been collected within TOUCH

In  light  of  the  higher  number  of  patients  with  prior  IS  use  and  anti-JCV  antibodies  in  the  TYGRIS  EU population  and  considering  that  differences  in  PML  incidences  between  EU  and  US  patients  have  been observed in the past it is considered mandatory to also include patients with prior IS use in the planned analysis. This will also allow for the investigation of a potential cumulative risk for PML in patients  with prior IS use switching from newer DMT's to Tysabri.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion, the comparability of EU and US patients was not fully demonstrated. The MAH plans to assess the feasibility of including EU data.

Regarding the strategy proposed by the MAH to collect post-authorisation safety data relying mainly on the  TOUCH  program  mainly  data  from  US  patients  will  be  used  to  assess  the  PML  risk  for  patients switching  from  newer  DMT's  to  Tysabri.  In  order  to  assess  infrequent  events  such  as  PML  and  other opportunistic infections in patients switching from the newer DMTs, the MAH has proposed to undertake an  observational  cohort  study  utilizing  all  available  data  fields  collected  within  the  Tysabri  TOUCH prescribing program in the US. However, collection of data beyond the dataset agreed with the FDA (e.g. EDSS,  ARR),  is  not  feasible  in  this  cohort  because  the  MAH  does  not  unilaterally  control  the  TOUCH program which is carried out in conjunction with the FDA. This is a prospective study which will include all TOUCH MS patients and will run for a period of 8 years, with an anticipated end-date of 2023.

Additionally  the  MAH  should  also  commit to  review  the  feasibility  of  including  EU-patient  data  utilising existing registries, and should this be unfeasible, commit to set up a dedicated registry in the EU, in order to  address  the  issue  of  missing  data  from  EU  patients.    Even  though  it  is  acknowledged  that  this  will require  additional  time  to  set-up,  it  is  considered  mandatory  to  gain  safety  data  in  the  long  term  in European Tysabri-treated patients switching from a new DMT.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of Tysabri evaluated in TOP did not show major differences regarding SAEs (incidence, type, frequency), malignancies or PML incidence rates compared to the currently known safety profile of Tysabri. Safety findings were consistent within the subgroups. The lower incidence of SAEs observed in the  fingolimod  subgroup  compared  to  the  total  population  could  be  a  result  of  the  lower  exposure  to natalizumab in this subgroup. However, the overall safety of Tysabri after the use of new DMTs is  at present  incompletely  characterized  mainly  because  of  the  limited  number  of  patients  who  received fingolimod  treatment  prior  to  Tysabri  and  to  the  extremely  low  number  of  patients  who  received teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate, the short Tysabri exposure after fingolimod treatment, the lack of data on duration of exposure to first-line DMTs.

Currently  PML  represents  the  main  safety  concern  for  treatment  with  Tysabri  also  with  regards  to  a possible increase in the frequency of PML events due to the sequential use and possible cumulative effect of new DMTs with immunosuppressive activity and Tysabri. In this regard it has to be mentioned that PML cases have also been reported for DMF and fingolimod. However, due to the recent approval status only limited data are currently available on the risk for PML with these drugs.

Adequate information on the limited-absence of data for patients switching from new DMTs to Tysabri should be provided in the SmPC for the prescriber.

As  long  as  conclusive  data  are  not  available,  patients  with  prior  use  of  another  DMT  with  an immunosuppressive effect, in a conservative approach must be considered as having a PML risk equal to patients  who  received  immunosuppressants  prior  to  receiving  Tysabri.  This  information  should  be adequately reflected in the SmPC, Physician Information and Management Guidelines.

Since safety information on a rare event such as PML may be acquired only with post marketing clinical experience  over  years,  the  Applicant  committed  to  collect  post-authorisation  safety  data  on  Tysabri treatment  in  MS  patients  who  were  previously  treated  with  at  least  one  DMT  including  teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, fingolimod.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

The CHMP adopted changes to the existing indication as follows:

'TYSABRI is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in adults with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups:

-  Adult Patients aged 18 years and over with high ly active disease activity despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or

-  Adult Patients aged 18 years and over with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI'.

Additionally and as a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## (DMT) (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1) a beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate.

These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'non-responder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

To support the change to the approved indication for Tysabri, efficacy data are derived from the ongoing Tysabri Observational Program (TOP), an observational study of patients receiving Tysabri, through an interim Clinical Study Report using a cut-off date of May 1, 2014.

In the overall TOP population, ARR decreased from 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.96, 2.01) in the pretreatment  year  to  0.22  (95%  CI:  0.21,  0.24)  while  on  natalizumab  therapy  (p  &lt;  0.0001)  and remained stable over 5 years. A significant reduction in ARR with natalizumab occurred in patients who were either DMT naïve, had taken only 1 DMT or had taken &gt;1 DMT prior to dosing with natalizumab (p &lt; 0.0001), with greater reductions seen in patients who were either DMT naïve or had taken only 1 DMT prior to dosing with natalizumab.

When looking at the three subgroup of patients with interferon, glatiramer acetate or fingolimod as last therapy received prior to natalizumab, in all three subgroups there was a significant reduction in ARR while on natalizumab treatment compared to pretreatment year (GA subgroup ARR decreased from 1.98 in the pre-treatment year to 0.24 while on natalizumab therapy; beta interferon subgroup ARR decreased from 1.98 to 0.21; fingolimod subgroup ARR decreased from 2.06 to 0.38; p&lt;0.0001).

For  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta interferon the reduction in ARR remained stable over 5 years. For patients whose last therapy prior to dosing with natalizumab was fingolimod, the reduction in ARR remained stable over 2 years. Data for the fingolimod subgroup after the 2 year period are less meaningful due to the smaller sample size (n=22 at 3 years; n ≤ 4 after 3 years).

Mean EDSS scores were similar from Baseline (3.5) to Year 5 (3.2) in the overall TOP population patients treated with natalizumab. Similar results were seen for the subgroups of patients whose last therapy prior to  dosing  with  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta  interferon.  For  the  fingolimod  subgroup,  less  meaningful conclusions may be obtained due to the limited sample size ad due to the shorter Tysabri exposure (n=51 at year 1, n=15 at year 2 and n ≤ 4 after the 2 year period). From the limited data available, mean EDSS scores were similar from Baseline to Year 2.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The majority of patients treated with natalizumab in the TOP study received as last treatment prior to starting Tysabri either beta interferon (n= 3210, 57%) or glatiramer acetate (GA) (n= 1354, 24%); only a small subgroup of patients received fingolimod (n=130, 2.3%); very few patients received teriflunomide or  dimethyl  fumarate  (6  and  5  patients,  respectively);  215  patients  (3.8%)  received  'traditional' immunosuppressants (mitoxantrone, n=77, azathioprine, n= 90, cyclophosphamide, n=24). Furthermore, the subgroup of patients who received fingolimod as last therapy before natalizumab was exposed to a lower  number  of  Tysabri  infusions  (mean  14.29)  compared  to  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last therapy  before  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta  interferon;  (mean  29  and  31  natalizumab  infusions, respectively). In particular, only 21 patients out of 130 (16%) were exposed to Tysabri for &gt;24 months.

No  efficacy  data  have  been  provided  for  patients  switching  from  other  DMTs  (teriflunomide,  DMF)  to Tysabri  but  efficacy  of  Tysabri  could  be  expected  due  to  disease  related  indication  for  these  drugs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(teriflunomide, DMF for mild to moderate RRMS, Tysabri for highly active disease).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  TOP  study  was  designed  as  a  safety  non-interventional/  observational  study.  No  data  have  been provided from a randomized controlled clinical trial to support the proposed extension of indication for Tysabri.

On the basis of available data coming from the observational TOP study, in a small subgroup (n=147) of patients  treated  with  fingolimod  prior  to  switching  to  natalizumab,  the  Applicant  stated  that  safety findings were generally consistent regardless if the patient's last therapy before natalizumab infusion was GA, beta-interferon or fingolimod.

The  incidence  density  of  at  least  1  SAE  was  similar  in  the  Overall  TOUCH  population  (3.98  per  100 patients-years)  and  in  the  subgroups  according to prior  DMT  (switched  from  fingolimod:  3.60  per  100 patients-years; switched from dimethyl fumarate 3.27 per 100 patients-years; switched from teriflunomide  3.23  per  100  patients-years).  However,  the  incidence  density  of  SAEs  by  SOCs  in  the subgroups  of  patients  who  switched  from  teriflunomide  is  less  comparable  due  to  the  relatively  small sample size and the small number of events (4 or fewer) of events.

The major safety concern with natalizumab treatment is the risk of developing PML, as reflected by the 35  PML  cases  that  occurred  in  TOP  study.  Among  risk  factors  for  PML  there  is  the  previous  use  of immunosuppressive  drugs.  The  new  DMTs  are  all  endowed  with  immunosuppressive  activity  and  thus may increase the risk of PML following Tysabri especially for patients switching from fingolimod and DMF. Moreover, PML cases have been reported both in patients treated with fingolimod as well as after the administration of dimethyl fumarate containing products, independently of Tysabri exposure.

Of the 35 confirmed cases of PML in the TOP study, 6 (17.1%) received prior IS therapy. The prior IS therapies  included  mitoxantrone,  azathioprine  and  cyclophosphamide.  None  of  the  35  confirmed  PML patients in TOP received fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide or alemtuzumab at any time prior to  initiating  Tysabri.  However  -due  to  the  limited  exposure  to  these  new  DMTs  in  the  overall  TOP population this provides only very limited reassurance.

Among important  Tysabri  potential  risks,  there  is  the  occurrence  of  malignancies.  In  the  TOP  interim analysis there were 60 patients (1.1%) diagnosed with a neoplasm, and 41 of these events in 39 patients (0.7%) were malignant. Further data with longer exposures are needed in order to assess whether the use of other DMT with an immunosuppressive effect prior to switching to Tysabri are associated with an increased risk of malignancies. This issue will need discussion in upcoming PSURs.

In  the  TOP  study  there  were two deaths due to pulmonary embolism, a total of 8 SAEs of pulmonary embolism, and 5 SAEs of deep vein thrombosis.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The Applicant updated safety data from the TOP study (last interim analysis up to 1 May 2015). However, these  safety  data  did  not  significantly  increase  the  relevant  safety  dataset.  TOP  data  include  only  a limited number of patients (147) who switched from fingolimod to Tysabri, followed up for a relative short time  (212  person-years  of  exposure).  Only  7  patients  included  in  TOP  switched  from  teriflunomide  to Tysabri and only 5 switched from dimethyl fumarate to Tysabri. As potential source of additional safety data in patients switching from other disease modifying therapies (DMT) to Tysabri the MAH identified the TOUCH prescribing program in the US.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is at present not known if differences exist between 'traditional' immunosuppressants and 'new DMT'endowed  with  immunosuppressive  activity  as  risk  factors  for  the  occurrence  of  PML  events  following Tysabri  administration.  Currently,  no  conclusive  safety  data  for  patients  switching  from  other  DMTs (teriflunomide, DMF, fingolimod) to Tysabri are available.

Due  to  the  variability  in  duration  and  washout  periods  of  prior  traditional  immunosuppressants  use between the PML and non-PML TOP population no conclusions may be drawn on this comparison.

Weight was not collected in TOP, thus the MAH is unable to provide data regarding the weight of patients with PML

Present  data  do  not  allow  for  comparison  of  the  frequency  and  type  of  malignancies  observed  in natalizumab-treated TOP patients with those occurring in the patient population with MS of comparable age  not  treated  with  natalizumab.  Further  data  with  longer  exposures  are  needed  in  order  to  assess whether  the  use  of  other  DMT  with  an  immunosuppressive  effect  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  are associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  malignancies.  Further  post-authorisation  safety  data  should  be collected.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Efficacy  of  Tysabri  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  past  and  is  supported  by  the  TOP  study.  Treatment options for patients with highly active RRMS are limited. Efficacious treatment is important in this patient population. Insufficient therapy can lead to an increase of relapse rates and disabilities. The possibility of switching to Tysabri after only one DMT could contribute to the patient's benefit.

Currently, the indication of Tysabri is limited to patients who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course  of  IFN-β  or  GA.  The  MAHs  proposal  to  extend  the  indication  for  Tysabri  is  comprehensible considering the introduction of new therapeutic options in the MS treatment over the past years and the corresponding changes to current MS treatment guidelines.

From  a  biological  perspective,  there  is  no  reason  to  suspect  that  Tysabri  efficacy  should  be  different according to the type of first line DMT. Thus the administration of Tysabri after any first line DMT would allow a larger number of MS patients to benefit from the treatment with a very efficacious drug.

Safety  information  on  a  rare  event  such  as  PML  may  be  acquired  only  with  post  marketing  clinical experience over years, so, at present, it is not possible to definitely evaluate the risk of PML for new MS DMTs or to quantify the potential increase in PML events following administration of different DMTs and Tysabri.

Conclusive data for patients with prior use of recently approved DMT switching to Tysabri are currently limited/  not  available.  Consequently,  estimation  of  the  PML  risk  for  these  patients  is  not  possible. Therefore, patients with prior use of  these DMT must be considered and treated as having a PML risk equal to patients with prior use of immunosuppressants.

Adequate information on the limited/absence of data for patients switching from new DMTs to Tysabri should be provided in the SmPC for the prescriber.

## Benefit-risk balance

The clinical  course  of  RRMS  is  characterized  by  a  high  inter-individual  variability.  A  subset  of  patients presents with severe disease activity, defined by a high load of active lesions and frequent relapses that are very likely to progress to sustained disability with all related complications. If these patients show an inadequate response to a first-line therapy the treating physician should have the possibility to administer a second-line treatment such as Tysabri, after careful consideration of the individual benefit/risk balance.

Conversely,  there  is  also  a  subset  of  MS  patients  for  whom  sequential  courses  with  more  than  one disease  modifying  agent  could  be  reasonably  considered  before  starting  a  second-line  therapy  with  a worse safety profile. This is correctly reflected in the wording of the indication which states after 'at least one'  disease  modifying  treatment.  Because  of  its  safety  profile,  Tysabri  should  be  used  when  other treatments are viewed as not appropriate or inefficacious, on a case by case basis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main safety concern that the use of Tysabri after treatment with new DMTs generates is the potential increase in PML frequency due to the fact that previous treatment with 'traditional' immunosuppressants is  a  known  risk  factor  for  PML  occurrence.  Due  to  the  rarity  of  PML  further  information  may  only  be acquired  with  post  marketing  clinical  experience  over  years  and  the  MAH  committed  to  systematically gather additional data on the safety of Tysabri treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one DMT including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, fingolimod.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

DMTs like GA, beta-interferon, teriflunomide and DMF are first line treatment options for mild to moderate forms of RRMS. In case of disease worsening DMTs are usually insufficient and these patients are in need for  more  effective  treatment  options.  For  patients  with  highly  active  RRMS  these  options  include natalizumab.  In  the  past  efficacy  of  Tysabri  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  treatment  of  highly  active RRMS. TOP provided additional efficacy data (ARR, EDSS) for patients with prior GA, beta-interferon and fingolimod therapy although for the latter the dataset is limited.

Although data on the efficacy of Tysabri after failure of first-line treatment with the newest DMTs were limited they were considered sufficient. Moreover it was recognized by the CHMP, that given the current situation,  and  the  available  therapeutic  options  in  clinical  practice,  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect separate  efficacy  data  to  be  provided  in  patients  treated  with  each  of  the  marketed  drugs  before switching to Tysabri.

However,  the  main  safety  concern  elicited  by  the  sequential  therapy  of  new  DMTs,  all  endowed  with immunosuppressive  activity,  and  Tysabri  is  the  occurrence  of  infections,  and  above  all  the  risk  of developing PML. Indeed PML cases have been recently recorded also in patient treated with fingolimod and  dimethyl  fumarate  containing  products,  independently  of  Tysabri  exposure.  A  recent  abstract presented at the American Academy of Neurology in Washington (Herbert et al, 2015) suggested that increasing Tysabri dosing interval may be a strategy for mitigating risk of PML while maintaining efficacy. In this regard, it is of note that about 40% of patients in the TOP study did not receive Tysabri every month.

A Complete Blood Count is recommended prior to initiating Tysabri to ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved. As alemtuzumab has a profound prolonged immunosuppressive effect and as the actual duration  of  these effects  is  unknown,  initiating  treatment with TYSABRI after alemtuzumab is not recommended unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient.

In general, it is agreed that in case of sequential use of new DMTs and Tysabri, information in the SmPC on how to avoid additive immunosuppression is needed. However, up to now it is unknown whether new DMTs with an immunosuppressive mechanism of action are associated with the same increased PML risk as  'traditional  immunosuppressants'  when  administered  prior  to  Tysabri.  Indeed,  complete  safety information on a rare event such as PML may be acquired only with post marketing clinical experience over years, and thus it is impossible to evaluate and quantify at present the added risk of new DMTs to the development of PML following Tysabri exposure.  The limited data available do not allow to identify any pattern or trend with regard to PML risk and the specific types of IS therapies. In this regard, the addition of  specific  recommendations  with  regard  to  specific  prior  immunosuppressant  therapies  in  the SmPC of Tysabri and the Educational material is considered inappropriate.

Based on the available PSUR data (coming from STRATA, TOP and TYGRIS), no specific pattern or trend on  duration  of  the  wash-out  period  for  'traditional  immunosuppressants'  therapy  prior  to  Tysabri  has been observed. PML risk appears to be present with both short and long wash-out periods.

As  long  as  more  complete  data  are  not  available,  patients  with  prior  use  of  another  DMT  with  an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immunosuppressive  effect  should  be  considered  as  having  a  PML  risk  equal  to  patients  who  received immunosuppressants prior to receiving Tysabri.

The Applicant committed to systematically gather additional data on the safety of Tysabri treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one DMT including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, fingolimod.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Tysabri

As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the SmPC were updated in order to provide physicians with more options for treating RRMS patients with high disease activity who fail a full and adequate course of treatment with disease modifying therapy (DMT). Consequential changes were also introduced in sections 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 of the SmPC.

The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 18.
