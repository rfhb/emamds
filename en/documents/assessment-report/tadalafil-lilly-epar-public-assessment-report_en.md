## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. submitted on 2 November 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tadalafil Lilly, through the centralised procedure. As this application concerns active substance already authorised via the centralised procedure, 'automatic' access was granted by the CHMP on 13 October 2016.

The applicant applied for the following indications:

- Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.
- Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males (for the 5mg strength only).

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC - relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder for an authorised medicinal product.

The application submitted is composed of administrative information, quality, non-clinical and clinical data with a letter from a MAH Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data.

This application is submitted as a multiple of Cialis authorised on 12 November 2002in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Not applicable

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP were:

Rapporteur: Concepcion Prieto Yerro Co-Rapporteur:   Bruno Sepodes

PRAC Rapporteur: Dolores Montero Corominas

- The application was received by the EMA on 2 November 2016.
- The procedure started on 28 November 2016.
- The CHMP and PRAC Rapporteurs' joint Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 3 January 2017.
- During the PRAC meeting on 12 January 2017, endorsed the relevant sections of the joint CHMP/PRAC Assessment Report.
- The CHMP and PRAC Rapporteurs' updated joint Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 20 January 2017.
- The CHMP and PRAC Rapporteurs' revised updated joint Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 24 January 2017.
- During the meeting on 26 January 2017, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to Tadalafil Lilly.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

The MAH for Cialis, has provided consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical documentation contained in the file of Cialis, assessed and approved. As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of Tadalafil Lilly are identical to the up to date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Cialis.

The application for Tadalafil Lilly concerns the strengths of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20mg film-coated tablets and consists only of Module 1 information.

The benefit-risk of Tadalafil Lilly is considered to be positive, as it is a duplicate of Cialis, for which the B/R is positive in the following indications:

- Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males for Cialis 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20mg film-coated tablets.
- Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males for Cialis 5 mg film-coated tablets.

Tadalafil is an orally administered phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific PDE5. As a treatment for erectile dysfunction, when sexual stimulation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

causes the local release of nitric oxide, inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Tadalafil has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.

This effect is also observed in the smooth muscle of the prostate, the bladder and their vascular supply. The resulting vascular relaxation increases blood perfusion which may be the mechanism by which symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are reduced.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Cialis application, the quality data in support of the Tadalafil Lilly application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Cialis dossier, which has been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Since Tadalafil Lilly application is an informed consent of Cialis application, the non-clinical data in support of Tadalafill Lilly application is identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Cialis dossier which has been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The Applicant has provided an ERA, comprising an estimation of exposure (Phase I) and an initial environmental fate and effects analysis (Phase II, Tier A) for tadalafil.  Since in Tier A a potential risk for the medicinal product to the environment has not been identified, a Phase II Tier B assessment does not need to be conducted. Moreover, tadalafil is not classified as a PBT drug substance, although temperature adjusted DT50 values in aquatic sediment systems  met the criteria for very persistent (vP). The company included in SmPC 6.6 the statement: Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Considering the above tadalafil is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

RMP version 7.1 refers to both Adcirca and Cialis/Tadalafil Lilly. However, Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and such risks do not apply.

## Conclusion

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.1 is acceptable.

## 2.6. PSUR submission

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## 2.8. Product information

## 2.8.1. User consultation

Since Tadalafil Lilly application is an informed consent of Cialis application, the product information (PI) for Tadalafil Lilly 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets is identical to the up-to-date PI of Cialis, with the only exception of the name of the medicinal product.

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

Tadalafil Lilly film-coated tablets are identical to Cialis film-coated tablets, the CHMP has previously reviewed data on quality, safety and efficacy of Cialis and considered the benefit/risk balance favourable.

Therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indications:

- •
- Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males. In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women.
- Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males.

## 4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy and in accordance with the originator Cialis, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Tadalafil Lilly is favourable in the following indication:

For Tadalafil Lilly 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets:

Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males.

In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.

Tadalafil Lilly is not indicated for use by women.

For Tadalafil Lilly 5 mg film-coated tablets:
