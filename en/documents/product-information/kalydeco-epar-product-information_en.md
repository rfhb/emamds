## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Kalydeco tablets are indicated:

- As monotherapy for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the following gating (Class III) mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene: G551D , G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , S1251N , S1255P , S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
- In a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272 -26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T .

- In a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one non-Class I mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Kalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. If the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 4.1). The phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be determined in accordance with local clinical recommendations.

## Kalydeco in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

There are a limited number of patients who harbour mutations not listed in Table 6 that may be responsive to ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (IVA/TEZ/ELX). In these cases, ivacaftor (IVA) in combination with IVA/TEZ/ELX can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision. This excludes patients with two Class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) as they are not expected to respond to modulator therapy (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1).

## Posology

Adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older should be dosed according to Table 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6 hours have passed since the time the dose is usually taken, the patient should be advised to wait until the next scheduled dose.

Patients receiving Kalydeco in a combination regimen should be advised not to take more than one dose of either medicinal product at the same time.

## Concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors

During concomitant administration with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A, the ivacaftor dose should be adjusted as detailed in Table 2. Dosing intervals should be modified according to clinical response and tolerability (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Special populations

## Elderly

Very limited data are available for elderly patients treated with ivacaftor (administered as monotherapy or in a combination regimen). No dose adjustment specific to this patient population is required (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A).

In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), the ivacaftor dose should be adjusted as detailed in Table 3 (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of ivacaftor as monotherapy have not been established in children less than 1 month of age or in children less than 6 months of age born prematurely (less than 37 weeks of gestational age), neither in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children less than 6 years of age or in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in children less than 2 years of age. No data are available.

Limited data are available in patients less than 6 years of age with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. Available data in patients aged 6 years and older are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.

## Method of administration

For oral use.

Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or broken before swallowing because there are no clinical data currently available to support other methods of administration.

Ivacaftor tablets should be taken with fat-containing food.

Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Only patients with CF who had a G551D , G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , S1251N , S1255P , S549N , S549R gating (Class III), G970R or R117H mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene were included in studies 770-102, 770-103, 770-111 and 770-110 (see section 5.1).

In study 770-111, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change in the sweat chloride test was &lt; 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant improvement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R mutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1).

Efficacy results from a phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of ivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of ivacaftor as monotherapy in these patients is not recommended.

Less evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H-7T mutation associated with less severe disease in study 770-110 (see section 5.1).

Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor should not be prescribed in patients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have a second CFTR mutation not listed in section 4.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury

In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, liver failure leading to transplantation has been reported while receiving ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. This medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, portal hypertension) and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

Moderate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are common in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated with ivacaftor as monotherapy and in combination regimens with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. In patients taking ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these elevations have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Therefore, assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For all patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT or AST &gt; 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN with bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN), dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Use of ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, is not recommended in patients aged 6 years and older with severe hepatic impairment unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. These patients should not be treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see Table 3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2).

For patients aged 6 years and older with moderate hepatic impairment, use of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor is not recommended. Treatment should only be considered when there is a clear medical need and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2).

## Depression

Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients while receiving ivacaftor, mainly in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, usually occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.

## Renal impairment

Caution is recommended while using ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Mutations unlikely to respond to modulator therapy

Patients with a genotype consisting of two CFTR mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein (i.e., two Class I mutations) are not expected to respond to CFTR modulator therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical studies comparing ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor

No clinical study has been conducted to directly compare ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor in patients not harbouring F508del variants.

## Patients after organ transplantation

Ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with ciclosporin or tacrolimus.

## Rash events

The incidence of rash events with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking hormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and hormonal contraceptives should be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor without hormonal contraceptives is appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see section 4.8).

## Interactions with medicinal products

## CYP3A inducers

Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the loss of ivacaftor efficacy; therefore, co-administration of ivacaftor with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## CYP3A inhibitors

Exposure to ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor are increased when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of ivacaftor must be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.5).

## Paediatric population

Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric patients treated with ivacaftor and ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment (see section 5.3).

## Excipients with known effect

## Lactose

This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and a potential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for P-gp.

## Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor

## CYP3A inducers

Co-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. Co-administration of ivacaftor with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), is not recommended (see section 4.4).

No dose adjustment is recommended when ivacaftor is used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers.

## CYP3A inhibitors

Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is recommended for co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4).

Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is recommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole, erythromycin, and verapamil (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4).

Co-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with ivacaftor (see section 4.2).

## Potential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters

In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro . Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of ivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be clinically relevant.

## Ciprofloxacin

Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose adjustment is required when ivacaftor is co-administered with ciprofloxacin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medicinal products affected by ivacaftor

Administration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.

## CYP2C9 substrates

Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is recommended during co-administration of warfarin with ivacaftor. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution.

## Digoxin and other P-gp substrates

Co-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used.

## CYP3A substrates

Co-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A substrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are co-administered with ivacaftor.

## Hormonal contraceptives

Ivacaftor has been studied with an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive and was found to have no significant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is necessary.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in pregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of ivacaftor during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Limited data show that ivacaftor is excreted into human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

There are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on fertility in rats (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ivacaftor has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness (see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older who received ivacaftor are headache (23.9%), oropharyngeal pain (22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), nasal congestion (20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), nasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), dizziness (9.2%), rash (12.8%) and bacteria in sputum (12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in 12.8% of ivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of placebo-treated patients.

In patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion (26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%), and bacteria in sputum (11.8%).

Serious adverse reactions included abdominal pain (0.9%) and transaminase elevations (1.8%) in patients who received ivacaftor, while serious adverse reactions of rash were reported in 1.5% patients aged 12 years and older treated with a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see section 4.4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 4 reflects the adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor monotherapy in clinical trials (placebocontrolled and uncontrolled studies) in which the length of exposure to ivacaftor ranged from 16 weeks to 144 weeks. Additional adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor and/or in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor are also provided in Table 4. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Transaminase elevations

During the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 770-102 and 770-103 of ivacaftor as monotherapy in patients aged 6 years and older, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5 or &gt; 3 × ULN was 3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% in ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo-treated patients, respectively. Two patients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases, each &gt; 8 × ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN. In ivacaftor-treated patients, most transaminase elevations up to 5 × ULN resolved without treatment interruption. Ivacaftor dosing was interrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations &gt; 5 × ULN. In all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4).

During the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks) of tezacaftor/ivacaftor, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, or &gt; 3 × ULN were 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in tezacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient (0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. No patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor experienced a transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN.

During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these figures were 1.5%, 2.5%, and 7.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5%, and 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations was 10.9% in ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients.

Post-marketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported (see section 4.4).

## Rash events

In study 445-102, the incidence of rash events (e.g., rash, rash pruritic) was 10.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 6.5% in placebo-treated patients. The rash events were generally mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of rash events by patient sex was 5.8% in males and 16.3% in females in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 4.8% in males and 8.3% in females in placebo-treated patients. In patients treated with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, the incidence of rash events was 20.5% in females taking hormonal contraceptive and 13.6% in females not taking hormonal contraceptive (see section 4.4).

## Increased creatine phosphokinase

In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase &gt; 5 x the ULN was 10.4% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 5.0% in placebo-treated patients. The observed creatine phosphokinase elevations were generally transient and asymptomatic and many were preceded by exercise. No ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients discontinued treatment for increased creatine phosphokinase.

## Increased blood pressure

In study 445-102, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic).

The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients compared with 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively in placebo-treated patients.

## Paediatric population

## Ivacaftor as monotherapy

Safety of ivacaftor as monotherapy for 24 weeks was evaluated in 43 patients between 1 month to less than 24 months of age (with 7 of them less than 4 months old), 34 patients between 2 to less than 6 years of age, 61 patients between 6 to less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to less than 18 years of age.

The safety profile of ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen) is generally consistent among paediatric patients and is also consistent with adult patients.

The incidence of transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) observed in studies 770-103, 770-111 and 770-110 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years), study 770-108 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years), and study 770-124 (patients aged 1 to less than 24 months) are described in Table 5. In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of transaminase elevations were similar between treatment with ivacaftor (15.0%) and placebo (14.6%). Peak LFT elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. Across all populations, peak LFT elevations returned to baseline levels following interruption, and in almost all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive rechallenge were observed.

In study 770-108 ivacaftor was permanently discontinued in one patient. In study 770-124, in the cohort of patients aged 1 month to less than 4 months, a 1-month old (14.3%) patient had transaminase values of ALT &gt; 8 × ULN and AST &gt; 3 to ≤ 5 × ULN, which led to discontinuation of ivacaftor treatment (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases).

Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor

The safety of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor was evaluated in 124 patients between 6 to less than 12 years of age. The tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical studies in children aged 6 to less than 12 years weighing 30 to &lt; 40 kg.

The safety profile is generally consistent among children and adolescents, and is also consistent with adult patients.

During the 24-week, open-label phase 3 study in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (study 661-113 part B, n = 70), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, and &gt; 3 × ULN were 1.4%, 4.3%, and 10.0%, respectively. No tezacaftor/ivacaftor treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN or discontinued tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase elevations. One patient interrupted treatment due to elevated transaminases, and subsequently resumed tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment successfully (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

The safety data of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, 445-106, 445-111, and 445-124 was evaluated in 272 patients between 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric and adult patients.

During study 445-106 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, and &gt; 3 × ULN were 0.0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, and &gt; 3 × ULN were 1.3%, 2.7%, and 8.0%, respectively. No ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

## Rash

During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, 15 (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash event, 4 (9.8%) females and 11 (32.4%) males.

## Lenticular opacity

One patient had an adverse event of lenticular opacity.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific antidote is available for overdose with ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs, liver function tests and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02

## Mechanism of action

## Ivacaftor as monotherapy

Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to enhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced channel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open probability of R117H-CFTR , which has both low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced channel current amplitude (conductance). The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in subjects with this mutation in study 770-111 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy and safety).

In vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from rodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate the gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely elucidated.

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

Elexacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR correctors that bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. When ivacaftor is administered in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, the combined effect is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride transport.

## CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR

The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing select CFTR mutations.

The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical response. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response.

In CF, the presence of one CFTR mutation responsive to ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor based on in vitro data in FRT cells, will likely result in a clinical response.

Table 6 lists ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-responsive CFTR mutations. The occurrence of CFTR mutations listed in this table should not be used in lieu of a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, nor as a sole determinant for prescribing purposes.

There are people with CF harbouring two, rare nonF508del CFTR mutations not listed in Table 6. Provided that they do not harbour two class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) (see section 4.1), they may respond to treatment. In these cases, Kaftrio can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision.

The individual diagnosis of CF should be based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement as considerable variability exists in phenotype for patients harbouring the same genotype.

- ⁎ Mutations supported by clinical data.

†  Mutations supported by RealWorld data in ≥ 5 patients.

‡  Complex/compound mutations where a single allele of the CFTR gene has multiple mutations; these exist independent of the presence of mutations on the other allele.

Non-annotated mutations are included based on the FRT assay in which a positive response is indicative of a clinical response.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Ivacaftor as monotherapy

In studies 770-102 and 770-103 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to rapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -48 mmol/L [95% CI: -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI: -62, -47], respectively) and sustained (through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study 770-111, part 1 in patients who had a nonG551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with ivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride of -49 mmol/L (95% CI: -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the G970R -CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 (6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit (4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending to pre-treatment levels.

In study 770-110 in patients aged 6 years or older with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene, the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of treatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI: -28, -20). In subgroup analyses by age, the treatment difference was -21.87 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.46, -17.28) in patients aged 18 years or older, and -27.63 mmol/L (95% CI: -37.16, -18.10) in patients aged 6 to 11 years. Two patients 12 to 17 years of age were enrolled in this study.

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor

In study 661-106 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference between ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 24, was -10.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.4, -8.8).

In study 661-108 (patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity), the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3) between tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and placebo, and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3) between ivacaftor and placebo.

In study 661-115 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who were homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity), the within treatment mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 8 was -12.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -15.3, -9.3) in the tezacaftor/ivacaftor group.

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

In study 445-102 (patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that predicts either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor (minimal function mutation) in vitro ), the treatment difference of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to placebo for mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4, -39.3).

In study 445-103 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to tezacaftor/ivacaftor for mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1).

In study 445-104 (patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating defect or residual CFTR activity), the treatment difference of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor compared to the control group (ivacaftor monotherapy group or tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor group) for mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 8 was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1).

In study 445-106 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline (n=62) through week 24 (n=60) was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2) * . The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 12 (n=59) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.1, -56.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* Not all participants included in the analyses had data available for all follow-up visits, especially from week 16 onwards. The ability to collect data at week 24 was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Week 12 data were less impacted by the pandemic.

In study 445-116 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean treatment difference for the ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in combination with ivacaftor group versus placebo for the absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1).

In study 445-124 (patients aged 6 years and older with a qualifying nonF508del , ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-responsive CFTR mutation), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 compared to placebo was -28.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -32.1, -24.5 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.0001).

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Ivacaftor as monotherapy

## Studies 770-102 and 770-103: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations

The efficacy of ivacaftor has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D mutation in the CFTR gene on at least one allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted.

Patients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., tobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted.

Study 770-102 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used some medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medicinal products included dornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% versus 33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years).

Study 770-103 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was 30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); 8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less than 70% predicted at baseline.

The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment.

The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in study 770-102 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 770-103. The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 770-102 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 770-103. The mean change from baseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo group in study 770-102 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 770-103. In both studies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks.

The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 770102 was 11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients with baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 770-103 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6).

The results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 7.

Study 770-111: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations

Study 770-111 was a phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study (part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or nonG551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene ( G178R , S549N , S549R , G551S , G1244E , S1251N , S1255P or G1349D ).

In part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours with fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to the other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for 16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomised to part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to part 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence.

Thirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% predicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the F508del -CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per treatment sequence).

In part 1 of study 770-111, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was 79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value was 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the placebo period. The observed treatment difference (95% CI) between ivacaftor and placebo was 10.7% (7.3, 14.1) ( P &lt; 0.0001).

The effect of ivacaftor in the overall population of study 770-111 (including the secondary endpoints absolute change in BMI at 8 weeks of treatment and absolute change in the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R through 8 weeks of treatment) and by individual mutation (absolute change in sweat chloride and in percent predicted FEV1 at week 8) is shown in Table 8. Based on clinical (percent predicted FEV1) and pharmacodynamic (sweat chloride) responses to ivacaftor, efficacy in patients with the G970R mutation could not be established.

In part 2 of study 770-111, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 following 16 weeks (patients randomised to the ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence in part 1) of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 10.4% (13.2%). At the follow-up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -5.9% (9.4%). For patients randomised to the placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence in part 1 there was a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

further mean (SD) change of 3.3% (9.3%) in percent predicted FEV1 after the additional 16 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor. At the follow-up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%).

## Study 770-104: study in patients with CF with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene

Study 770-104 (part A) was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2 study of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted.

The mean absolute change from baseline through week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 1.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and -0.2 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points (95% CI: -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.15).

## Study 770-105: open-label extension study

In study 770-105 patients who completed treatment in studies 770-102 and 770-103 with placebo were switched to ivacaftor while patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length of treatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at least 144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group.

One hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 770-102 were rolled over in study 770-105, 67 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 770-103 were rolled over in study 770-105, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group.

Table 9 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups of patients. For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group baseline percent predicted FEV1 is that of study 770-105 while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group the baseline value is that of studies 770-102 and 770-103.

When the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 is compared from study 770-105 baseline for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 72) who rolled over from study 770-102, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.0% (9.05), while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 25) who rolled over from study 770-103 this figure was 0.6% (9.1). This shows that patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

initial study (day 0 through week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional improvements in study 770-105 (week 48 through week 144).

For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 770-102, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than during the subsequent study 770-105 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to week 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group from study 770-102, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to week 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 770-105, the rate of annualised pulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across weeks 48 to 96.

For patients who rolled over from study 770-103 the number of events was overall low.

## Study 770-110: study in patients with CF with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene

Study 770-110 evaluated 69 patients who were 6 years of age or older; 53 (76.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. The confirmed R117H poly-T variant was 5T in 38 patients and 7T in 16 patients. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 73% (range: 32.5% to 105.5%) and mean age was 31 years (range: 6 to 68 years). The mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and 0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI: -1.1, 5.4).

A pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted in patients aged 18 years and older (26 patients on placebo and 24 patients on ivacaftor). Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24 of 4.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus -0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 5.0 percentage points (95% CI: 1.1, 8.8).

In a subgroup analysis in patients with a confirmed R117H-5T genetic variant, the difference in the mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 between ivacaftor and placebo was 5.3% (95% CI: 1.3, 9.3). In patients with a confirmed R117H-7T genetic variant, the treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 0.2% (95% CI: -8.1, 8.5).

For secondary efficacy variables, no treatment differences were observed for ivacaftor versus placebo in absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24 or time to first pulmonary exacerbation. Treatment differences were observed in absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through week 24 (treatment difference of ivacaftor versus placebo was 8.4 [95% CI: 2.2, 14.6] points) and for the mean change from baseline in sweat chloride (see Pharmacodynamic effects).

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 12 years and older was assessed in two clinical studies; a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 504 patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation (study 661-106); and a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and ivacaftor-controlled, 2 period, 3 treatment, 8-week crossover study with 244 patients who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity (study 661-108). The longterm safety and efficacy of the combination regimen was also assessed in both patient populations in a 96-week open-label, rollover, long-term extension study (study 661-110). Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of tezacaftor/ivacaftor for additional data.

The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets in patients aged 12 years and older was demonstrated in three, phase 3, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies (patients were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal function on the second allele, n = 403) and active-controlled (patients were homozygous

for the F508del mutation, n = 107, or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating or residual CFTR activity mutation on the second allele, n = 258) studies of 24 (study 445-102), 4 (study 445103), and 8 weeks (study 445-104) of duration respectively. Patients from all studies were eligible to enter open-label, rollover, long-term extension studies (study 445-105 or study 445-110).

The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets in patients aged 6 years and older with nonF508del , ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-responsive CFTR mutations was demonstrated in a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n = 307) and an observational retrospective study (CFD-016; n = 422) of Real-World clinical outcomes.

## Paediatric population

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor

The efficacy and safety in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age 8.6 years) were assessed in an 8-week, double-blind, phase 3 trial (study 661-115) with 67 patients who were randomised 4:1 to either ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or a blinding group. Forty-two patients were homozygous for the F508del mutation (F/F) and 12 were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity (F/RF). Patients were eligible to enter an open-label, rollover, 96-week study (study 661-116 part A). Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of tezacaftor/ivacaftor for additional data.

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

The pharmacokinetics and safety in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (n = 66) and in those from 2 to less than 6 years (n = 75) who have at least one F508del mutation were assessed in two 24-week open-label studies (study 445-106 and study 445-116). Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for additional data.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Kalydeco in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF.

After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) for AUC and Cmax were 10.60 (5.26) µg∙h/mL and 0.768 (0.233) µg/mL, respectively. After every 12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9.

## Absorption

Following multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. When given with fatcontaining food, the exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold. When coadministered with tezacaftor and elexacaftor, the increase in AUC was similar (approximately 3-fold and 2.5- to 4-fold respectively). Therefore, ivacaftor, administered as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, should be administered with fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state.

Ivacaftor granules (2 × 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with fat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the granules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. The effect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules.

## Distribution

Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) apparent volume of distribution was 353 L (122).

## Biotransformation

Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active.

The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor exposure is consistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. No dose-adjustment of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, or elexacaftor is considered necessary. The effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data are available for such patients.

## Elimination

Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (± SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects.

## Linearity/non-linearity

The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from 25 mg to 250 mg.

## Special populations

## Hepatic impairment

Following a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 0.735 [0.331] µg/mL) but an approximately 2-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16.80 [6.14] µg∙h/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for predicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dose from 150 mg q12h to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable steady-state Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic impairment.

In subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9), ivacaftor AUC increased approximately by 50% following multiple doses for 10 days of either tezacaftor and ivacaftor or of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor.

The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10 to15) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For guidance on appropriate use and dose modification see Table 3 in section 4.2.

## Renal impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment. In a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor monotherapy, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less than 0.01% following a single oral dose of 500 mg).

No dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. Caution is recommended when administering ivacaftor to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Race

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white (n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis.

Gender

The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor are similar in males and females.

Elderly

Clinical studies of ivacaftor did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in younger adults.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor in the elderly patients (65-72 years) are comparable to those in younger adults.

## Paediatric population

Predicted ivacaftor exposure based on observed ivacaftor concentrations in phase 2 and 3 studies as determined using compartmental analysis is presented by age group in Table 10.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

## Pregnancy and fertility

Ivacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall fertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant reductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average litter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of approximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits.

## Peri- and post-natal development

Ivacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the MRHD.

## Juvenile animal studies

Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor exposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived from rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with ivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Kalydeco granules are indicated:

- As monotherapy for the treatment of infants aged at least 1 month, toddlers and children weighing 3 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the following gating (Class III) mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
- In a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one non-Class I mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Kalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. If the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene (see section 4.1). The phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be determined in accordance with local clinical recommendation.

Kalydeco in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

There are a limited number of patients who harbour mutations not listed in Table 6 that may be responsive to ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (IVA/TEZ/ELX). In these cases, ivacaftor (IVA) in combination with IVA/TEZ/ELX can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision. This excludes patients with two Class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) as they are not expected to respond to modulator therapy (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1).

If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should be advised to take it as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. If more than 6 hours have passed since the time the dose is usually taken, the patient should be advised to wait until the next scheduled dose.

Patients receiving Kalydeco in a combination regimen should be advised not to take more than one dose of either medicinal product at the same time.

## Concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors

During concomitant administration with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A, the ivacaftor dose should be adjusted as detailed in Table 2 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Table 2: Dosing recommendations for concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors

| Age/weight                             | Moderate CYP3A inhibitors                                                     | Strong CYP3A inhibitors                                                         |

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients aged 6 months and older with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Treatment with ivacaftor is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months with any level of hepatic impairment.

In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), the ivacaftor dose should be adjusted as detailed in Table 3 (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of ivacaftor as monotherapy have not been established in children less than 1 month of age or in children less than 6 months of age born prematurely (less than 37 weeks of gestational age), neither in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in children less than 2 years of age. No data are available.

Limited data are available in patients less than 6 years of age with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. Available data in patients aged 6 years and older are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.

## Method of administration

For oral use.

Each sachet is for single use only.

Each sachet of granules should be mixed with 5 mL of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and completely and immediately consumed. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. If not immediately consumed, the mixture has been shown to be stable for one hour and therefore should be ingested during this period. A fat-containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or just after dosing.

Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Only patients with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R gating (Class III) or G970R mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene were included in studies 770-102, 770-103, 770-111 and 770-108 (see section 5.1).

Less evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H-7T mutation associated with less severe disease in study 770-110 (see section 5.1).

In study 770-111, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change in the sweat chloride test was &lt; 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant improvement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R mutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1).

Efficacy results from a phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of ivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of ivacaftor as monotherapy in these patients is not recommended.

## Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury

In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, liver failure leading to transplantation has been reported while receiving ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. This medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, portal hypertension) and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

Moderate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are common in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated with ivacaftor as monotherapy and in combination regimens with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. In patients taking ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these elevations have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Therefore, assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For all patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT or AST &gt; 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN with bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN), dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Use of ivacaftor as monotherapy is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months of age with any level of hepatic impairment. Use of ivacaftor as monotherapy is not recommended in patients aged 6 months and older weighing less than 25 kg with severe hepatic impairment unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see Table 3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2).

For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, use of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor is not recommended. Treatment should only be considered when there is a clear medical need and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3 in section 4.2, and sections 4.8 and 5.2).

## Depression

Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients while receiving ivacaftor, mainly in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, usually occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.

## Renal impairment

Caution is recommended while using ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Mutations unlikely to respond to modulator therapy

Patients with a genotype consisting of two CFTR mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein (i.e., two Class I mutations) are not expected to respond to CFTR modulator therapy.

## Clinical studies comparing ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor

No clinical study has been conducted to directly compare ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor in patients not harbouring F508del variant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients after organ transplantation

Ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with ciclosporin or tacrolimus.

## Rash events

The incidence of rash events with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking hormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor and hormonal contraceptives should be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor without hormonal contraceptives is appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see section 4.8).

## Interactions with medicinal products

## CYP3A inducers

Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the loss of ivacaftor efficacy; therefore, co-administration of ivacaftor with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## CYP3A inhibitors

Exposure to ivacaftor is increased when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of ivacaftor must be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.5). Treatment with ivacaftor monotherapy is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months taking strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors.

## Paediatric population

Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric patients treated with ivacaftor and ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating ivacaftor treatment (see section 5.3).

## Excipients with known effect

## Lactose

This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and a potential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for P-gp.

## Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor

## CYP3A inducers

Co-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. Co-administration of ivacaftor with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), is not recommended (see section 4.4).

No dose adjustment is recommended when ivacaftor is used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers.

## CYP3A inhibitors

Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the ivacaftor dose is recommended for co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin as well as for co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole, erythromycin, and verapamil. Treatment with ivacaftor monotherapy is not recommended when concomitantly used with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4).

Co-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with ivacaftor (see section 4.2).

## Potential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters

In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro . Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of ivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be clinically relevant.

## Ciprofloxacin

Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose adjustment is required when ivacaftor is co-administered with ciprofloxacin.

## Medicinal products affected by ivacaftor

Administration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CYP2C9 substrates

Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is recommended during co-administration of warfarin with ivacaftor. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution.

## Digoxin and other P-gp substrates

Co-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used.

## CYP3A substrates

Co-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A substrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are coadministered with ivacaftor.

## Hormonal contraceptives

Ivacaftor has been studied with an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive and was found to have no significant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is necessary.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in pregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable avoid the use of ivacaftor during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Limited data show that ivacaftor is excreted into human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ivacaftor therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on fertility in rats (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ivacaftor has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness (see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older are headache (23.9%), oropharyngeal pain (22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), nasal congestion (20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), nasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), dizziness (9.2%), rash (12.8%) and bacteria in sputum (12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in 12.8% of ivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of placebo-treated patients.

In patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion (26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%) and bacteria in sputum (11.8%).

Serious adverse reactions included abdominal pain (0.9%) and transaminase elevations (1.8%) in patients who received ivacaftor, while serious adverse reactions of rash were reported in 1.5% patients aged 12 years and older treated with a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see section 4.4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 4 reflects the adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor in clinical trials (placebo-controlled and uncontrolled studies) in which the length of exposure to ivacaftor ranged from 16 weeks to 144 weeks. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Transaminase elevations

During the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 770-102 and 770-103 in patients aged 6 years and older, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5 or &gt; 3 × ULN was 3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% in ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in placebo-treated patients, respectively. Two patients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor, permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases, each &gt; 8 × ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN. In ivacaftor-treated patients, most transaminase elevations up to 5 × ULN resolved without treatment interruption. Ivacaftor dosing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was interrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations &gt; 5 × ULN. In all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4).

During the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks) of tezacaftor/ivacaftor, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, or &gt; 3 × ULN were 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in tezacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient (0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. No patients treated with tezacaftor/ivacaftor experienced a transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN.

During the 24-week, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, these figures were 1.5%, 2.5%, and 7.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5%, and 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations was 10.9% in ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients.

Post-marketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor (see section 4.4).

## Rash events

In study 445-102, the incidence of rash events (e.g., rash, rash pruritic) was 10.9% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 6.5% in placebo-treated patients. The rash events were generally mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of rash events by patient sex was 5.8% in males and 16.3% in females in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 4.8% in males and 8.3% in females in placebo-treated patients. In patients treated with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, the incidence of rash events was 20.5% in females taking hormonal contraceptive and 13.6% in females not taking hormonal contraceptive (see section 4.4).

## Increased creatine phosphokinase

In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase &gt; 5 x the ULN was 10.4% in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients and 5.0% in placebo-treated patients. The observed creatine phosphokinase elevations were generally transient and asymptomatic and many were preceded by exercise. No ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients discontinued treatment for increased creatine phosphokinase.

## Increased blood pressure

In study 445-102, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic).

The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively in ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients compared with 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively in placebo-treated patients.

## Paediatric population

## Ivacaftor as monotherapy

Safety of ivacaftor as monotherapy for 24 weeks was evaluated in 43 patients between 1 month to less than 24 months of age (with 7 of them less than 4 months old), 34 patients between 2 to less than

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6 years of age, 61 patients between 6 to less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to less than 18 years of age.

The safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric patients aged 1 month and older and is also consistent with adult patients.

The incidence of transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) observed in studies 770-103, 770-111 and 770-110 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years), study 770-108 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years), and study 770-124 (patients aged 1 to less than 24 months) are described in Table 5. In the placebocontrolled studies, the incidence of transaminase elevations were similar between treatment with ivacaftor (15.0%) and placebo (14.6%). Peak LFT elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. Across all populations, peak LFT elevations returned to baseline levels following interruption, and in almost all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive rechallenge were observed.

In study 770-108 ivacaftor was permanently discontinued in one patient. In study 770-124, in the cohort of patients aged 1 month to less than 4 months, a 1-month old (14.3%) patient had transaminase values of ALT &gt; 8 × ULN and AST of &gt; 3 to ≤ 5 × ULN, which led to discontinuation of ivacaftor treatment (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases).

Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor

The safety of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor was evaluated in 124 patients between 6 to less than 12 years of age. The tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical studies in children aged 6 to less than 12 years weighing 30 to &lt; 40 kg.

The safety profile is generally consistent among children and adolescents, and is also consistent with adult patients.

During the 24-week, open-label phase 3 study in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (study 661-113 part B, n = 70), the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, and &gt; 3 × ULN were 1.4%, 4.3%, and 10.0%, respectively. No tezacaftor/ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN or discontinued tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase elevations. One patient interrupted treatment due to elevated transaminases, and subsequently resumed tezacaftor/ivacaftor treatment successfully (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases).

Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

The safety data of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, 445-106, 445-111, and 445-124 was evaluated in 272 patients between 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric and adult patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During study 445-106 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, and &gt; 3 × ULN were 0.0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8, &gt; 5, and &gt; 3 × ULN were 1.3%, 2.7%, and 8.0%, respectively. No ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

## Rash

During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, 15 (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash event, 4 (9.8%) females and 11 (32.4%) males.

## Lenticular opacity

One patient had an adverse event of lenticular opacity.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific antidote is available for overdose with ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs, liver function tests and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02

## Mechanism of action

## Ivacaftor as monotherapy

Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to enhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced channel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open probability of R117H-CFTR , which has both low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced channel current amplitude (conductance). The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in subjects with this mutation in study 770-111 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy and safety).

In vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from rodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely elucidated.

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

Elexacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR correctors that bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. When ivacaftor is administered in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, the combined effect is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride transport.

## CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR

The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing select CFTR mutations.

The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical response. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response.

In CF, the presence of one CFTR mutation responsive to ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor based on in vitro data in FRT cells, will likely result in a clinical response.

Table 6 lists CFTR mutations included in the indication for treatment in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. The occurrence of CFTR mutations listed in this table should not be used in lieu of a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, nor as a sole determinant for prescribing purposes.

There are people with CF harbouring two, rare nonF508del mutations not listed in Table 6. Provided that they do not harbour two class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) (see section 4.1), they may respond to treatment. In these cases, IVA in combination with IVA/TEZ/ELX can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision.

The individual diagnosis of CF should be based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement as considerable variability exists in phenotype for patients harbouring the same genotype.

- ⁎ Mutations supported by clinical data.
- †  Mutations supported by RealWorld data in ≥ 5 patients.
- ‡  Complex/compound mutations where a single allele of the CFTR gene has multiple mutations; these exist independent of the presence of mutations on the other allele.

Non-annotated mutations are included based on the FRT assay in which a positive response is indicative of a clinical response.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Ivacaftor as monotherapy

In studies 770-102 and 770-103 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to rapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -48 mmol/L [95% CI: -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI: -62, -47], respectively) and sustained (through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration.

In study 770-111, part 1 in patients who had a nonG551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with ivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride of -49 mmol/L (95% CI: -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the G970R -CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 (6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit (4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending to pre-treatment levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study 770-110 in patients aged 6 years or older with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene, the treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of treatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI: -28, -20). In subgroup analyses by age, the treatment difference was -21.87 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.46, -17.28) in patients aged 18 years or older, and -27.63 mmol/L (95% CI: -37.16, -18.10) in patients aged 6 to 11 years. Two patients 12 to 17 years of age were enrolled in this study.

In study 770-108 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with a gating mutation on at least one allele of the CFTR gene administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor twice daily, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -47 mmol/L (95% CI: -58, -36) at week 24.

In study 770-124 in patients with CF aged 1 month to less than 24 months, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -62.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -71.6, -52.4) at week 24. Results were consistent in the 12 months to less than 24 months, 6 months to less than 12 months, and 4 months to less than 6 months age cohorts.

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

In study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation, the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6).

In study 445-124 (patients aged 6 years and older with a qualifying nonF508del , ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-responsive CFTR mutation), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 compared to placebo was -28.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -32.1, -24.5 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.0001).

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Ivacaftor as monotherapy

## Studies 770-102 and 770-103: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations

The efficacy of ivacaftor has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D mutation in the CFTR gene on at least one allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted.

Patients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., tobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted.

Study 770-102 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used some medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medicinal products included dornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% versus 33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years).

Study 770-103 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was 30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); 8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less than 70% predicted at baseline.

The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in study 770-102 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 770-103. The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 770-102 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 770-103. The mean change from baseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo group in study 770-102 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 770-103. In both studies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks.

The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 770102 was 11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients with baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 770-103 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6).

The results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 7.

## Study 770-111: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations

Study 770-111 was a phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study (part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or nonG551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene ( G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P or G1349D ).

In part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours with fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to the other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for 16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients randomised to the part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to part 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence.

Thirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% predicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the F508del -CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per treatment sequence).

In part 1 of study 770-111, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was 79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value was 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the placebo period. The observed treatment difference (95% CI) between ivacaftor and placebo was 10.7% (7.3, 14.1) ( P &lt; 0.0001).

The effect of ivacaftor in the overall population of study 770-111 (including the secondary endpoints absolute change in BMI at 8 weeks of treatment and absolute change in the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R through 8 weeks of treatment) and by individual mutation (absolute change in sweat chloride and in percent predicted FEV1 at week 8) is shown in Table 8. Based on clinical (percent predicted FEV1) and pharmacodynamic (sweat chloride) responses to ivacaftor, efficacy in patients with the G970R mutation could not be established.

In part 2 of study 770-111, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 following 16 weeks (patients randomised to the ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence in part 1) of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 10.4% (13.2%). At the follow-up visit 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -5.9% (9.4%). For patients randomised to the placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence in part 1 there was a further mean (SD) change of 3.3% (9.3%) in percent predicted FEV1 after the additional 16 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor. At the follow-up visit 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2, week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%).

## Study 770-104: study in patients with CF with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene

Study 770-104 (part A) was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2 study of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted.

The mean absolute change from baseline through week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 1.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and -0.2 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points (95% CI: -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.15).

## Study 770-105: open-label extension study

In study 770-105, patients who completed treatment in studies 770-102 and 770-103 with placebo were switched to ivacaftor while patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length of treatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at least 144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group.

One hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 770-102 were rolled over in study 770-105, 67 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 770-103 were rolled over in study 770-105, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group.

Table 9 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups of patients. For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group baseline percent predicted FEV1 is that of study 770-105 while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group the baseline value is that of studies 770-102 and 770-103.

† Change from prior study baseline after 48 weeks of placebo treatment.

When the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 is compared from study 770-105 baseline for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 72) who rolled over from study 770-102, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.0% (9.05), while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 25) who rolled over from study 770-103 this figure was 0.6% (9.1). This shows that patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the initial study (day 0 through week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional improvements in study 770-105 (week 48 through week 144).

For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 770-102, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than during the subsequent study 770-105 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to week 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group from study 770-102, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to week 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 770-105, the rate of annualised pulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across weeks 48 to 96.

For patients who rolled over from study 770-103 the number of events was overall low.

## Study 770-110: study in patients with CF with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene

Study 770-110 evaluated 69 patients who were 6 years of age or older; 53 (76.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. The confirmed R117H poly-T variant was 5T in 38 patients and 7T in 16 patients. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 73% (range: 32.5% to 105.5%) and mean age was 31 years (range: 6 to 68 years). The mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and 0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI: -1.1, 5.4).

A pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted in patients aged 18 years and older (26 patients on placebo and 24 patients on ivacaftor). Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24 of 4.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

versus -0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 5.0 percentage points (95% CI: 1.1, 8.8).

In a subgroup analysis in patients with a confirmed R117H-5T genetic variant, the difference in the mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 between ivacaftor and placebo was 5.3% (95% CI: 1.3, 9.3). In patients with a confirmed R117H-7T genetic variant, the treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 0.2% (95% CI: -8.1, 8.5).

For secondary efficacy variables, no treatment differences were observed for ivacaftor versus placebo in absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24 or time to first pulmonary exacerbation. Treatment differences were observed in absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score through week 24 (treatment difference of ivacaftor versus placebo was 8.4 [95% CI: 2.2, 14.6] points) and for the mean change from baseline in sweat chloride (see Pharmacodynamic effects).

## Study 770-108: study in paediatric patients with CF aged 2 to less than 6 years with G551D or another gating mutation

The pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in 34 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with CF who had a G551D , G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , S1251N , S1255P , S549N or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene were assessed in a 24-week uncontrolled study with ivacaftor (patients weighing less than 14 kg received ivacaftor 50 mg and patients weighing 14 kg or more received ivacaftor 75 mg). Ivacaftor was administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food in addition to their prescribed CF therapies.

Patients in study 770-108 were aged 2 to less than 6 years (mean age 3 years). Twenty-six patients out of the 34 enrolled (76.5%) had a CFTR genotype G551D/F508del with only 2 patients with a nonG551D mutation ( S549N ). The mean (SD) sweat chloride at baseline (n = 25) was 97.88 mmol/L (14.00). The mean (SD) faecal elastase-1 value at baseline (n = 27) was 28 µg/g (95).

The primary endpoint of safety was evaluated through week 24 (see section 4.8). Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints evaluated were absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks of treatment, absolute change from baseline in weight, body mass index (BMI) and stature (supported by weight, BMI and stature z-scores) at 24 weeks of treatment, and measures of pancreatic function such as faecal elastase-1. Data on percent predicted FEV1 (exploratory endpoint) were available for 3 patients in the ivacaftor 50 mg group and 17 patients in the 75 mg dosing group.

The mean (SD) overall (both ivacaftor dosing groups combined) absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24 was 0.32 kg/m 2 (0.54) and the mean (SD) overall change in BMI-for-age z-score was 0.37 (0.42). The mean (SD) overall change in stature-for-age z-score was -0.01 (0.33). The mean (SD) overall change from baseline in faecal elastase-1 (n = 27) was 99.8 µg/g (138.4). Six patients with initial levels below 200 µg/g achieved, at week 24, a level of ≥ 200 µg/g. The mean (SD) overall change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at week 24 (exploratory endpoint) was 1.8 (17.81).

## Study 770-124: study in paediatric patients with CF aged less than 24 months

The pharmacokinetics and safety of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 1 month to less than 24 months were assessed in a 24-week (part B only), open-label single arm study where 19 patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (mean age 15.2 months at baseline), 11 patients aged 6 months to less than 12 months, 6 patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months, and 7 patients (part A/B) aged 1 month to less than 4 months were enrolled and treated with ivacaftor according to their age and body weight. Mean age at baseline of each cohort was 15.2 months, 9.0 months, 4.5 months, and 1.9 months, respectively.

Primary endpoint in part B and part A/B was safety through 24 weeks. Pharmacokinetics and the absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks (see Pharmacodynamic effects) were secondary endpoints. Tertiary endpoints included efficacy measures such as faecal elastase-1 and growth parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients aged 1 month to less than 24 months, with both baseline and week 24 values available, mean (SD) weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length z-scores are provided in Table 10.

Table 10: Effect of ivacaftor on growth parameters in patients aged 1 month to less than 24 months with baseline and week 24 values

|                           | Number of   | Baseline     | Baseline            | Absolute change at week 24   | Absolute change at week 24   |

| Weight-for-age z-score    | 41          | 0.00 (0.94)  | 0.07 [-1.93, 1.79]  | 0.45 (0.64)                  | 0.30 [-0.54, 2.66]           |
| Length-for-age z-score    | 40          | -0.03 (1.11) | -0.03 [-1.99, 2.79] | 0.44 (0.92)                  | 0.52 [-1.81, 3.38]           |
| Weight-for-length z-score | 40          | 0.07 (1.02)  | 0.14 [-1.72, 2.16]  | 0.32 (0.99)                  | 0.32 [-2.04, 2.22]           |

In patients aged 1 month to less than 24 months, out of the 24 subjects who were pancreatic insufficient at baseline (defined as faecal elastase-1 &lt; 200 µg/g), 14 had faecal elastase-1 values above 200 μg/g at week 24. In the overall population of part B and part A/B, the median (min, max) value of faecal elastase1 (μg/g) was 55.5 (7.5, 500.0) at baseline. The median (min, max) absolute change in faecal elastase-1 from baseline (n = 40) to week 24 (n = 33) was 126.0 (-23.0, 423.5).

## Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets in patients aged 12 years and older was demonstrated in three phase 3, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies (patients were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal function on the second allele, n = 403) and active-controlled (patients were homozygous for the F508del mutation, n = 107, or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating or residual CFTR activity mutation on the second allele, n = 258) studies of 24 (study 445-102), 4 (study 445103), and 8 weeks (study 445-104) of duration respectively. Patients from all studies were eligible to enter open-label, rollover, long-term extension studies (study 445-105 or study 445-110).

The efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets in patients aged 6 years and older with nonF508del , ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor-responsive CFTR mutations was demonstrated in a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n = 307) and an observational retrospective study (CFD-016; n = 422) of Real-World clinical outcomes.

Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for additional data.

## Paediatric population

Ivacaftor in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

The pharmacokinetics and safety in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (n = 66) and in those from 2 to less than 6 years (n = 75) who have at least one F508del mutation were assessed in two 24-week open-label studies (study 445-106 and study 445-111), respectively. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor for additional data.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Kalydeco in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF.

After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) for AUC and Cmax were 10.60 (5.26) µg∙h/mL and 0.768 (0.233) µg/mL, respectively. After every 12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9.

## Absorption

Following multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally increased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. When given with fatcontaining food the exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold. When coadministered with tezacaftor and elexacaftor, the increase in AUC was similar (approximately 3-fold and 2.5- to 4-fold, respectively). Therefore, ivacaftor, administered as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, should be administered with fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state.

Ivacaftor granules (2 × 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with fat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for the granules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. The effect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules.

## Distribution

Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) apparent volume of distribution was 353 L (122).

## Biotransformation

Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active.

The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor exposure is consistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. No dose adjustment of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, or elexacaftor is considered necessary. The effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data are available for such patients.

## Elimination

Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (±SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Linearity/non-linearity

The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from 25 mg to 250 mg.

## Special populations

## Hepatic impairment

Following a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 0.735 [0.331] µg/mL) but an approximately 2-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16.80 [6.14] µg∙h/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for predicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dose from 150 mg q12h to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable steady-state Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic impairment.

In subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9), ivacaftor AUC increased approximately by 50% following multiple doses for 10 days of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor.

The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10 to 15) on the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor or in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor have not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.

For guidance on appropriate use and dose modification see Table 3 in section 4.2.

## Renal impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment. In a human pharmacokinetic study, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less than 0.01% following a single oral dose of 500 mg).

No dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. However, caution is recommended when administering ivacaftor to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Race

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white (n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis.

## Gender

The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor are similar in males and females.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

Clinical studies of ivacaftor as monotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in younger adults.

## Paediatric population

Predicted ivacaftor exposure based on observed ivacaftor concentrations in phase 2 and 3 studies as determined using compartmental analysis is presented by age group in Table 11.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and fertility

Ivacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall fertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant reductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average litter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of approximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits.

## Peri- and post-natal development

Ivacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the MRHD.

## Juvenile animal studies

Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor exposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived from rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with ivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Kalydeco is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Kalydeco
3. How to take Kalydeco
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Kalydeco
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Kalydeco is and what it is used for

Kalydeco contains the active substance ivacaftor. Ivacaftor acts at the level of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein that forms a channel at the cell surface that allows the movement of particles such as chloride in and out of the cell. Due to mutations in the CFTR gene (see below), chloride movement is reduced in those with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ivacaftor helps certain abnormal CFTR proteins open more often to improve chloride movement in and out of the cell.

## Kalydeco tablets are indicated:

- As monotherapy for patients aged 6 years and older and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the following gating mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D , G1244E , G1349D , G178R , G551S , S1251N , S1255P , S549N or S549R .
- In combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for patients aged 6 years and older with CF who have two F508del mutations in the CFTR gene (homozygous for the F508del mutation) or who have an F508del mutation and certain other second mutations that result in reduced amount and/or function of the CFTR protein (heterozygous for the F508del mutation with a residual function (RF) mutation). If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to be taken with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. It contains important information about how to take these two medicines.
- In combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets for patients aged 6 years and over who have CF, with at least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to Kalydeco in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to be taken with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. It contains important information about how to take these two medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you take Kalydeco

## Do not take Kalydeco

- if you are allergic to ivacaftor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kalydeco.

- Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems or have previously had them. Your doctor may need to adjust your dose.
- Increased liver enzymes in the blood have been seen in some people receiving Kalydeco (alone or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems:
- Pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area
- Yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea or vomiting
- Dark urine
- Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment, particularly during the first year and especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past.
- Depression (including suicidal thoughts and behaviours) has been reported in patients while taking Kalydeco, mainly in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, usually starting within the first three months of treatment. Talk to a doctor straightaway if you (or someone taking this medicine) experience any of the following symptoms: sad or altered mood, anxiety, feelings of emotional discomfort or thoughts of harming or killing yourself, which may be signs of depression.
- Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems or have previously had them.
- If you have two Class I mutations (mutations known not to make CFTR protein), you should not take Kalydeco, as you are not expected to respond to this medicine.
- Kalydeco is not recommended if you have undergone an organ transplant.
- Talk to your doctor if you are using hormonal contraception - for example, women using the contraceptive pill. This may mean you are more likely to get a rash while taking Kalydeco in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor.
- Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has been noted in some children and adolescents treated with Kalydeco (alone or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Your doctor may perform some eye examinations prior to and during treatment.
- Kalydeco should only be used if you have one of the mutations in the CFTR gene indicated in section 1 (What Kalydeco is and what it is used for).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Children and adolescents

Do not give this medicine to children under 1 month of age as it is not known if ivacaftor is safe and effective in these children.

Do not give this medicine in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor to children under 6 years of age or in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to children under 2 years of age as it is not known if they are safe and effective for them.

## Other medicines and Kalydeco

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Some medicines can affect how Kalydeco works or make side effects more likely. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may decide to adjust your dose or that you need extra check-ups.

- Antifungal medicines (used for the treatment of fungal infections). These include fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole.
- Antibiotic medicines (used for the treatment of bacterial infections). These include clarithromycin, erythromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin, and telithromycin.
- Epilepsy medicines (used for the treatment of epileptic seizures or fits). These include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.
- Herbal medicines. These include St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ).
- Immunosuppressants (used after an organ transplantation). These include ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus.
- Cardiac glycosides (used for the treatment of some heart conditions). These include digoxin.
- Anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent blood clots). These include warfarin.
- Medicines for diabetes. These include glimepiride and glipizide.
- Medicines for lowering blood pressure. These include verapamil.

## Kalydeco with food and drink

Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit during treatment as these may increase the side effects of Kalydeco by increasing the amount of ivacaftor in your body.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It may be better to avoid using Kalydeco during pregnancy, if possible, and your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child.

Ivacaftor passes into breast milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before taking Kalydeco. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop breast-feeding or for you to stop ivacaftor therapy. Your doctor will take into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for you.

## Driving and using machines

Kalydeco can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle or use machines.

## Kalydeco contains lactose and sodium

If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

Kalydeco contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

You must keep using all other medicines you use, unless your doctor tells you to stop using any.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child's.

3. How to take Kalydeco
4. Possible side effects

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Kalydeco is and what it is used for

Kalydeco contains the active substance ivacaftor. Ivacaftor acts at the level of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein that forms a channel at the cell surface that allows the movement of particles such as chloride in and out of the cell. Due to mutations in the CFTR gene (see below), chloride movement is reduced in those with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ivacaftor helps certain abnormal CFTR proteins open more often to improve chloride movement in and out of the cell.

Kalydeco granules are indicated:

- As monotherapy for the treatment of babies and children aged 1 month and older and weighing 3 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of the following gating mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R .
- In combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor granules for patients aged 2 to 6 years who have CF, with at least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to Kalydeco in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor. If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to be taken with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, read the package leaflet of the latter. It contains important information about how to take these two medicines.

## 2. What you need to know before your child takes Kalydeco

## Do not give your child Kalydeco

- if your child is allergic to ivacaftor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your child's doctor before your child takes Kalydeco.

- Talk to your child's doctor if your child has liver problems or has had them previously. Your child's doctor may need to adjust your child's dose.
- Increased liver enzymes in the blood have been seen in some people receiving Kalydeco (alone or in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Tell your child's doctor right away if your child has any of these symptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems:
- Pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area
- Yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea or vomiting
- Dark urine
- Your child's doctor will do some blood tests to check your child's liver before and during treatment, particularly during the first year and especially if blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past.
- Depression (including suicidal thoughts and behaviours) has been reported in patients while taking Kalydeco, mainly in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, usually starting within the first three months of treatment. Talk to a doctor straightaway if you (or someone taking this medicine) experience any of the following symptoms: sad or altered mood, anxiety, feelings of emotional discomfort or thoughts of harming or killing yourself, which may be signs of depression.
- Talk to your child's doctor if you have been told your child has kidney problems or has previously had them.
- If you have two Class I mutations (mutations known not to make CFTR protein), you should not take Kalydeco, as you are not expected to respond to this medicine.
- Kalydeco is not recommended for patients who have undergone an organ transplant.
- Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has been noted in some children and adolescents during treatment (alone or in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor). Your child's doctor may perform some eye examinations prior to and during treatment.
- Kalydeco should only be used if your child has one of the mutations in the CFTR gene indicated in section 1 (What Kalydeco is and what it is used for).

## Children

Do not give this medicine to children under 1 month of age as it is not known if ivacaftor is safe and effective in these children.

Do not give this medicine in combination with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor to children under 2 years of age as it is not known if they are safe and effective for them.

## Other medicines and Kalydeco

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

particular, tell your child's doctor if your child is taking any of the medicines listed below. Your child's doctor may decide to adjust your child's dose or if extra check-ups are needed.
