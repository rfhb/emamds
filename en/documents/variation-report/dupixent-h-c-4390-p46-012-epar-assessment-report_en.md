## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

Study number

: LPS16764

Study title : Open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis

Brief title: Dupilumab-PEdiatric skin barrier function and Lipidomics Study in patients with Atopic Dermatitis - PELISTAD

Study initiation date:

19 February 2021 (first participant first visit)

Study completion date:

30 November 2022 (last participant last visit)

The analyses presented in this report are based on a database lock date of 23 December 2022.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis - LPS16764

## Description

Study LPS16764 (PELISTAD) was a phase 4, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in pediatric patients aged between ≥6 and &lt;12 years old with moderate-to-severe AD with a healthy participant cohort as a reference comparator. It was conducted in 2 sites in the United States and 1 site in United Kingdom from 26 February 2021 (first participant first visit) through 30 November 2022 (last participant last visit).

## Methods

## Study participants

Atopic dermatitis participants were enrolled based on the following criteria:

- Patients with AD diagnosis according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria (4) at least 1 year before screening.
- Investigator global assessment (IGA) score of ≥3 (for US patients) or IGA ≥4 (for EU patients) at screening (on the 0-4 scale) depending on approved label indication in the country.
- Patients with moderate-to-severe AD eligible to be treated with dupilumab according to product label.
- Patients with AD had active lesions on the upper limbs or lower limbs, with severity for lesion erythema or edema/papulation ≥2 at screening on the 0 -3 scale of the Individual Signs Score (ISS).
- Atopic dermatitis participants had a non-lesional (normal looking) skin area 4 cm from the edge of the lesional area. If unable to identify non-lesional skin 4 cm from the lesional area, it was acceptable to identify normal looking skin as close to the lesion as possible. Age, gender, and other demography and participant characteristics at baseline were matched between the AD participant cohort and the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

healthy participant cohort for the safety population. A total of 48 participants (24 participants in the AD participant cohort and 24 participants in the healthy participant cohort) were planned to be enrolled to achieve 40 evaluable participants. A total of 43 participants were enrolled in the study, among them 41 participants were screened successfully, including 23 participants with moderate to severe AD and 18 healthy participants. The intent-to-treat (ITT), the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and safety populations included all 41 participants.

In the AD participant cohort, the median age of the participants at baseline was 7.0 years, and ranged from 6 to 11 years. More than half of the participants (15 [65.2%]) were male. The majority of the participants (16 [69.6%]) were white. The mean (SD) BMI of the participants at baseline was 19.60 (3.71) kg/m 2 . In the healthy participant cohort, the median age of the participants at baseline was 8.0 years, and ranged from 6 to 11 years. More than half of the participants (10 [55.6%]) were male. Half of the participants (9 [50%]) were white. The mean (SD) BMI of the participants at baseline was 18.44 (3.14) kg/m 2 .

## Study design

Study LPS16764 was a Phase 4, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in pediatric participants aged between ≥6 and &lt;12 years old with moderate-tosevere AD with a healthy participant cohort not receiving any drug or placebo as a reference comparator.

Male and female participants with moderate-to-severe AD were enrolled. Healthy participants matched for age, gender, location of skin area, and study site served as reference comparators for skin barrier function.

The study intervention included dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg in a prefilled syringe for subcutaneous administration. AD participants with baseline 15 kg ≤ body weight &lt;30 kg received a SC loading dose of dupilumab 600 mg (2 injections of dupilumab 300 mg) on Day 1 (Week 0), followed by Q4W SC dosing of dupilumab 300 mg from Week 4 to Week 12. AD participants with baseline 30 kg ≤ body weight &lt;60 kg received a SC loading dose of dupilumab 4 00 mg (2 injections of dupilumab 200 mg) on Day 1 (Week 0), followed by Q2W SC dosing of dupilumab 200 mg from Week 2 to Week 14.

The duration of the treatment period was 16 weeks. The maximum study duration per participant was 32 weeks.

The study comprised:

- Screening period 1 (Day -28 to Day -1): Participants were evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.
- Baseline visit (Week 0, Day 1): Participants who remain eligible were enrolled.
- A 16-week treatment phase for participants with AD and a 16-week observation period for healthy volunteers.
- A 12-week follow-up period.

## Treatments

See Table 1 above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives and outcomes

The objectives of this study (see Table 2) were to assess the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin barrier function measured by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and measurement of lipids, proteins, and gene expression associated with skin barrier function from skin tape stripping (STS) in participants with moderate to severe AD. In addition, this study evaluated the relationship between skin barrier function and disease activity measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as high-definition standard photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas. Transepidermal water loss is commonly used for physiologic assessments of skin barrier function. In addition to basal TEWL to assess the undisturbed permeability of the skin barrier, TEWL measurements were combined with skin barrier perturbation using STS to measure skin barrier function and integrity. The STS technique uses a standardized tape for removing the epidermis layer by layer. The advantages of this technique are as follows: it is noninvasive, causes no pain in participants, and leaves no scars. With this technique, it was possible to follow reactions within the same skin area over time and to study precisely in which depth of the epidermis the different cellular and molecular cutaneous markers were located. Through these assessments, the study explored the interplay between skin barrier function kinetics, clinical disease severity, and therapeutic response.

Transepidermal water loss is the loss of water that passes from inside a body through the epidermis. A higher value of TEWL means more water is passing through the skin, such as in AD patients. It is influenced by many environmental and individual factors, including age, gender, race, anatomical region, skin temperature, environmental conditions, season, smoking status, measurement technique, and many others. Therefore, it was important to include a 'normal' TEWL from an age-, gender-, targeted lesion area-, and study site-matched healthy participant cohort assessed at the same time under the same measurement conditions on the same anatomical region with reference thresholds of skin barrier function evaluation indicating pathological relevance.

## Objectives

## Tertiary/exploratory

- Evaluate dupilumab treatment effect on skin lipidomics using STS samples in both predefined lesional and non-lesional skin in pediatric patients with moderate-tosevere AD during dupilumab treatment phase and follow-up period in reference to normal skin of healthy volunteers.
- Evaluate dupilumab treatment effect on skin proteomics using STS samples in both predefined lesional and non-lesional skin in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe AD during dupilumab treatment phase and follow-up period in reference to normal skin of healthy volunteers.
- Evaluate dupilumab treatment effect on epidermal hypertrophy and structure of skin barrier changes and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in both predefined lesional and non-lesional skin in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe AD during dupilumab treatment phase and follow-up period in reference to normal skin of healthy volunteers.

## Sample size

Sample size for this exploratory study was based on medical/clinical judgment and is consistent with the sample size from similar studies in the literature (Danby et al., 2011). No formal sample size calculation was performed. TEWL data collected in similar settings as planned for this study were not available, i.e., TEWL values after 5 STS, and pre- and post-dupilumab treatment are unknown. Allowing for drop-out rate of 15%, a total of approximately 24 pediatric patients with moderate-tosevere AD will be enrolled to achieve 20 evaluable patients, ie, patients with no major or critical deviations related to IMP and/or TEWL measurements, for whom the TEWL data for primary analysis: ie, TEWL at baseline and Week 16, are considered sufficient and interpretable. An approximately equal number of age, gender, location of targeted lesion area and site matched healthy volunteers serving as

## Endpoints

- Change (percent and absolute) in TEWL area under the curve (TEWL AUC: a composite measure before and after5,10,15,and20 STS)for skinbarrier function in lesional skin in AD patients over time.
- Change (percent and absolute) in TEWL AUC (a composite measure before and after 5, 10, 15 and 20 STS) for skin barrier function in non-lesional skin in AD patients over time.
- Change (percent and absolute) in TEWL AUC (a composite measure before and after 5,10,15 and 20 STS) for skin barrier function in normal skin in healthy volunteers over time.
- Change (percent and absolute) in TEWL after STS assessed on lesional skin in AD patients over time.
- Change (percent and absolute) in TEWL after STS assessed on non-lesional skin inAD patients over time.
- Change (percent and absolute) in TEWL after STS assessed on normal skin in healthy volunteers over time.
- Changes (percent and absolute) in lipidomics parameters in lesional and non-lesional skin including the ratio of highly hydrophobic omega-esterified fatty acid sphingosine ceramides (EOS CER) and non-hydroxy fatty acid sphingosine ceramides (NS CER), and filaggrin (FLG) breakdown products of urocanic acid (UCA) and pyroglutamic acid (PCA) concentrations over time.
- Global characterization of protein-bound CER over time.
- Changes (percent and absolute) in the expression of proteins associated with skin barrier function including keratin intermediate filaments, proteins associated with inflammatory response, and glycolysis and oxidative stress response proteins in STS protein extracts over time.
- Change (percent and absolute) in epidermal hypertrophy parameters including epidermal thickness (μm), superficial plexus depth (μm), blood vessel diameter (um) and density (segments/mm²) measured by OCT over time.
- Change (percent and absolute) in stratum comeum lipid structure measured by FTIR spectroscopy in conjunction with tape-stripping over time.

a reference comparator cohort will be enrolled. Drop-out rate in healthy volunteers is expected to be minimal. Any drop-out healthy volunteer for whom the matched patient is considered as evaluable will not be replaced.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Changes to the conduct of the study

There were no changes in the conduct of the study.

## Statistical Methods

A detailed description of participant accountability including number of participants by analysis population, screen failure of participants with the reasons for screen failure, participants who did not complete the study observation period along with the main reason for permanent treatment discontinuation, and participants who requested permanent treatment discontinuation were generated by cohort. Continuous variables (age, weight) and qualitative variables (gender, race, and body mass index) were summarized by cohort and by descriptive statistics (summary tables). The efficacy evaluation was based on a review of the individual values (graphics), descriptive statistics (summary tables, graphics), and where applicable, exploratory statistical analysis. All efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT and mITT population. The safety evaluation was based on a review of vital signs parameters and reported adverse events. All the safety analyses were performed using the safety population. When applicable, results were reported by cohort and overall.

## Results

## Participant disposition

A total of 43 participants were enrolled in the study, among them 41 participants were screened including 23 participants with moderate to severe AD and 18 healthy participants. All 23 AD participants completed the study treatment period and 21 AD participants completed the study period, 1 AD participant discontinued from the study period due to withdrawal by participants and 1 AD participant was lost to follow up and didn't perform end of study visit. All 18 healthy participants completed the study period. The details of the participant disposition are provided in Table 3.

## Baseline data

## Demographic data

Age, sex, and other demographics and participant characteristics at baseline were matched between the AD participant cohort and the healthy participant cohort for the mITT population. In the AD participant cohort, the median age of the participants at baseline was 7.0 years, and ranged from 6 to 11 years. More than half of the participants (15 [65.2%]) were male. The majority of the participants (16 [69.6%]) were white. The mean (SD) BMI of the participants at baseline was 19.60 (3.71) kg/m 2 . In the healthy participant cohort, the median age of the participants at baseline was 8.0 years, and ranged from 6 to 11 years. More than half of the participants (10 [55.6%]) were male. Half of the participants (9 [50.0%]) were white. The mean (SD) BMI of the participants at baseline was 18.44 (3.14) kg/m 2 .

n (%) = number and percentage of participants with at least one concomitant medication

Note: Concomitant medications are those the participant used at any time during the treatment-emergent period (from the IMP administration upto theend of treatment (included))for ADparticipants and during the observational period(period of 16 week following collection of the first skin biopsy) for healthy participants.

A medication canbe counted in several ATC classes.

Therapeutic classes are sorted by decreasing frequency in ADParticipant group within each anatomic class.

## Efficacy results

## Primary endpoint

Transepidermal water loss is a widely used objective measurement for physiologic assessments of skin barrier function. In addition to basal TEWL to assess the undisturbed permeability of the skin barrier, TEWL measurements were combined with skin barrier perturbation using STS to measure skin barrier

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

function and integrity. The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline in TEWL after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin at Week 16 in AD participants. The primary endpoint of percent change from baseline in TEWL after 5 STS on lesional skin in AD participants demonstrated a clinically significant improvement at Week 16 for the ITT population, representing a 37.5% reduction in TEWL.

## Secondary endpoints

The median TEWL before STS (spot 1) on lesional and non-lesional skin area were 48.1500 and 25.3400 g/m 2 /hour, respectively, at baseline, versus 28.1000 and 17.2500 g/m 2 /hour on lesional and non-lesional skin area, respectively at Week 16. The median TEWL after 20 STS on lesional and nonlesional skin area were 92.7600 and 82.3100 g/m 2 /hour, respectively at baseline, versus 55.7450 and 68.8400 g/m 2 /hour on lesional and non-lesional skin area, respectively at Week 16. The results of the secondary endpoints of TEWL before and after 5, 10, 15, and 20 STS demonstrated a clinically significant improvement at Week 16 versus baseline on lesional and non-lesional skin for the ITT population. There were no observed changes at Week 16 on healthy skin.

The median TEWL AUC on lesional and non-lesional skin area were 1447.9250 and 1106.9500 g*nsts/m 2 /hour at baseline, respectively, versus 815.2000 and 826.1000 g*nsts/m 2 /hour at Week 16, respectively. The results of the secondary endpoints of TEWL AUC demonstrated a significant improvement at Week 16 versus baseline on lesional skin area and non-lesional skin area for ITT population. The secondary endpoints of the absolute change from baseline in the AUC of TEWL at Week 16 for the ITT population assessed on lesional, non-lesional, and healthy skin are provided in 5.3.5.1

## Safety results

## Exposure

The mean (SD) exposure was 191.8 (41.8) days. All participants with AD were treated for more than 112 days.

## Adverse events

## Overview

In the safety population, 21 (91.3%) participants with AD treated with dupilumab and 6 (33.3%) participants in the healthy participant cohort experienced at least 1 TEAE (Table 15 and Table 16). None of the participants in either of the cohorts experienced a severe AE, an SAE, an AE leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation, an AE leading to permanent study discontinuation, or an AESI. Overall, no clinically meaningful findings were reported in vital sign measurements, physical examination assessments, or other observations related to safety in this study .

## Treatment-emergent adverse events

In the AD participant cohort , the most common TEAE SOCs (≥15% participants) reported were infections and infestations (11 [47.8%] participants), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (11 [47.8%] participants), general disorders and administration site conditions (6 [26.1%] participants), eye disorders (5 [21.7%] participants), and nervous system disorders (4 [17.4%] participants) (Table 17). In the healthy participant cohort, the most common AE SOCs reported were infection and infestations (2 [11.1%] participants) and general disorders and administration site conditions (2 [11.1%] participants); all other SOCs were reported in 1 (5.6%) participant each (Table 18).

In the AD participant cohort, the most common TEAE PTs reported were dermatitis atopic (9 [39.1%] participants), medical device site haemorrhage (skin bleeding at skin tape stripping site, 6 [26.1%] participants), upper respiratory tract infection (4 [17.4%] participants), headache (3 [13%] participants), urticaria (3 [13%] participants) and eye pruritus (2 [8.7%] participants); all other PTs were reported in 1 (4.3%) participant each (Table 17). In the healthy participants cohort, the most common AE PT was pyrexia (2 [11.1%] participants), all other PTs were reported in 1 (5.6%) participant each (Table 18).

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The applicant submitted efficacy and safety results from study LPS16764, a phase 4, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in pediatric patients aged between ≥6 and &lt;12 years old with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Atopic dermatitis is associated with skin barrier defects, which has, amongst others, implications for the immune function of the skin. The purpose of this phase 4 study was the analysis of the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin-barrier function in adolescent and adult AD patients, i.e. on (patho-)physiological features such as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

transepidermal water loss (TEWL), epidermal activation, epidermal lipids and proteins, etc. using skin rape stripping (STS) to measure skin barrier function and integrity. In addition, disease activity was measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as high-definition standard photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas.

Overall, 43 children were enrolled in the study, two of the participants were excluded from the efficacy and safety population due to screen failures, thus 41 subjects were treated; 23 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 18 healthy volunteers (HV) to the control group which served as reference comparator for the skin barrier assessment parameters. The participants were enrolled if they had an AD diagnosis according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria at least 1 year before screening, moderate-to-severe symptoms, and active lesions on the upper limbs or lower limbs with Individual Signs Score ≥2 at screening . The demographic characteristics were balanced between both groups. The median age was 7 years in the AD group with a median disease duration of 7 years. Accordingly, most patients in the AD participant cohort had prior medications such as topical corticosteroids and other dermatological preparations, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Further medications included ophthalmologicals, drugs for the treatment of obstructive airway disease, and nasal preparations indicating concomitant type 2 inflammatory diseases. To establish similar conditions for the subsequent analysis of dupilumab's treatment effect on the skin barrier, individuals were matched with AD patients for age, gender, examined skin area and study site. Study subjects must have had a treatment gap of at least 6 months or must have been treatment-naïve.

The patients assigned to the dupilumab group were treated according to product label. The duration of the open-label treatment or observation period was 16 weeks, and the maximum study duration per participant was 32 weeks.

The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin barrier function measured by TEWL and measurement of lipids, proteins, and gene expression associated with skin barrier function from STS in the participants. In addition, this study evaluated the relationship between skin barrier function, integrity and disease activity measured by clinical assessments and patientreported outcomes. The measurement of TEWL to quantify the skin barrier functionality as well as noninvasive techniques such as STS to determine TEWL are commonly used in clinical trials. Here, 5-20 STS over a period of 16 weeks were performed in lesional and non-lesional skin areas in AD patients under dupilumab treatment and for comparison in HV. The STS time points are acceptable as the onset of dupilumab's effect was observed after 2 treatment weeks in clinical trials.

41 participants were included in the efficacy population (ITT) and safety population. TEWL measurements were combined with skin barrier perturbation using STS to measure skin barrier function and integrity. The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline in TEWL after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin at Week 16 in AD participants. After 5 STS on lesional skin in AD participants the TEWL was reduced by 37.5% at week 16, and also on non-lesional skin of AD patients as demonstrated by results of the secondary endpoints. In contrast, no changes were observed on healthy skin. As demonstrated before, dupilumab had a positive effect on further clinical and patientreported outcomes EASI, ISS, POEM, skin pain NRS, sleep disturbance NRS, worst itch NRS, and CDLQ total scores. Major protocol deviations that are deemed to have impacted efficacy analyses were reported in 31 participants (20 participants in the AD participant cohort, and 11 participants in the healthy participant cohort) due to used prohibited therapies or missing TEWL assessment not performed as defined in the protocol. It is unclear if adolescent patients were involved. To what extent these medications have influenced TEWL measurements, is not discussed by the MAH.

The safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. Overall, no new safety findings were identified in this study. No amendments of the product information were introduced by the applicant which is supported.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The efficacy results indicate that TEWL of lesional skin was gradually reduced for the total AD ITT population over a period of 16 treatment weeks compared with the TEWL of healthy volunteers suggesting an improved skin barrier. Treatment benefits also included improvements in quality of life. However, the relatively high amount of concomitant AD medication and major protocol deviations are supposed to have influenced the results. Regarding the limited analysed patient number, the generated data are considered to be supportive information. The collected safety data are consistent with the known safety profile. It is concurred that no amendment of the PI is indicated.
