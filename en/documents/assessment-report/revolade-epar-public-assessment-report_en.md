## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Chronic  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP)  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterized  by autoantibody-induced  platelet destruction and  reduced  platelet production, leading to a  low peripheral blood platelet count (&lt;150,000/ μ L). The epidemiology of ITP shows an overall incidence of ITP among adults from 1.6 to 3.0 per 100,000 person years of observation. Prevalence estimates range from 2.1 to approximately 36.4 per 100,000 persons. The estimated adult prevalence is 24.6 per 100,000 persons.

The  exact  aetiology  of  ITP  is  unknown  and  the  diagnosis  of  ITP  remains  one  of  exclusion.  The clinical  hallmark  of  the  disease  is  an  increased,  pathological  tendency  to  bleed,  spontaneously  or after  minimal  trauma.  Routine  diagnostic  tools  are  blood  count,  peripheral  blood  film,  patient history, physical examination and prompt response to high-dose corticosteroids

Disease management decisions in patients with chronic ITP are based primarily on platelet count and severity of bleeding. The goal of treatment is to elevate platelet counts to a safe range ( ≥ 50,000/ μ L to 250,000/ μ L) to minimise the risk of bleeding. Medical treatment to elevate platelet counts to a safe range is  recommended if patients' platelet count is below 30,000/ μ L or if  bleeding  symptoms are present.

Currently immunoglobulins (anti-D and IVIg) are used for the treatment of ITP. Additional drugs to treat chronic ITP include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or vincristine. Based on the  literature,  first-line  treatment  with  intravenous  immunoglobulins  or  corticosteroids  results  in normal  or  sufficient  platelet  counts  in  about  70%  of  patients  with  chronic  ITP.  IVIg  typically provides a temporary elevation of platelet counts within up to 5 days and for an average duration of 3-4  weeks.  Corticosteroids  will  induce  a  response  within  up  to  two  weeks,  although  the  effect  is often not sustained upon dose reduction or cessation of treatment, and long-term administration of corticosteroids  is  limited  by  the  development  of  side  effects.  Furthermore,  corticosteroid-treated patients are at increased risk of infections. Second-line therapy typically involves splenectomy. Twothirds of patients with ITP who undergo splenectomy will achieve a normal platelet count, which is often sustained with no additional therapy. Patients who do not have a complete response can still expect some improvement in platelet counts (e.g. partial response) or transient increases in platelet count.  When  adult  patients  fail  to  first  and  second  line  therapies,  they  are  considered  as  chronic refractory ITP. The actual percentage of patients defined as having refractory ITP varies from 11% to  35%.  Romiplostim  (Nplate),  a  recombinant  protein  that  increases  platelet  production  through activation of the thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R), was authorised in the EU in February 2009.

This application seeks marketing  authorization  for Revolade  (eltrombopag)  as  a  centralised procedure  according  to  (EC)  No  726/2004,  Mandatory  scope  (Article  3(1)),  Annex  (4)  Orphan designated medicinal product. Eltrombopag received an orphan medicinal product designation in the European  Union  on  03  August  2007  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  ITP  (Community  Register  of OMP´s EU/3/07/467).

The claimed therapeutic indication is:

'Revolade  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  previously  treated  patients  with  chronic  idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to increase platelet counts and reduce or prevent bleeding.'

The approved therapeutic indication is:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). Revolade may be considered as second line treatment for adult non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated' .

A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for the condition idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has been agreed by the PDCO. The subset of the paediatric population concerned by the paediatric development included children from 1 year to less than 18 years. Newborns and infants from birth to less than 1 year have been waived on the grounds that ITP does not occur in this paediatric subset.

The paediatric plan included the development of new a powder formulation for oral suspension in fixed  single-dose  sachets  and  a  clinical  study  to  investigate  the  safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy  of eltrombopag in patients diagnosed with ITP from 1 year to less than 18 years old. A deferral has been granted for completion of the quality study and for the initiation and completion of the clinical study.

Revolade  is  a  small  molecule  for  oral  administration  that  increases  platelet  production  through activation  of  the  TPO-R.  The  recommended  initial  dose  for  eltrombopag  is  50  mg  once  daily administered orally. If after 2 to 3 weeks of initial therapy, the platelet counts are below the clinically indicated levels (e.g. 50,000/ μ L); the dose may be increased to a maximum of 75 mg once daily. A dose reduction is recommended for patients with platelet counts between 150,000 and 250,000/ μ L. Once  the  platelet  count  is  &lt;100,000/ μ L,  therapy  should  be  reinitiated  at  a  reduced  daily  dose. Eltrombopag  treatment  should  only  be  initiated  by  a  physician  experienced  in  the  treatment  of thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by the exclusion of other clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia. Consideration should be given to performing a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy over the course of the disease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, those with systemic symptoms or abnormal signs.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Forced degradation studies and photostability studies have also been carried out.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  pharmaceutical  development  of  this  sparingly-soluble  drug  product  has  been  performed  in  a satisfactory way. Attention has focussed on the physical state of the active substance, in particular the particle size, in order to obtain consistent bioavailability. A risk-based approach is applied to the development  of  the  active  substance  (in  the  synthesis  process  of  eltrombopag  free  acid  and  the synthesis of eltrombopag olamine) in order to establish the design space and control strategy for the process parameters. Concerning pharmaceutical development of the product, the design intent was to develop  an  oral  formulation,  with  a  minimal  number  of  tablets  per  dose.  A  risk  based  approach (FMEA and BRITEST) was utilised during development, to identify and mitigate risks by dosage form design, the manufacturing process and controls where appropriate.

Therefore the synthesis of the active substance and the manufacture of the product are under control and  can  deliver  a  consistently  high  quality  active  substance  or  product,  controlled  from  batch  to batch by relevant and validated test methodology and specification limits.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

A range of in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to investigate the primary and secondary pharmacology  of  eltrombopag,  including  a  battery  of  safety  pharmacology  studies.  Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion studies have been performed with eltrombopag to assess the suitability of the animal species used during toxicological evaluation.

As claimed by the applicant, all safety pharmacology studies, a number of pharmacokinetic studies and  all  pivotal  toxicity  studies  (including  the  toxicokinetic  investigations)  were  carried  out  in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. All other studies were conducted in line  with  Company  Divisional  Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  Policies,  and  in  general accordance with the principles of GLP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro studies

In  murine  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (BAF3)-TPO  cells  stably  transfected  with  human  TPO-R eltrombopag  half  maximal  effective  concentration  (EC50)  was  0.27 μ M,  and  in  32D-mpl  cells (murine cells transfected with human TPO-R and gpIIb promoter linked to luciferase) the EC50 was 0.1 μ M.

Activation of the STAT and MAPK pathways by eltrombopag was observed using phospho-specific antibodies  in  western  blots.  Eltrombopag  (10 μ M)  stimulated  STAT  3  and  STAT5  (STAT-based transduction  pathways)  and  activated  p42/44  MAPK,  with  a  similar  kinetics  to  that  observed  for TPO. However, eltrombopag was only able to induce minimal phosphorylation of STAT 1 and no phosphorylation of AKT. In addition to activation of the STAT and MAPK signal transduction paths, the expression of certain early response genes associated with proliferation and TPO activation, i.e., Fos, EGR-1 and thyroid-like receptor 3 was upregulated following treatment with eltrombopag (30 μ M).

Eltrombopag induced proliferation of a megakaryocyte cell line (N2C-TPO, also named UT7/TPO) with an EC50 of 0.03 μ M. Eltrombopag also showed to be able to increase differentiation of human CD 34+ marrow progenitor cells into CD41+ megakaryocytic cells in a dose dependent manner with an EC50 of 0.1 μ M. Megakaryocyte differentiation equivalent to that observed following treatment with  TPO  (0.1 μ g/mL)  was  observed  at  an  eltrombopag  concentration  of  3 μ M.  Comparison  of eltrombopag potency with TPO potency in terms of EC50 ( μ M) showed that TPO is between 7 to 9 orders  of  magnitude  more  potent  than  eltrombopag  in  the  CD34+  megakaryocyte  differentiation assay,  as  well  as  in  the  N2C-TPO  proliferation  assay.  When  comparing  the  maximum  effect achieved by TPO and eltrombopag in these two assays, maximum eltrombopag effect is between 95 and 155% the maximum effect achieved by TPO.

Eltrombopag showed an additive effect with TPO on STAT activation, and in a proliferation assay in N2C-TPO cells. In an apoptosis assay, both eltrombopag and TPO were additive in their ability to prevent cell death; the level of maximal activity was demonstrated at 0.1 μ g/mL TPO and at 0.3 μ M eltrombopag.

There was no activity of eltrombopag (over a 3 log concentration range) in the BAF3 parental line and in additional proliferation, reporter gene or STAT activation assays in cells that did not express TPO-R  but  that  utilize  STAT  signalling  pathways  (UT7-EPO,  BAF3/GCSFR,  HepG2  and  BAF parental).

Eltrombopag  inhibited  the  proliferation  of  fifteen  out  of  seventeen  leukaemia  and  lymphoma  cell lines (IC50 = 0.56 to 15.4 μ g/mL) and of liver cancer cell line HepG2 (IC50= 5.61 μ g/mL). The cell lines  NOMO-1  and  OCI-M1  (AML)  were  resistant  to  eltrombopag  with  IC50 &gt;  40 μ g/mL,  the maximum  tested  dose.  Other  two  cell  lines  N2C-TPO  and  HEL  92.1.7,  demonstrated  increased proliferation  at  eltrombopag  concentrations  from  0.006  to  1.7 μ g/mL,  and  0.1  to  0.4 μ g/mL, respectively. Additional studies were performed in other tumour cell lines which included 4 different lung carcinoma cell lines, 2 prostate tumour cell lines and 3 ovarian tumour cell lines. There was no increase in proliferation of any of the additional cell lines tested.

TPO-R mRNA expression was low in the majority of the 376 tumour cell lines tested, as measured by qRT-PCR. Nevertheless, two AML cell lines, HEL 92.1.7 and KG-1, and the lung carcinoma cell line NCI-H510 had greater than 9500 normalized abundance for TPO-R mRNA.

In contrast to TPO, eltrombopag (1 to 10 μ M) has no direct effect on in vitro platelet aggregation or activation,  nor  does  it  influence  the  ability  of  ADP  (3 μ M),  collagen  (2 μ g/mL)  or  the  thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) (20 μ M) to induce platelet aggregation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eltrombopag showed a marked specificity for human and chimpanzee TPO-R. The transmembrane domain  and  amino  acid  residue  His499  in  particular,  was  demonstrated  to  be  necessary  for eltrombopag/TPO-R interaction. Threonine 492 and zinc also contribute to the in  vitro activity  of eltrombopag in transient transfection models as well.

## In vivo studies

Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo studies were performed in chimpanzees. Five daily doses of 10 mg/kg/day  produced  increases  between  1.3-  to  2.4-  fold  in  platelet  counts  approximately  1  week after the last dose and returned to baseline values within 2 weeks. A similar trend was observed in reticulated platelet counts.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The selectivity of eltrombopag was assessed in a panel of standard in vitro radio-ligand binding and enzyme  activity  assays  against  41  physiologically  relevant  receptors,  enzymes  and  ion  channels. Eltrombopag showed activity (defined as &gt; 25% inhibition) on 4 targets: α 2B-receptor (38%, IC50= 15.5 μ M),  I2-receptor  (88%,  IC50=  1.7 μ M),  oestrogenα -receptor  (85%,  IC50=  0.3 μ M)  and oestrogenβ -receptor (33%, IC50= 1.9 μ M).

## · Safety pharmacology programme

## -In vitro studies on the effect on cardiac ion channels:

The  effects  of  eltrombopag  (10  or  25 μ M)  on  action  potential  duration  at  30%,  60%  and  90% repolarisation,  maximum  rate  of  depolarization  (MRD),  upstroke  amplitude  (UA)  and  resting membrane potential (RMP) were investigated in isolated  dog  Purkinje  fibres  paced  at  stimulation frequencies of 1 and 0.5 Hz. In fibres paced at 3 Hz (control and 25 μ M), only MRD was measured.

In fibres stimulated at frequencies of 0.5 and 1 Hz, exposure to eltrombopag at concentrations of 10 and  25 μ M  had  no  effects  on  resting  membrane  potential  and  action  potential  duration  at  30% repolarisation. In the presence of 10 μ M (4.4 μ g/mL) and 25 μ M (11.1 μ g/mL) eltrombopag induced decreases  in  maximum  rate  of  depolarization,  upstroke  amplitude  and  action  potential  duration  at 60% and 90% repolarisation. The effects on MRD at 1 and 0.5 Hz suggested that eltrombopag may produce a tonic inhibition of cardiac sodium channels.

A  study  was  conducted  to  measure  the  effect  of  eltrombopag  on  hERG  currents  recorded  from HEK293 cells stably transfected with hERG-1 cDNA. A series of concentrations up to the maximum soluble concentration of eltrombopag (21.7 μ M) were tested. E-4031 (0.1 μ M), a known inhibitor of the IKr , current was used as a reference substance. Eltrombopag was found to inhibit hERG channel tail  current  in  a  concentration-  dependent  manner.  The  nominal  IC25,  IC50  and  IC75  values  were estimated to be 0.09, 0.69 and 5.13 μ M, respectively.

## In vivo studies

## - Overt Central and Peripheral Effects:

Male Sprague Dawley rats (10 per group) were administered eltrombopag as single oral doses at 0, 3, 10  or  40  mg/kg.  Eltrombopag  did  not  affect  any  of  the  measures  of  the  functional  observational battery (FOB). The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for this study is 40 mg/kg (6-fold the maximum proposed human Cmax of eltrombopag when administered at 75 mg/day (12.7 μ g/mL).

## - Actions on Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems:

Conscious male Sprague Dawley rats (n=4) were administered eltrombopag as single oral doses at 0, 3, 10 and 40 mg/kg on separate days in a crossover study design with 7 days between treatments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ventilatory  parameters  (tidal  volume,  respiratory  rate  and  minute  volume)  and  airway  resistance (total pulmonary resistance) were recorded before dosing, around the times of Cmax (1 and 4 hours post  dose)  and  at  approximately  24  and  48  hours  post  dose.  Eltrombopag  did  not  produce  any adverse  effect on  respiratory function in the male  rat.  The  no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for this study is 40 mg/kg.

Conscious male Beagle Dogs (n=4) were administered eltrombopag as single oral doses at 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg on separate days in a crossover study design with 7 days between treatments.

Eltrombopag had no effect  on  arterial  blood  pressures,  heart  rate  or  ECG  intervals  during  the  48 hours  post  dose.  There  was  no  evidence  of  ECG  waveform  abnormalities  or  arrhythmias  in  ECG tracings at tmax (1 hour post dose), and at approximately 4, 24 and 48 hours post dose. Additionally no evidence of cardiac abnormalities was observed in dogs in the 52 week repeat dose study at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (3-fold higher exposure than expected at maximum human dose).

No studies have been submitted.

## Pharmacokinetics

For pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic investigations, plasma samples were analyzed for eltrombopag  (parent  compound)  by  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass spectrometry  (HPLC/MS/MS)  analysis,  preceded  by  protein  precipitation.  The  lower  limit  of quantification for eltrombopag was 10 ng/mL and the higher limit of quantification was 2500 ng/mL using a 50 μ L plasma sample.

Determination of the radioactivity in biological samples following the administration of 14C-labelled eltrombopag was carried out by either direct liquid scintillation counting (LSC) or by LSC following combustion of the sample. For radioactivity levels in tissues, whole body autoradiographic technique with quantitative imaging was used. The profiling and identification of metabolites of eltrombopag was  performed  using  a  variety  of  techniques  including  HPLC  with  radiochemical  and  ultraviolet (UV)  detection,  liquid  chromatography  with  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS),  liquid  chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and/or NMR analysis.

- Absorption

Following single  intravenous  administration,  plasma  clearance  of  eltrombopag  (parent  compound) was 0.45 mL/min/kg in rats, 0.44 mL/min/kg in dogs and 3.3 mL/min/kg in monkeys, with half-lives of 12, 14 and 7.7 hours, respectively. Volume of distribution corresponded to 2 times the total body water in the monkey (1.39 L/kg), but less than one-half total body water in rats and dogs (0.196 L/kg and 0.47 L/kg, respectively).

Following a single oral administration in solution, eltrombopag was more quickly absorbed in rats, dogs, or humans (tmax of 1.35 to 2.5 hours) than in the monkey (tmax of 4.25 hours). In mice, tmax values ranged from 1 to 4 hours.

Oral bioavailability of eltrombopag (parent compound) when administered in solution was between 12 to 34% in rats, 83% in dogs and 89% in monkeys. In dogs, when administered in a capsule, the oral bioavailability of eltrombopag was higher when given as the bis-monoethanolamine salt (48%) than that following administration of the parent compound  (21%). When  comparing  oral bioavailability  of  eltrombopag  (parent  compound)  administered  in  solution,  suspension  or  in  a capsule, the highest bioavailability was for the solution, being F values of 83%, 15.8% and 7.09%, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Repeat administration of the salting agent, monoethanolamine, at 32.4 mg/kg/day to mice for 7 days (equivalent to eltrombopag bis-monoethanolamine salt at 150 mg/kg/day) did not increase monoethanolamine above normal endogenous levels in plasma.

In  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  eltrombopag  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs,  systemic exposures of eltrombopag increased with dose (approximately proportionally in mice and dogs, but greater  than  proportionally  in  rats).  In  juvenile  rats  systemic  exposures  of  eltrombopag  decreased with dose.  There were no marked differences in systemic exposure between males and females and no consistent indication of accumulation upon repeat administration in any species. In general there were no differences in  exposure  between  pigmented  and  non-pigmented  animals.  In  embryofoetal development studies in rabbits, systemic exposures of eltrombopag increased above doseproportionally.

## · Distribution

Eltrombopag-related  material  was  widely  distributed  into  peripheral  tissues  in  mice  and  rats, although  higher  levels  were  generally  associated  with  tissues  involved  in  absorption  and/or elimination  (gastrointestinal  tract,  liver  and  renal  cortex);  the  concentrations  in  most  tissues  were lower than in blood. Drug-related material did not extensively penetrate into central nervous system or  the  lens  of  the  eye,  nor  was  it  selectively  retained  in  melanin  containing  tissues.  There  was  no evidence of tissue accumulation of drug-related material in mice, including eyes, kidneys and skin, although  the  levels  of  the  radioactivity  in  the  tissues  after  repeated  administration  in  rats  were slightly higher and declined slower than those observed following a single dose.

Eltrombopag was highly bound to plasma proteins in mouse (93.7%-99.8%), and very highly bound (99.0%-99.8%) in rats, dogs, monkeys and humans; with low association to blood cells.

## · Metabolism

Following incubation of [ 14 C]eltrombopag with human liver microsomes and supersomes resulted in the formation of metabolite J (a mono-oxygenation product of eltrombopag). CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 were the primary enzymes involved in the in vitro oxidative metabolism of eltrombopag. UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 metabolized eltrombopag to form metabolite K (glucuronide conjugate).  Following incubation  of  [ 14 C]eltrombopag  with  human  hepatocytes,  the  major  metabolic  pathways  observed were  conjugation  with  glucuronic  acid  (metabolite  K)  or  cysteine  (metabolite  G).  Other  minor pathways were conjugation with glutathione (metabolite F) and oxidation that led to formation of an M+14  metabolite.  Additional  metabolites  detected  included  metabolite  J  (mono-oxygenated)  and metabolite  O  (oxidation  of  a  methyl  to  a  carboxylic  acid).  Human  kidney  microsomes  exhibited minimal capacity to metabolize eltrombopag in vitro .

The metabolic profiles of eltrombopag in vitro were qualitatively similar in rats, dogs and monkeys. There  has  been  no  evidence  for  the  formation  of  any  human  specific  metabolites. In  vivo eltrombopag was the predominant circulating component in all species. In rats there was adequate coverage for the circulating metabolites in humans. M14 which accounts for a 20% in human urine excretion was present up to 9.2% in mice urine but was not detected in rats and information is not available in dogs.

## · Excretion

Eltrombopag  was  primarily  eliminated  as  unchanged  drug  in  the  faeces  with  renal  elimination  of cleavage products contributing as a minor route. Gut microbes readily cleaved eltrombopag based on in vitro incubation of eltrombopag with human faeces and mouse and rat cecal contents in anaerobic conditions.  Qualitatively,  all  of  the  major  metabolites  of  eltrombopag  observed  in  humans  were observed in the non-clinical species.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

In vitro studies show that eltrombopag was an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 with IC50 values of 24.8  and  20.2 μ M,  respectively,  but  was  not  an  inhibitor  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5 or CYP4A9/11 at concentrations up to 100 μ M.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eltrombopag was only a weak activator of human Pregnane X receptor (PXR) with low efficacy and was  not  an  activator  of  rat  PXR.  Furthermore,  in  conjunction  with  oral  toxicity  studies,  repeat administration  of  eltrombopag  for  up  to  14  days  did  not  result  in  notable  changes  in  activities  of CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2E, CYP3A and CYP4A in rat or dog. Eltrombopag did not cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in cultured human hepatocytes.

Eltrombopag  was  found  to  be  an in  vitro inhibitor  of  several  uridine  diphosphate  glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) with IC50s ranging from 3 to 30 μ M (UGT1A9, UGT1A3, UGT1A1, UGT2B15, UGT1A6, UGT2B7 and UGT1A4).

In vitro eltrombopag is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. According to the Applicant, only 21% of the dose could be subjected to hepatic conversion mediated by CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.

Eltrombopag was neither an inhibitor nor a substrate of human Pgp and was not a substrate of human OATP1B1, although it was an inhibitor of this transporter and the potential for such an interaction was confirmed clinically following co-administration of eltrombopag with rosuvastatin (a substrate of OATP1B1 and BCRP). Eltrombopag inhibited OATP1B1-mediated uptake of [ 3 H]estradiol 17 β -D-glucuronide with and IC50 of 2.71 μ M. In addition, eltrombopag was an in vitro inhibitor and a substrate  of  human  BCRP.  Eltrombopag  inhibited  also  BCRP-mediated  transport  of  cimetidine in vitro with an IC50 of 2.7 μ M.

## Toxicology

The toxicity profile of eltrombopag has been investigated in a battery of studies including a single dose study in dogs, repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks in mice, 28 weeks in rats and 52 weeks  in  dogs,  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies,  reproductive  toxicity  studies  and  local tolerance studies. Pivotal studies were conducted in accordance with GLP regulations.

- Single dose toxicity

Beagle dogs (n= 1 male and 1 female) were administered a single oral dose of eltrombopag at 100 or 300 mg/kg, 7 days apart, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in dogs by the oral route. A  dose  of  100  mg/kg  was  tolerated  with  clinical  signs  limited  to  slight  reductions  in  food consumption  and  body  weight  (4  to  7%).  A  dose  of  300  mg/kg  was  poorly-tolerated  and  was associated  with  emesis,  abnormal  stool  consistency,  decreased  activity,  inappetence  and  moderate body weight reduction.

Toxicokinetic data were determined on Days 1 and 8 - pre-dose, and approximately 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dose. A 3-fold increase in dose supposed a more than dose proportional increase in exposure in the male dog (~ 5-fold), and a 3-fold decrease in exposure in the female dog.  Exposures ranged from 12.6-fold to 86-fold the maximum proposed clinical exposure (exposure margins are presented based upon comparison of the animal systemic exposure with that reported for ITP patients receiving  the  maximum  proposed  oral  therapeutic  dose  of  75  mg/day  eltrombopag:  AUC=  168 μ g.h/mL, Cmax= 12.7 μ g/mL).

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The toxicity  of  repeated  oral  doses  of  eltrombopag  has  been  assessed  in  mice  (5  studies),  rats  (6 studies),  rabbits  (2  studies)  and  dogs  (4  studies)  in  studies  of  up  to  13,  28,  1  and  52  weeks, respectively. In addition, repeat dose toxicity was assessed in 2 year carcinogenicity studies in mice. The major findings are summarised in Table 2.

In  addition  in  a  safety,  pharmacology  and  pharmacokinetics study in chimpanzees it was reported that there were no treatment-related effects on clinical signs or body weight and no adverse clinical pathology findings following single eltrombopag doses of 0.1, 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg or repeated doses of 10 mg/kg.

a: Due to mortality, 300 mg/kg/day was discontinued at Week 3. In females, 150 mg/kg/day was lowered to 115 mg/kg/day at Week 21 due to clinical signs. Dosing in both males at 150 mg/kg/day and females at 150/115 mg/kg/day was discontinued at Week 43 and the animals were euthanized at Week 64.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

The effects of eltrombopag on fertility and general reproductive performance, peri- and post-natal development and juvenile toxicity have been investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats, while the effects on  embryofoetal  development  have  been  investigated  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  and  New  Zealand white rabbits.

In  a  male  fertility  study  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats  testicular  weights  were  slightly  increased  at  40 mg/kg/day, but there were no effects of eltrombopag on mating and fertility of the treated males, nor any effects on survival, growth or external morphology of the foetuses sired by the treated males. The no observed adverse effect dose for male fertility in this study was 40 mg/kg/day. In a rat repeat dose oral toxicity study for up to 10 days vacuolar changes in the testes were noted at 40 and 120 mg/kg/day, as well as spermatid retention/ degeneration at 120 mg/kg/day eltrombopag (2.3- to 5.1fold  greater  than  the  maximum  proposed  clinical  exposure).    These  were  not  associated  with systemic toxicity.

In a female fertility and early embryonic development study in Sprague-Dawley rats, decreases in maternal  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  noted  at  60  mg/kg/day  (6.2-fold  the maximum proposed clinical exposure). Embryotoxicity was observed at 60 mg/kg/day in the form of increased pre- and post-implantation loss (leading to a 27% decrease in live litter size) and a 20% to 21% decrease in foetal weight. Under the conditions of this study, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level  (NOAEL)  for  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  was  20  mg/kg/day  (2-fold  the maximum proposed clinical exposure).

In one embryofoetal development study in rat, animals given eltrombopag orally at 60 mg/kg/day for 11 days, showed decreased maternal body weight (9%) and food consumption (8%-11%), as well as decreased foetal weights in males and females (6%-7%), and increased incidence of cervical ribs. No test  article-related  changes  were  observed  for  any  caesarean  section  parameters  (corpora  lutea, implants,  pre-  and  post-  implantation  loss  and  number  of  live  foetuses).  These  studies  were performed at 60 mg/kg/day eltrombopag, 6.2-fold the maximum proposed clinical exposure.

One embryofoetal development study was performed in New Zealand rabbits. Eltrombopag did not produce effects on uterine or teratogenicity parameters.

In  a  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  in  rats,  there  were  no  adverse  effects  on  pregnancy, parturition or lactation of female rats and no effects on the growth, development, neurobehavioral or reproductive function of the offspring at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.

Two juvenile toxicity studies were conducted in rat pups dosed eltrombopag from Days 4 to 32 pp. At doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (2274 μ g.h/mL, 13.5-fold the maximum proposed clinical exposure) some deaths occurred, as well as evident toxicity clinical signs (decreased activity, weakness, thinness and cold  to  touch).  Pale  yellow  discoloration  of  the  fur/skin,  carcass,  salivary  gland  and  thymus, revealing  hepatic  affectation,  was  reverted  in  the  30  mg/kg/day  dose  group  during  the  4  week recovery period. Ocular opacities were noted grossly in five animals in the middle dose group (30 mg/kg/day). There were no treatment related findings at 10 mg/kg/day (977 μ g.h/mL; 5.8- fold the maximum proposed clinical exposure).

In one of the studies there was a slight decrease in red blood cell count, haemoglobin, and mean cell haemoglobin  concentration  values  for  males,  a  slight  increase  in  absolute  reticulocyte  counts  for females, and slight increases in red cell distribution width for males and females at 15 mg/kg/day.

Due to age-dependent development of hepatic excretory pathways, and additional juvenile toxicity study was conducted at higher doses in slightly older rats. Pups were dosed eltrombopag orally once daily from Day 32 to 63 post partum. There were no deaths or treatment-related effects on clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observations, body weight, food consumption or ophthalmology at doses up to 40 mg/kg /day. At the highest  dose  group  (40  mg/kg/day),  effects  on  red  blood  cell  parameters  to  the  same  extent  than observed in the previous study in younger pups were also noted. In this case, these findings were not considered adverse.

At 40 mg/kg/day dose group, increased urinary protein was noted in males, It was considered to be related to an increased incidence of tubular hyaline droplets observed in the kidneys of males given 15 and 40 mg/kg/day. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that the hyaline droplets contained alpha-2  microglobulin,  a  male-rat  specific  protein.  Changes  were  only  accompanied  by  slight proteinuria and were not accompanied by histologic evidence of renal damage.

As a conclusion from these three studies, toxicity was observed at lower eltrombopag doses in the youngest animals dosed from Day 4 to 32 pp (NOAEL: 10-15 mg/kg/day), when compared to older animals, administered from Day 32 to 63 pp (NOAEL: 40 mg/kg/day).

- Local tolerance

Local tolerance studies included in vitro ocular and dermal irritancy studies and an ex vivo ocular irritancy assay. Eltrombopag was considered not to be skin irritant but a severe ocular irritant.

- Other toxicity studies

## Antigenicity

An in vivo study on skin sensitisation potential in the mouse local lymph node assay was submitted. Eltrombopag was considered to be a non-sensitizer under the conditions of this assay.

## Immunotoxicity

A study was performed to investigate the effects of eltrombopag on the primary antibody response to T-cell dependent antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). There was no treatment-related effect on immunology parameters in females. Male rats in the highest dose group showed a decrease in group geometric mean anti-KLH IgM antibody concentration, compared to the male control group (3 versus 19 μ g/mL; p ≤ 0.01). The decrease in anti-KLH IgM response in the 40 mg/kg/day male group is considered related to drug treatment; however, whether it is a direct drug effect or secondary to the slight  decrease  (12  and  15%)  in  body  weight  gain  at  the  time  of  immunization  and  IgM measurement, is uncertain. The finding is considered non-adverse based on nominal differences in anti-KLH  IgG  response  which  were  neither  statistically  nor  biologically  significant  in  the  40 mg/kg/day  male  group,  compared  to  controls.  In  conclusion,  eltrombopag  at  doses  up  to  40 mg/kg/day does not adversely affect immune function.

## Phototoxicity

Eltrombopag was demonstrated to be phototoxic in vitro (3T3 NRU phototoxicity test).

There was no evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity in SKH1-hr mice at ~1 hour, 4 hours (tmax) and 3 days post UVR exposure (dose equivalent to ~ 0.5 MED) at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day  for 14 days (Cmax of 167 μ g/mL and AUC of 1607 μ g.h/mL, corresponding to 13.1- and  9.5- fold maximum proposed clinical exposure, respectively).

Studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  phototoxic  potential  of  eltrombopag  on  the  eyes  of pigmented  and  non-pigmented  (albino)  mice  and  rats.  The  overall  incidence  and  progression  of cataracts  was  generally  increased  in  pigmented  female  mice  (B6C3F1)  versus  albino  female  mice (CD-1) given eltrombopag (100 or 150 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks, with or without UVR exposure (0.6 MED/day or 3 MED/week). There were 6 deaths (6 out of 35) in albino mice given 150 mg/kg/day eltrombopag (3 exposed and 3 no exposed). No adverse clinical observations  or deaths  related  to treatment were noted in pigmented mice

No  adverse  ophthalmological  or  histological  findings  were  noted  in  eyes  of  male  Long  Evans (pigmented) and Sprague Dawley (albino) rats given 40 mg/kg/day eltrombopag orally for 14 days followed by a single UVR exposure ( ∼ 0.5 MED).

## Renal effects

A four-week investigative study on potential eltrombopag-induced renal toxicity was performed in female CD-1 mice (n=12/group; ~ 11 weeks of age at the start of dosing). Eltrombopag dose: 150 mg/kg/day,  p.o.,  for  4  weeks;  or  250  mg/kg/day,  p.o.,  for  11  days.  Toxicokinetics:  additional  20 animals/group.

Mortality and deteriorating clinical condition at 250 mg/kg/day between Days 9 and 11 resulted in the  early  termination  (Day  11)  of  the  remainder  of  that  group.  Renal  findings  associated  with  the spontaneous syndrome of chronic nephropathy in mice, tubular basophilia and interstitial inflammatory  infiltrates  were  present  in  eltrombopag-treated  mice  at  an  increased  incidence  (0 control vs. 6 mice given 150 mg/kg/day, Day 28) and tubular casts were present at 250 mg/kg/day at an increased number and localization (cortex and medulla vs. confined to the medulla in controls or mice  given  150  mg/kg/day).  Eltrombopag-related  tubular  degeneration,  tubular  dilation  and/or regenerative  changes  were  observed  at  low  incidence  (approximately  20%)  and  minimal  to  mild severity at doses of 150 or 250 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure was similar (AUC ≈ 2300 μ g.h/mL) at doses of 150 mg/kg/day on Day 28 or 250 mg/kg/day on Day 11. tmax occurred at 8 or 2 hours post dose at 150 or 250 mg/kg/day, respectively.

A  second  investigative  study  on  potential  eltrombopag-induced  renal  toxicity  was  performed  in female CD-1 mice (n=40/group; ~ 6 weeks of age at the start of dosing). Eltrombopag dose: 150 mg/kg/day p.o., for up to 28 or 32 weeks. Mice given 150 mg/kg/day had decreased body weight gain and 4 of 40 mice died or were euthanized in moribund condition (following 81 to 193 doses of eltrombopag; Weeks 12 to 28). Degeneration and necrosis noted in cortical and medullar tubules of 3 of  these  mice  were  considered  secondary  changes  associated  with  moribundity  and  vascular compromise. Increases in urine protein-to-urine creatinine ratios (up to 3.9X control) were observed in  mice  given  150  mg/kg/day  following  87  to  196  days  of  dosing  (Weeks  13  to  28).  Tubular basophilia, inflammatory  infiltrates within interstitial and tubular casts, associated with the spontaneous syndrome of chronic nephropathy in mice, were found in both the treated and control group with no differences in the incidence and severity, which increased with age. There were no test article-related microscopic renal findings following up to 193 days of dosing.

## Studies on impurities

A review of the synthetic route for eltrombopag and possible degradation chemistry of reagents used therein  highlighted  a  number  of  synthetic  intermediates  and  degradation  products  as  potential genotoxins: SB-611855-AAB, SB-601205, SB-564758, GSK560666A and SB-710620-A.

SB-611855-AAB and SB-601205 were negative in Ames bacterial mutation assays in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system (S9-mix) when tested up to 5000 μ g/plate. SB-564758, an isolated intermediate, was not mutagenic in an Ames assay in the presence and absence of S9-mix at  up  to  5000 μ g/plate  but  was  clastogenic  in  an in  vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  S9-mix.  SB-564758  was  negative  in  a  rat  oral micronucleus  assay  at  doses  up  to  600 mg/kg/day.  Based  on  these  findings,  SB-611855-AAB, SB-601205 and SB-564758 are considered non-genotoxic impurities.

SB-710620-A  and  GSK560666A  were  positive  in  an in  vitro bacterial  mutation  HTFT  (high throughput fluctuation test) mutagenicity screen.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Using the Phase I calculation without marketing penetration factor (Fpen) refinement for prediction of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC), the calculated PEC for eltrombopag (0.35 μ g/l) was above the trigger value of 0.01 μ g/l. According to published epidemiological data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Abrahamson et  al .  2009),  an  incidence  of  0.39  in  10,000  is  equivalent  to  0.0039%  of  the population  and  use  of  this  refined  figure  in  the  standard  Phase  I  calculation  of  worst  case  PEC would give a PEC value of 0.0015 µg/L which is significantly below the nominal trigger value of 0.01 µg/L.

The study OECD 107 for the determination of logKow showed a log Kow above 4.5 at pH7.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The in vitro inhibitory effects on α 2B, I2-, oestrogenα - and oestrogenβ -receptors were not correlated with in vivo findings in clinical trials or in non-clinical species at exposures approximately 3- to 6fold maximum  clinical exposure (based on AUC  and  Cmax). The potential for secondary pharmacodynamic effects on these receptors in patients receiving eltrombopag is unlikely and thus, potential interactions associated with a particular medical condition or with concomitant medications are not expected.

According  to  Guideline  3BS1a  on  Single  dose  Toxicity,  single-dose  toxicity  studies  must  be conducted  on  at  least  two  mammalian  species.  For  eltrombopag  only  one  study  in  dogs  was performed. According to the same Guideline, two different routes of administration should be used. In the only study provided, eltrombopag was just administered orally, the intended route for man. However, this approach has been considered acceptable based on the battery of repeat dose toxicity studies provided.

The  principal  toxicological  findings  associated  with  eltrombopag  administration  include  cataracts (mice and rats), renal toxicity (mice) and hepatotoxicity (mice, rats and dogs). In vitro phototoxicity (3T3 and CHO cells) has also been observed. This information has been addressed in section 5.3 of the SPC.

Observed effects on red blood cells including decreased reticulocyte counts (in rats and dogs) and regenerative  bone  marrow  erythroid  hyperplasia  (rats  only)  observed  in  short  term  studies  and endosteal hyperostosis (rats only) have been addressed in section 5.3 of the SPC.

Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (included in section 5.3 of the SPC). Studies in animals have shown that eltrombopag is likely secreted into milk, therefore a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded and a warning has been included in section 4.6 of the SPC.

Study OECD 107 for the determination of logKow presented in the ERA showed a log Kow above 4.5 at pH7; therefore a PBT-assessment is necessary. The substance should be screened in a step-wise procedure  for  persistence  (OECD  308),  toxicity  (OECD  210,  OECD  211)  and  bioaccumulation (OECD 305) and the Applicant has committed to submit these studies as a follow up measure.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Two Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies RAISE (TRA102537) and TRA100773B and two open-label studies REPEAT (TRA108057) and EXTEND (TRA105325) evaluated the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in adult patients with previously treated chronic ITP.  Overall, eltrombopag was administered to 277 patients for at least 6 months and 202 patients for at least 1 year.

The therapeutic indication for Revolade claimed by the Applicant was: Revolade is indicated for the treatment of previously treated patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to increase platelet counts and reduce or prevent bleeding.

The approved therapeutic indication is: Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). Revolade may be considered as second line treatment for adult non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated.

The  Applicant  received  Protocol  Assistance  from  the  CHMP  on  clinical  aspects  of  the  dossier focusing on the study design for the pivotal trials.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## · Methods

## Analytical methods

Plasma  samples  were  analysed  for  eltrombopag  using  a  method  based  on  protein  precipitation, followed by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) analysis.  Data  on  BQL,  within  and  between-run  precision,  accuracy  and  sample stability show values within the accepted range of suitability for a human plasma analysis.

## Pharmacokinetic data analysis

Pharmacokinetic  data  were  firstly  explored  on  the  basis  of  an  individual  approach  by  using  noncompartmental PK analysis (WinNonlin software). Population pharmacokinetic methods, using the program NONMEM VI, have also been used to analyse PK data from 5 studies: 3 Phase I studies (TRA102860, TRA105580, SB-487115/002), 1 Phase II study (TRA100773A) and 1 Phase III study (TRA100773B).

Statistical analyses conducted with PK data were standard and appropriate in each case.

## · Absorption

The plasma eltrombopag concentration-time data was collected in 88 subjects with ITP in Studies TRA100773A  and TRA100773B  (see Table 5). Plasma eltrombopag concentrations were quantifiable  within  approximately  1  h,  with  peak  concentrations  occurring  2  to  6h  after  oral administration  of  single  and  repeat  doses  of  eltrombopag.  The  plasma  elimination  half  life  of eltrombopag is approximately 21 to 32 h.

Table  5:  Plasma  Eltrombopag  AUC(0-tau)  and  Cmax  Estimates  for  Subjects  with  ITP  in  Studies TRA100773A and TRA100773B

| Eltrombopag Dose, QD   |   N | AUC(0- τ ) a , μ g.h/mL   | Cmax a , μ g/mL   |
|------------------------|-----|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 30mg                   |  28 | 47 (39, 58)               | 3.78 (3.18, 4.49) |
| 50mg                   |  34 | 108 (88, 134)             | 8.01 (6.73, 9.53) |
| 75mg                   |  26 | 168 (143, 198)            | 12.7 (11.0, 14.5) |

Data presented as geometric mean (95% CI).  AUC(0τ ) and Cmax based on population PK post-hoc estimates.

Plasma  eltrombopag  AUC  and  Cmax  increased  with  increasing  dose  and  the  evaluation  of proportionality was dose dependent. Plasma eltrombopag AUC(0τ ) increased in a dose proportional manner between 50 mg and 200 mg; Cmax increased in a dose proportional manner between 50 mg and 150 mg. At doses below 50 mg, plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-∞ ) and Cmax increased in a greater than  dose-proportional  manner.  Between-subject  variability  (%CVb)  in  AUC  and  Cmax  was generally between 30 and 40%.

A population PK analysis was performed using the data from 111 healthy subjects from three Phase I studies  (TRA102860,  TRA105580, SB-497115/002) and 88 ITP patients from one Phase II study (TRA100773A) and one Phase III study (TRA100773B). The PK of eltrombopag following singleand  repeat-oral  administration  were  adequately  described  by  a  linear  2-compartment  model  with absorption lag time, dual sequential first order absorption, inter-occasion variability on absorption and first order elimination. The absorption rate constant at 1.9 hours post dose increased from 0.5 hr1 to 10.4 hr-1, indicating that eltrombopag absorption rate is much faster in the small intestine than in  the  stomach.  The  estimated  mean  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI))  parameter  values  for  an  ITP male Caucasian patient that weighed 70 kg and did not take corticosteroids are shown in Table 6.

In healthy subjects receiving eltrombopag once daily for 10 days, the accumulation ratio (90% CI) was 1.44 (1.20,1.63) for 50 mg once daily and 1.56 (1.23,1.97) for 75 mg once daily. Eltrombopag demonstrated time-invariant PK over the dose range of 5 mg to 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days.  Based  on  a  population  PK  analysis,  the  apparent  oral  clearance  for  eltrombopag  was,  on average, 17% higher in healthy subjects as compared to patients with chronic ITP.

## Influence of food

The absorption of eltrombopag was significantly reduced when administered with the standard highfat  breakfast  with  milk  (corresponding  to  427mg  calcium);  whereas,  low-calcium  meals  (&lt;50mg calcium),  regardless  of  fat  content,  had  minimal  impact  on  plasma  eltrombopag  exposure.  In addition,  the  absorption  of  eltrombopag  was  significantly  reduced  when  co-administered  with  a polyvalent cation-containing antacid.

## · Distribution

Distribution was well characterized in the final population PK model by assuming a 2-compartment PK model. Thus, two volumes of distribution have to be estimated as fixed parameters: volume of central  compartment  (Vc/F)  and  volume  of  the  peripheral  compartment  (Vp/F).  Interindividual random  effects  (IIV)  on  both  were  firstly  included  using  exponential  models  with  a  diagonal variance  -covariance  matrix.  The  apparent  volumes  of  distribution  for  the  Vc/F  and  Vp/F compartments were estimated to be low (8.76L and 11.3L, respectively). IIV on Vp/F resulted to be quite high: 45%. Correlation between CL/F and Vc/F was also included in the final popPK model (0.81). Weight and low dose (&lt; 20 mg) were the most significant determinants on apparent volume of the central compartment. The effects of weight on Vp/F were fixed to the same as for Vc/F.

In vitro data showed that eltrombopag is highly bound to human plasma proteins (&gt; 99.9 %), predominantly to albumin.

## · Elimination

In a human radiolabel study (Study TRA102861), 75 mg eltrombopag were administered by single dose. Eltrombopag accounted for approximately 64% of plasma radiocarbon AUC0-t suggesting the presence of metabolites. On average, 59% of the dose was recovered in faeces, 20% as unchanged eltrombopag and 21% as three co-eluting metabolites including a glutathione, glutamyl-cysteine, and cysteine  adduct.  On  average,  31%  of  the  dose  was  recovered  in  urine,  none  as  unchanged eltrombopag,  and  20%  as  a  glucuronide  of  the  phenylpyrazole  moiety  resulting  from  hydrazine cleavage. Hydrazine cleavage products identified in human urine suggested that eltrombopag might be  metabolized  by  bacteria  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  The  remaining  unaccounted  dose  in  the excreta was comprised of multiple metabolites that could not be identified because their levels were close to or below background radioactivity (19% of dose overall, 8% in faeces and 11% in urine), and losses incurred during sample processing and analysis (10% of dose in faeces).

Plasma eltrombopag half-life in humans following a single oral administration ranged from 21 to 32 hours.  Data  from  the  mass  balance  study  show  that  the  mean  total  recovery  of  radioactivity  was 89.6%  (range  of  83.8  to  93.2%)  of  the  dose.  Faecal  elimination  was  the  predominant  route  of elimination with a mean of 58.9% (range of 40.9 to 69.8%) of the total radiocarbon dose. Urinary excretion  accounted  for  a  mean  recovery  of  30.7%  (range  of  23.4  to  45.4%)  of  the  administered dose.  Urinary  elimination  was  essentially  complete  in  the  first  48  hours  post dose  while  faecal elimination  continued  for  several  more  days.    Most  of  the  dose  was  recovered  by  144 hours  after dosing.

The in  vivo metabolism  of  eltrombopag  was  investigated  in  six  healthy  male  subjects  (CD 2006/01628/00)  following  a  single  oral  administration  of  [14C]eltrombopag  at  dose  of  75  mg. Eltrombopag  was  the  predominant  radiocomponent  in  plasma  extracts.  Minor  metabolites,  each accounting  for  approximate  10%  or  less  of  plasma  radioactivity  were  also  detected  and  were products  of  glucuronidation  or  oxidation.  Parent  eltrombopag  was  not  detected  in  urine.  The predominant radiometabolite present in the human urine (accounting for about 20% of the dose) was a glucuronide of the phenylpyrazole moiety (lower portion) of the molecule following the cleavage of  the  hydrazine  linkage.  NMR  analysis  confirmed  that  a  glucuronide  conjugate  of  the  biphenyl moiety (unlabelled top portion after cleavage) of eltrombopag was also present in urine. In faeces, unchanged  eltrombopag  and  three  co-eluting  glutathione-related  conjugates  were  the  predominant radio-components. Eltrombopag accounted for approximately 20% of the administered dose and the co-eluting  metabolites  (a  glutathione,  a  glutamyl-cysteine,  and  a  cysteine  adduct  of  eltrombopag) together accounted for approximately 21% of the dose.

Based on the metabolic profile characterized in the human mass balance study, it is estimated that approximately  21%  of  a  dose  could  be  metabolised  through  the  CYP  system  and  CYP1A2  and CYP2C8  were  identified in vitro as enzymes  responsible  for the oxidative  metabolism  of eltrombopag. UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 were identified as the enzymes responsible for glucuronidation. Eltrombopag, administered as 75 mg QD for 7 days, did not inhibit or induce the metabolism  of  probe  substrates  for  CYP  1A2,  2C9,  2C19,  and  3A4  in  healthy  male  subjects.  In addition, there has been no evidence for the formation of any human specific metabolites.

Eltrombopag  is  not  a  substrate  or  inhibitor  of  P-glycoprotein.  Eltrombopag  is  not  a  substrate  for OATP1B1, but is an inhibitor of this transporter with an IC50 value of 2.7 μ g/mL). Eltrombopag is a substrate and inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP with an IC50 value of 2.7 μ g/mL), and  has  been  shown  to  increase  plasma  concentrations  of  the  OATP1B1  and  BCRP  substrate rosuvastatin (Study TRA105120).

Elimination was well characterized in the final population PK model by assuming a 2-compartment PK model with first order absorption and first order elimination. The final covariate model included the influence of body weight on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F, and Vp/F, and influence of the disease (ITP versus healthy), race, gender, and concomitant corticosteroids on CL/F. Mean (95% CI) apparent clearance was 33% (26%, 41%) lower in Asians compared to all other races, 26% (7%, 45%) lower in patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

taking  corticosteroids  concomitantly,  and  19%  (7%,  31%)  lower  in  females  compared  to  males. Healthy subjects had 17% (0%, 34%) higher CL/F than ITP patients.

Eight polymorphisms were identified as significantly associated with PK variability using the tiered approach in Asian or White HVT subjects. None of these polymorphisms was associated with PK variability in both Asian and White HVT samples.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Following  administration  of  single  oral  doses  of  eltrombopag  as  granules  in  a  capsule,  plasma eltrombopag exposure increased more than proportionally with dose over the range of 3 mg to 9 mg; the slope (95% CI) estimate was 1.59 (1.21, 1.97) for AUC(0-t), 1.51 (1.14, 1.88) for AUC(0-∞ ), and 1.68 (1.39, 1.97) for Cmax. Plasma eltrombopag AUC and Cmax increased in a greater than dose proportional  manner  between  3mg  and  9mg  because  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  slope estimate was greater than one.

No accumulation of plasma eltrombopag AUC(0τ ) was observed after QD dosing at 5 mg and 10 mg; however, 37-56% accumulation was observed after QD dosing of 20 mg, 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg for 10 days (49115/002). Single dose plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-∞ ) and Cmax values increased with increasing dose in a slightly greater than dose proportional manner where the slope estimate (90%) CI) 1.13 (1.04, 1.22) for AUC(0-∞ ) and 1.15 (1.07, 1.24) for Cmax over a range of 5 mg to 75 mg.  Steady-state  plasma  eltrombopag  AUC(0τ )  and  Cmax  increased  with  increasing  dose  in  a slightly greater than dose proportional manner where the slope estimate (90% CI) was 1.19 (1.11, 1.26) for AUC(0τ ) and 1.20 (1.12, 1.27) for Cmax over a range of 5 mg to 75 mg QD.

No time dependent changes in plasma eltrombopag pharmacokinetics were observed across the dose levels (49115/002). After receiving a dose of 75 mg qd of eltrombopag, AUC, Cmax and half-live values at the first and the tenth day were quite similar with no statistically significant differences (72 vs.79 mg*h/L; 6 vs.7 mg/L; 16 vs.14h, respectively).

## · Special populations

## Impaired renal function

An open-label,  non-randomized  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  50  mg eltrombopag  was  performed  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment.  Plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-∞ ) was on average 32%, 36% and 60% lower in subjects with mild, moderate and  severe  renal  impairment,  respectively,  compared  with  healthy  subjects.  Moderate  to  high between-subject  variability  (CVb%)  was  observed  in  the  PK  parameters  and  variability  increased with increasing severity of renal impairment. The impact on half-life was not so evident but CL/F showed a significant increase from healthy subjects to severe renal impairment subjects.

## Impaired hepatic function

An open-label,  non-randomized  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  50  mg eltrombopag  was  performed  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  volunteers  with  mild,  moderate  or  severe hepatic  impairment.  AUC0-∞ of  eltrombopag  was  41 %  higher  in  subjects  with  mild  hepatic impairment  and  80  %  to  93 %  higher  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment compared with healthy volunteers.

## Gender

The influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (14 females) and 88 patients with ITP (57 females). Based  on  estimates  from  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  female  ITP  patients  had approximately  50 %  higher  plasma  eltrombopag  AUC(0τ )  as  compared  to  male  patients,  without adjustment for body weight differences.

## Race

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The influence of East Asian ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (31 East Asians) and 88 patients with ITP (18  East  Asians).  East  Asian  ITP  subjects  had  approximately  87%  higher  plasma  eltrombopag AUC(0τ )  values  compared  to  non-East  Asian  ITP  subjects  who  were  predominantly  Caucasian, without adjustment for body weight differences. Similar differences in plasma eltrombopag PK were observed between East Asian and non-Asian healthy subjects. Evaluation of platelet response across the  ITP  studies  suggests  that  East  Asian  ITP  subjects  were  more  likely  to  achieve  platelet  counts &gt;400  ,000/ μ L.  In  addition,  there  was  a  trend  to  a  higher  incidence  of  hepatobiliary  laboratory abnormalities in East Asian ITP subjects.

## Weight

Apparent clearance and volume were influenced by body weight. For the range of weights in the population pharmacokinetic analysis (43 kg to 122 kg), predicted typical (for ITP male Caucasian patient without corticosteroids) CL/F and Vc/F and are 0.495 to 0.941 L/h and 6.49 to 12.3 L, respectively.

## Elderly

The  studies  included  patients  over  a  wide  range  of  age.  The  median  (range)  age  across  the  199 subjects  included  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  30  (18-85)  years.  Age  did  not influence the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag.

## Children

No studies have been submitted.

Weight, gender, race (Asian vs. Non-Asian) and corticosteroid use were predictors of drug exposure in ITP patients; following the same dosing regimen lighter subjects, women, subjects of Asian origin and corticosteroid users would have greater eltrombopag exposures.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

A clinical drug  interaction study was  conducted  to  determine  the  potential impact  of  coadministering  eltrombopag  on  the  PK  of  rosuvastatin,  an  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitor  used  to reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides, and an OATP1B1 and BCRP substrate.  Eltrombopag 75 mg once daily for 5 days with a single dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg increased plasma rosuvastatin Cmax 103 % (90 % CI: 82 %, 126 %) and AUC0-∞ 55 % (90 % CI: 42 %, 69 %).

A  clinical drug  interaction study was  conducted  to  determine  the  potential impact  of  coadministering eltrombopag with a polyvalent metal cation-containing antacid.  Administration of a single  75  mg  dose  of  eltrombopag  with  an  antacid  (1524  mg  aluminium  hydroxide  and  1425  mg magnesium carbonate) decreased plasma eltrombopag AUC(0-∞ ) and Cmax by 70%.

A clinical drug interaction study was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of co-administering eltrombopag on the PK of CYP substrates. Administration of eltrombopag 75 mg once daily for 7 days  with  single  doses  of  CYP  substrates  did  not  inhibit  or  induce  CYP1A2  (caffeine),  CYP2C9 (flurbiprofen),  CYP2C19  (omeprazole),  or  CYP3A4  (midazolam)  as  evidenced  by  no  change  in probe substrate PK.

Study TPL 111716 in 40 healthy volunteers was a phase I, open-label, single sequence study was aimed  at  providing  information  on  the  potential  drug-drug  interaction  between  eltrombopag  and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV). The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the impact of LPV/RTV on plasma eltrombopag PK following administration of LPV/RTV 400/100 mg BID for 14 days with a single dose of eltrombopag 100 mg in healthy adult subjects. In addition the impact of eltrombopag on plasma LPV/RTV following administration of LPV/RTV 400/100 mg BID for 14 days with a single dose of eltrombopag 100 mg in healthy adult subjects was evaluated.

The results obtained show that this inhibitor of HIV protease accelerates the metabolism/elimination of eltrombopag, decreasing the AUC(0-∞ ) of eltrombopag approximately 17%, (90% CI 6.6%,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

26.6%). No information was provided for eltrombopag used in a dose repeating scheme, which is the one used in clinical practise.

With regard to safety, the adverse events and laboratory findings of LPV/RTV observed in the study are those already covered in the SPC of Kaletra, and were consistent with the safety profile of this medicinal product. Similarly, the adverse events observed with eltrombopag, are in line with ones recorded during the clinical program of the product.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Mechanism of action

No studies have been submitted.

- Primary and secondary pharmacology

Dose dependent increases in platelet counts were observed in three clinical studies following repeat dose administration of eltrombopag to healthy adult subjects:

Study  497115/002-  The  mean  maximum  change  from  baseline  in  platelet  counts  were  104,000 platelets/ μ L for 30 mg QD, 156,100 platelets/ μ L for 50 mg QD, and 163,000 platelets/ μ L for 75mg QD  after  a  10-day  repeat  dose  administration  in  26  healthy  male  subjects.  Platelet  function,  as measured  by  platelet  aggregation  and  activation,  was  not  affected  by  the  administration  of eltrombopag.

Study TRA105580- Platelet count increases of 10,700 platelets/ μ L for placebo, 128,500 platelets/ μ L for 25 mg QD, 195,000 platelets/ μ L for 50 mg QD and 202,200 platelets/ μ L for 75 mg QD were observed  after  a  10-day  repeat  dose  administration  in  42  healthy  Japanese  male  subjects.  Platelet counts reached peak level on Day 14 post-dose, and returned to baseline values during follow-up periods.

Study TRA102860- Platelet count increases of 14, 200 platelets/ μ L for placebo, 67,400 platelets/ μ L for 100 mg QD, 107,300 platelets/ μ L for 150 mg QD, and 149,600 platelets/ μ L for 200 mg QD were observed  after  a  5-day  repeat  dose  administration  in  33  healthy  subjects  (18  males/15  females). Platelet  counts  reached  peak  level  on  Day  14  post-dose,  and  returned  to  baseline  values  during follow-up periods.

Pharmacodynamic response was not observed following single dose administration of eltrombopag in the following studies:

Study  497115/001-Following  single  oral  administration  of  3,  6,  and  9  mg  of  eltrombopag  to  24 healthy male subjects.

Study 497115/002- Following single oral administration of  5, 10, 20, 50 and 75 mg of eltrombopag to 97 healthy male subjects.

Study TRA105580- Following single oral administration of 25, 50 and 75 mg of eltrombopag to 42 healthy male subjects.

Study TRA104603- Following single oral administration of 30, 50, 75 and 100 mg of eltrombopag to 16 healthy male Japanese subjects.

A conventional sequential PK/PD approach was used to build the population PK/PD model. The PD data were fitted alone using the individual maximum a posteriori Bayesian PK parameter estimates (obtained from the population PK model) to predict the eltrombopag concentrations. The population PK/PD model assumes that platelet precursor production is the same in healthy volunteers and ITP patients, but that platelets are degraded much faster in ITP patients (larger KP), which is consistent with an increased rate of platelet destruction in ITP disease well described in the literature. Despite the  higher  platelet  count  variability  and  fixing  KIN  and  KOUT  to  the  estimates  from  the  healthy volunteer model, the ITP patient PK/PD model predictions were consistent with the observed platelet count  versus  time  data.  The  population  PK/PD  model  was  validated  (internal  validation:  visual predictive check (VPC) and non-parametric bootstrap analysis) to confirm the internal robustness of the model.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The final model was used to simulate platelet counts for ITP patients following 10 weeks of once daily dosing of 50 mg eltrombopag. The results of the simulations indicated that steady-state platelet counts  were  achieved  by  week  3  and  that  90%  of  steady-state  was  achieved  by  week  2.  Thus, biweekly  dose  adjustments  are  a  reasonable  approach  to  titrate  each  patient.  Doubling  the eltrombopag dose from 25 to 50 mg once daily would increase median steady-state platelet count 45%, and a 50% increase in dose from 50 to 75 mg once daily would increase steady-state median platelet count 31%.

In healthy subjects, baseline platelet counts, gender and race (Asian versus non-Asian) were tested as covariates on the parameters KIN, KOUT, and SLOP, and gender was also tested on the parameter BASE. Finally, the only significant covariate-parameter relationship was gender on SLOP indicating females had a 36% lower slope compared to males. In the ITP patients population PK/PD model, gender and age were the only covariates which could be included in the model on KIN suggesting that female and older ITP patients ( ≥ 65 years) appear to be more sensitive to eltrombopag than men and younger patients.

In healthy subjects, concomitant drugs were not included in the final population PK/PD model since no significant covariate-parameter relationship was found. Concurrent and prior ITP medications of interest included: corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins  (IVIg), vincristine/vinblastine, cyclophosamide,  danazol,  rituximab, azathioprine,  cyclosporine,  dapsone  and  mycophenolate. Corticosteroids  were  the  only  concomitant  ITP  medication  group  used  by  more  than  10%  of population. The use of concurrent corticosteroids has been identified as a predictive factor of higher platelet counts following administration of eltrombopag to ITP patients, either due to higher plasma eltrombopag exposure (PK) or greater PD response.

According to submitted data, samples from more than 200 patients with 8 different sorts of solid and non-solid tumours demonstrated levels of Mpl below the levels of accurate detection by microarray or qRT-PCR. No single non-megakaryocytic cell line tested has demonstrated increased proliferation when  treated  with  eltrombopag  up  to  100 μ g/mL,  and  last  submitted  data  show  low  or  non quantifiable levels of Mpl expression in all the different tumours tested ex-vivo.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The gene encoding for TPO-R is a proto-oncogen, also known as c-Mpl, the increased expression of which  has  been  linked  to  poor  prognosis  in  myelodysplastic  syndrome  and  in  acute  myeloid leukaemia.  According  to  the  submitted  data  the  concern  on  the  potential  stimulatory  effect  of eltrombopag  on  the  proliferation  of  some  malignant  cell  lines  is  minimal,  although  it  cannot  be completely discarded. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC reflecting this risk and the Applicant will study long term effects in a post-marketing study included in the risk management plan.

Data of concentration over time and platelet counts used in the population PK/PD analysis are rich enough  and  well  distributed  across  time  to  support  the  estimation  of  the  population  PK/PD parameters with fairly good precision.

Based  on  estimates  from  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  East  Asian  (i.e.  Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) ITP patients had approximately 87 % higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0τ ) values as compared to non-East Asian patients who were predominantly Caucasian, without adjustment for body weight differences. Initiation of eltrombopag at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily may be considered for patients of East Asian ancestry (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese or Korean) and this information has been included in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC. The Applicant has committed to further investigate the ethnic differences observed in eltrombopag exposure in a post-authorisation commitment.

In  order  to  avoid  clinically  significant  reductions  in  plasma  eltrombopag  exposure,  eltrombopag should be administered at least 4 hours apart from antacids and other products containing polyvalent cations  such  as  mineral  supplements  and  dairy  products.  Administration  of  eltrombopag  with  a standard high-calorie,  high-fat  breakfast  that  included  dairy  products  reduced  plasma  eltrombopag

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AUC0-∞ by 59 % and Cmax by 65 %. This information has been included in the SPC in sections 4.2 and 4.5.

Platelet counts should be monitored when combining eltrombopag with other medicinal products for the  treatment  of  ITP  (corticosteroids,  danazol,  and/or  azathioprine,  intravenous  immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anti-D immunoglobulin) in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the recommended range (relevant information included in section 4.2 of the SPC).

Interactions of eltrombopag and rosuvastatin have been demonstrated in healthy adults. Interactions are also expected with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including pravastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin,  however,  clinically  significant  interactions  are  not  expected  between  eltrombopag  and atorvastatin or fluvastatin. Concomitant  administration of  eltrombopag  and  OATP1B1  (e.g. methotrexate)  and  BCRP  (e.g.  topotecan  and  methotrexate)  substrates  should  also  be  undertaken with caution. This information has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC.

Co-administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir may cause a decrease in the concentration of  eltrombopag.  Therefore,  caution  should  be  used  when  co-administration  of  eltrombopag  with lopinavir/ritonavir  takes  place.  Platelet  count  should  be  closely  monitored  in  order  to  ensure appropriate  medical  management  of  the  dose  of  eltrombopag  when  lopinavir/ritonavir  therapy  is initiated  or  discontinued.  This  interaction  has  been  included  in  section  4.5  of  the  SPC  for information.  In  addition  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  provide  further  information  on  the  coadministration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir as a post-authorisation commitment.

The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied after administration of eltrombopag to adult subjects  with  hepatic  impairment.  There  was  substantial  variability  and  significant  overlap  in exposures between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. Unbound eltrombopag (active) concentration for this highly protein bound medicinal product were not measured. Therefore, eltrombopag should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 7)  unless  the  expected  benefit  outweighs  the  identified  risk  of  portal  venous  thrombosis.. Information on patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment has been included in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC.

No  dose  adjustment  is  necessary  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  Patients  with  impaired  renal function should use eltrombopag with caution and close monitoring, for example by testing serum creatinine and/or performing urine analysis. This information has been included in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC.

## Clinical efficacy

The  primary  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  comes  from  3  double-blind,  placebocontrolled studies (TRA100773A, TRA100773B, and RAISE, see Table 7). TRA 100773 consisted of two independent, sequentially conducted studies: the phase II dose-finding TRA 100773A study and the phase III TRA 100773B study, both with treatment periods for up to 6 weeks. RAISE was phase III study of 6 months treatment duration.

Additional efficacy data from 2 single-arm, open-label studies (REPEAT and EXTEND, see Table 7) are ongoing. The REPEAT study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag following up to 3 intermittent treatment cycles of up to 6 weeks of eltrombopag administration. The EXTEND study  was  designed  to  determine  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  in subject who has been previously participated in an eltrombopag study.

## · Dose response study

## TRA100773A Study

The  first  part  of  study  TRA100773  (TRA100773A)  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  placebocontrolled, parallel group study  comparing 30, 50 and 75 mg and placebo as oral tablets once-daily for 6 weeks to adult male and female subjects with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. This phase II/III investigated the efficacy of eltrombopag as short-term therapy (six weeks) for patients with chronic ITP. The study was expected to determine an optimal dose (part A), whose efficacy and safety in the short-term treatment of patients with ITP were to be established in part B.

Dose levels to be tested were chosen based upon the results obtained in previous PD and PK studies. Dose dependent increases in platelet counts, of at least 1.3-fold above baseline, were observed in healthy male subjects who received 20, 30, 50 and 75mg once-daily for 10 days. In addition, there was an acceptable safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of up to 75mg eltrombopag once-daily for 10 days in healthy male subjects.

Patients with chronic ITP that had failed at least one previous therapy were included. As an inclusion criterion,  a  baseline  platelet  count  below  30,000/ μ L  was  required.  Both  splenectomised  and  nonsplenectomised patients were allowed to enter the study.

Stratification was done by use of ITP medication at randomization, splenectomy status and baseline platelet count ≤ 15,000/ μ L. The treatment phase included a daily dose of randomised medication for up  to  6  weeks.  Subjects  who  achieved  a  platelet  count  &gt;200,000/ μ L  discontinued  treatment  with study medication.  Platelet counts were scheduled every week during the on-therapy period, and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks post therapy.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of responders at day 43 (week 6 visit). Responders were defined  as  subjects  whose  platelet  count  reached ≥ 50,000/ μ L at  the  day  43  visit  from  a  baseline count of &lt;30,000/ μ L. Patients were also classified as responders if they achieved a platelet count of &gt;200,000/ μ L prior to day 43. The final on-treatment value was carried forward for such patients for Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analyses.  Patients were classified as non-responders if they discontinued study medication  prior  to  the  day  43  visit  for  any  other  reason,  irrespective  of  their  last  on  treatment platelet  count.  The  baseline  score  was  carried  forward  for  these  patients  in  ITT  analyses.  The proportion  of  responders  was  compared  between  treatments  using  a  logistic  regression  model adjusted by the stratification factors used in the randomisation.

The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  efficacy  population  (subjects  randomized  and  treated with  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  and  with  a  baseline  platelet  count  of  &lt;30,000/ μ L).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional supportive analyses were performed using the ITT Population (all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one platelet count post-dosing) and the Per-Protocol (PP) Population, which excluded major protocol violators.

Two interim analyses were scheduled. The first analysis was to be done when on-therapy platelet count  data  were  available  for  approximately  one-third  (~90)  of  subjects  and  the  second  interim analysis when data were available from two-thirds (~180) of the subjects. At each interim analysis, a dose could be stopped for either efficacy using a step-down procedure or for futility using a step-up procedure  or  for  safety  concerns.  The  critical  value  for  stopping  the  study  early  for  efficacy  was p ≤ 0.0113  (1-sided)  for  the  first  interim  and  would  have  been  p ≤ 0.0112  (1-sided)  for  the  second interim.  The  final  analysis  was  to  be  conducted  using  p ≤ 0.0147  as  the  critical  value.  In  order  to protect the overall Type I error at 2.5% (1-sided), a closed testing procedure was applied.

Patients' baseline characteristics were properly balanced between groups (considering the relatively small sample size).

The study was stopped at the first interim analysis. The primary efficacy endpoint showed that there was a dose-dependent effect as assessed by the rate of responders (27.6%, 70.4% and 80.8% in the groups of treatment 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg respectively) being the results of the  2 higher doses statistically significantly different from placebo (p&lt;0.001) (see results in Table 8 and Figure 1).

The logistic regression analysis (primary analysis defined in the protocol) showed a consistent effect regardless the population considered. An interaction between treatment and background therapy and baseline platelet count was found, especially for the 50 mg dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  a  post-hoc  analysis  the  durability  of  the  response  was  assessed.  The  number  of  patients  who showed a sustained response during &gt;4 weeks was 10%, 27% and 18 % in the groups of treatment 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg respectively. Due to the small sample size and the nature of the analysis these results should be interpreted with caution.

In  conclusion,  study  TRA100773A  showed  a  dose  dependent  increase  in  the  number  of  patients whose  platelet  counts  increased  form  a  pre-dosing  level  of  &lt;30,000/ μ L  to  &gt;50,000/ μ L/  (primary endpoint)  over  the  six  weeks  duration  of  the  study.  This  effect  was  supported  by  the  analysis  of secondary  endpoints  (mean  platelet  count,  bleeding  events).  On  the  basis  of  these  results  the Applicant selected 50 mg/d as the starting dose for phase III studies.

evidence for chronic hepatitis B infection, or any evidence for active hepatitis at the time of subject screening.

12. previous participation in a clinical study with eltrombopag.

## Treatments

The doses for this study were eltrombopag 50mg or matching placebo once daily for up to 6 weeks. Subjects  with  platelet  counts  &lt;50,000/ μ L  on  Day ≥ 22  may  have  had  their  dose  increased  to eltrombopag 75mg (or matching placebo). Subjects reaching a platelet count above 200,000/ μ L were withdrawn from the study medication, but continued to attend follow-up visits.

Subjects were permitted to use stable, maintenance ITP medications (corticosteroids, azathioprine, danazol, cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil) during the treatment period of the trial. Dose and duration of treatment were recorded during the on-therapy and follow-up periods. If the dose of concomitant maintenance ITP medication was modified, the subject was to be withdrawn from study medication.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of eltrombopag as a thrombopoietic agent,  when  administered  once  daily  for  up  to  6  weeks  to  previously  treated  adult  subjects  with chronic ITP.

Secondary objectives of the study were:

·  To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  eltrombopag  when  administered  once  daily  for  up  to  6 weeks to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP;

-  To  characterize  the  population  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  oral  eltrombopag  using  a  serial pharmacokinetic sampling strategy when administered once daily for up to 6 weeks to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP;

· To assess the impact of eltrombopag on the incidence and severity of symptoms of thrombocytopenia  when  administered  once  daily  for  up  to  6  weeks  to  previously  treated  adult subjects with chronic ITP; and

· To assess the impact of eltrombopag on the health-related quality of life when administered once daily for up to 6 weeks to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  a  shift  from  a  baseline  platelet  count  of  &lt;30,000/ μ L  to ≥ 50,000/ μ L  after  up  to  42  days  of  dosing  with  study  medication.  The  primary  analysis  of  this endpoint was performed on a dataset which classified subjects as either responders or non-responders (primary dataset).

Criteria to determine response in the primary dataset:

- Subjects were classified as responders if they achieved a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/ μ L at the Day 43 Visit;
- Subjects were also classified as responders if they responded strongly with a platelet count &gt;200,000/ μ L  and  discontinued  study  medication  prior  to  Day  43;  their  last  on  treatment platelet count was used to determine response; and
- Subjects  were  classified  as  non-responders  if  they  discontinued  treatment  with  study medication  prior  to  the  Day  43  Visit  for  any  other  reason,  irrespective  of  their  last  on treatment platelet count.

Other secondary endpoints include:

- Platelet counts;
- Proportion of subjects responding to treatment during Weeks 2 to 6 of the study
- Proportion of subjects with platelet counts ≥ 50,000/ μ L and at least twice their baseline
- Incidence and severity of symptoms associated with chronic ITP, including bleeding, bruising, and petechiae, were measured using the WHO Bleeding Scale and the ITP Bleeding Score; and
-  Physical  and  mental  health  status  using  the  Short  Form-36,  version  2  (SF-36v2)  health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) tool and Patient Preference Assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The  sample  size  was  calculated  to  compare  the  differences  between  eltrombopag  50mg  versus placebo in  the  proportion  of  responders  42  days  after  initiation  of  dosing  (Day  43  measurement). Assuming 25% and 60% responses on placebo and eltrombopag 50mg, respectively, 87 evaluable subjects (58 on eltrombopag, 29 on placebo) were needed in order to provide 90% power at the 5% level  of  significance  (two-sided).  However,  in  order  to  provide  additional  safety  data,  66  subjects were to be recruited to the eltrombopag treatment group and 33 subjects to the placebo treatment group.

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomized to treatment (eltrombopag 50mg or placebo) in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified based upon use or non-use of ITP medications at randomization, splenectomy status (refractory following splenectomy or non-splenectomised) and baseline platelet count ( ≤ 15,000/ μ L or &gt;15,000/ μ L).

## Blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind study and treatment allocation was blinded to the subjects, the site staff and sponsor personnel. Treatment blinding was maintained by use of matching placebo tablets.

## Statistical methods

All programming was performed using SAS version 8, or a later release, in a UNIX environment. All confidence  intervals were  calculated at  the  95%  confidence  levels.  Any  analyses  requiring significance  testing  were  performed  using  a  two-sided  test  at  the  0.05  significance  level,  unless otherwise specified.

The proportion of responders was compared between treatments using a logistic regression model adjusted for ITP medication use at randomization, splenectomy status and baseline platelet count.

Summary statistics for the primary endpoint were presented for each stratum. Similar summaries for other  subgroups,  such  as  gender,  race  and  age,  were  also  provided.  The  level  of  significance  for interactions was set to 10%. If a significant treatment by strata interaction was seen in the primary endpoint, then the primary efficacy analysis table was produced for each level of the strata. Inference was only made for the primary and secondary endpoints above should the interaction be statistically significant and considered to be clinically relevant.

There were no requirements for multiplicity adjustments in this study. The overall type I error rate is 0.05 (two-sided).

## Recruitment

The study was conducted between 6 Feb 2006 - 31 Jan 2007. After the dosing period subjects were assessed at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks to assess the durability of the platelet response and safety parameters. Subjects were also to complete an ocular examination 6 weeks and 6 months following the final dose of study medication.

## Conduct of the study

There  were  4  amendments  to  the  protocol  in  study  TRA100773,  however  only  Amendment  4 pertained to Study TRA100773B. This amendment, dated 28 November 2005, addressed changes on  dose  selection  and  revised  sample  size  based  on  the  evaluation  of  interim  data  that  led  to termination  of  study  TRA100773A  (because  of  overwhelming  efficacy).  In  addition  it  added:  a secondary endpoint of 'elevation of platelets to ≥ 50,000/ μ L and at least twice their baseline value', an  additional  logistic  regression  analysis  of  responders  using  a  Generalized  Estimating  Equations (GEE) methodology, a follow-up visit at Day 50 and the ITP Bleeding Scale and Patient Preference assessments (as secondary efficacy endpoints).

Six  subjects  had  one  or  more  major  protocol  violations  resulting  in  full  data  exclusion.  These subjects (placebo: 1 subject; eltrombopag: 5 subjects) were excluded from the PP Population. Two subjects  in  the  eltrombopag  treatment  group  were  excluded  due  to  evidence  that  the  subject's underlying condition was not ITP and that the platelet count was ≥ 30,000/ μ L at Day 1 or within 24h prior to dosing on Day 1.

Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  in  the  placebo  and  eltrombopag  groups  (50%  and  47%, respectively) were receiving ITP medication at randomization. Similar percentages of subjects (34% and 37%, respectively) had a prior splenectomy and baseline platelet counts of ≤ 15 ,000/ μ L (48% and 50%, respectively).

All subjects in both treatment groups had ≥ 1 prior ITP therapy as determined by clinical review (see Table  10).  Approximately  50%  of  subjects  had  received  at  least  3  prior  treatments.  A  higher percentage of subjects in the eltrombopag treatment arm had ≥ 3 and ≥ 4 prior therapies compared to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo.  Prior  ITP  medications  used  by  subjects  were  similar  across  the  2  treatment  groups. Corticosteroids were the most commonly reported prior ITP medication taken by approximately 75% of subjects in both treatment groups.

## Numbers analysed

A total of 114 subjects were enrolled in the study, with 76 randomized to the eltrombopag treatment group, and 38 randomized to placebo.

The  Efficacy  Population  was  the  primary  population  for  efficacy  analyses.  Additional  supportive analyses  were  performed  using  the  ITT  and  the  PP  Populations,  which  excluded  major  protocol violators. All safety analyses were reported using the Safety Population. The numbers of subjects in each population are presented in Table 11.

Data Source:Table 6.1

a. Subjects may have been excluded from a population for more than 1 reason.

b. Reasons for exclusion from the Efficacy Population included: Both subjects in the Eltrombopag treatment group excluded from the Eficacy Population had platelet counts ≥30Gi/L on Day 1 or within 24 h prior to dosing on Day

Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint: Responders at day 43 visit.

The analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  showed  that  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  platelet  counts ≥ 50,000/ μ L after up to 6 weeks of dosing was greater in the eltrombopag treated group compared to placebo. A total of 59% of subjects on eltrombopag attained a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/ μ L on Day 43, compared to 16% of subjects on placebo (Efficacy Population). The odds ratio for active/placebo treatment  was  9.61  (95%  CI  3.31-27.86)  showing  a  statistically  significant  p-value  (two-sided) &lt;0.001.

At each visit, the percentage of responders was greater in the eltrombopag treatment group compared to  the  placebo  treatment  group  (see  Figure  2).  Other  thresholds  included:  Platelets  &gt;200,000/ μ L, placebo 1/37 (3%) vs. eltrombopag 18/73 (25%); and Platelets &gt;400,000/ μ L, placebo 0/371 (0%) vs. eltrombopag 2/73 (3%).

This  effect  of  eltrombopag  relative  to  placebo  was  significant  across  all  subgroups  regardless  of baseline  platelet  count,  use  of  concomitant  ITP  medication  or  splenectomy  status  (see  Table  12). This difference was observed in all study visits.

## - Bleeding

Consistently  with  the  increase  in  platelet  count,  an  effect  on  bleeding  rates  was  observed.  A statistically  significant  decrease  in  any  bleeding  (WHO  grades  1  to  4)  at  day  43  was  observed  in secondary analyses in subjects treated eltrombopag compared to placebo (OR=0.27, p=0.029) (see Table 14).

Table 14: Results WHO bleeding scale

|             | Placebo     | 50mg        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Baseline    |             |             |
| No bleeding | 12/35 (34%) | 27/70 (39%) |
| Bleeding    | 23/35 (66%) | 43/70 (61%) |
| Day 43      |             |             |
| No bleeding | 12/30 (40%) | 31/51 (61%) |
| Bleeding    | 18/30 (60%) | 20/51 (39%) |

Secondary analyses based on updated results showed similar trend with 25/38 (66%) bleedings in placebo  treated  subjects  compared  to  30/76  (39%)  in  eltrombopag  treated  subjects  (ITT population,  WHO  bleedings  grade  1-4  at  Day  43).  The  odds  of  bleeding  were  observed  to remain significantly lower (p=0.010) in the eltrombopag treated group with an Odds Ratio (95% CI) of 0.30 (0.12, 0.75). Moreover, 11/38 (29%) of placebo treated subjects compared to 12/76 (16%) of the eltrombopag treated subjects had a WHO bleeding grade 2-4 at Day 43. The odds of bleeding was lower in the eltrombopag treated group with an Odds Ratio (95% CI) of 0.46 (0.18, 1.19) and p=0.111

In  the  group  of  patients  treated  with  75  mg  a  similar  percentage  of  subjects  with  WHO  bleeding scales grades 1 to 4 in placebo (86%) and eltrombopag (83%) group were observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  eltrombopag arm, baseline WHO bleeding scale score grades 0 (43.7%), grades 1 (35.2%), grades  2  (16.9%)  and  grades  3  (4.2%)  changed  to  grades  0  (60.8%),  grades  1  (29.4%)  grades  2 (9.8%)  in week 6 on treatment, showing that changes mostly affected the lowest grades (0 through 1) and largely by a transition from \"petechaie\" (grade1) to the absence of petechaie (grade 0).

## -Odds of Responding to Treatment during Weeks 2-6

At any point during the 6 week treatment period, subjects in the eltrombopag treatment group had a greater odd of responding than subjects in the placebo treatment group (OR=8.79; CI=3.54, 21.86; p&lt;0.001)

## -Response in Platelet Count to 50,000/ μ L or More and at Least 2x Baseline

Logistic regression analysis of the percentage of subjects with a Day 43 platelet count ≥ 50,000/ μ L and at least 2x baseline using the primary dataset for the Efficacy Population showed a statistically significant treatment effect of eltrombopag compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001).

## Study TRA102537 (RAISE)

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eltrombopag olamine, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, administered for 6 months as oral tablets once daily in adult subjects with previously treated chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Study sites  were  located  in  a  total  of  23  countries  from  the  following  continents/countries:  North America (16 Sites), South America (2 Sites), Europe (44 Sites), Africa (1 Site), Asia (8 Sites), and New Zealand (4 Sites).

## Inclusion criteria

A subject was eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria applied:

1. Subject signed and dated a written informed consent.

2.  Adults  ( ≥ 18  years)  diagnosed  with  chronic  ITP  according  to  the  ASH/BCSH  guidelines,  and platelet  count  &lt;30,000/ μ L on Day 1 (or within 24 hours prior to dosing on Day 1). In addition, a peripheral  blood  smear  should  support  the  diagnosis  of  ITP  with  no  evidence  of  other  causes  of thrombocytopenia (e.g. pseudothrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis). The physical examination should not suggest any disease which may cause thrombocytopenia other than ITP.
3.  Subjects  who previously received one or more prior ITP therapies. Previous treatments for ITP included but were not limited to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, azathioprine, danazol, cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab.

4. Subjects must have had either initially responded (platelet count &gt;100,000/ μ L) to a previous ITP therapy  or  have  had  a  bone  marrow  examination  consistent  with  ITP  within  3  years  to  rule  out myelodysplastic syndromes or other causes of thrombocytopenia.

5. Previous therapy for ITP with immunoglobulins (IVIg and anti-D) must have been completed at least 1 week prior to randomization and the platelet count must show a clear downward trend after the  last  treatment  with  immunoglobulins.  Previous  treatment  for  ITP  with  splenectomy,  rituximab and cyclophosphamide must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization, or clearly be ineffective.

6. Subjects treated with concomitant ITP medication (e.g. corticosteroids or azathioprine) must have been receiving a dose that was stable for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects treated with cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil or danazol must have been receiving a dose that was stable for at least 3 months prior to randomization. The medication should have been continued with a stable dose for the initial 6 weeks of study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

7.  Prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT)  must  have  been  within  80  to  120%  of  the  normal  range  with  no  history  of hypercoagulable state.
8. A complete blood count (CBC), within the reference range (including white blood count (WBC) differential not indicative of a disorder other than ITP), with the following exceptions:
- &lt;30,000/ μ L on Day 1 (or within 24 hours of Day 1) was required for inclusion,

·  Hemoglobin: Subjects with hemoglobin levels between 10 g/dL (100 g/L) and the lower limit of normal were eligible for inclusion, if anaemia was clearly attributable to ITP (excessive blood loss).

·  Absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC) ≥ 1500/ μ L  (1.5  x  109/L)  was  required  for  inclusion  (elevated WBC/ANC due to corticosteroid treatment is acceptable).

9.  The  following  clinical  chemistries  must  not  have  exceeded  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN) reference range by more than 20%: creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. In addition, total albumin must not have been below the lower limit of normal (LLN) by more than 10%.

10.  Subject  was  practicing  an  acceptable  method  of  contraception  (documented  in  chart).  Female subjects (or female partners of male subjects) must have either been of non childbearing potential (hysterectomy,  bilateral  oopherectomy,  bilateral  tubal  ligation  or  post-menopausal  &gt;1  year),  or  of childbearing potential and using one of the following highly effective methods of contraception (i.e., Pearl  Index  &lt;1.0%)  from  two  weeks  prior  to  administration  of  study  medication,  throughout  the study, and 28 days after completion or premature discontinuation from the study:

- Complete abstinence from intercourse;
- Intrauterine device;
-  Two  forms  of  barrier  contraception  (diaphragm  plus  spermicide,  and  for  males  condom  plus spermicide);
- Male partner was sterile prior to entry into the study and is the only partner of the female;
- Systemic contraceptives (combined or progesterone only).

11.  Subject  was  able  to  understand  and  comply  with  protocol  requirements  and  instructions  and intended to complete the study as planned.

## Exclusion criteria

A subject was not eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria applied:

1.  Any clinically  relevant  abnormality,  other  than  ITP,  identified  on  the  screening  examination  or any  other  medical  condition  or  circumstance,  which  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  made  the subject  unsuitable  for  participation  in  the  study  or  suggested  another  primary  diagnosis  (e.g., thrombocytopenia secondary to another disease).

2.  Concurrent  malignant  disease  and/or  history  of  cancer  treatment  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

3. Any prior history of arterial or venous thrombosis (stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), AND ≥ 2  of  the  following risk factors: hormone  replacement  therapy,  systemic  contraception  (containing  estrogen),  smoking,  diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, medication for hypertension, cancer, hereditary thrombophilic disorders (e.g., Factor V Leiden, antithrombin III deficiency, etc), or any other family history of arterial or venous thrombosis.

5.  Female  subjects  who  were  nursing  or  pregnant  (positive  serum  or  urine β -human  chorionic gonadotrophin pregnancy test) at screening or pre-dose on Day 1.
6. History of alcohol/drug abuse.
7. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever was longer) preceding the first dose of study medication.
8.  Subject  treated  with  drugs  that  affect  platelet  function  (including  but  not  limited  to  aspirin, clopidogrel and/or NSAIDs) or anti-coagulants for &gt; 3 consecutive days within 2 weeks of the study start and until the end of the study.

infection,  hepatitis  C  virus  infection,  or  any  evidence  for  active  hepatitis  at  the  time  of  subject screening. If a potential subject had no clinical history that would support HIV infection or hepatitis infection, no further laboratory screening was necessary; however, standard medical practice would suggest further evaluation of subjects who had risk factors for these infections.

11. Previous participation in a clinical study with eltrombopag.
12. Subjects planning to have cataract surgery.
13. In France, a subject was neither affiliated with nor a beneficiary of a social security category.

## Treatments

The starting dose was either eltrombopag 50 mg or matching placebo once daily. Throughout the six month treatment period, the dose of the study medication could be up- (75 mg/d) or down- (25 mg/d titrated according to platelet count monitoring). Subjects were allowed a dose increase on or after day 22  if  a  subject's  platelet  count  did  not  rise  above  50,000/ μ L  for  two  successive  platelet  count assessments. The subjects were to reduce their dose of eltrombopag when platelet count exceeded of 200,000 / μ L. When platelet counts reached 400,000/ μ L study medication was interrupted for at least 7 days, until platelet counts fell below 150,000/ μ L. At that point subjects were re-administrated at next lower dose.

## Objectives

## Primary objective

To determine the efficacy of eltrombopag as a thrombopoietic agent, when administered once daily for 6 months (RAISE) to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP.

## Secondary objectives

Secondary objectives of the study were:

· To assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered once daily for 6 months to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP;

· To assess the impact of eltrombopag on the incidence and severity of symptoms of thrombocytopenia when administered once daily for  6 months to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP;

· To assess the impact of eltrombopag on the health-related quality of life when administered once daily for  6 months to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP;

- To assess the ability of eltrombopag to prevent the use of rescue treatment (rescue treatment was defined as a composite of: new ITP medication, increased dose of concomitant ITP medication from baseline, platelet transfusion and splenectomy);
-  To  describe  the  pharmacodynamics  and  durability  of  eltrombopag  response  (maintenance  of  an elevated blood platelet count);
- To determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag, when administered once daily, for 6 weeks duration, to previously treated adult subjects with chronic ITP;
- To describe the effect of eltrombopag on reduction of concomitant ITP medications from baseline.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  endpoint  was  the  odds  of  achieving  a  platelet  count ≥ 50,000/ μ L  and ≤ 400,000/ μ L during the 6-month treatment period, for subjects receiving eltrombopag relative to placebo.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included:

- Proportion of subjects receiving a rescue treatment (rescue treatment was defined as a composite of:  new  ITP  medication,  increased  dose  of  a  concomitant  ITP  medication  from  baseline,  platelet transfusion, and/or splenectomy) during the 6 month duration of the study.
-  Proportion  of  subjects  for  whom  at  least  75%  of  their  assessments  were ≥ 50,000/ μ L  and ≤ 400,000/ μ L.
- Maximum duration of response ( ≥ 50,000/ μ L and ≤ 400,000/ μ L) for each subject.
- Proportion of subjects achieving a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/ μ L and ≤ 400,000/ μ L during weeks 2-6 of study treatment.
- Proportion of subjects with a reduction in use of concomitant ITP medications from baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Incidence and severity of symptoms associated with chronic ITP, including bleeding, bruising, and petechiae, were measured using the WHO Bleeding Scale and the ITP Bleeding Score; and

·  Physical  and  mental  health  status  using  the  Short  Form-36,  version  2  (SF-36v2)  health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) tool and Patient Preference Assessment.

## Sample size

The primary analysis was to compare the odds of achieving a platelet count ≥ 50 and ≤ 400,000/ μ L during the treatment period in the eltrombopag group relative to the placebo group. Assuming 60% and 25% positive response rates in the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively, 120 evaluable subjects were needed to provide ≥ 90% power at the 1% (two-sided) level of significance. To ensure sufficient power for both the primary and main secondary endpoints, a 30% increase in subjects was pre-specified to compensate for potential missing data and drop-outs during the full 6 month study duration, for a total of 189 subjects (63 placebo subjects; 126 eltrombopag subjects).

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomized 2:1, eltrombopag to placebo, and were stratified based upon splenectomy status, baseline use or non-use of ITP medication and baseline platelet count ≤ 15,000/ μ L or greater than 15,000/ μ L.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was double-blinded. Treatments were blinded to the research subjects and all study and sponsor personnel. Treatment blind was maintained by use of matching placebo medication.

## Statistical methods

The  subject  response  profiles  during  the  6-month  treatment  period  were  compared  between treatments  using  a  repeated  measures  model  for  binary  data  adjusted  for  the  randomization stratification variables. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) methodology was used to estimate the  regression  model  parameters  with  the  correlation  of  an  individual  subject's  responder  status between  visits  being  modelled  as  exchangeable  (i.e.  assuming  the  correlation  between  any  2 measures for a subject is the same).

All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 8 or a later release, in a  UNIX  environment.  Significance  testing  was  two-sided  at  the  1%  level  of  significance  for  the primary endpoint, and unless stated otherwise, significance testing was two-sided at the 5% level of significance  for  all  other  comparisons.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  95%  confidence  intervals  (CI) around the odds ratios or treatment differences, as appropriate were presented.

There were no requirements for multiplicity adjustments in this study. The overall Type I error rate was 0.01 (two-sided) for the primary efficacy analysis and, unless otherwise indicated, 0.05 (twosided) for all secondary and exploratory analyses.

## Populations for main analysis:

Intent-to-Treat  Population: The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  was  the  primary  population  for analysis and was comprised of all randomized subjects.

Per-Protocol Population: The per-protocol (PP) population was defined as per the Intent-to-Treat population but excluded major protocol violators. Additional analysis based on this population was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint and the main secondary endpoints only.

Safety  Population: The  safety  population  was  comprised  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  had received at least one dose of the study treatment. All safety parameters were reported using the safety population, all subjects being analyzed under the treatment group to which they were randomized.

Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  in  the  placebo  and  eltrombopag  groups  (50%  and  47%, respectively) were receiving ITP medication at randomization. Similar percentages of subjects (34% and 37%, respectively) had a prior splenectomy and baseline platelet counts of ≤ 15,000/ μ L (48% and 50%,  respectively).  All  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had ≥ 1  prior  ITP  therapy  (including splenectomy) as determined by clinical review (see Table 16). Eighty-one percent of placebo-treated subjects and 78% of eltrombopag-treated subjects received at least 2 prior therapies, and more than 30% of subjects in each group received ≥ 4 prior therapies.

Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Endpoint

The  effect  of  eltrombopag  on  platelet  is  shown  in  Table  18.  The  odds  of  responding  over  the  6 months  treatment  period  were  greater  and  significantly  different  between  eltrombopag-treated subjects  and  placebo-treated  subjects  (p&lt;0.001).  Fifty-four  percent  of  the  eltrombopag-treated patients  and  13 %  of  placebo-treated  patients  achieved  this  level  of  response  after  6  weeks  of treatment. A similar platelet response was maintained throughout the study, with 52 % and 16 % of patients  responding  at  the  end  of  the  6-month  treatment  period.  This  response  was  observed regardless of splenectomy status, baseline platelet count and use of baseline ITP medications.

Table 18. Analysis of Responders-Primary  Dataset Generalized Estimating Equations (ITT Population)

| p-value (two-sided vs. PBO)                  | <0.001b      |

A sensitivity analysis using the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was consistent with these results.

The table below (Table 19) presents the number and percentage of evaluable subjects who achieved a platelet response between 50-400,000/ μ L at each nominal on-therapy visit.

## Secondary endpoints

## Platelet count

The median platelet counts for eltrombopag treated subjects began to rise after 1 week of treatment and  remained  above  50,000/ μ L  throughout  the  6  month  treatment  period.  Two  weeks  after discontinuation of eltrombopag median platelet counts returned to near baseline levels (see Figure 4).

Figure 4: Median Platelet Counts (25th and 75th percentiles) By Baseline Platelet Count - Baseline to 4-week Follow-up (ITT Population)

<!-- image -->

The percentage of subjects treated with eltrombopag by dose at each nominal visit was studied. All subjects  initiated  treatment  with  eltrombopag  50  mg.  Beginning  as  early  as  Day  8,  a  subset  of subjects  who  were  sensitive  to  treatment  (achieved  platelet  counts  above  200,000/ μ L)  with eltrombopag  50  mg  were  down-titrated  to  25  mg  or  less;  approximately  20%  of  subjects  were maintained on ≤ 25 mg throughout the study. The majority of eltrombopag treated subjects received 50 mg from Day 8 through Day 15 (99% and 93% respectively). After the Day 22 visit, subjects who did not achieve platelet counts above 50,000/ μ L on 50 mg were able to be uptitrated to eltrombopag 75  mg.  From  Day  29  to  the  end  of  treatment,  29  to  53%  of  eltrombopag  treated  subjects  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receiving  75  mg.  Response  to  eltrombopag  75  mg  was  observed  after  1  week  in  over  15%  of subjects and in between 30-46% of subjects throughout the remainder of the 6 month study.

## Duration of response

Duration of response was assessed using data from all visits for both the continuous and cumulative number  of  weeks  of  response.  Summary  statistics  of  both  the  maximum  weeks  of  continuous response  (platelet  counts  between  50  and  400,000/ μ L)  and  the  cumulative  weeks  of  response  are provided in Table 20:

## Reduction in Use of Baseline ITP Medication

At  baseline,  31  placebo  subjects  (50%)  and  63  eltrombopag  subjects  (47%)  reported  use  of  ITP medications, of which 10 (32%) and 37 (59%) subjects, respectively, reduced or discontinued at least one  concomitant  ITP  medication  (see  Table  21).  This  difference  was  statistically  significant (p=0.016).

## Rescue treatment

Rescue  treatment  was  defined  as  a  composite  of:  new  ITP  medication,  increased  dose  of  a concomitant ITP medication, platelet transfusion, and/or splenectomy. During the on-therapy period, 25/62  subjects  (40%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  24/135  subjects  (18%)  in  the  eltrombopag  group required the use of protocol-defined rescue treatment.

An analysis of the proportion of subjects initiating rescue treatment showed the odds of initiating a rescue  treatment  were  67%  lower  in  the  eltrombopag  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group (p=0.001).

## Bleedings

Secondary  analyses  showed  that  the  observed  baseline  percentage  of  subjects  with  any  bleeding (Grades 1-4) and clinically significant bleeding (Grades 2-4) was reduced by approximately 50 % from Day 15 to the end of treatment throughout the 6 month treatment period. Bleedings (Grades 14)  were  reported  in  79%  of  the  patients  receiving  eltrombopag  versus  93%  receiving  placebo. Bleedings  (Grades  2-4)  were  reported  in  33%  of  the  patients  receiving  eltrombopag  versus  53% receiving  placebo.  At  each  time  point  in  both  treatment  groups,  more  than  half  of  the  bleeding observed  was  Grade  1  bleeding.  Throughout  the  treatment  period,  clinically  significant  bleeding occurred infrequently, generally in &lt;25% of subjects in the placebo group and in &lt;15% of subjects in the eltrombopag group. At baseline, more than 70 % of patients in each treatment group reported any bleeding  (WHO Grades 1-4)  and  more    than  20 %  reported  clinically  significant  bleeding  (WHO Grades 2-4), respectively.

Fourteen  eltrombopag-treated  subjects  (10%)  and  4  placebo-treated  subjects  (7%)  experienced  at least  one  haemostatic  challenge  during  the  study.  In  the  placebo  group,  2  of  the  subjects  (50%) required  rescue  therapy  despite  the  relatively  mild  nature  of  the  haemostatic  challenges  (tooth extraction and dental preventative procedure). No bleeding events were reported in conjunction with the haemostatic challenges. In the eltrombopag group, 4 of the 14 subjects (29%) received rescue therapy. Of the 4 subjects, 3 had not consistently responded to eltrombopag treatment (Subjects 406, 407, and 589) and had platelet counts below 40,000/ μ L at the time of the haemostatic challenge.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No studies have been submitted.

- Clinical studies in special populations

There were numerically more responders at each nominal visit amongst females compared to males in both treatment groups; however, there was no significant difference in response to eltrombopag relative to placebo between males and females (p=0.225).

At all on therapy visits, except the Week 26 Visit, there was a higher percentage of Asian subjects who responded to eltrombopag compared to other racial groups.

Subjects were prospectively categorized in the following age groups: 18-49 years, 50-64 years, 65-74 years, and ≥ 75 years. However, due to the small number of subjects in the ≥ 75 year age group (2 placebo  and  11  eltrombopag,  the  following  categories  were  defined  post-hoc  to  assess  any differences in the response to eltrombopag relative to placebo across age categories: 18-49 years, 5064  years,  and ≥ 65  years).  This  analysis  indicated  no  evidence  of  a  difference  in  response  to eltrombopag relative to placebo between the age categories (p=0.342).

REPEAT  (R epeated E x P osure  to E ltrombopag  in A dults  with  Idiopathic T hrombocytopenic Purpura)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This is an open-label repeat dosing study of eltrombopag in adult subjects, with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This multi-centre, open-label, single-group, repeat-dose, Phase II study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  eltrombopag,  initially administered as 50 mg oral tablets once daily, over 3 cycles of repeated, intermittent dosing. Other objectives were:

- To assess the number of subjects requiring rescue treatments over 3 cycles of therapy.
- To assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered over 3 cycles of therapy.
- To assess anti-platelet antibody levels during the 3 cycles of eltrombopag treatment.
-  To  assess  the  impact  of  eltrombopag  on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  bleeding  symptoms  as measured by the World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale and ITP Bleeding Score over 3 cycles of therapy.

A cycle  was  defined  as  an  eltrombopag  on-therapy  period  of  up  to  6  weeks  followed  by  an  offtherapy period of up to 4 weeks. The duration of both the on-therapy and the off-therapy period was defined by the subject's platelet count. Subjects interrupted treatment for the cycle if they achieved a platelet count &gt;200,000/ μ L, or when they reached Week 6. Subjects began the next cycle when their platelet counts fell below 20,000/ μ L, or when they reached Week 4 of the off-therapy period and had platelet counts &lt;50,000/ μ L. Subjects who did not respond in Cycle 1 (response defined as a platelet count ≥ 50,000/ μ L and at least 2x baseline at Day 43 or at treatment discontinuation due to platelet counts &gt;200,000/ μ L) were not eligible to continue into Cycle 2 or 3. If a subject's platelet count did not fall below 50,000/ μ L by Week 4 of therapy period, the subject did not begin the next cycle of treatment, but a medical monitor was contacted to discuss the subject's case and continuation in the study.

As  off-therapy  periods  were  necessary  to  examine  eltrombopag  re-treatment,  it  was  important  to minimize the bleeding risk patients might be exposed to by participation in the study. Therefore, in contrast  to  other  eltrombopag  studies,  a  higher  baseline  platelet  count  (between ≥ 20,000/ μ L  and ≤ 50,000/ μ L) was required for entry into this trial and eltrombopag re-treatment began after 4 weeks off-therapy in the previous dosing cycle, or when subject's platelet counts fell below 20,000/ μ L.

The study dosage regimen was similar to the Phase III Study TRA100773B. Subjects whose platelet count was below 50,000/ μ L for 2 successive weeks could have their eltrombopag dose increased to 75 mg on or after Day 22 of the on-therapy period of each cycle. Subjects who had a dose adjustment began the next cycle at the same dose of eltrombopag they were receiving upon completion of the previous cycle.

A total of 66 subjects entered the study. Sixty-six subjects entered Cycle 1, 55 subjects entered Cycle 2  and  51  subjects  entered  Cycle  3.  Eleven  subjects  did  not  enter  Cycle  2  because  8  were  nonresponders  in  Cycle  1,  1  subject  had  a  prolonged  response,  1  subject  relocated,  and  1  subject withdrew due to an AE. Four additional subjects did not enter Cycle 3 because 3 of these were nonresponders in Cycle 2, and 1 subject had a prolonged response for &gt;8 weeks after Cycle 2 and was withdrawn from study treatment.

Data on subject discontinuation of study medication is shown in Table 23:

Eight subjects experienced 10 haemostatic challenges during the study. The diagnostic procedures and surgeries performed varied in the degree of bleeding risk associated with the procedure, from cardiac  catheterization  and  transurethral  resection  of  the  prostate  to  tooth  extraction  and  dental cleaning. All subjects responded to eltrombopag and none required additional treatment to elevate their platelet count before or after the procedure. No abnormal bleeding was reported for any of the procedures.

## EXTEND ( E ltrombopag e XTEN ded D osing Study)

This is an extension study of eltrombopag in adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) previously  enrolled  in  eltrombopag  studies.  The  primary  objective  was  to  describe  the  long-term safety  and  tolerability  of  oral  eltrombopag  treatment  of  subjects  with  ITP  with  or  without concomitant ITP medication.

For subjects receiving concomitant ITP medication, the study design included four stages:

Stage 1: Eltrombopag Initial Dosing. To identify a dose of eltrombopag that increases platelet counts to a level high enough ( ≥ 100,000/ μ L) to support dose reduction of concomitant ITP medication.

Stage  2: Concomitant  ITP  Medication  Minimization.  To  reduce  or  eliminate  concomitant  ITP medication, while maintaining platelet counts ≥ 50,000/ μ L.

Stage  3: Eltrombopag  Dose  Adjustment.  To  identify  the  minimal  effective  dose  of  eltrombopag necessary  to  maintain  platelet  counts ≥ 50,000/ μ L  in  conjunction  with  the  minimal  dose  of concomitant ITP medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stage  4: Eltrombopag  Long-term  Dosing.  To  monitor  safety  and  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  at  the minimal effective dose that in conjunction with the minimal dose of concomitant ITP medications maintains platelet counts ≥ 50,000/ μ L.

Subjects started the study receiving eltrombopag 50 mg once daily. Based upon the subjects' platelet count  at  each  visit,  the  dose  of  eltrombopag  could  be  adjusted  (increased  or  decreased)  or  the frequency  reduced  to  less  than  once  daily,  for  example  25  mg  every  other  day.  Alternate  dosing schedules  to  achieve  average  daily  doses  in  between  25  mg,  50  mg  or  75  mg  were  also  allowed. Subjects whose platelet count exceeded 200,000/ μ L were required to decrease the dosage of study medication in order to maintain platelet counts within the target range (50-400,000/ μ L) and to reduce the  possibility  of  having  platelet  counts  over  400,000/ μ L.  Subjects  whose  platelet  count  exceeded 400,000/ μ L were asked to interrupt study medication for at least  7  days,  until  platelet  counts  fell below 150,000/ μ L; when platelets were &lt;150,000/ μ L, subjects were re-administered study medication at a lower dose.

Subject disposition in the study is showed in Table 27.

The superior efficacy of eltrombopag compared to placebo in terms of platelet count in ITP patients has  been  shown  based  on  the  pivotal  studies  submitted.  The  efficacy  database  was  robust  and included adequate analyses from pivotal and supportive studies.

An association between eltrombopag and reduced bleedings has also been consistently observed in secondary  analyses  of  both  phase  III  studies,  though  the  effect  is  essentially  driven  by  mild  to moderate cutaneous bleedings.

Eltrombopag dosing requirements must be individualised based on the patient's platelet counts. The objective of treatment with eltrombopag should not be to normalise platelet counts but to maintain

platelet  counts  above  the  level  for  haemorrhagic  risk  (&gt; 50,000/ μ L).  On  the  other  hand  treatment with eltrombopag should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after four weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 75 mg once daily. This information has been included in section 4.2 of the SPC.

Eltrombopag is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy. There are limited data on the use of eltrombopag in patients aged 65 years and older. In the clinical studies of eltrombopag, overall no clinically significant differences in safety of eltrombopag were observed between subjects aged at least 65 years and younger subjects. Initiation of eltrombopag at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily may be considered for patients of East Asian ancestry (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese or Korean).

## Clinical safety

The safety profile of eltrombopag has been evaluated in 26 completed or ongoing clinical studies in 1616  eltrombopag-treated  and  247  placebo-treated  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  ITP, Hepatitis C or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (see Table 28). The doses of eltrombopag used  in  these  studies  ranged  from  3  mg  to  200  mg.  The  duration  of  treatment  with  eltrombopag ranged from 1 day in healthy volunteers up to 560 days in subjects with chronic ITP.

A summary of the subjects contributing to the safety analysis and the main studies performed with eltrombopag in Chronic ITP is shown in Tables 29 and 30.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

There were a total of 8 deaths in the eltrombopag ITP programme as of 1 August 2008: 1 subject in study TRA100773A, 1 subject in RAISE, 1 subject in REPEAT, 5 subjects in EXTEND.

One death was reported in a subject treated with eltrombopag 50 mg in TRA100773A; this subject had a history of pneumonectomy due to lung cancer and died of cardiopulmonary failure which was not considered related to drug by the investigator, although proximal events of renal insufficiency, embolism, pulmonary embolism and hepatitis were considered related to the drug.

In RAISE, a 43-year old female who had a baseline platelet count of 2,000/ μ L in the placebo group suffered  a  fatal  brain  stem  haemorrhage  six  days  after  initiation  of  study  medication,  which  was considered unrelated.

No deaths were reported in REPEAT during the on-therapy or the 4-week follow-up period of the study.  One  subject  was  diagnosed  with  pancreatic  cancer  (reported  as  an  unrelated  SAE)  6  days following the last dose of eltrombopag. Six months post-therapy, the subject died from that cancer.

All 5 deaths in EXTEND were reported as unrelated to study medication. Two deaths occurred while the subjects were on-therapy (passenger in a fatal motor vehicle accident; sudden death, definitive cause of death unknown). Three subjects died &gt;30 days following discontinuation of eltrombopag.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Severe  adverse  events  observed  during  the  clinical  development  in  ITP  trials  are  summarised  in Tables 36 and 37. The rate of discontinuation due to AEs in double blind trial was similar in both treatment groups, eltrombopag and placebo, although specific AEs (e.g. thromboembolic complications)  were  numerically  higher  among  eltrombopag  patients.  In  the  open  label  EXTEND trial 9 subjects suffered from AEs (in 6 of them SAEs) leading to drug discontinuation.

## Bleedings

A higher proportion of placebo subjects experienced bleeding events on-therapy AE in the pooled data from TRA100773A and TRA100773B. Thirteen percent (13%) of placebo subjects [9 subjects, 13 events] experienced on-therapy bleeding events as compared to 8% [9 subjects, 11 events] in the eltrombopag  group.  All  of  these  events  were  reported  as  unrelated  to  study  treatment  with  the exception  of  3  SAEs  (Grade  2  gastrointestinal  [GI]  haemorrhage,  cerebral  haemorrhage  and haematuria)  that  occurred  in  1  subject  in  the  placebo  group.  Post-therapy  bleeding  rates  in  the  2 double blind studies are shown below in Tables 38 and 39.

The placebo controlled trials do not show a clinically or statistically significant difference relative to placebo in terms of platelet counts, bleeding events or need for rescue medication in the 4 weeks following  discontinuation  of  therapy  with  eltrombopag.  Observations  from  the  open  label  studies support  the  conclusion  that  there  is  not  an  excess  bleeding  risk  associated  with  interruption  of eltrombopag.

In both placebo-controlled trials as well as in open-label studies transient decrease in platelets count after eltrombopag discontinuation has been analysed according to the following definition: 'a post therapy platelet count &lt;10,000/ μ L and at least 10,000/ μ L less than the baseline within the 4 weeks of study medication discontinuation'. The results are summarised in Table 40.

In summary in the 3 controlled clinical studies, transient decreases in platelet counts to levels lower than  baseline  were  observed  following  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  8 %  and  8 %  of  the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively.

## Thromboembolic complications

From all ITP studies, a total of 17 out of 446 (3.8%) patients experienced TEE which included (in descending  order  of  occurrence)  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary  embolism,  acute  myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, embolism, transient ischaemic attack, and suspected  PRIND (prolonged  reversible  ischemic  neurologic  deficiency)  (see  Table  41).  Of  them  6  (35%)  achieved maximum platelet count &gt;400,000/ μ L at some time of treatment but only just 1 experienced the TEE close to their maximum platelet count (407,000/ μ L).  The role of other thrombophilic risk factors and conditions  in  subjects  who  experienced  TEEs  during  the  eltrombopag  trials  was  examined retrospectively, including concomitant therapies. No apparent relationship was shown.

Safety data emerged from study TPL104054/ELEVATE in thrombocytopenic subjects with chronic liver  disease  and  the  study  was  prematurely  stopped  by  the  IDMB  for  safety  reasons.  As  of  20 August 2009, 6 of 261 (2.3%) subjects treated with eltrombopag 75 mg had experienced 7 TEEs (Table 42; Figure 5). These consisted of 7 events of the portal vein system (4 portal vein thromboses [PVT], 3 mesenteric vein thromboses) in 6 subjects and 1 myocardial infarction (MI). The median (range)  time  to  onset  since  the  first  dose  of  study  medication  was  22  days  (15,  53).  None  of  the events occurred on-therapy, the median (range) days since last dose was 9 days (1, 38). Five of the 7 subjects experienced the TEE within 2 weeks of the last dose of study medication. Six of the cases correlated with platelet counts above 200,000/ μ L (see Figure 5).

In addition the ELEVATE IDMC also reviewed TEEs from the ongoing HCV studies (TPL103922/ENABLE 1 and TPL108390/ENABLE 2), an ongoing Japanese chronic liver disease study (TPL111913, n=38 subjects; recruitment completed), and from post-marketing safety reports (n=1239 patients, approximately 240 patient years, as of 14 August 2009).

The ENABLE studies are 2 ongoing phase III studies of eltrombopag in subjects with HCV associated thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;75Gi/L). All subjects initiated treatment with 25mg eltrombopag and were able to dose escalate to a maximum of 100mg to achieve platelet counts of &gt;90 or 100Gi/L depending upon the study. A total of 11 of the1185 ENABLE subjects (0.9%) had

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experienced a TEE as of 1 September 2009. These consisted of 4 PVT events, 5 venous thrombosis events of the lower extremities, 1 MI event and 1 proximal occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery.

TPL111913 was a dose ranging study in Japanese subjects with chronic liver disease that used 12.5, 25 and 37.5mg dose which may approximate to 25, 50 and 75mg in a non East Asian population. In Part A of this study, 12 subjects were dosed with 12.5mg eltrombopag for 14 days. In Part B of the study, subjects received either 25mg or 37.5mg eltrombopag (14 and 12 subjects, respectively). Subjects were dosed for 14 days or 21 days depending upon whether or not the platelet count was above 80Gi/L at Day 15. One of the 38 subjects (2.6%) experienced an SAE of portal vein thrombosis 34 days after initiation of 37.5mg eltrombopag and 21 days since the last dose of eltrombopag.

In the post-marketing setting, as of 30 September 2009, a total of 1544 patients in the US REMS program were exposed to eltrombopag for approximately 356 patient years. Six of the 1544 patients had reported a TEE. Events included 3 pulmonary embolisms, 1 deep vein thrombosis, 1 embolism and 1 cerebrovascular accident. Of the 6 events 1 was unresolved, 2 had improved outcome and 1 was fatal.

## Bone marrow toxicity

In  RAISE  and  REPEAT  per  protocol,  bone  marrow  examinations  were  to  be  performed  prior  to enrolment to confirm the diagnosis of ITP and to rule out myelodysplastic syndromes or other causes of  thrombocytopenia  in  subjects  who  responded  insufficiently  to  corticosteroids  or  if  the  WBC differential  and  the  subsequent  peripheral  blood  smear  confirm  the  presence  of  immature  or dysplastic cells.

In EXTEND, bone marrow examinations were performed for the following reasons:

a) Prior to enrolment into the study, for subjects who had not responded to prior ITP therapies with a platelet count increase to ≥ 100,000/ μ L or had not had a bone marrow examination consistent with a diagnosis of ITP within 3; and

- b) During the study, for subjects who had immature or dysplastic cells in the white blood cell (WBC) differential that were confirmed by peripheral blood smear microscopy.
- c) After dosing with eltrombopag for one year in EXTEND
- d) At any time at the Investigator's discretion

Bone  marrow  examinations  were  not  required  in  the  6-week  TRA100773A  and  TRA100773B studies.

Bone marrow toxicity data come from EXTEND (cut-off date 10 December 2008) where subjects were to have a bone marrow examination performed after 12 months of treatment with eltrombopag. Additionally  bone  marrow  examinations  may  have  been  performed  at  any  time  for  other  reasons based upon local standards of care.

86 subjects had been dosed for a median time of 12 months, none of the bone marrow exams were prompted by an abnormal peripheral blood smear. Of the 86 subjects 46 had a bone marrow aspirate done, none of which had an abnormal karyotype or an increase bone marrow blast count. The ontreatment reports for three of the 86 subjects did not mention testing for reticulin or fibrosis. The remaining  83  subjects  were  evaluable  for  reporting  bone  marrow  fibre  information  and  it  is summarised below:

· Forty-eight subjects had either an MF Grade of 0 recorded in the eCRF (42 subjects), or 'no', 'no significant increase', 'no evidence of fibrosis' or 'Grade 0' reticulin documented in the bone marrow report (6 subjects).

-  Thirty  subjects had either an MF Grade of 1 (26 subjects) recorded in the eCRF or 'focal mild' reticulin documented in the bone marrow report (4 subjects).
- o  One  of  these  subjects  (Subject  58)  had  a  MF  Grade  of  1  in  the  eCRF  and  'slight  increase'  in collagen documented in the bone marrow report (collagen not documented in the eCRF).
- Five subjects (Subjects 53, 61, 67, 1058 and 1241) had an MF Grade of 2 in the eCRF; with the exception of Subject 67, these subjects were presented in the original MAA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  3/5 had no collagen described in the bone marrow report (Subjects 53, 67 and 1058);
- 2/5 had collagen mentioned in the bone marrow report (Subjects 61 and 1241).

4  subjects  had  a  reticulin  assessment  prior  to  and  after  treatment  with  eltrombopag.  Changes  in reticulin are described in Table 43, further follow up assessments have not been completed

## Malignancies

Five (1.2%) cases of malignancies in eltrombopag group and 1(1.4%) in placebo group have been detected in all ITP studies. Among the 6 cases of malignancies observed in ITP studies, there were 2 cases of haematological malignancies: 1 in placebo group and one in eltrombopag group.

## Hepatotoxicity

Across  the  3  placebo-controlled  studies,  1  patient  in  the  placebo  group  and  1  patient  in  the eltrombopag group experienced a Grade 4 liver test abnormality.

A review of all cases of liver injury reported in the completed studies and up to 10 December 08 from the on-going EXTEND study was provided. Drug induced liver injury (DILI) screening criteria for hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities (HBLA) were defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST) ≥ 3x  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  and/or  bilirubin  or alkaline  phosphatase  (AP)  &gt;1.5xULN.  An  analysis  of  time  to  onset,  age,  sex,  dose,  concomitant medications,  repeated  exposure  to  eltrombopag  and  outcome/resolution  of  the  HBLA  has  been provided.

A total  of  69  cases  of  HBLA  have  been  reported  (any  dose  of  eltrombopag  or  placebo).  60  were receiving eltrombopag. Among the 60 cases, 5 cases occurring with the doses of 30 mg (3 cases) and 75  mg  (2  cases)  were  not  included  in  the  analysis  except  for  the  evaluation  of  the  time  to  onset. Therefore, 55 cases have been analysed. Summaries of all cases of HBLA for studies TRA100773A and TRA100773B (pooled data) and RAISE are presented in Tables 44 and 45.

Akbreviations: AP=alkaline phosphatase; AST=aspartate aminotransferase; ALT=alarine aminotransferase; Bili=bilirubin;

Data Source: TRA102357 CSR, Tatle 8.90, m5.3.5.3, sequence 0000

ULN=upper limit of normal; AT=ALT and/or AST

Subjecis are counted in more than one category if they fulfill more than one criterion.

Time  to  onset  varied  broadly.  In  TRA100773A-B  and  RAISE  studies,  DILI  occurred  in  the  first month of treatment (median: 15, 29 days respectively) but in EXTEND the median of time onset was 3.5  months.  Bilirubin  occurred  in  a  shorter  time  than  transaminases  in  all  studies,  except  in TRA100773A-B in which median of time to onset for both bilirubin and ALT was 8 days.

HBLA was  observed  across  all  age  ranges.  Of  the  eltrombopag-treated  subjects  who  developed, HBLA 66% were female and 34% were male. Hepatotoxicity was more frequent in Asian subjects.

The outcome was analysed in 61 cases (7 of them occurred in both EXTEND and previous studies). In  37  cases  the  HBLA  resolved,  12  resolved  after  eltrombopag  discontinuation  and  2  after  dose decrease. The remaining 23 cases the event resolved despite eltrombopag therapy continued. Of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

24  cases  in  which  the  event  did  not  resolve,  10  were  only  bilirubin  elevation  (6  with  Gilbert's Syndrome).

Half of the patients experienced only bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. 5 patients had elevations of transaminases with bilirubin increases and met Hy's Rule Criteria. In two cases alternative causes were  identified  (thromboembolism  of  the  liver  and  cardiac  failure,  cholecystitis).  In  one  case  the patient  experienced  sudden  elevations  of  transaminases  and  bilirubin  1  year  after  starting  therapy with  eltrombopag.  The  other  two  cases  fluctuations  on  elevations  of  transaminases  and  bilirubin occurred  during  a  long  period  of  time  (1  year,  5  months).  Bilirubin  increase  was  due  to  indirect bilirubin in the 3 cases.

A pharmacogenetic  study  identified  the UGT1A1*28 allele  as  being  associated  with  elevated total bilirubin in the White subjects included in the eltrombopag clinical development program. This allele has been associated with Gilbert's Syndrome in populations of European ancestry as well  as  hyperbilirubinaemia  and  toxicity  following  administration  of  some  drugs  in  which UGT1A1 contributes to the elimination of parent drug or metabolites. In East Asian populations UGT1A1*28 is  of  lower  frequency  and  other  alleles  of  diminished  activity  such UGT1A1*6 (absent in European populations) and UGT1A1*60 are important and these alleles contribute to Gilbert's syndrome and are associated with some drug toxicities. The eltrombopag PGx analysis did  not  report  an  association  of UGT1A1 alleles  with  total  bilirubin  elevation  in  Asian  ITP patients; however, only a limited number of Asian patients could be included in this analysis (3 Asians with elevated total bilirubin and 33 Asian controls).

## Cataracts

In the double-blind RAISE study patients had an ocular exam prior to enter in study and after starting the study at month 3 and 6. The frequency of incident cases of cataracts was similar for eltrombopag group (4.5%) and placebo group (4.9%). The frequency in cataract progression was slightly higher in eltrombopag group compared with placebo group. Prior to enter in the study 25 patients had cataracts (13 placebo, 12 eltrombopag group) and during the study, 4(33%) patients had a cataract progression in the eltrombopag group and 3(23%) in the placebo group.

The frequency of cataracts (incident/progression) was similar in open label studies (REPEAT 3%, EXTEND  5%).  All  patients  who  developed  cataracts  in  ITP  studies  had  chronic  treatment  with corticosteroids.

## Phototoxicity

No difference in the frequency of skin and subcutaneous adverse events was demonstrated between the eltrombopag and placebo groups in the controlled trials. The frequency reported in the open label studies was similar to the placebo controlled studies.

Data from open label studies and EXTEND are consistent with this data.

## Renal laboratory values

Across the pooled data from TRA100773, 22 subjects showed an increase from baseline in creatinine (placebo: 4 subjects; 30 mg: 3 subjects; 50 mg: 13 subjects; 75 mg: 2 subjects). Five of these subjects (all receiving eltrombopag) were considered of clinical interest because they had multiple on-therapy creatinine values ≥ 0.3 mg/dL above their individual baseline. These subjects did not experience any AEs potentially related to renal function, and an improvement or normalization of their creatinine values  was  reported  while  continuing  on  drug,  except  for  one  subject  whose  creatinine,  albeit remaining within normal values, had not yet returned to baseline at the end of the study.

In  the  RAISE  one  subject  treated  with  eltrombopag  had  at  least  2  consecutive  assessments ≥ 0.3 mg/dL above baseline and above the ULN (peaked at 1.5xULN). Thereafter, the values decreased during treatment with eltrombopag. A summary of the subjects with increases in serum creatinine from baseline is presented in Table 44.

The rate of serum creatinine abnormal values was similar in the open label studies.

Enhanced renal monitoring was added to the ongoing RAISE, REPEAT, and EXTEND studies to detect the potential occurrence of renal toxicity. In this review eltrombopag was associated with liver injury with a frequency of 10-13%.

## Platelet function and antiplatelet antibodies

No systemic  change  in  the  detectable  anti-platelet  antibody  levels  for  antibodies  to  glycoproteins Ia/IIa, Ib/IX, and IIb/IIIa has been detected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Safety in special populations

Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. No relevant difference  in  the  type  and  frequency  of  adverse  events  were  noted.  However,  both  the  number  of patients and duration of treatment are not appropriate to draw clinical safety conclusions.

Gender and age did not appear to have a critical impact in the safety of the drug. Representation of elderly  (&gt;65 years) and very elderly (&gt;75 years) is limited, though age and gender distribution in clinical trials generally mimics the real prevalence of the disease.

## Hepatic impairment

The risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) has been found to be increased in patients with chronic liver disease treated with 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for two weeks in preparation for invasive procedures. In a placebo-controlled study where eltrombopag was administered for 2 weeks in preparation for invasive procedures, 6 of 261 patients with chronic liver disease experienced 7 thromboembolic events of the portal venous system. One additional patient developed a myocardial infarction 20 days after the last dose of study medication, which remains blinded (see section on thromboembolic complications).

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No studies have been submitted.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

See section on 'Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events'.

- Post marketing experience

No studies have been submitted.

- Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of eltrombopag has been evaluated in 26 completed or ongoing clinical studies in 1616 eltrombopag-treated and 247 placebo-treated healthy volunteers and patients with ITP, hepatitis C or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The total exposure in the ITP safety database is 446 patients, being the main limitation of this safety database the long-term treatment.

The risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) has been found to be increased in patients with chronic liver disease treated with 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for two weeks in preparation for invasive procedures. This data emerged from the study ELEVATE in thrombocytopenic subjects with chronic liver disease and the study was prematurely stopped for safety reasons. The CHMP consulted an ad hoc expert  group  to  provide  guidance  on  the  significance  of  these  events.  The  questions  and responses from the expert group are summarised below:

1. Please discuss the possible mechanism for the observed increase in thromboembolic events in the ELEVATE study.

The  group  agreed  that  it  is  difficult  to  speculate  on  the  possible  mechanism  for  the  observed thromboembolic  events  in  ELEVATE  as  the  study  remains  blinded.  A  plausible  explanation  was based on the rapid increase in platelet counts observed in the liver impaired population due to the administration  of  a  higher  dose  of  eltrombopag  (75  mg  compared  to  25  mg  or  50  mg  in  the  ITP population). However in order to be reassured on this point information on whether the patients that experienced  thromboembolic  events  received  transfusions  in  addition  to  drug  treatment  and  what platelet counts were achieved in the patients who had no TEEs was needed. In addition, it could not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be  excluded  that  an  enhancement  of  the  pro-thrombotic  state  (hypercoagulability)  due  to  an imbalance in coagulation factors and/or the presence of endothelial damage seen in liver disease had contributed to the thromboembolic events.

In  order  to  clarify  the  pathophysiology  of  the  observed  events  the  experts  expressed  the  need  for further characterisation upon unblinding of the ELEVATE study:

-  Levels of pro- and anti- coagulant factors in all patients (i.e. protein C, protein S, anti-thrombin, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor). Time points suggested were: pre eltrombopag/placebo, at day 15 and at time of TEE/ end of monitoring period.

- Platelet activation status.

- Endothelial activation status.

Although  the  group  acknowledged  that  some  of  these  studies  would  not  be  feasible  if  not  prespecified in the original protocol of ELEVATE, it was recommended exploring them pre- and posttreatment with eltrombopag/placebo in the context of liver impaired patients independently of the ELEVATE  study  if  needed.  Doppler  ultrasound  to  assess  asymptomatic  portal  vein  thrombosis should also be considered.

2. Do the experts consider that the safety findings triggering the decision of the IDMC results seen in the Elevate study are relevant to the ITP population?

The group was of the opinion that the thromboembolic events observed in the ELEVATE study are unlikely to be relevant to the ITP patient population. The main reasons for this conclusion are the different pathophysiology of the two diseases, the different aetiology of the thrombocytopenia and the different type and pattern of thromboembolic events observed in the two populations.

3. What additional precautions do the experts think that could be taken to ensure a safe use of Revolade in ITP patients?

The  group  expressed  the  need  to  include  a  strong  warning  in  the  SPC  highlighting  the  risk  of thromboembolic events in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. In this regard a full contraindication was not supported, however it was recommended the inclusion of a clear statement indicating  that  eltrombopag  should  not  be  used  in  these  patients  unless  the  expected  benefit outweighs the risk of portal vein thrombosis and including a recommended dose in those cases. The group voiced that especially for those patients undergoing invasive procedures, platelet transfusion remains a safer option.

The  experts  agreed  that  the  SPC  should  contain  a  clear  cut  definition  of  the  term  'moderate  to severe' liver impairment, including Child-Pugh and Meld scores.

Regarding  posology,  the  group  agreed  that  the  revised  cut-off  values  of  platelet  counts  for  dose adjustment and treatment interruption proposed by the Rapporteurs were adequate to minimise the risk of thromboembolic episodes in the ITP population.

The CHMP concurred with the expert group recommendations and concluded that the TEE findings in the ELEVATE study are unlikely to be relevant to the ITP patient population. However, it was agreed  that  strong  warnings  hightlighting  the  risks  associated  with  moderate  to  severe  liver impairment should be included in the SPC (sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). The agreed wording was the following:

'Eltrombopag should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh score ≥ 7) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis.

If the use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary, the starting dose must be 25 mg once daily.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) has been found to be increased in patients with chronic liver disease treated with 75 mg eltrombopag once daily for two weeks in preparation for invasive procedures'

In  order  to  further  characterise  the  risk  associated  with  liver  impairment,  the  Applicant  has committed to provide to  the  CHMP  the  final  results  of  the  ELEVATE  study  (Study  TPL104054) including PK and PD data when they become available (study still blinded, report expected to be available September 2010). Moreover, the Applicant will further assess, from stored samples in the ELEVATE study, the potential effect of eltrombopag on the unstable coagulation balance (pro- vs. anti-coagulant factors production) in this patient population.

Based on the result ELEVATE study in which there was an observable close relationship between high  platelet  counts  and  TE  complications  (five  out  of  7  patients,  thromboembolic  complications took  place  at  the  time  of  the  maximum  platelet  count  above  200,000/ μ L  for  each  individual)  the CHMP  requested  the  Applicant  a  revised  and  more  conservative  cut-off  points  for  dosing adjustment, taking on board that the key aspect in the ITP patient population is to maintain platelet count  above  the  threshold  considered  to  be  associated  to  bleeding  risk  (50,000/ μ L).  The  CHMP considered that there was no clinical justification for the administration of eltrombopag in patients with platelet count ≥ 250,000/ μ L. With this value there is a broad safety margin of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (more than 200,000/ μ L). This was also agreed by experts consulted by the CHMP as summarised above. The following posology has been recommended in the SPC:

| Platelet count                                      | Dose adjustment or response                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| < 50,000/ μ L following at least 2 weeks of therapy | Increase daily dose by 25 mg to a maximum of 75 mg/day.                                                                                                                          |
| ≥ 50,000/ μ L to ≤ 150,000/ μ L                     | Use lowest dose of eltrombopag and/or concomitant ITP treatment to maintain platelet counts that avoid or reduce bleeding.                                                       |
| > 150,000/ μ L to ≤ 250,000/ μ L                    | Decrease the daily dose by 25 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the effects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments.                                                                |
| > 250,000/ μ L                                      | Stop eltrombopag; increase the frequency of platelet monitoring to twice weekly. Once the platelet count is ≤ 100,000/ μ L, reinitiate therapy at a daily dose reduced by 25 mg. |

Several risks need to be further assessed in a larger population than the one studied, therefore the Applicant  has  submitted  a  comprehensive  risk  management  plan  and  has  committed  to  perform additional post-authorisation studies. Safety concerns included hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities, thromboembolic events, post therapy recurrence of thrombocytopenia, bone marrow reticulin formation and risk of bone marrow fibrosis, haematological malignancies, cataracts and loss of response to eltrombopag (all reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC). Eltrombopag has been contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to eltrombopag or to any other of the excipients, this information has been included in section 4.3 of the SPC.

The effectiveness and safety of eltrombopag have not been established for use in other thrombocytopenic conditions including chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

Serum ALT, AST and bilirubin should be measured prior to initiation of eltrombopag, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase and monthly following establishment of a stable dose. Abnormal serum liver tests should be evaluated with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If the abnormalities are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

confirmed, serum liver tests should be monitored until the abnormalities resolve, stabilise, or return to baseline levels.  Eltrombopag should be discontinued if ALT levels increase ( ≥ 3X the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and are: progressive, persistent for ≥ 4  weeks, accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation. Caution should be taken when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic disease.

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of eltrombopag in pregnant women therefore the potential risk for humans is unknown and eltrombopag is not recommended during pregnancy and in women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  contraception.  In  addition  it  is  not  known  whether eltrombopag or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Warnings during pregnancy and lactation have been included in section 4.6 of the SPC.

In order to further characterise the uncertainties associated with eltrombopag treatment, the applicant has provided new information clarifying how the risk of eltrombopag will be estimated. The US Risk Evaluation  and  Mitigation  Strategy  (REMS)  program  will  be  the  main  source  to  obtain  data  for eltrombopag-risk, and two registries included in the pharmacovigilange plan (UK-ITP and PARCITP  registries)  will  provide  information  on  the  background  risk  of  ITP  disease.  Comparison  on incidence rates among REMS and UK-ITP or PARC-ITP registry should be used to estimate risk of thromboembolic events and malignancies.

In addition the applicant has committed to assess the levels of bone marrow fibers (reticulin and/or collagen) at baseline and any change from baseline after 1 and 2 years of treatment with eltrombopag in adult subjects with chronic ITP (study TRA112940). The final study report will be submitted as a post-authorisation commitment.

Additional risk minimization activities have been agreed for hepatic events, thromboembolic events, reoccurrence  of  thrombocytopenia,  bone  marrow  fibrosis  and  malignancies.  These  risks  will  be addressed  in  a  healthcare  professional  information  pack  containing  educational  materials  to  be provided prior to launch to all physicians who intend to prescribe eltrombopag.

An evaluation of the proposed risk minimization plan should be submitted periodically. Specifically, for  the  hepatic  monitoring  an  evaluation  should  be  presented  every  6  months  together  with  the PSURs and RMP updates.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: see as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  quality  of  the  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the conditions  defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Eltrombopag does not  stimulate  platelet  production  in  mice,  rats  or  dogs  because  of  unique  TPO receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animals do not fully model potential adverse effects related to the pharmacology of eltrombopag in humans, including the reproduction and carcinogenicity studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment-related cataracts were detected in rodents and were dose and time-dependent. At ≥ 6 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC, cataracts were observed in mice after 6 weeks and rats after 28 weeks of dosing. At ≥ 4 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC, cataracts were observed  in  mice  after  13 weeks  and  in  rats  after  39 weeks  of  dosing.  Cataracts  have  not  been observed in dogs after 52 weeks of dosing (2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown (see section 4.4).

Renal tubular toxicity was observed in studies of up to 14 days duration in mice and rats at exposures that were generally associated with morbidity and mortality. Tubular toxicity was also observed in a 2 year oral carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day.  Effects were less severe at lower doses and were characterized by a spectrum of regenerative changes.  The exposure at the lowest dose was 1.2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC.  Renal effects were not observed in rats after 28 weeks or in dogs after 52 weeks at exposures 4 and 2 times respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC.  The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

Hepatocyte degeneration and/or necrosis, often accompanied by increased serum liver enzymes, was observed in mice, rats and dogs at doses that were associated with morbidity and mortality or were poorly tolerated.  No hepatic effects were observed after chronic dosing in rats (28 weeks) or dogs (52 weeks) at exposures up to 4 or 2 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC.

At poorly tolerated doses in rats and dogs (&gt; 10 times maximum human clinical exposure based on AUC), decreased reticulocyte counts and regenerative bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia (rats only) were observed in short term studies. There were no effects of note on red cell mass or reticulocyte counts  after  dosing  for  up  to  28  weeks  in  rats,  52  weeks  in  dogs  and  2  years  in  mice  or  rats  at maximally tolerated doses which were 2 to 4 times the maximum human clinical exposure based on AUC.

Endosteal hyperostosis was observed in a 28 week toxicity study in rats at a non-tolerated dose of 60 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum human clinical exposure based on AUC). There were no bone changes observed in mice or rats after lifetime exposure (2 years) at 4 times the maximum human clinical exposure based on AUC.

Eltrombopag was not carcinogenic in mice  at  doses  up  to  75 mg/kg/day  or  in  rats  at  doses  up  to 40 mg/kg/day (exposures up to 4 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC). Eltrombopag was  not  mutagenic  or  clastogenic  in  a  bacterial  mutation  assay  or  in  two in  vivo assays  in  rats (micronucleus  and  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis,  10  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on Cmax).  In  the in  vitro mouse  lymphoma  assay,  eltrombopag  was  marginally  positive  (&lt; 3-fold increase in mutation frequency). These in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that eltrombopag does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans.

Eltrombopag  did not affect female fertility, early embryonic  development  or embryofoetal development  in  rats  at  doses  up  to  20 mg/kg/day  (2  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on AUC).    Also  there  was  no  effect  on  embryofoetal  development  in  rabbits  at  doses  up  to 150 mg/kg/day,  the  highest  dose  tested  (0.5  times  the  human  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC). However, at a maternally toxic dose of 60 mg/kg/day (6 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) in rats, eltrombopag treatment was associated with embryo lethality (increased pre- and postimplantation loss), reduced foetal body weight and gravid uterine weight in the female fertility study and a low incidence of cervical ribs and reduced foetal body weight in the embryofoetal development study.  Eltrombopag did not affect male fertility in rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested (3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC). In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, there were no undesirable effects on pregnancy, parturition or lactation of F0 female rats at maternally non-toxic doses (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) and no effects on the growth, development, neurobehavioral  or  reproductive  function  of  the  offspring  (F1).  Eltrombopag  was  detected  in  the plasma  of  all  F1  rat  pups  for  the  entire  22 hour  sampling  period  following  administration  of medicinal product to the F0 dams, suggesting that rat pup exposure to eltrombopag was likely via lactation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  vitro studies  with  eltrombopag suggest a potential phototoxicity risk; however, in rodents there was no evidence of cutaneous phototoxicity (10 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) or ocular phototoxicity ( ≥ 5 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC).

## Efficacy

Eltrombopag increases platelet count in patients with chronic ITP unresponsive to at least one first line  therapy  (corticosteroids  or  immunoglobulins).  This  effect  has  been  shown  to  be  superior  to placebo in both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients in two well-designed and conducted placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  of  short-term  (6  weeks)  and  medium-term  (6  months)  duration. Open label extension studies have confirmed this effect.  Duration  of  response  in  platelet  count  is longer with eltrombopag than with placebo, being consistently shown in the clinical database.

Secondary  analyses  have  consistently  reported  an  association  between  eltrombopag  and  reduced bleedings. The association was essentially driven by mild to moderate cutaneous bleedings, however an effect on severe bleedings has also been consistently observed in secondary analyses. In addition, greater  discontinuation  of  concomitant  therapies  was  observed  with  eltrombopag  compared  to placebo.

The response to eltrombopag shows variability, especially in cases with over-response (platelet count above 400,000/ μ L). This is particularly relevant considering that full therapeutic response can take place as early as during the first week of therapy. In addition, response to eltrombopag in patients with very low platelet count (&lt;15,000/ μ L ) is considerably lower, although it is significantly different from placebo.

## Safety

The safety profile of eltrombopag has been evaluated based on data from 26 completed or ongoing clinical studies in 1616 eltrombopag-treated and 247 placebo-treated healthy volunteers and patients with ITP, hepatitis C or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The doses of eltrombopag used in these studies ranged from 3 mg to 200 mg. The duration of treatment with eltrombopag ranged from 1 day in healthy volunteers up to 560 days in subjects with chronic ITP.

Adverse reactions observed during eltrombopag treatment included headache (13%); nausea, alanine aminotransferase  increased  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (4%);  diarrhoea  and  fatigue (3%);  paraesthesia,  constipation,  rash,  pruritus,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  cataract,  arthralgia, myalgia and hyperbilirubinaemia (2%), abdominal pain upper, alopecia, dry eye, oedema peripheral, muscle spasm, bone pain, hepatic function abnormal and insomnia (1%).

Safety  concerns  included  hepatobiliary  laboratory  abnormalities,  thromboembolic  events,  posttherapy recurrence of thrombocytopenia, bone marrow reticulin formation and risk of bone marrow fibrosis, haematological malignancies, cataracts and loss of response to eltrombopag.

Eltrombopag administration can cause abnormal liver function. In clinical studies with eltrombopag, increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin were observed. Findings were mostly mild (Grade 1-2), reversible and not accompanied by clinically significant symptoms that would indicate an impaired liver function. Across the 3 placebo-controlled studies, 1 patient in the placebo group and 1 patient in the eltrombopag group experienced a Grade 4 liver test abnormality.

Among 446 adult chronic ITP patients receiving eltrombopag, 17 subjects experienced thromboembolic  events, which included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary  embolism, acute myocardial  infarction,  cerebral  infarction,  embolism,  transient  ischaemic  attack,  and  suspected PRIND (prolonged reversible ischemic neurologic deficiency).

The risk  of  thromboembolic  events  has  been  found  to  be  increased  in  patients  with  chronic  liver disease treated with eltrombopag. These findings have been considered unlikely to be relevant to the ITP patient population (conclusion supported by an ad hoc expert group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  induction  of  reticulin  formation  and  the  potential  development  of  bone  marrow  fibrosis  is  a serious  safety  concern.  There  are  limited  data  suggesting  that  eltrombopag  is  associated  with reticulin  formation  in  the  bone  marrow  (collagen  formation  in  3  cases)  however  whether  this  is  a finding likely to have clinical consequences on the long term is still uncertain. In addition, for Mpl ligands,  such  as  eltrombopag,  there  is  a  theoretical  concern  that  they  may  stimulate  the  growth haematopoietic  malignancies,  or  increase  progression  of  MDS  to  acute  myelogenous  leukaemia (AML).

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

- User consultation

The Applicant performed a readability testing ('user consultation') and a satisfactory report has been provided.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The benefits of eltrombopag in terms of platelet counts have been established in several independent clinical  trials  on  a  short  and  long-term  basis.  In  secondary  analyses,  eltrombopag  was  also consistently associated with a reduction of the risk of bleedings.

Adverse reactions observed during eltrombopag treatment included headache (13%); nausea, alanine aminotransferase  increased  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (4%);  diarrhoea  and  fatigue (3%);  paraesthesia,  constipation,  rash,  pruritus,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  cataract,  arthralgia, myalgia and hyperbilirubinaemia (2%), upper abdominal pain, alopecia, dry eye, oedema peripheral, muscle spasm, bone pain, hepatic function abnormal and insomnia (1%).

In  addition  during  treatment  with  eltrombopag  a  number  of  risks  and  uncertainties  have  been identified. These include hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities, thromboembolism events and post therapy  recurrence  of  thrombocytopenia  as  identified  risks  and  bone  marrow  reticulin  formation, haematological  malignancies,  renal  toxicity,  phototoxicity,  cataracts,  haematological  changes  and endosteal hyperostosis as potential risks.

In  splenectomised  patients  refractory  or  intolerant  to  first  line  therapies  (corticosteroids  and immunoglobulins),  the  benefits  of  eltrombopag  outweigh  the  risks.  However,  considering  the unknown  risks,  the  benefit-risk  balance  cannot  be  considered  positive  for  non-splenectomised patients, for whom splenectomy is a therapeutic option that could potentially affect the course of the disease. Therefore, the indication for non-splenectomised patients has been restricted from the one that the Applicant initially applied and eltrombopag may be considered as second line treatment only when surgery is contra-indicated.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
-  the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 2.3.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is of the opinion that Revolade is not similar to Nplate within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of Revolade in the treatment of:

'Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). Revolade may be considered as second line treatment for adult non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated'

was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

In  addition,  the  CHMP,  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  EC  No  141/2000,  considers Revolade not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Nplate for the same therapeutic indication.

Furthermore, the CHMP takes note that the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan is not completed yet as none of the measures are completed.
