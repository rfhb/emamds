## SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE SUSPENSION OF ACOMPLIA PRESENTED BY THE EMEA

Acomplia (rimonabant) is a selective antagonist of cannabinoid type I (CB1) receptors. The cannabinoid system has been shown to be involved in the central regulation of food intake and the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  reward system. CB1 receptors were first found in the brain, and later in several human tissues, including adipocytes.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Acomplia was authorised in the EU on 19 June 2006. It is indicated 'as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of obese patients or overweight patients with associated risk factors such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia'. At the time of approval, a higher incidence of dizziness, anxiety, depressed mood and depressive disorders were observed in the 20 mg rimonabant group, compared with  placebo.    Risk  minimization  strategies  were  included  in  the  product  information  which  have since then been tightened to include contraindications for major depression and use of antidepressant. Additionally,  warnings  concerning  past  history  of  depressive  disorder,  the  need  to  monitor  for  the emergence of depressive symptoms or mood alteration and a warning to stop rimonabant if depression is diagnosed have been introduced in the product information. In  the  conclusions  of  PSUR  3  (March  2008)  it  was  noted  that  the  reporting  rate  for  depressive disorders had increased markedly during the last 6-month period compared to the first 1-year period of marketing (24 cases per 10,000 treated patients versus 13). The reporting rates for cases related to suicidality  and  aggressive  behaviour  had  also  increased.  These  findings  raised  significant  safety concerns regarding rimonabant and the risk of psychiatric disorders. Thus, the MAH was requested to provide further analysis on this topic. Additional safety concerns arose from the results of the STRADIVARIUS trial (JAMA April, 2008). In  this  study,  the  absolute  reporting  rate  of  psychiatric  adverse  events  was  higher  compared  to previous studies (43.4% vs 28.4%, p&lt;0.001 for rimonabant and placebo, respectively). At the April 2008 CHMP meeting, the Committee agreed to convene the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) on Diabetes and Endocrinology to discuss the benefits and risks of rimonabant and its place in therapy. The SAG meeting was held in June 2008 and the group looked at all of the available data on the benefits and risks of Acomplia. The experts were concerned that the margin of benefits over risks for Acomplia had narrowed since the medicine's approval, but agreed that more data were needed before a conclusion could be reached. At the July 2008 CHMP meeting, it was considered that there were uncertainties with the benefit/risk of Acomplia and the CHMP requested the MAH to submit further analyses on the above-mentioned safety concerns, the duration of treatment and potential subgroups that may be more likely to respond to  the  treatment.  The  overall  assessment  of  these  data  confirmed  the  previously  safety  concerns  of Acomplia without identifying any subgroups with a potentially more favourable benefit/risk balance. In view of the above the European Commission initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  European  Commission  requested  the  Committee  on  20  October  2008  to assess  the  above  concerns  and  its  impact  on  the  risk/benefit  balance  for  Acomplia,  and  to  give  its opinion on measures necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of Acomplia and on whether the marketing  authorisation  for  this  product  should  be  maintained,  varied,  suspended  or  withdrawn.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP after  reviewing  all  the  available  data  submitted  by  the  MAH  to  address  the  increased concern  over  the  psychiatric  adverse  events  and  its  impact  on  the  risk  benefit-risk  concluded  the following:

## Efficacy

In clinical studies, in which the patients were treated for more than a year, the weight reducing effect of rimonabant was moderate but probably of clinical relevance for 20-30 % of the treated patients. However, since new data have now emerged indicating a shorter duration of treatment in 'real life' than what was tested in the clinical trials setting, the benefit of the weight reduction would be more limited with this short-term use of the product.  Results from studies finalised after approval point out to the same direction, as they also indicate a more limited effect on weight reduction compared to the initial trials.

Rimonabant  has  beneficial  effects  on  HDL-cholesterol,  triglycerides  and  HbA1c.  This  could  be advantageous  since  the  prevention  of  cardiovascular  disease  should  be  based  on  a  multi-factorial approach. However, these effects were rather limited and the potential benefits are based on a long term treatment approach. Furthermore the results of the Stradivarius study did not indicate any effect on the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by the IVUS technique.

## Safety

Gastrointestinal,  nervous  and  psychiatric  disorders  have  been  identified  as  known  side  effects  of rimonabant treatment. Depression and related problems have been serious concerns since the time of approval and strengthened warnings and contraindications have been added to the product information, along with distribution of DHCP letters.

Data  from  clinical  studies  indicate  that  there  is  approximately  a  1.5-  2  fold  increased  risk  of psychiatric disorders (mainly depressive and sleep disorders and anxiety) associated with the use of rimonabant.  This  relative  risk  may  not  have  increased  since  the  time  of  approval,  but  the  absolute numbers  are  quite  different  depending  on  study  population  and  study  design,  with  higher  absolute risks in patients with comorbidities. In addition, the latest analysis provided by the MAH shows that the absolute incidence of clinically severe depressive disorders occurred more commonly.

About  50%  of  the  depressions  occurred  during  the  first  3  months  of  treatment  and  the  main  risk factors to develop depressive disorders were concurrent and past history of depressive disorders and co-administration of antidepressants. However, depressive reactions may occur in patients who have no obvious risk factors, apart from obesity itself.

In the finalised clinical studies, the incidence of suicidal ideation was similar between placebo groups and rimonabant with only one completed suicide. However, in ongoing studies 6 additional cases of completed suicide have been reported out of which 5 cases were treated with rimonabant. This is a serious safety concern.

The post-marketing experience confirms the safety profile of rimonabant already observed in clinical trials,  with  the  cases  being  mostly  from  psychiatric  origin  and  also  indicating  an  increased  risk  of aggressiveness which was not seen in clinical trials.

According  to  prescription  surveys,  a  high  adherence  is  noted  for  the  respect  of  the  indication. However, the  adherence  to  warnings  and  contraindications  may  be  considerably  lower  considering that concomitant use of antidepressants in patients prescribed Acomplia is still 6-20 %. This represents a safety concern.

## Benefit/Risk Balance

The efficacy of rimonabant as a weight-reducing agent can be considered as moderate.  The beneficial effects  on  cardiovascular  risk  factors  may  be  of  limited  importance  considering  the  reported  short duration of use. No new subgroups with an expected increased benefit of rimonabant treatment have been  identified  and  patients  at  an  elevated  risk  of  developing  psychiatric  disorders  could  not  be identified  either.    The  expected  benefits  are  considered  as  more  limited  compared  to  what  was foreseen at the time of approval.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The safety profile for rimonabant with a 1.5- 2 fold increased risk of psychiatric disorders, has been shown  to  translate  into  high  absolute  risks  in  real  life  situations,  especially  in  patients  with comorbidities  and  patients  with  previous  history  of  psychiatric  disease.    The  absolute  risk  of psychiatric adverse event in clinical practice may be more common compared to what was seen at the time of approval. In addition, the suicide cases reported in the ongoing clinical trials are of concern. Overall Conclusion Based on the reported short duration of use, and the fact that no subgroups with an expected increased benefit has been identified, it is concluded that the clinical benefit of the treatment with rimonabant are less pronounced compared to the time of approval. Given the generally short duration of treatment the evidence of clinical benefit in the prevention of cardiovascular disease is also lacking. Based on the higher absolute risks of psychiatric adverse event in clinical practice and the limited impact  of  risk  minimisation  activities,  the  risks  of  psychiatric  adverse  events  such  as  depressions, anxiety, sleep disorders and aggressive behaviour are considered as more serious concern compared to the time of approval. It  is  unlikely  that  additional  measures  to  reduce  exposure  of  patients  most  at  risk  of  psychiatric reactions will lead to a favourable balance of risk and benefit because the patients at highest risk of these reactions, and those that might benefit most from the product, cannot reliably be identified. Taken this into account, the benefit/risk balance for rimonabant is considered as negative. GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION PRESENTED BY THE EMEA The Committee reviewed all available information on the benefits and risks of Acomplia including all studies that have been completed and post-marketing data available. The Committee considered that in clinical studies in which the patients were treated for more than a year, the weight reducing effect of Acomplia was moderate and of clinical relevance for 20-30 % of the treated patients as reflected by the 10 % responder rate. The Committee considered that Acomplia also has moderate beneficial effects on HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and HbA1c. However, since available data indicate that patients only take Acomplia for short periods, there is currently no evidence of Acomplia preventing cardiovascular disease.

The Committee considered that the new data from clinical studies and post-marketing reports showed that  in  clinical  practice  the  psychiatric  disorders  such  as  depressions,  anxiety,  sleep  disorders  and aggressive  behaviour  are  more  common  compared  to  what  was  seen  at  the  time  of  approval.  In addition, the suicide cases reported in the ongoing clinical trials are of serious concern.

The  Committee  concluded,  in  view  of  available  data,  that  the  risks  associated  with  the  use  of Acomplia as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of obese or overweight patients with risk

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

factors  such  as  type 2  diabetes  or  dyslipidaemia  outweigh  the  benefits.  In  addition,  the  Committee considered that the current and proposed risk minimisation activities were not adequate to reduce the risks to an acceptable level or predict which patients may be at risk.

The Committee, as a consequence, concluded that the benefit/risk balance of Acomplia is not positive under normal conditions of use.

The CHMP has therefore recommended the suspension of the Marketing Authorisation for Acomplia.

The CHMP also recommended that provisional measures are needed and therefore recommends to the European Commission that the marketing of Acomplia be suspended in all concerned EU Member States awaiting the adoption of the Commission Decision.
