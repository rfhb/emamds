## 1. Introduction

Duloxetine  is  classified  as  a  serotonin  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI).  It  is  a  selective inhibitor of both serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) receptors. Both 5-HT and NE have been implicated in the mediation of endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms via the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord.

Duloxetine is currently approved under the trade name Cymbalta/Xeristar for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) in adults and under the trade name Yentreve/Ariclaim for the diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) in adults and the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI).

This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indication for Xeristar to include the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). 2. Non Clinical Aspects Environmental risk assessment (ERA) Based on the updated Environmental Risk Assessment and the study reports submitted by the MAH the  CHMP  asked  the  MAH  to  update  the  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration  in  surface  water (PECsurface  water)  refinement  since  there  were  two  basic  concerns:  1.  The  No  Observable  Effect Concentration (NOEC) in the algae toxicity study and 2. The refinement of the PEC surface water  based on binding of duloxetine to sludge solids. In reply to CHMP concerns, the MAH concluded that using a lowered algae NOEC (4.3 µg/L) and a lowered predicted binding to sludge, the risk quotient for surface water is unfavourable.  Therefore the MAH proposed to refine the PEC surface water  using sales forecasts and metabolism as allowed by the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use and then use this PEC surface water  to recalculate the risk quotient. A further commitment is made by the MAH to provide a revised Duloxetine ERA no later than the end of June. 3. Clinical Aspects GCP aspects According to the MAH all studies were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki. 3.1 Clinical efficacy Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The  clinical  plan  for  the  efficacy  of  duloxetine  in  the  treatment  of  GAD  includes  four  placebocontrolled short-term studies, ( Study HMBR, Study HMDT, Study HMDU, and Study HMDW) , and one long-term placebo-controlled relapse prevention study (Study HMDV) . Table 1 summarizes all the studies.

## Short-term efficacy

## Design of short-term studies

All studies started with a 3-30 days screening phase followed by a one week placebo run-in in two studies (HMBR and HMDT). Eligible patients were randomised to 9-10 weeks treatment with one or two dosage groups of duloxetine or placebo. Two studies (HMDU and HMDW) also had an active control (venlafaxine).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy measurements The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  reduction  of  the  baseline  Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale (HAMA).  The  secondary  variables  included  HAMA  factor  scores,  percentage  of  patients  with sustained  improvement  (&gt;30%  reduction  in  total  HAMA  score  at  a  visit  prior  to  the  final  visit sustained  through  the  final  visit),  percentage  responders  (&gt;50%  reduction  in  total  HAMA  score), percentage  of  patients  in  remission  (HAMA&lt;7)  and  Clinical  and  Patient  Global  Impression  of Improvement  (CGI-I  and  PGI-I,  respectively).  Health  outcome  and  Quality  of  Life  were  evaluated with Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) and Euro-QoL - 5 Dimension (EQ-5D). Somatic symptoms were measured with a visual analogue scale for pain and Symptom Questionnaire-Somatic subscale (SQ-SS) in two studies (HMBR and HMDT). Short-term efficacy results Table  2.

Study HMBR In study HMBR fixed doses were used and, taking into account all the CI, better results were achieved in comparison with the other Acute Placebo-Controlled Studies. Both used doses (60mg and 120 mg) showed  significant  improvement  compared  with  placebo  for  primary  and  secondary  outcome measures.  Results  were  similar  between  doses  with  no  statistically  significant  differences  between them. Study HMDT Patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg QD (Once Daily) showed significant improvement compared with  placebo-treated  patients  as  measured  by  the  primary  efficacy  measure  HAMA  total score  (p=0.23).  Results  were  closer  to  placebo  in  comparison  with  the  results  achieved  in  study HMBR, the mean change was over placebo (-2.67) but still significant (-4.48,-0.86). Study HMDU In  study  HMDU,  patients  randomized  to  duloxetine  60  mg  to  120  mg  QD  showed  significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients as measured by the primary efficacy measure, HAMA  total  score.  Venlafaxine  was  also  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  and  also experienced a mean decrease of more than 2 points greater than that of placebo. Nevertheless, in terms of  responder  rate  and  remission  rate,  the  differences  compared  to  placebo  did  not  reach  statistical significance, in contrast to venlafaxine. Most secondary outcome measures including: SDS Global Functional Improvement score, the HAMA psychic anxiety factor score, the HADS anxiety subscale score, the CGI-Improvement and the PGIImprovement  and  Q-LES-Q-SF  showed  statistically  greater  improvements  for  duloxetine  and venlafaxine treated patients. Some other secondary outcome did not achieve statistically significantly results (HAMA somatic anxiety factor score). Study HMDW Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Study HMDW included a fixed dose for duloxetine (20 mg), a variable dose (60 to 120 mg) and a variable  dose  also  for  venlafaxine  (75  to  225  mg).  All  these  treatment  groups  obtained  significant improvement  in  improving  symptoms  of  anxiety  as  measured  by  the  primary  efficacy  variable (HAMA total score) and for practically all secondary efficacy outcomes. The 20 mg dose obtained results were not much different than for 60 mg or 120 mg in other studies (HMBR, HMDL, HMDU); however the minimum dose proposed is 60 mg.

## Combination of Study HMDU and HMDW

Data from study HMDU and Study HMDW were combined to ensure adequate power for comparison between duloxetine and venlafaxine. PP analyses showed that the lower bound of the interval of mean change in HAMA total score (DLX60-120 minus VEN75-225) exceeded the non-inferiority margin of -1.5 defined by the external expert consensus panel. The ITT analysis showed a lower bound which did not exceed the non-inferiority margin.

A significant effect was seen in Caucasians but not in patients of other origin. Eighty percent of the patients were Caucasians.

Special patient populations and subgroup analyses Children and adolescents No data have been provided for children and adolescents. Elderly In  a  subgroup  analysis  the  effect  was  similar  in  patients  above  and  below  55  years  of  age. Nevertheless, efficacy and safety data of duloxetine when treating the elderly are limited. Gender Females constitute 63% of the total study population. Overall the effect seemed more pronounced in males compared to females (as shown in Table 7). In particular, the 20 mg dose seemed to be less effective in females. Furthermore, in study HMDU there was a gender-by-treatment interaction with no significant effect in females. The difference in change in total HAMA score versus placebo was 0.52 (p=0.680) in females compared to -5.84 (p&lt;0.001) in males. Table 7.  Gender specific results in short-term studies.

## Severity

The effect was more pronounced in patients with higher baseline HAMA score.

## Effects on pain

The effects on pain were mixed. In one out of two studies a significant effect on pain was observed with  VAS-ratings.  In  neither  of  the  studies  an  effect  on  somatic  symptoms  measured  with  SQ-SS could be seen.

## Long-term-efficacy

## Study HMDV

## Design

Study HMDV was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled relapse prevention study, with  an  open-label,  flexible  dose  acute  therapy  phase  (6  months)  and  double-blind  continuation therapy phase (6 months).

Treatment started with duloxetine 30 mg which was increased to 60 mg after one week. Patients not tolerating 60 mg were withdrawn. The maintenance dose could be adjusted in steps between 60 and 120 mg until week 16 and after randomisation of responders between week 22 and 24 the duloxetine dose was down-titrated during two weeks in the placebo group. The randomised treatment continued for  26  weeks  or  until  relapse.  Patients  and  investigators  were  not  aware  of  the  exact  time  of randomisation. Responder was defined as a decrease from baseline in HAMA total score by at least 50% to a score not higher than 11 and a CGI-Improvement score &lt;2 (much or very much improved) for at least two consecutive visits. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score by at least 2  points  to  a  score  &gt;  4  and  a  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  diagnosis  of  GAD  or discontinuation due to lack of effect.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the long-term maintenance of efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg QD compared with placebo by a comparison of the time to relapse among patients with GAD who responded to duloxetine during the open-label acute therapy phase after 6 months. Patients Male and female patients at least 18 years of age fulfilling the DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD with no major depressive disorder and a CGI-Severity score of at least 4 were included in an open label phase. Efficacy measures In  Study  HMDV,  the  primary  measure  was  Time  to  Relapse using  CGI-Severity  and  the  Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Long-term efficacy results Study HMDV provides substantial evidence that duloxetine at flexible doses of 60 mg to 120 mg QD was efficacious for long-term treatment of GAD and significantly reduced the risk of relapse. The 3-fold higher relapse rate of placebo-treated patients (compared with duloxetine-treated patients) during the continuation phase indicates the need for ongoing treatment for patients with GAD. Eight hundred and eighty-seven patients entered the open label phase and 429 were randomised. Time to relapse was significantly prolonged in the duloxetine group (p&lt;0.001). After 26 weeks of doubleblind treatment the relapse rate was 13.7 and 41.8% in the duloxetine and placebo group, respectively. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The MAH commented that efficacy of duloxetine can be clearly identified following treatment for a period of 1-2 weeks in all of the short term GAD studies. Given these data, it was acceptable for the MAH to balance the efficacy at a lower dose for some patients with a risk of inadequate treatment for others by recommending a lower initial dose while providing prescribers with an expected timeframe for therapeutic response to ensure that patients do not remain on an ineffective lower dose indefinitely. The lowest dose where efficacy was showed was 20 mg QD, and a significant number of patients in the clinical program received 30 mg QD as their initial starting dose. Therefore, the lowest initial dose proposed  by  the  MAH  was  either  20  mg  or  30  mg.  Nevertheless,  the  MAH  considered  that  those patients with GAD suffering co-morbid depression, need an adequate treatment for their depressive symptoms and taking into account that duloxetine 60 mg is the lowest effective dose specified in the SPC for major depressive disorder, it was proposed to also apply this dose to GAD patients with comorbid MDD.

CHMP Assessment of Efficacy data Initial recommended dose The CHMP suggested that the recommended dose 60 mg QD needs further substantiation. Considering the similar effect observed with 20 mg QD and 60-120 mg in Study HMDW and the overall tendency of less adverse events on 20 mg, a lower starting dose might be useful for males and also for females. The CHMP concluded that the observed results indicate that lower doses could achieve good efficacy results  at  least  for  some  groups  of  patients.  The  20  mg  dose  has  clearly  shown  global  statistically significant  efficacy  results  as  primary  variable,  secondary  variables,  percentage  of  patients  with sustained improvement, percentage of responders, and percentage of patients in remission, similar to those  obtained  for  60-120  mg  dose.  The  frequency  of  lack  of  efficacy  as  reason  for  study discontinuation  was  similar  between  both  strengths  (20mg:  n=2  (2.4%);  60-120mg:  n=3  (1.9%)) meanwhile the study discontinuation due to adverse events was superior for patients treated with 60120 mg regimen in comparison with those treated with 20 mg (n=21; 13.3% vs n=4 ; 4.8%). The CHMP agreed with the MAH that in the analysis, some subgroups have shown significant results for 60-120 mg and not for 20 mg. Therefore, 60 mg could be considered as the lower starting dose in accordance with the available data. The MAH admitted that there is evidence for the efficacy of a 20 mg dose in some GAD patients from the clinical program, and that patients treated with lower doses of duloxetine may experience a lower incidence  of  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  than  those  treated  with  60-120  mg  once  daily (QD).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP pointed out that taking into account the favourable efficacy data obtained for lower doses, the MAH's recommendation for a 30 mg initial dose is considered acceptable. The CHMP suggested that the 20 mg dose is not needed since considering the closeness to the 30 mg strength and also the known large inter-individual variability in duloxetine plasma levels, clinical differences are unlikely to be detectable with a 30 mg dosing form. Furthermore, adding a 20 mg dosage to the existing 30 and 60 mg  is  unlikely  to  add  anything  but  potential  confusion  to  prescribers  and  patients.  Therefore  the CHMP suggested that the recommended starting dose in patients with GAD should be only the 30 mg one.

## Justification of dose escalation

The CHMP pointed out that the proposed dose escalation of duloxetine in GAD does not mimic the one used in active comparator clinical trials with optional titration. This more flexible approach is also used by other drugs indicated for GAD. The CHMP requested the MAH to further justify the rational for the two step dose recommendation in the SPC (60 mg up to 120 mg). In reply to the CHMP concern, the MAH mentioned that the method of dose escalation for patients taking duloxetine in the active comparator trials was consistent with the dosing method that was used for patients taking venlafaxine in these studies.  Venlafaxine was titrated from 75 mg to 150 mg to 225 mg  and  duloxetine  was  titrated  from  60mg  to  90  mg  to  120  mg.    Although  this  method  of  dose escalation  was  used  in  these  studies,  data  from  Study  HMBR,  as  well  as  from  MDD  and  diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) studies of duloxetine show that patients can titrate from 60  mg to 120 mg without employing the intermediate 90 mg dose. The MAH commented that at the conclusion of the flexible dose studies, the majority of patients who completed the study were taking a dose higher than 60 mg QD at endpoint (mean final duloxetine dose:    103.32 mg QD).    60%  of  responders  demonstrated  efficacy  with  duloxetine  120 mg QD  and 25% demonstrated efficacy with duloxetine 90 mg QD for the duration of this study and considered that  duloxetine 90  mg  QD can be effective for some GAD patients. Therefore, the MAH proposed titration from 60 mg QD up to 120 mg QD, based on the clinical judgment of the physician. The CHMP concluded that the dose escalation method used in the clinical trials provided data which indicate the inter-individual variability in the response. Approximately 15% were not eligible for dose escalation during the clinical trials, approximately 30% increased their dose to Duloxetine 90 mg QD and approximately 55% increased their dose to Duloxetine 120 mg QD.  Therefore intermediate doses between  60  mg  and  120  mg  are  considered  effective  for  some  GAD  patients  and  this  should  be reflected in the SPC. The CHMP considered that since MAH had indicated this issue in the SPC, it was resolved. Gender specific analyses The CHMP concluded that due to an overall lower effect in females and one study with almost no effect  in  females  it  is  questionable  whether  a  clinically  relevant  effect  in  this  dominating  group  of GAD  patients has been convincingly demonstrated. Gender-specific analyses of sustained improvement,  responder  and  remission  rates  in  pooled  analyses  of  all  short-term  studies  were  also requested by CHMP. In these analyses discontinuing patients should be counted as failures. The data submitted by the MAH are summarised in the table below: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

This issue was, however, considered by the CHMP to have been addressed satisfactorily. Exclusion of patients from study The CHMP commented that patients were excluded from the study if patients were diagnosed with MDD  within  the  past  6  months.  All  enrolled  patients  should  not  have  any  items&gt;3  of  Raskin Depression  Scale  (RDS).  HADS  Depression  subscale  was  conducted  at  baseline  (with  a  score variation from 0 to 21 points). The CHMP suggested that considering that Duloxetine could achieve good responses with depressive patients, measured at baseline of HAMD17 scale would have been of great interest. The  MAH  explained  that  the  exclusion  criteria  (DSM-IV  criteria)  used  in  these  clinical  trials, excluding  patients  with  a  current  or  recent  history  of  major  depression  (within  6  months  of  study entry)  are  in  accordance  with  CHMP  Guidance  (CPMP/EWP/4284/02).  The  RDS  and  the  HADS depression subscale, helped to assess the depressive symptoms. The CHMP considered this concern to have been addressed. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The CHMP suggested that the MAH should indicate in the SPC the limitation of the data base for the elderly  and  should  further  explore  this  population  group.  The  MAH  agreed  to  perform  a  study assessing the safety and efficacy of duloxetine in elderly patients with GAD and to submit a draft of the prospective study by Q4 2008. The SPC has been revised regarding the use in the elderly with GAD. The CHMP considered that the MAH had convincingly addressed this concern, which was thus resolved. Explanation of the use of the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method Alternative analyses where all discontinuing patients are counted as non-responders for the acute GAD studies were also considered to be needed by the CHMP. As  requested,  analyses  of  response,  remission,  and  sustained  response  counting  all  discontinuing patients  as  non-responders  (BOCF  (Baseline  Observation  Carried  Forward)  analysis)  for  the  acute GAD studies, are presented below by study and as pooled data (Table 9).

Acute GAD Studies Pooled Data d Abbreviations:  BOCF = baseline observation carried forward; DLX = duloxetine; GAD = generalized anxiety disorder; LOCF = last observation carried forward; PLA = placebo; VEN = venlafaxine extended release. a Remission rate: HAMA total score of ≤ 7 at endpoint. b Response rate: 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the HAMA endpoint total score. c Sustained Improvement:  at least a 30% improvement (reduction) on the HAMA total score from baseline to endpoint, at an earlier visit prior to the last visit of the study period, and at all visits in between. d The pooled duloxetine data does not include patients who were randomized to duloxetine 20 mg QD. *p ≤ .05 **p ≤ .01 ***p ≤ .001 The  BOCF-results  are  consistent  with  the  initially  reported  LOCF-results.  Thus  it  has  been  made plausible that the LOCF-results are not biased due to the differential withdrawal pattern. The CHMP considered this concern to have been addressed.

## 3.2 Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

A total of 1797 subjects (shown in the Table 10 as Primary overall duloxetine exposures), representing approximately 570 patient-years of exposure were treated with duloxetine for GAD. A total of 1228 patients (162 patient-years) received short-term treatment and 1094 (879 open label therapy phase and 215 double-blind continuation phase) patients (419 patient-years) received long-term treatment (up 1 year) with duloxetine.

## Method of analyses

The integrated  safety  data  of  duloxetine  in  the  treatment  of  GAD  was  classified  into  four  primary analyses sets based on study design: a. The  primary  acute  placebo-controlled  analyses  set  includes  data  on  GAD  placebo-controlled studies (HMBR, HMDT, HMDU and HMDW) with up to 10 weeks treatment in which most subjects were randomly assigned to doses of 60 mg to 120 mg daily throughout the trial. b. The primary active-comparator-controlled analysis set includes data on GAD, using venlafaxine as active comparator (Study HMDU and Study HMDW). c. The primary long-term analyses set includes data from the long-term relapse-prevention study (HMDV) of 6 months open-label and 6 months double-blind in which subjects were treated with duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg  daily. d. The primary overall duloxetine analyses set includes data from patients treated with duloxetine in  all  GAD  studies  (Study  HMBR,  Study  HMDU,  Study  HMDT,  Study  HMDV  and  Study HMDW). Two additional analyses set covering all indications were included for comparisons: e. the all placebo-controlled analyses set with data from all placebo-controlled duloxetine studies for all indications (Fibromyalgia (FM), Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain  (DPNP), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Lower Urinary Tract Disorder (LUTD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and f. the overall duloxetine exposures analyses set with duloxetine data coming from all completed studies, all indications as of the data cut-off date of 12 May 2007. CHMP assessment of Safety Data According  to  the  findings  identified  during  the  continuous  safety  assessment  of  duloxetine  in  its different indications the following key events were closely monitored: a) Suicidality: A total of eight suicide ideations were reported in GAD studies, four of them in the open-label long term study. There was 1 case of self-injurious behaviour in the primary acute placebo-controlled  analyses  set  and  2  reports  of  suicide  attempts  in  Study  HMDV.  One duloxetine-  treated  patient  died  due  to  completed  suicide  in  the  open-label  phase  of  study HMDV. These  findings  indicate  that  the  concerns  about  suicidal  behaviour  associated  with duloxetine remain. This issue is considered in the pharmacovigilance activities for duloxetine and reflected in the SPC. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- b) Hepatic risk: Duloxetine treated patients involved in GAD studies showed greater increases of AST and alkaline phosphatase. No significant dose relationship was observed. No new hepatic safety concerns regarding duloxetine were observed. This issue is considered in the pharmacovigilance activities for duloxetine and reflected in the SPC.
- c) Duloxetine  did  not  appear  to  adversely  affect  glycaemic  control  or  lipid  profiles  in  GAD patients.

## Incidence of adverse events with higher doses

The CHMP asked the MAH to provide adverse events frequencies distribution observed for 60 mg treated patients in comparison to 120 mg treated patients for all aggregated studies.

The data submitted by the MAH are summarised below:

| longer   |
|----------|

<!-- image -->

The  MAH  commented  in  their  response  that  study  HMDU  and  study  HMDW  (placebo  versus duloxetine  versus  venlafaxine)  showed  that  both  duloxetine  and  venlafaxine  are  associated  with  a significantly higher frequency of TEAEs compared with placebo, but that overall the adverse event profile of the two drugs was very similar, both across the large majority of commonly reported TEAEs and  for  all  TEAEs  combined.  No  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  for  all  TEAEs combined (duloxetine 73.8%; venlafaxine 76.6%), and of the most frequently reported TEAEs, half were more  frequently reported with duloxetine (nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, somnolence, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis) and half were more frequently reported with venlafaxine (headache, dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, insomnia, vomiting). While nausea (26.9 versus 20.1), diarrhoea (11.3 versus 6.0%) and nasopharingitis (4.1% versus 1.5%) were reported statistically more frequently with

The submitted data showed that patients  who  were up-titrated to 120  mg  QD  did  not experience  a significantly  higher  frequency  of  TEAEs  (Treatment  Emergent  Adverse  Events)  compared  with patients who stayed on 60 mg QD, although the incidence of the majority of the events experienced were numerically higher for the 120 mg treatment group. The CHMP considered this issue to have been resolved. Comparison of Venlafaxine and Duloxetine safety profiles Another issue of concern for CHMP was the difference in incidence of serotoninergic adverse events between duloxetine and venlafaxine. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

duloxetine compared with venlafaxine, it is of note that the rates of diarrhoea and nasopharingitis were in fact higher for placebo than for venlafaxine.

Nausea and diarrhoea are both listed in the current SPC and are reported with their incidence ('very common'  and  'common  even',  respectively)  that  properly  reflects  the  safety  experience  with duloxetine in clinical trials for all indications combined.

In  summary,  the  MAH  considered  that  the  adverse  event  profile  of  the  two  drugs  appears  similar, across  the  large  majority  of  commonly  reported  TEAEs,  for  all  TEAEs  combined,  and  also  for serotoninergic adverse events.

The CHMP considered this issue to have been resolved.

Age differences in the safety profile The CHMP asked the MAH to further analyse the applicability of the safety data available from the overall safety data of duloxetine in the elderly patients. In  reply  to  CHMP request the MAH provided an analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events by demographic subgroup in patients treated for GAD. The data show that while placebo-treated patients aged ≥ 55 years old reported more TEAEs than placebo-treated patients aged &lt;55 years, such relation with age is not seen in duloxetine treated patients. A similar finding is observed for patients aged &lt;65 years and ≥ 65 years. Moreover, the MAH commented that older patients with GAD treated with duloxetine did not report more TEAEs than younger patients and considering the total exposure to date it could be concluded that the safety profile is similar across different indications. The MAH summarized the main safety conclusions as follows: · The safety profile in elderly and very elderly patients is similar to the overall duloxetine safety profile. · The  pattern  of  deaths  and  SAEs  does  not  appear  to  be  related  to  duloxetine  therapy  with increasing age. · The relationship of duloxetine to TEAEs increases or decreases with age depending on the type of TEAEs analyzed. · There is no age-related pattern to the effects of duloxetine on vital signs, laboratory measures, or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. The MAH concluded that the elderly and very elderly patients are well represented and characterized in  the  overall  duloxetine  database. Taking into account that there is no excess of TEAEs in elderly GAD patients treated with duloxetine compared with younger GAD patients, and the safety profile in this subgroup of patients is similar to the overall duloxetine safety profile, the MAH considered that it would not be appropriate to restrict the use of duloxetine in elderly patients with GAD. However the MAH agreed that data on duloxetine 120 mg QD are limited in this population and dose increases to 120 mg QD in the elderly or very elderly should be made with caution.

The CHMP considered the MAH response acceptable. There is no special reason to conclude that the elderly  and  very  elderly  patients  will  have  a  different  safety  profile  to  that  already  known  for  this group of population in other indications. However, considering that data on elderly GAD patients are limited  a  special  warning  for  physicians  has  been  included  in  the  SPC.  In  addition,  a  further commitment is made by the MAH to submit a draft of a prospective study assessing the safety and efficacy on duloxetine in elderly patients with GAD by Q4 2008.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancies

A further issue of concern for the CHMP was the relationship between duloxetine and miscarriage or abnormalities. Based on the data submitted by the MAH, a total of 77 pregnancies possibly exposed to duloxetine  have  been  reported  during  clinical  development  of  the  product.  At  least  27%  of  the pregnancies with known outcomes resulted in an unexpected or undesirable result (ectopic pregnancy, abortion, preterm delivery with fetal demise, congenital abnormalities).

The MAH argued that a relationship between duloxetine and miscarriage or abnormalities cannot be ruled  out  at  this  point.    For  this  reason,  the  MAH  pointed  out  that  the  current  SPC  wording  on pregnancy appropriately warns the prescribing physician of the need to carefully balance the benefit versus the potential risk before exposing a pregnant woman to duloxetine. The CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposal and the issue has been resolved.

Suicidality The CHMP commented that although suicidality is a key aspect of the pharmacovigilance program and  RMP (Risk  Management  Plan)  for  duloxetine  in  its  different  indications  (psychiatric  and  nonpsychiatric), no specific actions are proposed for the GAD indication. In reply to CHMP concern, the MAH pointed out that psychiatrists are well informed about the role of depression  and  SSRI/SNRI  treatment  in  relation  to  the  risk  of  suicidability,  and  the  suicide-related events experienced by GAD patients could be properly identified and reported by these physicians. The CHMP considered this issue to have been resolved. Withdrawal symptoms The CHMP asked the MAH to provide comparative data on the withdrawal signs when the treatment is stopped in GAD as compared to those observed in the depression indication (frequency, nature of events, effect of tapering). The MAH has provided the following comparative data on the withdrawal signs when the treatment is stopped abruptly or tapered in GAD patients and in MDD patients.

Changes to the Product Information In addition to the above-described concerns, a number of other aspects relating to the SPC wording proposed by the MAH were identified as issues by the CHMP during this procedure. In section 4.2 of the SPC the following wording included in order to consider the 30 mg as the initial dose (new text: bold) Generalised Anxiety Disorder The recommended starting dose in patients with Generalised Anxiety Disorder is 30 mg once daily with or without food. In patients with insufficient response the dose should be increased to 60 mg, which is the usual maintenance dose in most patients. In patients with co-morbid Major Depressive Episodes, the starting and maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily (please see also dosing recommendation above). Doses up to 120 mg per day have been shown to be efficacious and have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials. In patients with insufficient response to 60 mg, escalation up to 90 mg or 120 mg may therefore be considered. Dose escalation should be based upon clinical response and tolerability. After consolidation of the response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in order to avoid relapse. In section 4.4 of the SPC a special warning was included regarding the limited data on elderly GAD patients. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 5. Elderly

Major  Depressive  Episodes:  Data  on  the  use  of  XERISTAR  120mg  in  elderly  patients  with  major depressive disorders are limited. Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly with the maximum dosage (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Generalised Anxiety Disorder: Data on the use of XERISTAR in elderly patients with generalised anxiety disorder are limited.

The  MAH  submitted  revised  product  information  (sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SPC  and sections 1, 3 and 4 of the PL), in accordance with the requests from the CHMP.

## 6. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

The application to extend the indication for Xeristar (Duloxetine) to treatment of generalised anxiety disorder was evaluated by the CHMP.

An overall  effect  of  duloxetine  was  demonstrated  in  the  submitted  short-term  and  long-term  GAD studies;  however  some  efficacy  concerns  were  raised  mainly  with  regard  to  initial  dose  and  to  the remaining gender-specific analyses.

With regard to the initial dose, the MAH was req  uested  to  further  sustain  the  proposed  starting  dose (60 mg) as the observed results with lower doses indicate that it can be effective at least for some group of patients. In the responses, the MAH proposed a revised SPC wording considering 20 or 30 mg as initial doses. However, the 20 mg pharmaceutical form is not authorized, and considering the closeness  to  the  30  mg  strength  and  also  the  known  large  inter-individual  variability  in  duloxetine plasma levels, clinical differences are unlikely to be detectable. This issue has been addressed since section 4.2 of the SPC reflects the 30 mg as the initial dose. The  second  major  concern  was  related  to  the  fact  that  the  MAH  had  not  submitted  the  requested gender-specific analyses of sustained improvement, responder and remission rates in pooled analyses of  all  short-term  studies,  counting  all  discontinuing  patients  as  failures.  These  analyses  were considered important in order to explore  possible  gender  differences,  moreover  taking  into  account that GAD is shown to be more common in women than in men. The analyses were presented by the MAH and the submitted data show no indications of gender differences. The  MAH  was  also  requested  to  submit  alternative  analyses  to  the  LOCF  approach  used  in  the analysis  of  responder,  remission  and  sustained  responses  data to  count  all  discontinuing  patients  as non-responders. Data provided show that the BOCF-results are consistent with the initially reported LOCF-results. The MAH has also agreed to perform a study assessing the efficacy and safety of elderly patients in the proposed indication (draft of a prospective study will be given by Q4 2008). In  conclusion,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  duloxetine  in  the  treatment  of  GAD  can  be  considered positive. 7. Conclusion On 26 June 2008 the  CHMP considered this Type II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.
