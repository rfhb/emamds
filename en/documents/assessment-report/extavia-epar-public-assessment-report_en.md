## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Extavia has the same composition and the same pharmaceutical form as Betaferon, 250 microgram/ml, powder and solvent for solution for injection, which has been marketed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG since  1995  (Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  number  EU/1/95/003/003-006  in  November  1995). The last renewal date of Betaferon was 31 January 2006.  A variation procedure EMEA/H/C/81/II/48, which started in June 2007, relates to the inclusion of results from a 3-year integrated analysis and first year of follow-up of an ongoing clinical study in patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis.  A positive opinion was issued on 15 November 2007; changes to the SPC resulting from this variation have been reflected in the SPC of Extavia in order to harmonise the SPCs of both products.

The Pharmacovigilance System as described by the Applicant fulfils the requirements and provides adequate  evidence  that  the  Applicant  has  the  services of a qualified person  responsible  for Pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  collection  and  notification  of  any  adverse reaction suspected of occurring in the Community or in a third country.  Furthermore, the Applicant has satisfactorily addressed the issues raised by the CHMP in December 2007.

On  13  September  2007,  Bayer  Schering  Pharma  AG  has  acquired  from  Novartis  Vaccines  and Diagnostics  Inc.  the  biologics  manufacturing  facility  used  to  produce  Betaferon  and  agreed  to manufacture Extavia for Novartis. 2.2 Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent application of the Betaferon application, the quality data in support of Extavia application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the  Betaferon dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). Like Betaferon, Extavia is supplied as a vial with powder and either a 1.2 ml pre-filled syringe with 1.2 ml solvent or a 2.25 ml pre-filled syringe with 1.2 ml solvent and a vial adapter with needle. Human albumin 12.5 mg is used as an excipient. 2.3 Non clinical aspects In accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC and Guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00, it has been accepted that there was no need to provide an environmental risk assessment, since the active interferon beta-1b is  a  recombinant  equivalent  of  the  antiviral  human  native  cytokine  interferon  beta,  a  naturally occurring  protein.    Moreover,  with  a  maximum  daily  dose  of  250µg,  the  predicted  environmental concentration  in  surface  water  (PECsw)  is  expected  to  be  significantly  below  the  trigger  value  of 10ng/L for a phase II environmental fate and effect analysis. 2.4 Clinical aspects Not applicable. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system Pharmacovigilance System Medicinal product no longer authorised

Risk Management Plan

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In support of the application, a Risk Management Plan- which included a risk minimisation plan- was produced and submitted by Bayer Schering Pharma AG on behalf of Novartis, the Applicant.  The Applicant satisfactorily addressed the issues raised by the CHMP in December 2007 and provided a letter of undertaking with a commitment to the activities outlined in the RMP.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. The CHMP agreed that the PSUR cycle for Extavia will correspond to the one of Betaferon unless otherwise specified. 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Based on the review of the data from Module 1, and the submitted Risk Management Plan, the CHMP considers that the application for Extavia (interferon beta-1b) is approvable. Risk-benefit assessment Medicinal product no longer authorised

Concerning safety and efficacy, as this was an informed consent application, no data were submitted and the risk/benefit balance is the same as for Betaferon.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
- no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

<!-- image -->

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Extavia in the treatment of patients · with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis. · with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and two or more relapses within the last two years. · with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease, evidenced by relapses. was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
