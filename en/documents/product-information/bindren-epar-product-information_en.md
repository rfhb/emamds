ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

BindRen 1 g film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Experience from clinical studies in patients above the age of 75 years is very limited.

Each film-coated tablet contains 1 g colestilan. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated tablet. White, oval shaped, film-coated tablet approximately 20.2 mm in length and 10.7 mm wide printed with 'BINDREN' (in blue ink) on one side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications BindRen is indicated for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended starting dose is 6-9 g per day (2-3 g three times daily). Patients previously on other phosphate binders who are switched to BindRen should start taking 6-9 g per day (2-3 g three times daily). Dose titration Serum phosphorus concentrations should be monitored. If an acceptable serum phosphorus concentration is not achieved, the dose may be increased by 3 g per day (1 g three times daily) in 2-3 weekly intervals. The maximum daily dose of BindRen tested in clinical trials was 15 g per day (5 g three times daily). Special populations Elderly population Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Renal impairment

BindRen is indicated for use in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. No data on the use of BindRen in pre-dialysis patients are available.

## Severe hepatic impairment

Patients with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from clinical studies. Therefore, the use of BindRen is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see also section 4.4). No data are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of BindRen in children and adolescents aged under 18 years has not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

BindRen is for oral use. Tablets should be taken whole.

The daily dose of BindRen tablets should be taken in three equally divided doses with or immediately after meals with a sufficient amount of water to aid swallowing.

The division of the daily dose may be adjusted on a physician's advice taking into account the dietary intake of phosphate. Patients should be encouraged to adhere to their prescribed low phosphate diets.

Treatment of high blood phosphorus levels usually requires long-term treatment.

Patients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. BindRen does not contain calcium, and has no effect on serum calcium concentrations on treatment for up to one year. Serum calcium concentrations should be monitored as a normal follow-up of a dialysis patient. Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of hypocalcaemia.

4.3 Contraindications · Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. · Bowel obstruction. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The safety and efficacy of BindRen has not been studied in patients with: · Dysphagia or swallowing disorders · Severe gastrointestinal disorders such as chronic or severe constipation, intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, gastrointestinal ulcers, or recent major gastrointestinal surgery · Biliary obstruction · Severe hepatic impairment (see also section 4.2) · Seizure disorders · Recent history of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients · Serum albumin &lt;30 g/L Therefore, the use of BindRen is not recommended in patients with these disorders. Hyperparathyroidism BindRen alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment with BindRen. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with BindRen. In patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms, alternative treatment may need to be considered. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage Caution should be exercised when treating patients with conditions which predispose to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, such as recent history of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulcers, gastritis, diverticulosis, colitis and haemorrhoids. Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Fat-soluble vitamins

BindRen did not induce any clinically relevant reduction in the absorption of vitamins A, D, E or K during clinical studies of up to one year. However, caution should be exercised when treating patients with a susceptibility to vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, such as patients with malabsorption syndromes and patients treated with coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin). In these patients, monitoring of vitamin A, D and E concentrations or assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of coagulation parameters is recommended and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Folate deficiency

BindRen did not induce a clinically relevant reduction in folate absorption during clinical studies of up to one year. However, intestinal folate absorption may be impaired during long-term treatment of BindRen. In these patients, monitoring serum folate status and supplementation with folic acid should be considered.

## Hypothyroidism

Close monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism is recommended when levothyroxine is co-administered with BindRen (see section 4.5).

## Systemic ion balance

BindRen binds phosphate and bile acid, with the release of chloride which is available for systemic absorption. Changes in systemic ion balance with an increase in chloride and decrease in bicarbonate are therefore possible. However, BindRen did not induce any clinically relevant change in chloride and bicarbonate on treatment for up to one year. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction BindRen is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but may affect the bioavailability or absorption rate of other medicinal products. In addition, reduced bioavailability of other medicinal products by changes in enterohepatic circulation, for example, steroid hormones with potential impairment of  the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, have been reported for medicinal products with a similar mechanism of action to BindRen. When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically relevant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least 1 hour before, or 3 hours after taking BindRen. Concomitant treatment with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic window requires close monitoring of drug concentrations or adverse reactions, on initiation or dose-adjustment of either BindRen or the concomitant medicinal product. Interaction studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers. Interactions have not been studied at doses &gt;9 g daily, and greater interaction effects at higher doses of BindRen cannot be excluded. Single dose interaction studies demonstrated that the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin, warfarin and enalapril were not affected when co-administered with BindRen (6-9 g/day). BindRen lowered the bioavailability of digoxin by 16% and Cmax by 17%, and the Cmax of enalapril by 27%. Due to the high in vitro binding potential between BindRen and levothyroxine, closer monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in patients receiving BindRen and levothyroxine is recommended. No in vivo data are available on the possible interaction of BindRen on the absorption of the immunosuppressant  medicinal products mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin or tacrolimus. However, decreased blood concentrations have been reported for medicinal products with a similar mechanism of action to BindRen. Caution should be exercised when prescribing BindRen to patients receiving immunosuppressants. Patients with seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials with BindRen. Caution should be exercised when prescribing BindRen to patients also taking anti-seizure medicinal products. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

BindRen is not absorbed and is not systemically available. No direct effects of BindRen are thus anticipated. However, other effects of BindRen may affect pregnant and breast-feeding women or influence fertility, see sections 4.4 and 4.5.

## Pregnancy

No data are available to assess the safety and efficacy in pregnant women.

Patients that become pregnant and where a benefit/risk assessment confirms continued treatment with BindRen, supplementation of vitamins may be required, see section 4.4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

No data are available to assess the safety and efficacy in breast-feeding women.

Patients that breast-feed and where a benefit/risk assessment confirms continued treatment with BindRen, supplementation of vitamins may be required, see section 4.4.

## Fertility

No data are available to assess the potential influence of BindRen on fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

BindRen has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The Phase II and III clinical studies involving 1,410 patients with CKD Stage 5 on dialysis treated with BindRen for up to one year constituted the safety population. Patients received doses of up to 15 g per day, in three divided doses of 5 g. Approximately 30% of patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. The most serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal haemorrhage (uncommon) and constipation (common). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting (all common). The frequency of adverse reactions increased with dose. Tabulated list of adverse reactions A tabulated list of frequencies was defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are ranked in order of decreasing seriousness. Infections and infestations Uncommon: Gastroenteritis Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Hyperparathyroidism Metabolism and nutrition disorders Common: Hypocalcaemia, decreased appetite Uncommon: Folate deficiency, hypertriglyceridaemia, polydipsia Rare: Vitamin K deficiency, calciphylaxis, electrolyte imbalance, fluid overload Psychiatric disorders Uncommon: Insomnia Nervous system disorders Medicinal product no longer authorised

It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose BindRen has been given to dialysis patients in doses up to 15 g/day for up to one year continuously with no cases of overdose. The potential risk of overdosing could include adverse reactions or a worsening of adverse reactions mentioned in section 4.8. There are no known antidotes to BindRen. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned. ATC code: not yet assigned. Medicinal product no longer authorised

BindRen contains colestilan. Colestilan is a non-absorbed, non-calcium, non-metallic phosphate-binding polymer. The binding sites become partially protonated in the stomach and interact through ionic and hydrogen bonding with both dietary phosphate anions and bile acids in the duodenum. By binding phosphate from food in the digestive tract, colestilan lowers the serum phosphorus concentration. Colestilan also binds bile acids, thereby lowering the serum LDL-cholesterol concentration. Changes in the bile acid pool in the gastrointestinal tract have also been observed to lower serum glucose. Colestilan may also bind uric acid in the gastrointestinal tract.

Three Phase III studies and two long term follow-up studies have been performed in patients with CKD Stage 5 on dialysis, in order to investigate efficacy and safety in this population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serum phosphorus

## Fixed-dose study :

In a double-blind, 12-week fixed-dose study with five colestilan groups (3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day) and placebo, colestilan at 6 g/day and above demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in serum phosphorus level. The least squares mean reduction from baseline to week 12 as compared to placebo was 0.16, 0.21, 0.19 and 0.37 mmol/L at 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day respectively.

## Flexible-dose studies:

Two similar 12-week, open-label, flexible-dose studies followed by a 4-week double-blind withdrawal period (comparison to placebo) were performed. In the first study, the mean serum phosphorus level was 2.33 mmol/L at baseline and 1.96 mmol/L (mean reduction by 0.36 mmol/L) at week 12 on a colestilan mean daily dose of 11.5 g. Similarly in the second study, the mean serum phosphorus level was 2.44 mmol/L at baseline and 1.94 mmol/L at week 12 (mean reduction by 0.50 mmol/L) on a colestilan mean daily dose of 13.1 g. The rate of responders (either a reduction in serum phosphorus ≤ 1.78 mmol/L and/or a reduction from baseline ≥ 0.3 mmol/L) was 50.4 % and 43.8% in the two studies, respectively (placebo 30.8% and 26.3%, respectively).

## Serum uric acid

Long-term studies: Two long-term, open-label, flexible-dose studies demonstrated that serum phosphorus reduction was maintained for up to one year. After one year, the mean serum phosphorus level was 1.89 mmol/L with a significant reduction from baseline of 0.39 mmol/L and responder rate (phosphorus level &lt;1.78 mmol/L) was 44%. A majority of patients received 12 or 15 g/day of colestilan in the long-term studies. Serum calcium In clinical studies, colestilan had no effect on serum calcium levels over a period of up to one year. Serum calcium-phosphorus ion product Calcium-phosphorus ion product was reduced by at least 0.48 mmol 2 /L 2 at week 12 compared to placebo at doses ≥9 g/day in fixed-dose study and by 1.05 and 0.86 mmol 2 /L 2 at week 12 in two flexible-dose studies. Colestilan reduced calcium-phosphorus ion product by 0.90 mmol 2 /L 2 after one year. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) In most clinical studies, colestilan decreased serum PTH compared to baseline, and was statistically significant against placebo. Serum cholesterol Colestilan significantly reduced serum LDL-cholesterol by 17.8, 25.6, 29.4, 34.8 and 33.4% at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day at week 12 compared to placebo in fixed-dose study, respectively. Colestilan also showed significant reductions from baseline by 35.3 and 30.1% at week 12 in two flexible-dose studies, and by 25.8% after one year in long-term studies. The reductions in LDL-cholesterol are also reflected in significant falls in total cholesterol. Serum glycosylated haemoglobin A1c In subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥7.0%, colestilan showed a reduction of between 0.36 to 1.38% at week 12 in the fixed-dose study, and by 0.94 and 0.91% at week 12 in the two flexible-dose studies. After one year of treatment, a reduction of 1.12% in HbA1c was observed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Colestilan was also associated in dose-dependent reduction in serum uric acid, with a mean reduction of 43 micromol/L after one year of treatment.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

BindRen is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy volunteers following oral administration of 14 C-radiolabelled colestilan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of in vitro testing suggest that medicinal products with anionic and/or lipophilic characteristics have a higher potential to bind to BindRen.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no direct special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single- and repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential or toxicity to reproduction and development. However, reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted at doses higher than 2.5 times the human clinical dose, and the possible reproductive effects related to coagulation and bleeding have not been assessed.

Haemorrhage and increased clotting parameters (PT and aPTT) were evident in rats following repeat administration. These were considered to result from a deficiency of vitamin K following a reduction in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (see section 4.4). 6.

The division of the daily dose may be adjusted on a physician's advice taking into account the dietary intake of phosphate. Patients should be encouraged to adhere to their prescribed low phosphate diets.

Treatment of high blood phosphorus levels usually requires long-term treatment.

4.3 Contraindications · Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. · Bowel obstruction. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The safety and efficacy of BindRen has not been studied in patients with: · Dysphagia or swallowing disorders · Severe gastrointestinal disorders such as chronic or severe constipation, intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, gastrointestinal ulcers, or recent major gastrointestinal surgery · Biliary obstruction · Severe hepatic impairment (see also section 4.2) · Seizure disorders · Recent history of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients · Serum albumin &lt;30 g/L Therefore, the use of BindRen is not recommended in patients with these disorders. Hyperparathyroidism BindRen alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment with BindRen. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with BindRen. In patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms, alternative treatment may need to be considered. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage Caution should be exercised when treating patients with conditions which predispose to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, such as recent history of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulcers, gastritis, diverticulosis, colitis and haemorrhoids. Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. BindRen does not contain calcium, and has no effect on serum calcium concentrations on treatment for up to one year. Serum calcium concentrations should be monitored as a normal follow-up of a dialysis patient. Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of hypocalcaemia.

## Fat-soluble vitamins

BindRen did not induce any clinically relevant reduction in the absorption of vitamins A, D, E or K during clinical studies of up to one year. However, caution should be exercised when treating patients with a susceptibility to vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, such as patients with malabsorption syndromes and patients treated with coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin). In these patients, monitoring of vitamin A, D and E concentrations or assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of coagulation parameters is recommended and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Folate deficiency

BindRen did not induce a clinically relevant reduction in folate absorption during clinical studies of up to one year. However, intestinal folate absorption may be impaired during long-term treatment of BindRen. In these patients, monitoring serum folate status and supplementation with folic acid should be considered.

## Hypothyroidism

Close monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism is recommended when levothyroxine is co-administered with BindRen (see section 4.5).

## Systemic ion balance

BindRen binds phosphate and bile acid, with the release of chloride which is available for systemic absorption. Changes in systemic ion balance with an increase in chloride and decrease in bicarbonate are therefore possible. However, BindRen did not induce any clinically relevant change in chloride and bicarbonate on treatment for up to one year. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction BindRen is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but may affect the bioavailability or absorption rate of other medicinal products. In addition, reduced bioavailability of other medicinal products by changes in enterohepatic circulation, for example, steroid hormones with potential impairment of  the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, have been reported for medicinal products with a similar mechanism of action to BindRen. When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically relevant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least 1 hour before, or 3 hours after taking BindRen. Concomitant treatment with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic window requires close monitoring of drug concentrations or adverse reactions, on initiation or dose-adjustment of either BindRen or the concomitant medicinal product. Interaction studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers. Interactions have not been studied at doses &gt;9 g daily, and greater interaction effects at higher doses of BindRen cannot be excluded. Single dose interaction studies demonstrated that the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin, warfarin and enalapril were not affected when co-administered with BindRen (6-9 g/day). BindRen lowered the bioavailability of digoxin by 16% and Cmax by 17%, and the Cmax of enalapril by 27%. Due to the high in vitro binding potential between BindRen and levothyroxine, closer monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in patients receiving BindRen and levothyroxine is recommended. No in vivo data are available on the possible interaction of BindRen on the absorption of the immunosuppressant  medicinal products mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin or tacrolimus. However, decreased blood concentrations have been reported for medicinal products with a similar mechanism of action to BindRen. Caution should be exercised when prescribing BindRen to patients receiving immunosuppressants. Patients with seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials with BindRen. Caution should be exercised when prescribing BindRen to patients also taking anti-seizure medicinal products. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Medicinal product no longer authorised

4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The Phase II and III clinical studies involving 1,410 patients with CKD Stage 5 on dialysis treated with BindRen for up to one year constituted the safety population. Patients received doses of up to 15 g per day, in three divided doses of 5 g. Approximately 30% of patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. The most serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal haemorrhage (uncommon) and constipation (common). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting (all common). The frequency of adverse reactions increased with dose. Tabulated list of adverse reactions A tabulated list of frequencies was defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Serum phosphorus

## Fixed-dose study :

In a double-blind, 12-week fixed-dose study with five colestilan groups (3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day) and placebo, colestilan at 6 g/day and above demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in serum phosphorus level. The least squares mean reduction from baseline to week 12 as compared to placebo was 0.16, 0.21, 0.19 and 0.37 mmol/L at 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day respectively.

## Flexible-dose studies:

Two similar 12-week, open-label, flexible-dose studies followed by a 4-week double-blind withdrawal period (comparison to placebo) were performed. In the first study, the mean serum phosphorus level was 2.33 mmol/L at baseline and 1.96 mmol/L (mean reduction by 0.36 mmol/L) at week 12 on a colestilan mean daily dose of 11.5 g. Similarly in the second study, the mean serum phosphorus level was 2.44 mmol/L at baseline and 1.94 mmol/L at week 12 (mean reduction by 0.50 mmol/L) on a colestilan mean daily dose of 13.1 g. The rate of responders (either a reduction in serum phosphorus ≤ 1.78 mmol/L and/or a reduction from baseline ≥ 0.3 mmol/L) was 50.4 % and 43.8% in the two studies, respectively (placebo 30.8% and 26.3%, respectively).

## Serum uric acid

Long-term studies: Two long-term, open-label, flexible-dose studies demonstrated that serum phosphorus reduction was maintained for up to one year. After one year, the mean serum phosphorus level was 1.89 mmol/L with a significant reduction from baseline of 0.39 mmol/L and responder rate (phosphorus level &lt;1.78 mmol/L) was 44%. A majority of patients received 12 or 15 g/day of colestilan in the long-term studies. Serum calcium In clinical studies, colestilan had no effect on serum calcium levels over a period of up to one year. Serum calcium-phosphorus ion product Calcium-phosphorus ion product was reduced by at least 0.48 mmol 2 /L 2 at week 12 compared to placebo at doses ≥9 g/day in fixed-dose study and by 1.05 and 0.86 mmol 2 /L 2 at week 12 in two flexible-dose studies. Colestilan reduced calcium-phosphorus ion product by 0.90 mmol 2 /L 2 after one year. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) In most clinical studies, colestilan decreased serum PTH compared to baseline, and was statistically significant against placebo. Serum cholesterol Colestilan significantly reduced serum LDL-cholesterol by 17.8, 25.6, 29.4, 34.8 and 33.4% at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day at week 12 compared to placebo in fixed-dose study, respectively. Colestilan also showed significant reductions from baseline by 35.3 and 30.1% at week 12 in two flexible-dose studies, and by 25.8% after one year in long-term studies. The reductions in LDL-cholesterol are also reflected in significant falls in total cholesterol. Serum glycosylated haemoglobin A1c In subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥7.0%, colestilan showed a reduction of between 0.36 to 1.38% at week 12 in the fixed-dose study, and by 0.94 and 0.91% at week 12 in the two flexible-dose studies. After one year of treatment, a reduction of 1.12% in HbA1c was observed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Colestilan was also associated in dose-dependent reduction in serum uric acid, with a mean reduction of 43 micromol/L after one year of treatment.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

BindRen is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy volunteers following oral administration of 14 C-radiolabelled colestilan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of in vitro testing suggest that medicinal products with anionic and/or lipophilic characteristics have a higher potential to bind to BindRen.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no direct special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single- and repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential or toxicity to reproduction and development. However, reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted at doses higher than 2.5 times the human clinical dose, and the possible reproductive effects related to coagulation and bleeding have not been assessed.

Haemorrhage and increased clotting parameters (PT and aPTT) were evident in rats following repeat administration. These were considered to result from a deficiency of vitamin K following a reduction in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (see section 4.4). 6.

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

BindRen 3 g granules

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each sachet contains 3 g colestilan. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Granules. White, cylindrical, film-coated granules, each approximately 3.5 mm in length and 3 mm in diameter. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications BindRen is indicated for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended starting dose is 6-9 g per day (2-3 g three times daily). Patients previously on other phosphate binders who are switched to BindRen should start taking 6-9 g per day (2-3 g three times daily). Dose titration Serum phosphorus concentrations should be monitored. If an acceptable serum phosphorus concentration is not achieved, the dose may be increased by 3 g per day (1 g three times daily) in 2-3 weekly intervals. The maximum daily dose of BindRen tested in clinical trials was 15 g per day (5 g three times daily). Special populations Elderly population Experience from clinical studies in patients above the age of 75 years is very limited. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Renal impairment

BindRen is indicated for use in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. No data on the use of BindRen in pre-dialysis patients are available.

## Severe hepatic impairment

Patients with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from clinical studies. Therefore, the use of BindRen is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see also section 4.4). No data are available.

Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety and efficacy of BindRen in children and adolescents aged under 18 years has not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

BindRen is for oral use. Granules should be taken whole as one dose from the sachet.

The daily dose of BindRen granules should be taken in three equally divided doses with or immediately after meals with a sufficient amount of water to aid swallowing.

The division of the daily dose may be adjusted on a physician's advice taking into account the dietary intake of phosphate. Patients should be encouraged to adhere to their prescribed low phosphate diets.

Treatment of high blood phosphorus levels usually requires long-term treatment.

4.3 Contraindications · Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. · Bowel obstruction. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The safety and efficacy of BindRen has not been studied in patients with: · Dysphagia or swallowing disorders · Severe gastrointestinal disorders such as chronic or severe constipation, intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, gastrointestinal ulcers, or recent major gastrointestinal surgery · Biliary obstruction · Severe hepatic impairment (see also section 4.2) · Seizure disorders · Recent history of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients · Serum albumin &lt;30 g/L Therefore, the use of BindRen is not recommended in patients with these disorders. Hyperparathyroidism BindRen alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment with BindRen. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with BindRen. In patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms, alternative treatment may need to be considered. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage Caution should be exercised when treating patients with conditions which predispose to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, such as recent history of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulcers, gastritis, diverticulosis, colitis and haemorrhoids. Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. BindRen does not contain calcium, and has no effect on serum calcium concentrations on treatment for up to one year. Serum calcium concentrations should be monitored as a normal follow-up of a dialysis patient. Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of hypocalcaemia.

## Fat-soluble vitamins

BindRen did not induce any clinically relevant reduction in the absorption of vitamins A, D, E or K during clinical studies of up to one year. However, caution should be exercised when treating patients with a susceptibility to vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, such as patients with malabsorption syndromes and patients treated with coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin). In these patients, monitoring of vitamin A, D and E concentrations or assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of coagulation parameters is recommended and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Folate deficiency

BindRen did not induce a clinically relevant reduction in folate absorption during clinical studies of up to one year. However, intestinal folate absorption may be impaired during long-term treatment of BindRen. In these patients, monitoring serum folate status and supplementation with folic acid should be considered.

## Hypothyroidism

Close monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism is recommended when levothyroxine is co-administered with BindRen (see section 4.5).

## Systemic ion balance

BindRen binds phosphate and bile acid, with the release of chloride which is available for systemic absorption. Changes in systemic ion balance with an increase in chloride and decrease in bicarbonate are therefore possible. However, BindRen did not induce any clinically relevant change in chloride and bicarbonate on treatment for up to one year. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction BindRen is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but may affect the bioavailability or absorption rate of other medicinal products. In addition, reduced bioavailability of other medicinal products by changes in enterohepatic circulation, for example, steroid hormones with potential impairment of  the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, have been reported for medicinal products with a similar mechanism of action to BindRen. When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically relevant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least 1 hour before, or 3 hours after taking BindRen. Concomitant treatment with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic window requires close monitoring of drug concentrations or adverse reactions, on initiation or dose-adjustment of either BindRen or the concomitant medicinal product. Interaction studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers. Interactions have not been studied at doses &gt;9 g daily, and greater interaction effects at higher doses of BindRen cannot be excluded. Single dose interaction studies demonstrated that the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin, warfarin and enalapril were not affected when co-administered with BindRen (6-9 g/day). BindRen lowered the bioavailability of digoxin by 16% and Cmax by 17%, and the Cmax of enalapril by 27%. Due to the high in vitro binding potential between BindRen and levothyroxine, closer monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in patients receiving BindRen and levothyroxine is recommended. No in vivo data are available on the possible interaction of BindRen on the absorption of the immunosuppressant  medicinal products mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin or tacrolimus. However, decreased blood concentrations have been reported for medicinal products with a similar mechanism of action to BindRen. Caution should be exercised when prescribing BindRen to patients receiving immunosuppressants. Patients with seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials with BindRen. Caution should be exercised when prescribing BindRen to patients also taking anti-seizure medicinal products. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Medicinal product no longer authorised

BindRen is not absorbed and is not systemically available. No direct effects of BindRen are thus anticipated. However, other effects of BindRen may affect pregnant and breast-feeding women or influence fertility, see sections 4.4 and 4.5.

## Pregnancy

No data are available to assess the safety and efficacy in pregnant women.

Patients that become pregnant and where a benefit/risk assessment confirms continued treatment with BindRen, supplementation of vitamins may be required, see section 4.4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

No data are available to assess the safety and efficacy in breast-feeding women.

Patients that breast-feed and where a benefit/risk assessment confirms continued treatment with BindRen, supplementation of vitamins may be required, see section 4.4.

## Fertility

No data are available to assess the potential influence of BindRen on fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

BindRen has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The Phase II and III clinical studies involving 1,410 patients with CKD Stage 5 on dialysis treated with BindRen for up to one year constituted the safety population. Patients received doses of up to 15 g per day, in three divided doses of 5 g. Approximately 30% of patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. The most serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal haemorrhage (uncommon) and constipation (common). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting (all common). The frequency of adverse reactions increased with dose. Tabulated list of adverse reactions A tabulated list of frequencies was defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are ranked in order of decreasing seriousness. Infections and infestations Uncommon: Gastroenteritis Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Hyperparathyroidism Metabolism and nutrition disorders Common: Hypocalcaemia, decreased appetite Uncommon: Folate deficiency, hypertriglyceridaemia, polydipsia Rare: Vitamin K deficiency, calciphylaxis, electrolyte imbalance, fluid overload Psychiatric disorders Uncommon: Insomnia Nervous system disorders Uncommon: Tremor, dizziness, headache, dysgeusia Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BindRen contains colestilan. Colestilan is a non-absorbed, non-calcium, non-metallic phosphate-binding polymer. The binding sites become partially protonated in the stomach and interact through ionic and hydrogen bonding with both dietary phosphate anions and bile acids in the duodenum. By binding phosphate from food in the digestive tract, colestilan lowers the serum phosphorus concentration. Colestilan also binds bile acids, thereby lowering the serum LDL-cholesterol concentration. Changes in the bile acid pool in the gastrointestinal tract have also been observed to lower serum glucose. Colestilan may also bind uric acid in the gastrointestinal tract.

Rare: Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Uncommon: Muscle spasm, musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremities General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon: Asthenia *A single case with a fatal outcome Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose BindRen has been given to dialysis patients in doses up to 15 g/day for up to one year continuously with no cases of overdose. The potential risk of overdosing could include adverse reactions or a worsening of adverse reactions mentioned in section 4.8. There are no known antidotes to BindRen. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned. ATC code: not yet assigned. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Three Phase III studies and two long term follow-up studies have been performed in patients with CKD Stage 5 on dialysis, in order to investigate efficacy and safety in this population.

## Serum phosphorus

Fixed-dose study :

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a double-blind, 12-week fixed-dose study with five colestilan groups (3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day) and placebo, colestilan at 6 g/day and above demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in serum phosphorus level. The least squares mean reduction from baseline to week 12 as compared to placebo was 0.16, 0.21, 0.19 and 0.37 mmol/L at 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day respectively.

## Flexible-dose studies:

Two similar 12-week, open-label, flexible-dose studies followed by a 4-week double-blind withdrawal period (comparison to placebo) were performed. In the first study, the mean serum phosphorus level was 2.33 mmol/L at baseline and 1.96 mmol/L (mean reduction by 0.36 mmol/L) at week 12 on a colestilan mean daily dose of 11.5 g. Similarly in the second study, the mean serum phosphorus level was 2.44 mmol/L at baseline and 1.94 mmol/L at week 12 (mean reduction by 0.50 mmol/L) on a colestilan mean daily dose of 13.1 g. The rate of responders (either a reduction in serum phosphorus ≤ 1.78 mmol/L and/or a reduction from baseline ≥ 0.3 mmol/L) was 50.4 % and 43.8% in the two studies, respectively (placebo 30.8% and 26.3%, respectively).

Colestilan was also associated in dose-dependent reduction in serum uric acid, with a mean reduction of 43 micromol/L after one year of treatment.

Long-term studies: Two long-term, open-label, flexible-dose studies demonstrated that serum phosphorus reduction was maintained for up to one year. After one year, the mean serum phosphorus level was 1.89 mmol/L with a significant reduction from baseline of 0.39 mmol/L and responder rate (phosphorus level &lt;1.78 mmol/L) was 44%. A majority of patients received 12 or 15 g/day of colestilan in the long-term studies. Serum calcium In clinical studies, colestilan had no effect on serum calcium levels over a period of up to one year. Serum calcium-phosphorus ion product Calcium-phosphorus ion product was reduced by at least 0.48 mmol 2 /L 2 at week 12 compared to placebo at doses ≥9 g/day in fixed-dose study and by 1.05 and 0.86 mmol 2 /L 2 at week 12 in two flexible-dose studies. Colestilan reduced calcium-phosphorus ion product by 0.90 mmol 2 /L 2 after one year. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) In most clinical studies, colestilan decreased serum PTH compared to baseline, and was statistically significant against placebo. Serum cholesterol Colestilan significantly reduced serum LDL-cholesterol by 17.8, 25.6, 29.4, 34.8 and 33.4% at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 g/day at week 12 compared to placebo in fixed-dose study, respectively. Colestilan also showed significant reductions from baseline by 35.3 and 30.1% at week 12 in two flexible-dose studies, and by 25.8% after one year in long-term studies. The reductions in LDL-cholesterol are also reflected in significant falls in total cholesterol. Serum glycosylated haemoglobin A1c In subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥7.0%, colestilan showed a reduction of between 0.36 to 1.38% at week 12 in the fixed-dose study, and by 0.94 and 0.91% at week 12 in the two flexible-dose studies. After one year of treatment, a reduction of 1.12% in HbA1c was observed. Serum uric acid Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

BindRen is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy volunteers following oral administration of 14 C-radiolabelled colestilan.

The results of in vitro testing suggest that medicinal products with anionic and/or lipophilic characteristics have a higher potential to bind to BindRen.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no direct special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single- and repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential or toxicity to reproduction and development. However, reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted at doses higher than 2.5 times the human clinical dose, and the possible reproductive effects related to coagulation and bleeding have not been assessed.

Haemorrhage and increased clotting parameters (PT and aPTT) were evident in rats following repeat administration. These were considered to result from a deficiency of vitamin K following a reduction in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (see section 4.4).

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## BindRen 1 g film-coated tablets colestilan

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

-Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What BindRen is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you take BindRen 3. How to take BindRen 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store BindRen 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What BindRen is and what it is used for BindRen contains the active substance colestilan. It is used to lower high blood phosphorus levels in adult patients undergoing dialysis due to poor kidney function. About high blood phosphorus levels (hyperphosphataemia) If your kidneys no longer function properly you may undergo dialysis, which replaces many of the functions of your kidneys. You have also been advised to follow a special diet to reduce the amount of phosphorus that your body takes from food. Sometimes, the dialysis and diet are not enough to stop the phosphorus in your blood rising to high levels, a condition referred to by your doctor as hyperphosphataemia. Keeping the phosphorus level in your blood low is important to maintain healthy bones and blood vessels and to prevent itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain or bone fractures. How BindRen works Colestilan binds to the phosphorus from food in your digestive tract to prevent it from being absorbed into your blood. The colestilan-bound phosphorus is then excreted from your body in faeces. However, even though you are taking BindRen, you must also follow the special diet recommended by your doctor. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2. What you need to know before you take BindRen

## Do not take BindRen

- -if you are allergic to colestilan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -if you have bowel obstruction (a blockage of your intestines)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warning and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking BindRen if you are suffering from any of the following problems, since this medicine may not be right for you:

- -swallowing problems
- -severe problems with stomach or bowel movement, such as constipation, ulcers in the stomach or the gut or haemorrhoids, since these problems may lead to increased risk of e.g. bleeding from the intestines
- -recent major stomach or bowel surgery
- -gall bladder obstruction
- -severe liver problems
- -seizures

-recent history of inflammation of the membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal (tummy) cavity (peritonitis) -low levels of albumin (a protein) in your blood Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if during your treatment with BindRen, any of the following applies to you: -you experience constipation, since your doctor may wish to monitor your bowel function to detect potential side effects (see section 4). -you have been told that you have a disorder that decreases the intestines ability to absorb nutrients (malabsorption syndrome) or if you are treated with so called coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin), since your doctor may want to monitor your blood and possibly ask you to start taking vitamin supplements. -you have abnormally low levels of calcium in your blood. BindRen does not contain calcium and your doctor may prescribe additional calcium tablets. -you have abnormally high levels of calcium in your blood due to overactivity of the parathyroid glands.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
