## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Diabetic  nephropathy  is  the  leading  cause  of  chronic  kidney  disease  in  patients  starting  renal replacement  therapy  and  is  associated  with  increased  cardiovascular  mortality.  The  incidence  of diabetes  has  reached  epidemic  proportions  throughout  the  world,  with  an  expected  doubling  in  the number  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  in  the  next  25  years.  This,  in  turn,  will  lead  to  a  further increased incidence of diabetic nephropathy, of which approximately 30% progress to end-stage renal disease.

Metformin  is  contraindicated  in  diabetic  patients  with  impaired  renal  function.  Therefore,  there  is  a need for safe and effective oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) in patients with moderate, severe, and endstage renal impairment.

Renal  impairment  affects  the  PK  of  saxagliptin  by  reducing  renal  clearance,  thereby  increasing systemic exposure. The approved dose is 5 mg for subjects with normal renal function. A dose of 2.5 mg of saxagliptin in these subjects will result in systemic exposures to BMS-510849 near or below the exposures typically achieved from a 10 mg dose of saxagliptin in subjects with normal renal function.

This is an extension application, introducing a new product strength: Onglyza 2.5 mg film-coated tablet intended for use in renal impaired patients.

The existing product is: Onglyza 5 mg film-coated tablet; this was recently approved (October 2009; EMEA/H/C/001039). Both product strengths are indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

A type II variation II/08 has also been submitted to update the Product Information of the 5 mg tablet strength with the the dosing recommendations in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

This is a line extension application for marketing authorisation, introducing a new strength, Onglyza 2.5 mg film-coated tablet. The existing product is Onglyza 5 mg film-coated tablet.

Onglyza contains saxagliptin as active substance which is a highly potent, selective, reversible, and competitive  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP4)  inhibitor.  DPP4  is  the  enzyme  responsible  for  the inactivation of the incretin hormones  glucagon-like peptide-1  (GLP-1)  and  glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).

Incretin hormones are gastrointestinal hormones that increase insulin secretion in response to enteral stimulation.  In  humans,  incretins  such  as  GLP-1,  regulate  blood  glucose  via  multiple  mechanisms; these  include  stimulation  of  glucose-dependent  insulin  secretion,  delaying  of  gastric  emptying,  and inhibition of hepatic glucose production. However, incretins such as GLP-1 are rapidly inactivated by DPP4. Therefore, DPP4 inhibitors should extend the effects of incretins.

Onglyza 2.5 mg is an immediate release, film-coated tablet. The tablets contain 2.5 mg saxagliptin and are commercially supplied in Alu/Alu blister packaging.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

The active substance has been previously assessed for the existing 5 mg film coated tablets. There are no changes or new information in relation to manufacture, control or stability of the drug substance in the context of this submission.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The immediate release tablet consists of a tablet core without drug substance, covered by a number of film-coat layers. The drug substance saxagliptin is embedded within the middle layer, as a - in situ formed- hydrochloride (HCl) salt. The product contains 2.5 mg saxagliptin.

Saxagliptin is prone to undergo an intra-molecular cyclisation reaction in solution and solid states to form a cyclic amidine. To minimise this phenomenon the proposed tablet formulation was developed. The design of the 2.5 mg tablets is the same as the existing strength.

Quality by design concepts have been used in the manufacturing process development for this strength as well as for the registered one. These are outlined in the dossier and the design space is presented for  several  manufacturing  conditions.  Nevertheless  the  drug  product  is  routinely  tested  at  release regarding most quality aspects, and batch analysis as well as stability data have been submitted.

## Adventitious agents

Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. The MAH has confirmed that lactose monohydrate is the only material of animal origin and that it is sourced from healthy animals in the same way as for human use complying with regulations to ensure patient safety.

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process is identical to the one for the registered 5 mg strength. The manufacturing process for Onglyza tablets involves active coating of saxagliptin onto an inert core tablet, followed by standard unit operations such as film-coating and printing.

The  process  validation  was  performed  in  a  conventional  manner,  according  to  the  NfG  on  process validation. At least three production batches were validated, and results were well within the criteria.

## Product Specification

The specifications of the drug  product at release and shelf-life include tests for description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur.), impurities/ degradants (HPLC), dissolution (Ph.Eur. HPLC, not routinely), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). Drug dissolution results have  been  presented  for  six  commercial  scale  batches  of  drug  product.  All  batches  show  fast dissolution: 86 % or more after 10 minutes. Moreover, saxagliptin can be classified as a BCS Class III (high solubility, low permeability) compound meaning the absorption rate is the rate limiting step in vivo. It is therefore justified not to test dissolution routinely. Instead, dissolution will be tested in the 10  first  commercial  batches  and  thereafter  one  batch  per  year.  The  periodical  dissolution  test  is included in the product specification.

Batch analysis results have been provided for seven representative pivotal batches from the proposed manufacturing site.

Also  three  additional  batches  from  another  site  have  been  submitted  as  supportive  data.  All  results were well within specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability of the product

Stability data were presented for three representative batches. The tablets were made from different batches of drug substance manufactured by Process C. The data cover 36 months at 25°C/60%RH, 30°C/65%RH and 30°C/75%RH, and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH. The tablets were stable at all storage conditions tested, and statistical analysis was performed to support extrapolation of the data.

A  matrix  approach  was  applied  to  the  long  term  conditions.  For  one  batch  the  hold  time  of  active suspension was the maximum proposed. The results for these batches were not significantly different from the results from the other batches.

After  36  months  storage  at  30°C/65%RH  and  30°C/75%RH  total  aerobic  microbial  count  and  total combined yeast and mould count results were &lt; 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/g and E. coli was absent.

For photo-stability studies in accordance with ICH Q1B, showed the product is not sensitive to light.

The 36 months results cover the approved shelf-life. The new results remain within the limits and thus confirm the approved shelf-life. There is also no need for shelf-life criteria for water content, based on the  diagrams  of  water  contents  over  time,  impurities  contents  over  time,  and  dissolution  over  time over 36 months, which show no specific upward or downward trend in water content over time, and no relationship between water content over time versus impurities levels and dissolution.

In conclusion the proposed shelf life and storage conditions are acceptable.

In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

## 2.2.4. Discussion and Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of Onglyza 2.5 film coated tablet is adequately established. Information on development, manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The quality of the active substance is considered sufficiently described and adequately supported by data. Sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and control of the drug product has been presented. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions is chemically  stable  for  the proposed shelf life.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted what is considered acceptable.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

This is an extension application, introducing a new product strength: Onglyza 2.5 mg film-coated tablet intended for use in renal impaired patients. The existing product is: Onglyza 5 mg film-coated tablet;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

this  was  approved  in  October  2009  (EMEA/H/C/001039).  Both  product  strengths  are  indicated  for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

With this application for the 2.5 mg strength the following pharmacokinetic documentation has been submitted: One phase III renal impairment study D1680C00007 (study 07).

It should be noted that the original procedure for saxagliptin started with both the 2.5 mg and the 5 mg strength and at the end, the 2.5 mg strength was withdrawn, for clinical reasons. When applicable to the current application reference is made to the previous assessment report.

Bio-equivalence  of  the  lowest  strength  (2.5  mg)  has  not  been  evaluated.  However,  since  the qualitative  composition  of  the  2.5  mg  strength  is  the  same  as  the  5  mg  strength  and  since  the quantitative composition of both strengths (&lt;5% saxagliptin) is very similar, and all other conditions hold  true,  a  bio-waiver  can  be  granted  for  the  2.5  mg  dose  strength  on  the  basis  of  similarity  of dissolution profiles.

In  the  original  marketing  authorisation  application  (MAA)  renal  impairment  study  CV181019  was submitted.  In  this  study  it  was  found  that  in  mild  renal  impairment,  saxagliptin's  AUC  (INF)  values were less than 2-fold higher than the mean values in subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, no dosage adjustment has been recommended for patients with mild renal impairment. The mean AUC (INF) values for BMS-510849 were however ~3-fold higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment than in subjects with normal renal function. The MAH therefore proposed a dose of 2.5 mg in subjects with moderate renal impairment. In severe renal impairment, saxagliptin's and BMS-510849 AUC (INF) values were 2.1 and 4.5 folds higher than those observed in subjects with normal renal function. A dose  of  2.5  mg  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  is  therefore  proposed  by  the  MAH.  Since patients  undergoing  hemodialysis  also  have  severe  renal  impairment,  a  dose  of  2.5  mg  was  also proposed in these patients.

Based  on  the  results  of  this  study  it  was  concluded  that  the  proposed  dose-recommendations  for subjects  with  mild  renal  impairment  are  acceptable.  However,  the  use  of  Onglyza  in  patients  with moderate renal impairment was not recommended due to limited clinical study experience. Additionally, dose-recommendations in case of severe renal impairment were found not to be acceptable. The MAH proposed similar dose recommendations for moderate and severe renal impairment, whereas the AUC (INF)  values  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  were  1.6  fold  higher  than  in  subjects  with moderate renal impairment (4.5 folds versus 2.9 fold higher exposure).

## GCP

According to the MAH, the study submitted with this application was performed in accordance with the ethical  principles  that  have  their  origin  in  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  that  are  consistent  with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics. Questions were raised on the design and  conduct  of  the  study,  but  the  MAH  could  answer  these  questions  sufficiently.  Therefore  a  GCP inspection was not considered necessary.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

To  further  assess  the  PK  of  the  2.5  mg  dosage  in  patients  with  renal  impairment,  plasma  levels  of saxagliptin  and  its  major  metabolite  BMS-510849 were measured in some patients of the phase III renal  impairment  study  D1680C00007  (study  07).  This  was  a  12-week,  international,  multi-centre, randomised,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  treatment  effect and tolerability of saxagliptin 2.5 mg compared with placebo in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes and renal  impairment  (moderate,  severe,  and  end-stage).  After  a  2-week  single-blind  placebo  lead-in period,  subjects  underwent  stratified  randomisation  to  52  weeks  double-blind  treatment  with  either saxagliptin  or  placebo,  in  a  1:1  ratio  within  each  renal  impairment  category.  Randomisation  was stratified by renal impairment category at baseline. Data from the first 12 weeks are presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results  were  as  follows.  It  should  be  noted  that  among  end-stage  subjects,  blood  samples  for  PK analysis were taken in the morning before scheduled dialysis. The peak mean plasma concentrations of BMS-510849 were observed at the last nominal sampling time point of 4 hours post-dose in all groups.

Data derivedfromTable 8.14aST,Section 11.3.9.

Abbreviations: FAS: Full analysis set; n: Number of subjects with available data; SD: Standard deviation.

The mean saxagliptin plasma steady-state concentrations at the nominal collection times of pre-dose, 1,  2,  and  4  hours  post-dose  were  generally  similar  across  all  of  the  renal  impairment  categories studied. Based on mean pre-dose plasma concentrations of saxagliptin, a small amount of saxagliptin accumulation was observed in all categories of the renal impairment studied, but there was no clear pattern to the extent of accumulation associated with renal impairment category.  Based on mean predose concentrations of BMS-510849, accumulation of BMS-510849 was observed in all categories of renal impairment studied with higher plasma levels with increasing severity of renal impairment (max 1.9 -fold increase), similar to study CV181019.

This raised the question whether a lower dose than 2.5 mg should have been chosen for the patients with severe and end-stage renal disease. BMS-510849 is the major metabolite of saxagliptin, being also a selective, reversible, competitive DPP-4 inhibitor, half as potent as saxagliptin. In the clinical study no complete pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed and only measurements were made up to 4 hours post-dose so that no definitive conclusions could be made with regard to differences in total exposure. Peak plasma concentrations in patients with severe renal impairment following the 2.5 dose did  not  exceed  more  than  twice  the  peak  plasma  concentrations  found  for  subjects  without  renal impairment after the 5 mg dose.

The steady-state concentrations of BMS-510849 obtained in Study 07 were compared to the maximum concentrations of BMS-510849 observed following a single 5- and 10-mg saxagliptin dose in healthy subjects. The mean 4-hour concentration (the approximate time of Cmax) ranged from ~30 ng/mL in moderate renal impairment to ~58 ng/mL in subjects with end-stage renal impairment. In comparison, in healthy subjects given a 5-mg or 10-mg saxagliptin dose, the Cmax of BMS-510849 was 50 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL, respectively. Thus, the plasma concentrations of BMS-510849 in subjects with renal impairment given a 2.5-mg saxagliptin dose in Study 07 compare favourably to the concentrations of BMS-510849 in subjects given 5 mg (the approved dose) or 10 mg (a dose shown to be safe in phase 3  studies).  It  is  unlikely  that  the  imbalance  in  observed  AEs  is  related  to  active  metabolite concentrations,  but  is  more  likely  due  to  underlying  diabetes  mellitus  and  its  complications  in  this difficult-to-treat population. This can be verified by adding the concentration data from this study to the population PK analysis of saxagliptin. In this analysis the systemic exposures of both saxagliptin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were found to be higher with lower creatinine clearance. The results of this new analysis do not change the opinion that the clinical relevance of the higher exposure in severe renal  impaired  patients  and  patients  with  ESRD  is  difficult  to  predict  in  a  quantitative  way  and therefore saxagliptin should be used with care in patients with severe renal impairment and should not be used in patients with ESRD. At least no excessive exposure to the active moyeties appears likely when dose is adapted to 2.5 mg daily in patients whose creatinine clearance has declined to 10 ml/min.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Main study

As mentioned before with this application for the Onglyza 2.5mg strength the phase III renal impairment study D1680C00007 (study 07) has been submitted.

## Methodology

Study  07  included  subjects  with  type  2  diabetes,  inadequate  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%  to ≤ 11%) and moderate, severe, or end-stage renal impairment. The categorisation of renal impairment was  determined  by  estimated  Creatinine  clearance  (CrCl)  from  the  Cockcroft-Gault  equation  using central laboratory measurements of Serum creatinine (SCr) collected at study entry.

According to the MAH the database design did not allow partitioning of all of the short-term and longterm data. Thus, it was not possible to ensure that there were no changes made retrospectively to the short-term data post-lock (eg. to concomitant medication or AE data). However, all tables, figures and listings were based on the locked ST database, and thus efficacy and safety results of the ST-period were not changed. Furthermore, most changes were only minor and did not affect the efficacy and safety results.

A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) was prepared before unblinding of the week 12 data.

## Numbers of patients

Of  a  total  of  572  patients  were  enrolled,  170  were  randomised.  Incorrect  enrolment  was  the  main reason  for  not  entering  the  study.  In  effect,  most  subjects  were  screen  failures.  Screening  and enrolment were performed at the same visit, and not all laboratory variables were available at the time of medical record review. These arguments are considered plausible reasons for the large number of subjects not fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria. One hundred and twenty nine (129, 75.9%) subjects completed the 12-week treatment period and entered the long-term treatment period.  More patients in the saxagliptin group (24/85, 28.2%) vs placebo group (17/85, 20%) did not complete the 12 weeks period, mainly because subjects withdrew consent (13 vs 7 subjects) or did no longer meet study criteria (5 subjects in each group).

Long-term  data  consisted  of  extension  data  to  52-weeks.  Of  the  129  subjects  who  entered  the  LT treatment  period,  92  (54.1%  of  randomised  subjects)  completed  the  study  (52  weeks),  42  in  the saxagliptin group and 50 in the placebo group.

## Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics were largely comparable between treatment groups. There were no significant differences in age, gender, weight, BMI, duration of diabetes (mean 17 years). HbA1c at baseline was slightly higher in the saxagliptin group (8.5% vs 8.1%). Baseline HbA1c range was 6.6-11.3% in the saxagliptin  group,  5.0-11.1%  in  the  placebo  group.  However,  there  were  differences  in  renal impairment  and  in  insulin  use  at  baseline.  Of  the  randomised  subjects,  90  subjects  (52.9%)  had moderate renal  impairment  at  baseline,  41  subjects  (24.1%)  had  severe  renal  impairment,  and  39 subjects (22.9%) had end-stage renal disease. There were more moderate subjects in the saxagliptin group (48 [56.6%] versus 42 [49.4%] subjects) and more severe subjects in the placebo group (23 [27.1%] vs 18 [21.2%] subjects) compared with the corresponding treatment group. This was due to incorrect assignment by the investigator of 7 subjects in the saxagliptin group and 7 in the placebo group. One possible explanation for the initial incorrect assignment could be that the investigator by mistake  entered  the  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR)  assessment  instead  of  CrCl  which yielded lower values. This could have been the case for 5 of the patients in the saxagliptin group and 4 of the patients in the placebo group. The corrected category was used for the analysis of all study data. Although  the  misclassifications  resulted  in  an  imbalance  of  subjects  in  the  moderate  and  severe impairment categories by treatment group, this is not considered to  affect the interpretation of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

results. If there was any effect on HbA1c results, it is expected that the placebo group had a larger reduction because of the more severe renally impaired patients included in this group.

The majority of subjects were using other antihyperglycaemic medications, including insulin and oral blood  glucose  lowering  drugs.  Number  of  patients  using  insulin  was  70/85  subjects  (82.4%)  in  the saxa group versus 55/85 subjects (64.7%) in the placebo group. Mean insulin dose was 50.73 IU in the  saxagliptin  group  and  41.68  IU  in  the  placebo  group.  Percentage  of  patients  using  oral  blood glucose lowering drugs was 27.1 in the saxagliptin group and 36.5 in the placebo group.

## Protocol deviations

According  to  the  MAH,  29  (17.1%)  subjects  had  significant  protocol  deviations:  13  (15.3%)  in  the saxagliptin  group  and  16  (18.8%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  common  significant  protocol deviations  were  changes  in  dose  and/or  type  of  allowed  OAD  or  insulin  regimen  except  for  safety reasons (14, 8.2% subjects overall), and medication compliance &lt;80% or &gt; 120% (12, 7.1% subjects overall). Other protocol violations were reported for 22 (12.9%) subjects overall. The most common reason was compliance with study medication during lead-in. Although the proportion of subjects who discontinued  from  the  study  or  had  protocol  deviations  was  higher  than  seen  in  other  saxagliptin studies, difficulties in subject retention and strict adherence to the protocol was expected within this study  population  with  multiple  concomitant  diseases.  The  result  of  the  PP  analysis  for  change  from baseline in HbA1c at Week 12, which excluded data in subjects with significant protocol deviations, was consistent with the primary HbA1c analysis, providing additional support for the validity of the trial and the reliability of the data.

## HbA1c

HbA1c was reduced from baseline  to  week  12  in  both  treatment  groups.  Mean  change  was  -0.82± 0.114 in the saxagliptin group and -0.29± 0.122 in the placebo group. The difference was statistically significant. Mean difference (SE) was -0.42± (95% CI -0.71 to -0.12); p-value 0.007.

Analysis by renal impairment revealed that the treatment-by-baseline renal impairment interaction was not statistically significant. Numerically larger adjusted mean reductions from baseline to Week 12 in HbA1c  were  observed  with  saxagliptin  compared  with  placebo  in  subjects  with  moderate  renal impairment (adjusted mean [SE] change from baseline -0.64% [0.134%] for the saxagliptin group and -0.05% [0.139%] for the placebo group) and in subjects with severe renal impairment (adjusted mean [SE] change from baseline -0.95% [0.228%] for the saxagliptin group and -0.50% [0.201%] for the placebo group). In subjects with end-stage renal impairment, the adjusted mean (SE) change from baseline to Week 12 in HbA1c was -0.84% (0.243%) in the saxagliptin group and -0.87% (0.243%) in the placebo group (Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of subjects achieving a therapeutic response at Week 12 (LOCF) (defined as HbA1c reduction  from  baseline ≥ 0.5%)  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group  than  the  placebo  group. Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  in  accordance  with  these  results.  On  request,  the  MAH  has presented the percentages of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7%. After 12 weeks these percentages were 33.3% in the saxagliptin group versus 24.1% in the placebo group.

Insulin  dose  had  decreased  slightly  from  baseline  in  the  saxagliptin  group  but  remained  relatively constant  in  the  placebo  group:  in  the  FAS,  there  were  66  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  53 subjects  in  the  placebo  group  who  were  taking  background  insulin  therapy  during  the  lead-in  and short-term treatment periods. At Week 12, the mean (SE) insulin dose had decreased slightly from baseline in the saxagliptin group but stayed relatively constant in the placebo group.

In  both  treatment  groups,  a  larger  reduction  in  mean  FPG  from  baseline  to  Week  12  was  seen  in subjects who were receiving background insulin therapy compared with those who were not.

Long-term data up to 52-weeks indicate a sustained effect of saxagliptin. However, the (low) numbers and proportions of subjects with available data at time-points in the LT period of the study should be taken into consideration when interpreting the LT efficacy results. In subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment, larger unadjusted mean reductions from baseline were seen at all time-points for the  saxagliptin  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  However,  in  the  severe  group  the  placebo response was larger than that observed for subjects with moderate renal impairment.

Results  were  generally  similar  in  the  Full  analysis  set  using  observed  values.  Improvement  in glycaemic control during treatment with saxagliptin in subjects with renal impairment was confirmed and sustained during LT treatment of up to 52 weeks.

The excess of withdrawals on the saxagliptin arm relative to placebo might however be an issue.  LOCF is  used for data imputation which is potentially reasonable given that improvement is expected over time. However, the MAH does not provide a report on the timing of withdrawals and the impact of the data  imputation  on  the magnitude  of  effects  observed. The  values  imputed  for  withdrawing  patients should be listed and summarised.  Some bias in favour of saxagliptin is likely in these circumstances, in particular if patients derive initial benefit from treatment (greater than those on placebo) but then withdraw from the trial - this \"benefit\" will be artificially maintained (through the extrapolation) to the Week 12 timepoint. There might also be the common problem with LOCF of the imputation increasing estimated precision, hence narrowing confidence intervals and simultaneously decreasing the p-value, all  artificially  (see  revised CHMP  guideline  on  missing  data). The  MAH is  requested to  provide and  to discuss  some sensitivity analyses;  BOCF  would  be  conservative  (though  is  also  likely  to  suffer  from artificially increased precision), but potentially persuasive.

In  his  response  the  MAH  presented  data  from  4  sensitivity  analyses:  LOCF,  Repeated  Measures analysis, Observed case and BOCF. In all analyses an effect of saxagliptin was seen, albeit that in the BOCF (baseline observation carried forward) the difference was not statistically significant anymore. However,  all  analyses  point  in  the  same  direction,  and  the  analyses  suggest  that  the  influence  of withdrawals is not very large.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

HbA1c was reduced from baseline to week 12 in both treatment groups. The reduction was statistically significantly greater with saxagliptin 2.5 mg than with placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints were in accordance with these results. Initially a number of questions were raised regarding the design and conduct  of  the  study.  However,  the  MAH  was  able  to  explain  adequately  the  reasons  for  the discrepancy  between  the  number  of  enrolled  subjects  (572)  and  subjects  randomised  (170),  the incorrect  initial  assignment  in  severity  of  the  renal  disease  in  14  patients,  and  the  number  of withdrawals and protocol violations.

Furthermore, the MAH demonstrated it was plausible that imbalances between treatment groups did not affect the results. Imbalance in severity of renal impairment (more severe in the saxagliptin group) would not be in favour of saxagliptin, as the placebo response in patients with severe renal impairment was larger than in patients with moderate disease. Imbalance in patients using background insulin was shown not to influence the results to a great extent. A post-hoc analysis of the reduction in HbA1c from baseline to Week 12 using the primary analysis model with baseline insulin use as a covariate revealed no influence of the insulin treatment.

Initially,  the  MAH  had  submitted  12-week  data  only.  Long-term  data  were  submitted  at  Day  120. Although  the  primary  endpoint  was  decrease  in  HbA1c  at  week  12,  and  although  the  number  of patients completing the full 52 weeks was small (42 in the saxagliptin group and 50 in the placebo group), results indicate a sustained effect of saxagliptin during this period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although  the  treatment-by-baseline  renal  impairment  interaction  was  not  statistically  significant, numerically larger mean reductions from baseline to week 12 were observed with saxagliptin compared to placebo in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment, but there was no difference between treatment groups in patients with end-stage renal disease. The MAH decided to withdraw the claim for end-stage renal disease. For patients with severe renal disease, long-term data were suggestive for a sustained effect of saxagliptin, although the number of patients in this group was limited.

The percentage of subjects achieving a therapeutic response at Week 12 (LOCF) (defined as HbA1c reduction from baseline ≥ 0.5%) was higher in the saxagliptin group than the placebo group. However, mean HbA1c at baseline was higher in the saxagliptin group compared with the placebo group (8.45% versus 8.09%, respectively). On request, the MAH has presented the percentages of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7%:33.3% in the saxagliptin group versus 24.1% in the placebo group.

Insulin dose decreased slightly from baseline in the saxagliptin group but remained relatively constant in the placebo group.

The excess of withdrawals on the saxagliptin arm relative to placebo might however be an issue. The MAH  was  therefore  requested to  provide and  to  discuss  some  sensitivity  analyses;  BOCF  would  be conservative (though is also likely to suffer from artificially increased precision), but potentially persuasive. The MAH presented data from 4 sensitivity analyses. In all analyses an effect of saxagliptin was found. Data suggest that the influence of withdrawals was not very large.

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Saxagliptin  2.5  mg  resulted  in  a  clinically  relevant  decrease  in  HbA1c  in  patients  with  moderate  or severe renal insufficiency. Therefore the use of saxagliptin in this population is approvable. However, as  the  number  of  patients  in  the  group  with  severe  renal  insufficiency  was  small,  the  SmPC  should reflect that the experience in this group is limited.

The MAH has withdrawn the claim for treatment in end-stage renal disease.

Exposure=last dosing date (short-term double-blind treatment)-first dosing date (short-term double-blind treatment)+1.

Mean exposure to randomised study medication was 74.5 days in the saxagliptin group and 80.3 days in the placebo group. The majority of subjects (60.0% and 72.9% of subjects, respectively) were exposed to treatment for 82 to 88 days (Table 1).

The number of subjects with any adverse event (AE) was similar between the treatment groups (57.6 vs  54.1% in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively). However, (Table 2) in the saxagliptin group more subjects had a SAE (12 [14.1%] vs 7 [8.2%]) and more subjects discontinued due to an (S)AE (8 [9.4%] vs 2 [2.4%] subjects).

Events of hypoglycaemia were included in all categories.

There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  AEs  in  severe  and  end-stage  renal  impairment  as  compared  with saxagliptin group than in the placebo group (severe: 72% vs 61%; end-stage 63% vs 55%).

moderate  renal  impairment  (Table  3),  and  in  these  groups  incidence  of  AEs  was  higher  in  the In the saxagliptin group, the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar in each baseline renal  impairment  category,  whereas  in  the  placebo  group,  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  in  the moderate baseline renal impairment group compared with the severe and end-stage groups. Within each baseline renal impairment category, the incidence of SAEs was higher in the saxagliptin group compared with the placebo group. The incidence rates of SAEs for the saxagliptin and placebo groups were 11.1% (n=2) versus 4.3% (n=1), respectively, for subjects with severe renal impairment and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

15.8% (n=3) versus 5.0% (n=1), respectively, for subjects with end-stage renal impairment. However, the differences represent only 1 to 2 subjects and the SAEs documented were more likely related to underlying diabetes mellitus and its complications rather than a drug effect with saxagliptin.

At Day 120 long-term data were presented. It should be remarked that the number of patients in the severe and end-stage renal impairment group was low. Incidence of AEs in the moderate impairment group was 58.3% [n=28] vs 59.5 [n=25] for the saxagliptin and placebo group respectively, in the severe impairment group 83.3% [n=15] vs 69.6 [n=16] for saxagliptin vs placebo, and in end-stage renal disease group 57.9% [n=11] vs 70.0 [n=14]. Thus, there is no clear relationship between renal impairment and the incidence of AEs. The most common AEs in saxagliptin-treated subjects included urinary tract  infection,  hypertension,  dyspnoea and anaemia. The most common AEs in the placebo group included anaemia, oedema peripheral and hypertension. Overall, the incidence and type of SAEs, including deaths (saxagliptin: 23 [27.1%] subjects; placebo: 24 [28.2%] subjects) and SAEs leading to discontinuation were not unexpected for this subject population given the severity of renal disease. In  general,  AEs  and  SAEs  were  equally  distributed  across  various  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  and preferred terms (PTs) without any major imbalances between treatment groups. There were 7 deaths during  the  study,  3  in  the  saxagliptin  group  (sudden  death,  cardiac  arrest  and  cerebrovascular accident) and 4 in the placebo group (2 cases of sudden death, cardiac failure and sepsis). None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to study medication.

Events of hypoglycaemia were included in all categories.

Also in subjects receiving insulin as background treatment incidence of AEs, and SAEs was higher than in patients not treated with insulin. In these groups too, incidence in the saxagliptin group was higher as compared to the placebo group.

The most common AEs were infections and infestations (11%) in both the saxagliptin and the placebo group. The most common infections were urinary tract infection and nasopharyngitis (4.7 and 1.2% in the saxagliptin group, vs 2.4 each in the placebo group). (see Table 4)

There were no notable differences in incidence and type of AEs between the treatment groups and type of AEs within the 3 baseline renal impairment categories.

Hypoglycaemia terms based upon the saxagliptin defined list of events are excluded.

SAEs occurred in 12 (14.7%) and 7 (8.2%) subjects of the saxagliptin and placebo group respectively. Two subjects reported hypoglycaemia as SAEs, both of whom were in the placebo group. SAEs were reported across various SOCs, with no single SOC predominating.

Discontinuation  due  to  AEs  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (5 subjects vs 1 subject, 5.9% vs 1.2%). There was no clear pattern in the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypoglycaemia occurred more or less similarly in both treatment groups. Major hypoglycaemia was seen in 1 subject in each treatment group; minor hypoglycaemic events were observed in 13 subjects (15.3%) with 44 events in the saxagliptin group and in 11 subjects (12.9%) with 26 events in the placebo group.

There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory values and vital signs.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The overall number of subjects with any AE was similar between the treatment groups. There was a higher  incidence  of  (S)AEs  in  severe  and  end-stage  renal  impairment  as  compared  with  moderate baseline impairment with a larger difference compared to placebo. However, the differences represent only 1 to 2 subjects and the SAEs documented were more likely related to underlying diabetes mellitus and its complications rather than a drug effect with saxagliptin.

The  question  was  raised  whether  this  is  related  to  the  relative  higher  plasma  levels  of  the  active metabolite, as discussed under Pharmacokinetics. However, the plasma concentrations of BMS-510849 in subjects with renal impairment given a 2.5-mg saxagliptin dose in Study 07 compare favourably to the  concentrations  of  BMS-510849  in  subjects  given  5  mg  (the  approved  dose)  or  10  mg  (a  dose shown to be safe in phase 3 studies). It is unlikely that the imbalance in observed AEs is related to active  metabolite  concentrations,  but  is  more  likely  due  to  underlying  diabetes  mellitus  and  its complications in this difficult-to-treat population (see also Pharmacokinetics).

A higher percentage in the saxagliptin  group discontinued due to (S)AEs as compared with placebo but the  numbers  were  small  (4  vs.  1).  No  AEs  were  found  for  lymphopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  skin disorders, localised oedema, hypersensitivity, and pancreatitis. Hypoglycaemic events occurred more or less similarly between treatment groups. There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, body weight, BMI, or waist circumference in either treatment group.

Long-term  data  were  presented,  but  the  number  of  patients  completing  52  weeks  was  limited, especially in the severe and end-stage renal disease group. However, data did not reveal a consistent pattern in incidence of AEs related to renal insufficiency.

The MAH withdrew the claim for end-stage renal disease. It is emphasized in the SmPC that saxagliptin is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis.

The use of saxagliptin in severe renal patients is acceptable. But it is reflected in the SmPC that the experience in patients with severe renal impairment is very limited and that saxagliptin should be used with caution in this population

More  data  will  be  needed  to  investigate  safety  in  this  category  of  patients  with  severe  renal insufficiency. This can be done post-marketing when assessing the periodic safety update reports.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

Saxagliptin 2.5 mg once daily in general was well tolerated. However, more data will be needed to investigate  safety  in  renal  insufficiency,  in  particular  in  severe  renal  insufficiency.  This  can  be  done post-marketing when assessing the periodic safety update reports.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  current  approved  Pharmacovigilance  system  fulfils  the  legislative requirements and that no additional information is necessary for this extension application.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAH claims that the information provided in the current approved version of the Risk Management Plan for Onglyza 5 mg is valid for Onglyza 2.5 mg as well. No new information was considered needed by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities beyond those included in the product information are required for the extension of the Marketing Authorisation and agrees that the current version of the RMP is in principle valid. However for the next RMP update, awaited together with next PSUR, the applicant should include the recent already submitted and assessed data from study 07 in the section 'safety specification'. The MAH should also plan and perform a specific subpopulation  analysis  within  the  ongoing  phase  IV  database  studies  (CV181-P66/67/68/69/75)  of  the RMP.

## User consultation

The MAH submitted a justification that the readability test performed and submitted for the initial MAA for Onglyza is relevant for this line extension application.

This is considered acceptable for the CHMP.

## 2.8. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The quality of Onglyza 2.5 film coated tablet is adequately established.

A 12-week study was performed in patients with different grades of renal insufficiency. Additionally data were presented from a 40 week extension of this trial. Treatment with saxagliptin resulted in a statistically significant greater reduction in HbA1c than placebo. Mean change was -0.82± 0.114 in the saxagliptin  group  and  -0.29±  0.122  in  the  placebo  group.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  in accordance with these results.

Numerically larger adjusted mean reductions from baseline to Week 12 in HbA1c were observed with saxagliptin compared with placebo in subjects with moderate renal impairment (adjusted mean [SE] change  from  baseline  -0.64%  [0.134%]  for  the  saxagliptin  group  and  -0.05%  [0.139%]  for  the placebo  group)  and  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  (adjusted  mean  [SE]  change  from baseline -0.95% [0.228%] for the saxagliptin group and -0.50% [0.201%] for the placebo group). For the end-stage renal disease group, no difference with placebo was seen, but a large placebo response was noted.

Although the number of patients completing the full 52 weeks was small (42 in the saxagliptin group and 50 in the placebo group), results indicate a sustained effect of saxagliptin during this period.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The number of patients completing 52 weeks of the study was limited: 42 in the saxagliptin group and 50 in the placebo group, with small numbers in the severe and end-stage renal disease groups.

The MAH withdrew the claim for use of saxagliptin in end-stage renal disease. It is emphasized in the SmPC  that  saxagliptin  is  not  recommended  for  patients  with  end-stage  renal  disease  requiring haemodialysis.

The use of saxagliptin in severe renal patients is acceptable. But it is reflected in the SmPC that the experience in patients with severe renal impairment is very limited and that saxagliptin should be used with caution in this population. More data in this category will be obtained through PSURs.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The number of subjects with any AE was similar between the treatment groups (57.6 vs 54.1% in the saxa and placebo group, respectively). A higher percentage in the saxagliptin  group discontinued due to  (S)AEs  as  compared with placebo but the numbers were small (4 vs. 1). No AEs were found for lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, skin disorders, localised oedema, hypersensitivity, and pancreatitis. Hypoglycaemic events occurred more or less similarly between treatment groups.

There was a higher incidence of (S)AEs in severe and end-stage renal impairment as compared with moderate baseline impairment with a larger difference compared to placebo. However, the differences represent  only  1  to  2  subjects  and  the  SAEs  documented  were  more  likely  related  to  underlying diabetes  mellitus  and  its  complications  rather  than  a  drug  effect  with  saxagliptin.  There  were  no notable differences in type of AEs between the treatment groups.

There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory values and vital signs. Long-term data did not reveal unexpected issues.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

As  noted  above,  the  number  of  patients,  especially  in  the  severe  and  end-stage  renal  impairment groups was limited. Therefore, no definitive conclusions can be drawn on the safety of saxagliptin in this  subgroups.  The  MAH withdrew the claim for use of saxagliptin in end-stage renal disease. It is emphasized in the SmPC that saxagliptin is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis.

The use of saxagliptin in severe renal patients is acceptable. But it is reflected in the SmPC that the experience in patients with severe renal impairment is very limited and that saxagliptin should be used with caution in this population. More data in this category will be obtained through PSURs.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Saxagliptin resulted in a clinically relevant decrease in HbA1c in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.  Safety  data,  although  limited  in  number  of  patients  for  the  long-term  treatment,  is reassuring.

## Benefit-risk balance

The overall Benefit/Risk balance of Onglyza (saxagliptin) 2.5 mg film-coated tablets intended for use in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate to severe renal impairment is positive.

## 2.9. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by concensus that the risk-benefit balance of Onglyza 2.5 mg film-coated tablets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
