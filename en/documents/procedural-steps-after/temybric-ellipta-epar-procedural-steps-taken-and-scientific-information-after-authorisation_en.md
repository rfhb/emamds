| WS/2130/G           | This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data product | 11/11/2021 | 16/02/2022 no longer | and PL Following an update of the Company Core Safety Information (CCSI) of the Global Datasheet (GDS), dysgeusia was added as an adverse drug reaction (ADR) at a frequency of uncommon. Dysgeusia was not previously identified as an ADR for combination inhaled fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol trifenatate (FF/UMEC/VI) in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) clinical trial safety database but mainly supported by reference to the safety profile FF/UMEC/VI from asthma studies, literature case reports and review of cases of dysgeusia observed for the mono (UMEC) and dual constituents (UMEC/VI) of FF/UMEC/VI, both authorised for use in COPD. Frequency of dysgeusia was calculated based on the incidence in the triple therapy COPD clinical trials (CTT116855, CTT116853, 200812). Furthermore, based on assessment of study CTT116855 and postmarketing safety data for FF/UMEC/VI, intraocular pressure increased with frequency rare and vision blurred, glaucoma and eye pain with frequency uncommon were identified as new ADRS.
