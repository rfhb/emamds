<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 3.1 Introduction

This is a generic medicinal product containing lamivudine as active substance. Each film-coated tablet contains  100  mg  lamivudine;  the  product  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  HBV  infection.  The reference  medicinal  product  is  Zeffix  film-coated  tablets  which  is  part  of  the  global  marketing authorisation for lamivudine containing reference medicinal products.

Lamivudine is an antiviral agent with a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue structure, which suppresses HBV viral replication  by  terminating  HBV  DNA  chain  elongation.  Lamivudine  has  been  shown to enter HBV transfected and non-transfected HepG2cells (a human hepatoma-derived cell-line) where it is  phosphorylated  to  lamivudine  5'-monophosphate  (active  form  of  the  parent  compound)  by cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase. Intracellular phosphorylation of the monophosphate results in the formation of the 5'di- and 5'tri-phosphates. Lamivudine triphosphate acts as a substrate of HBV viral polymerase.  The  formation  of  further  viral  DNA  is  blocked  by  incorporation  of  lamivudine triphosphate into the chain.

The  safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  lamivudine  for  the  treatment  of  HBV  infection  has  been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of which can be found in the EPAR for the reference medicinal  product.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing  experience  contributing  to  the knowledge of the clinical use of this active substance. Since this application is a generic application referring  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  Zeffix,  the  pivotal  basis  is  the  demonstration  of bioequivalence.

The indication proposed for Lamivudine Teva is the same as authorised for the reference medicinal product, which is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with:

- compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  levels  and  histological  evidence  of  active  liver  inflammation and/or fibrosis.
- decompensated liver disease.

## 3.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 100 mg lamivudine.

Other ingredients are:

Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), magnesium stearate.

Film coating: hypromellose 3cP, hypromellose 6cP, titanium dioxide E171, macrogol 400, polysorbate 80, iron oxide yellow E172, iron oxide red E172.

The film coated tablets are packed in PVC/PVdC - Aluminium blisters and white HDPE containers with white opaque polyethylene child resistent screw cap with induction seal.

## Active Substance

Lamivudine is a white or almost white powder that is soluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol and slightly soluble in ethanol. Lamivudine has the chemical name 4-amino-1-[(2R,5S)-2(hydroxymethyl]-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one  hydrate  (5:1).  Lamivudine  possesses  two asymmetric  carbons  and  is  expected  to  be  optically  active.  Lamivudine  exists  in  two  polymorphic forms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Manufacture

The manufacturing of lamivudine consists in two steps. The information on the manufacturing process is  provided  in  an  ASMF.  Adequate  In-Process  Controls  are  applied  during  the  manufacture  of  the active substance. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents, have been presented and are satisfactory. Polymorphic forms and[c3] optical isomerism[c4]) are controlled during manufacture

## · Specification

The  specifications of the drug substance include description (Ph Eur), solubility (Ph Eur), identification (Specific Optical Rotation, IR, Enantiomeric purity), polymorphic identification (XRPD, DSC), absorbance, related substances, (Ph Eur), enantiomeric purity (Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), residue on ignition (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC[c7]) and residual solvents (GC). The analytical  methods  used  for  control  of  active  substance  are  methods  described  in  the  Ph  Eur monograph 2217.

Batch analysis data (n=3) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

## · Stability

The stability studies have been carried out on four batches of active substance in long-term conditions (30°C/65%  RH)  and  in  accelerated  conditions  (40°C/75%  RH).  The  data  cover  a  period  of  6  to  9 months in long term conditions and 6 months in accelerated conditions. The stability samples have been stored in a mini-size simulation of the original packing.

Parameters tested during stability studies are characterisation, identification (IR), polymorph identity XRPD), related substance (HPLC), water content and assay.

Forced degradation studies were performed by treatment with heat, light (UV light and visible light), under acidic and alkaline conditions, under oxidizing, reduction and hydrolysis conditions. The stability results justify the proposed retest period.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  aim  of  the  development  pharmaceutics  was  to  obtain  immediate-release  tablets  containing qualitatively  and  quantitatively  the  same  active  substance  as  the  reference  medicinal  product.  The dissolution tests described for the finished product were used as discriminating tests in order to select suitable formulations.

Different  manufacturing processes for Lamivudine tablets (direct compression and wet granulation) were tested. Ultimately, the direct compression process was chosen based on appearance and quality attributes of the product, as well as the simplicity and effectiveness of this process.

The  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  are  tablet  core:  microcrystalline  cellulose,  sodium  starch glycolate (Type A), magnesium stearate.film coating: hypromellose 3cP, hypromellose 6cP, titanium dioxide E171, macrogol 400, polysorbate 80, iron oxide yellow E172, iron oxide red E172.

All the excipients are tested according to the current European Pharmacopoeial specifications except the colorants which are tested as per in-house methods.

Tablets  are  packaged  either  with  PVC/  PVdC  blister  or  white  opaque  HDPE  container  with  child resistant  screw  cap.The  suppliers  declare  that  their  materials  comply  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  and Commission Directive  2002/72/EC  as  amended (relating  to  plastic  materials  intended  to  come  into contact with foodstuffs).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process is a standard direct compression. The manufacturing is divided into 6 main steps: initial blending, intermediate blending, final blending: lubrification, compression, coating and packaging.

## · Product Specification

The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for description, identification of active substance (HPLC, UV), identification  of  Opadry  colorants (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph Eur), dissolution (Ph Eur), assay ([c8]%, HPLC), impurities/degradation products (HPLC), microbial limit test (Ph Eur).

Batch analysis results (n = 2) confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

## · Stability of the Product

Two batches  of  the  finished  packed  in  the  intended  for  marketing  primary  packaging  (blisters  and HDPE containers) were put on long-term (25°C/60%RH) for up 12 months for blisters and for up 9 months for HDPE containers, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months stability testing ICH conditions. The following parameters were tested: description, assay, dissolution, impurities/degradation products, and microbiological quality.

The results support the shelf life in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 3.3 Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data were submitted in support of this  application. The  applicant  provided  an acceptable  summary  of  the  pharmacological,  pharmacodynamic  and  toxicological  properties  of lamivudine  from  recent  literature  sources  and  on  a  literature  research  for  recent  non-clinical information relevant to the safety of lamivudine. The non-clinical aspects of the SPC are in line with the SPC of the reference product. No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided.

The impurity profile has been discussed and it was concluded that there are no significant differences between the impurity profiles of the generic product and reference products. The applicant provided a suitable  justification  for  the  absence  of  a  formal  environmental  risk  assessment,  based  on  the expectation  that  introduction  of  these  generic  products  onto  the  market  is  unlikely  to  result  in  an increase  in  the  combined  sales  of  all  lamivudine-containing  products,  which  in  turn  is  unlikely  to increase exposure of the environment to lamivudine.

## 3.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

This is an abridged application for film-coated tablets containing 100 mg lamivudine. To support the marketing authorisation the applicant conducted a single dose bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting conditions using the 300 mg strength. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. For the 100 mg strength the applicant then applied for a biowaiver.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A clinical overview was provided summarising the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lamivudine  based  on  a literature  search;  this  overview  was  considered adequate. The SPC is in line with the SPC of the reference product.

No  formal  scientific  advice  by  the  CHMP  was  given  for  this  medicinal  product.  For  the  clinical assessment  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98)  in  its  current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  Guidelines  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  are  of  particular relevance.

## GCP:

The pivotal study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. The applicant provided a statement to the effect  that  clinical  trial  2008-1715  was  conducted  outside  the  community  and  was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Exemption

The applicant requested a biowaiver for the conduct of a bioequivalence study for the 100 mg strength based  on  the  following  justification  related  to  the  comparison  with  the  300  mg  strength  as  well  as characteristics of the active substance:

Both  strengths  of  the  generic  medicinal  product  are  manufactured  by  the  same  manufacturer  and process, have the same qualitative composition, same ratio between amounts of active substance and excipients,  and  similar  dissolution  profile  under  identical  conditions.  Adequate  dissolution  profiles were  provided.  From  a  pharmacokinetic  view  point,  lamivudine  shows  dose-linearity  over  the therapeutic range.

A bioequivalence study was conducted with the 300 mg strength. Based on the above information and taking into account the criteria laid out in the applicable Note for Guidance, the CHMP considered that a  bioequivalence  study  with  the  100  mg  strength  is  not  necessary.  It  was  noted  that  the  reference product used for the bioequivalence study is different from the reference product for the SPC; any potential differences between these formulations have been taken into account and were considered acceptable for the application of the biowaiver concept.

## Clinical studies

To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study; the details of this study are summarised in Table 1:

## Pharmacokinetics

## · Methods

## STUDY DESIGN

Study  2008-1715  was  an  open  label,  randomised  two-treatment,  two-period,  two-sequence,  singledose, crossover study conducted under fasting conditions.

The  subjects  were  confined  to  the  clinical  facility  for  at  least  10  hours  prior  to  each  drug administration  until  24  hours  after  dosing.  Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  two  dosing sequences.

In each period, an optional pre-study snack was provided to each subject after check-in and prior to fasting.  Subjects  fasted  overnight  for  at  least  10  hours  prior  to  drug  administration  and  for  at  least 4 hours  following  drug  administration.  Study  drugs  were  administered  with  240  ml  of  room temperature  potable  water.  Standardized  xanthine-free  meals  with  caffeine-free  beverages  were provided to subjects at least 4 hours after drug administration in each period. Other standardized meals were served throughout the remainder of the confinement period. Other than the optional pre-study snack  and  the  protocol  specified  meals,  subjects  were  not  allowed  any  other  food  or  drink  while confined in the clinic. With the exception of the water ingested during drug administration, water was not allowed from 2 hours prior to drug administration, until 2 hours post-dose.

Concentrations  of  lamivudine  were  measured  from  samples  collected  over  a  24-hour  interval  after dosing in each period. Blood samples were collected pre-dosing and at 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dosing. [EMEA10]

The washout interval between both periods was 7 days.

The  clinical  part  of  the  study,  the  bioanalytical  analyses  as  well  as  the  statistical  analyses  were performed by contract research organisations. [EMEA11]

The study protocol and consent form were reviewed and approved [EMEA13]by an ethics review board. [EMEA14]

## ANALYTICAL METHODS

The blood samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS Technique.

## [EMEA17]

The analytical method was considered adequately validated.

## PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES

The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  Cmax  and  Tmax  were  determined.  AUC  was calculated  by  the  trapezoidal  rule.  Cmax  and  Tmax  were  directly  estimated  from  the  individual concentration time profiles.

## STATISTICAL METHODS

The statistical analysis was performed using SAS software.

Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. The least square  means,  the  differences  between  the  treatments  least  square  means,  and  the  corresponding standard errors of these differences were estimated for log-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.

ANOVA was performed on the ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax. In addition, ANOVA was applied  to  untransformed  Kel  and  T1/2  parameters.  The  ANOVA  model  included  sequence,  subject nested  within  sequence,  period  and  treatment.  Based  on  these  statistics,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric means  for  treatments  and  the  corresponding  90%  confidence  intervals  were  calculated.  For  the bioequivalence conclusion it was predefined that 90% geometric intervals of the ratio (Test/Reference) of least square means from the ln-transformed values for AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax had to be within the range of 80-125%.

Non-transformed Tmax was tested using the non parametric Wilcoxon test.

The statistical methods were adequately described and were deemed acceptable. There were no major protocol deviations.

## · Results

38  out  of  40  enrolled  subjects  completed  the  study  and  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and statistical data analysis. Two subjects were excluded during the conduct of the study for the following reasons:

- -One  subject  was  tested  positive  for  cotinine  (exclusion  criteria)  at  period  II  check-in  and  was therefore dismissed for non-compliance;
- -One subject experienced nausea and loose stool after period II and was dismissed without being dosed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the beginning of period II, all pre-dose concentrations were below LLOQ except for one subject where pre-dose concentration was lower than 5% for Cmax.

The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the 38 subjects who were included in the analysis are presented in Table 3. The results of the statistical  analysis  for  ln-transformed  data  are  displayed  in Table 4.

* 90% confidence intervals based on ln transformed values.

The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  geometric  means  of  AUC0-t ,  AUC0-inf and Cmax  (lntransformed data) are within the limits of 80% to 125%.

A statistically significant difference ( α =0.05) was detected between the two periods of the study in the analysis of AUC0-t (p=0.0116) and AUC0-inf (p=0.0144). No objective explanation could be given for this  period  effect.  It  is  possible  that  the  observed  effect  is  due  solely  to  chance.  The  least-squares means of the formulation effect were adjusted for the period effect. The final results are not influenced by the statistically period effect noticed for these parameters.

With regard to the individual plasma concentration time profiles, it was noted that the concentrations values measured for two subjects in period I appeared to have spurious concentration at four hours post-dose. This was explained by a possible sample switch, and a graphical analysis switching theses values in the profiles was performed to support this assumption. An additional statistical analysis was performed with the measured values for the lamivudine concentration at 4 hours post-dose in period I switched between these two subjects. It was confirmed that also in this analysis the 90% confidence intervals  of  the  relative  mean  plasma  lamivudine  AUC0-t ,  AUC0-inf and Cmax of the test to reference product were within the 80-125% range.

## Safety data

There were 29 adverse events (11 with the test product and 18 with the reference product) involving 15 subjects in the study. All adverse events were mild. 18 events were considered unrelated and 11 events possibly related.

One subject had a bruised left hand finger after period I dosing. The subject was not dismissed from the study, but deemed lost to follow up. Another subject experienced serious adverse events. These occurred after the completion of the clinical portion of the study and were considered not related to the product.

None of the AEs was considered to have a significant impact on the safety of the subjects or on the integrity of the study results.

##  Conclusions

Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Lamivudine  Teva  is  considered  bioequivalent  with Epivir.  The  results  of  study  2008-1715  with  the  300  mg  film-coated  tablet  formulation  can  be extrapolated  to  other  strengths  of  100  mg,  according  to  conditions  in  Note  for  Guidance  on  the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), section 5.4.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

A single  dose  bioequivalence  study  -  randomized,  two-sequence,  two-period,  two-treatment,  crossover study under fasting conditions - has been conducted with the 300 mg film-coated tablets. The design of the study is considered adequate.

The sampling period of 24 hours is sufficient to characterize the plasma concentration-time profile and to ensure measurements over a period of at least 5 half-lives based on the minimum expected t½ of 5 hours. Blood sample timing is appropriate to allow an accurate measurement of Tmax. The wash-out period of 7 days is long enough to avoid any carry over effect to the second period.

The 90% confidence intervals of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax of the test to reference product were within the 80-125% range hence bioequivalence is concluded. The same statistical outcome was observed if the obtained values for the two subjects at 4 hours post-dose in period I, where an inadvertent switch is assumed, were switched. An observed statistical period effect did not impact on the final outcome and is considered a chance finding.

A biowaiver was applied for the 100 mg strength, which is subject to  the  present  application. The conditions for a biowaiver (same manufacturer and process, linearity over the therapeutic range, same qualitative  composition,  same  ratio  between  amounts  of  active  substance  and  excipients,  similar dissolution profile under identical conditions) have been fulfilled. Regarding the dissolution characteristics,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  dissolution  is  not  a  rate-limiting  step  due  to  the  high solubility of lamivudine and the solubility of lamivudine, which is practically pH independent. It was noted  that  the  reference  product  used  for  the  bioequivalence  study  is  different  from  the  reference product  for  the  SPC;  any  potential  differences  between  these  formulations  have  been  taken  into account and were considered acceptable for the application of the biowaiver concept. Therefore, it is concluded that the biowaiver for the 100 mg film-coated tablet is acceptable and that no dedicated bioequivalence study is required.

## 3.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application contains adequate quality data. No new nonclinical data have been presented but an acceptable summary of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of lamivudine has been provided.  This  is  considered  acceptable.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  an  appropriate  summary  of publicly  available  information  regarding  the  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamics  properties  as well as the clinical efficacy and safety profile of lamivudine for the treatment of HBV infection has been presented.

The pivotal basis of this application is a bioequivalence study conducted with a single dose in fasting state against a reference product. The overall study design as well as the bioanalytical methods were acceptable  for  this  purpose.  Based  on  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  obtained  pharmacokinetic  data, bioequivalence between the test and the reference product can be concluded as the 90% confidence intervals  of  the  relative  mean  plasma  lamivudine  AUC0-t ,  AUC0-inf and Cmax of the test to reference product were within the 80-125% range. This study was conducted with the 300 mg film-coated tablet whereas the strength applied for is the 100 mg film-coated tablet. Since the applicable criteria related to  the  manufacturing  of  the  product  as  well  as  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  are  fulfilled,  the application of the biowaiver concept is acceptable hence bioequivalence can be considered demonstrated for this formulation.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of Lamivudine Teva in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with:

- compensated  liver  disease  with  evidence  of  active  viral  replication,  persistently  elevated  serum alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  levels  and  histological  evidence  of  active  liver  inflammation and/or fibrosis.
- decompensated liver disease.

was positive and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
