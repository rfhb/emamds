Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey with data in patients on chronic haemodialysis from the Study GS-US-292-1825; this is a Phase 3b Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of E/C/F/TAF Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) in HIV-1 Infected Subjects on Chronic Haemodialysis. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to remove boceprevir drug-drug interaction information in section 4.5 of the SmPC since this medicinal product has been withdrawn from the EU market, as well as to introduce some minor amendments throughout the product information of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Moreover, the Package Leaflet of Genvoya and Odefsey have been updated regarding the lactose | 26/04/2019   | 06/06/2019 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | In study GS US 292 1825, the efficacy and safety of of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet in HIV-1 infected adults with end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis were evaluated. There were no new safety issues identified in these patients. No clinically relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal function. Efficacy was maintained through 48 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with normal renal function. Although there were no new safety issues identified, the implications of increased emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain. Therefore, it is recommended that Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey should generally be avoided but may be used in adults with end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. No dose adjustment is required in these patients. Based on this, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey have been updated accordingly. |

|           | worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC for Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey in order to provide long-term efficacy and safety data for HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive adults with results through 144 weeks of treatment with Genvoya from studies GS-US- 292-0104 and GS-US- 292-0111; two Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Genvoya vs Stribild. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to make minor administrative corrections to sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC for Genvoya and Descovy and linguistic amendments in Slovakian, Swedish, Polish, Latvian, Czech and Portuguese. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data |              |              |        | from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies in which 2,396 patients received Genvoya. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical studies through 144 weeks were nausea (11%), diarrhoea (7%), and headache (6%) (pooled data from Phase 3 clinical studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 in 866 treatment-naïve adult patients receiving Genvoya). Cobicistat increases serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. In clinical studies of Genvoya, increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 2 of treatment and remained stable through 144 weeks. In treatment-naïve patients, a mean change from baseline of 0.04 ± 0.12 mg/dL (3.5 ± 10.6 μmol/L) was observed after 144 weeks of treatment. Mean increases from baseline in the Genvoya group were smaller than in the elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg (E/C/F/TDF) group at Week 144 (difference -0.04, p < 0.001). In studies in treatment naïve patients, increases from baseline were observed in both treatment groups for the fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 144. The median increase from baseline for those parameters was greater in the Genvoya group compared with the E/C/F/TDF group at Week 144 (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides). The median (Q1, Q3) |

| change from baseline in total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio at Week 144 was 0.2 ( 0.3, 0.7) in the Genvoya group and 0.1 ( 0.4, 0.6) in the E/C/F/TDF group (p = 0.006 for the difference between treatment groups).  In a pooled analysis, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV 1 isolates from antiretroviral-naïve patients receiving Genvoya in Phase 3 studies GS US 292 0104 and GS US 292 0111 with HIV 1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at confirmed virologic failure, Week 144, or time of early study drug discontinuation.  Up to Week 144, the development of one or more primary elvitegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide resistance-associated mutations was observed in HIV 1 isolates from 12 of 22 patients with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and Genvoya treatment-failure isolates (12 of 866 patients [1.4%]) compared with 12 of 20 treatment failure isolates from patients with evaluable genotypic data in the E/C/F/TDF treatment group (12 of 867 patients [1.4%]).  Of the HIV 1 isolates from 12 patients with resistance development in the Genvoya group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 11) and K65R/N (n = 2) in RT and T66T/A/I/V (n = 2), E92Q (n = 4), Q148Q/R (n = 1) and N155H (n = 2) in integrase.  Of the HIV 1 isolates from 12 patients with resistance development in the E/C/F/TDF group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 9), K65R/N (n = 4), and L210W (n = 1) in RT and E92Q/V (n = 4), and Q148R (n = 2), and N155H/S (n = 3) in integrase. Most HIV 1 isolates from patients in both treatment groups who developed resistance mutations to elvitegravir developed resistance mutations to both emtricitabine and elvitegravir.   |

| In phenotypic analyses of patients in the final resistance analysis population, 7 of 22 patients (32%) had HIV 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir in the Genvoya group compared with HIV 1 isolates from 7 of 20 patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group, HIV 1 isolates from 8 patients (36%) had reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine in the Genvoya group compared with HIV 1 isolates from 7 patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group. One patient in the Genvoya group (1 of 22 [4.5%]) and 2 patients in the E/C/F/TDF group (2 of 20 [10%]) had reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. Genvoya met the non inferiority criteria demonstrated statistical superiority in achieving HIV 1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when compared to E/C/F/TDF at Week 144. The difference in percentage was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.6% to 7.8%). Changes in measures of bone mineral density In studies in treatment naïve patients, Genvoya was associated with smaller reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) compared to E/C/F/TDF as measured by DXA analysis of hip (mean change: -0.8% vs -3.4%, p < 0.001) and lumbar spine (mean chan ge: -0.9% vs -3.0%, p < 0.001) after 144 weeks of treatment. Improvements in BMD were noted at 96 weeks after switching to Genvoya from a TDF-containing regimen compared to maintaining the TDF-containing regimen.   |

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 15/12/2016 | 29/03/2017 | SmPC | In section 4.5 of the SmPC, the following oral contraceptives have been listed as having an interaction with the individual components of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey: Norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.250 mg once daily), ethinylestradiol (0.025 mg once daily). The recommendation concerning their co-administration with Descovy is that no dose adjustment of norgestimate/ethinylestradiol is required. Descovy should be dosed according to the concomitant antiretroviral in line with section 4.2 of the SmPC. The recommendation concerning their co-administration with Odefsey is that no dose adjustment is required. The recommendation concerning the co-administration of a hormonal contraceptive with Genvoya is that caution should be exercised. The hormonal contraceptive should contain at least 30 µg ethinylestradiol and contain norgestimate as the progestagen or patients should use an alternative reliable method of contraception. The long-term effects of substantial increases in progesterone exposure are unknown. The effect of co administration of Genvoya with oral contraceptives containing progestagens other than norgestimate is not |

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 15/09/2016   | 29/03/2017   | SmPC and PL   | The MAH has updated section 4.2 of the SmPC to note that there are limited data available regarding the use of Descovy (DVY) in patients with estimated CrCl < 30 mL/min; previously it stated there was no data. The summary of the safety profile in section 4.8 and the pharmacodynamic properties in section 5.1 were further updated to reflect 96 weeks data from clinical studies of treatment-naïve adult patients with Genvoya (GEN). Data from GEN clinical studies presented through 96 weeks of treatment in ART-naive adults in the current submission are consistent with the findings in the original submission. At Week 96, GEN was noninferior to Stribild. The efficacy of GEN in subgroup analyses revealed no meaningful differences in virologic success. The frequency of resistance development in ART-naive subjects taking GEN was acceptably low and comparable to that of the STB group through 96 weeks of treatment. Treatment with GEN continued to be well tolerated, as demonstrated by the incidence of SAEs considered related to study drug, or study drug discontinuation due to AEs. No new ADRs were identified. Based on the demonstrated bioequivalence between FTC/TAF from Genvoya and Descovy these results demonstrate that DVY is beneficial as a chronic treatment for ART-naive subjects.   |
