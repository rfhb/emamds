<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

The vaccine can be injected subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM), preferably in the deltoid region (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (see section 4.4).

The vaccine should under no circumstances be injected intravascularly. For precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product, see section 6.6. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product bef ore administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications /uniF0B7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or neomycin (which may be present as trace residues, see sections 2 and 4.4). /uniF0B7 Primary and acquired immunodeficiency states due to conditions such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma; other conditions affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system; immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1); cellular immune deficiencies. /uniF0B7 Immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose corticosteroids) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8); however, ZOSTAVAX is not contraindicated for use in individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low-dose systemic corticosteroids or in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., f or adrenal insuff iciency (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). /uniF0B7 Active untreated tuberculosis. /uniF0B7 Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see section 4.6). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of  biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction f ollowing the administration of  the vaccine, as there is a possibility of  hypersensitivity reactions, not only to the active substances, but also to the excipients and trace residuals (e.g. neomycin) present in the vaccine (see sections 4.3, 4.8 and 6.1). Neomycin allergy generally manifests as a contact dermatitis. However, a history of contact dermatitis due to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving live virus vaccines. ZOSTAVAX is a live, attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine and administration to individuals who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient may result in disseminated varicella-zoster virus disease, including fatal outcomes. Patients who previously received immune suppressive therapy should be carefully evaluated for the reconstitution of  the immune system prior to receiving Zostavax (see section 4.3).

The safety and ef f icacy of  ZOSTAVAX have not been established in adults who are known to be infected with HIV with or without evidence of immunosuppression (see section 4.3) however, a phase II saf ety and immunogenicity study in HIV-infected adults with conserved immune function (CD 4+T cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL) has been completed (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with severe thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder, because these individuals may bleed f ollowing intramuscular injections.

ZOSTAVAX is not indicated for treatment of zoster or PHN.

Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe acute febrile illness or inf ection.

As for any vaccine, vaccination with ZOSTAVAX may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. See section 5.1. Transmission In clinical trials with ZOSTAVAX, transmission of the vaccine virus has not been reported. However, post-marketing experience with varicella vaccines suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may occur rarely between vaccinees who develop a varicella-like rash and susceptible contacts [for example, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) susceptible infant grandchildren]. Transmission of vaccine virus from varicella vaccine recipients who do not develop a varicella-like rash has also been reported. This is a theoretical risk f or vaccination with ZOSTAVAX. The risk of transmitting the attenuated vaccine virus f rom a vaccinee to a susceptible contact should be weighed against the risk of  developing natural zoster and potentially transmitting wild-type VZV to a susceptible contact. Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. Potassium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-f ree'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ZOSTAVAX can be administered concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine as separate injections and at dif f erent body sites (see section 5.1). The concomitant use of ZOSTAVAX and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine resulted in reduced immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX in a small clinical trial. However, data collected in a large observational study did not indicate increased risk for developing herpes zoster af ter concomitant administration of the two vaccines. No data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. Concurrent administration of ZOSTAVAX and anti-viral medications known to be effective against VZV has not been evaluated. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no data on the use of ZOSTAVAX in pregnant women. Traditional non-clinical studies are insuff icient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). However naturally-occurring varicella-zoster virus infection is known to sometimes cause foetal harm. ZOSTAVAX is not recommended to be administered to pregnant women. In any case, pregnancy should be avoided for one month following vaccination (see section 4.3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether VZV is secreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to not administer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ZOSTAVAX taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of vaccination for the woman.

## Fertility

ZOSTAVAX has not been evaluated in fertility studies.

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the eff ects on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed . However, ZOSTAVAX is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines . 4.8 Undesirable effects a. Summary of the safety profile The most common adverse reactions reported in pivotal clinical trials were injection-site reactions. Headache and pain in the extremity were the most common systemic adverse reactions. Most of these local and systemic adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. Vaccine-related serious adverse reactions were reported for 0.01 % subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and subjects who received placebo. Data from a clinical trial (n=368) demonstrated that the current ref rigerated formulation has a saf ety profile comparable to that of the frozen formulation. b. Tabulated summary of adverse events In clinical trials, general saf ety has been evaluated in more than 57,000 adults vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. Table 1 presents vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater incidence in the vaccine group versus the placebo group within 42 days postvaccination in the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety trial (ZEST) study and in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of Shingles Prevention Study (SPS). Additional adverse reactions, spontaneously reported through post-marketing surveillance, are also included in Table 1. As these events are reported voluntarily from a population of  uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably calculate their f requency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Consequently, the frequencies of these adverse reactions have been estimated based on the adverse events reported in SPS and ZEST (regardless of vaccine relationship assigned by the investigator). The adverse reactions are assigned frequency categories using the following convention: Very Common (≥ 1/10); Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); Rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); Very rare (&lt; 1/10,000) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes and Varicella/varicella-like rashes in clinical trials In clinical trials the number of  herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes within the 42-day postvaccination was low in both ZOSTAVAX and placebo groups. The majority of rashes have been rated as mild to moderate; no complications from rash have been observed in the clinical setting. Most of the reporting rashes that were VZV positive by PCR analysis were associated with wild-type VZV.

1 Clinical trials experience. 2 Solicited adverse reaction within 5 days post-vaccination. c. Description of  selected adverse reactions Injection site reactions Vaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions were significantly greater for subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who received placebo. In SPS, the overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions were 48 % for ZOSTAVAX and 17 % for placebo in subjects 60 years of age and older. In ZEST, the overall incidence of vaccine-related injection site adverse reactions were 63.9 % f or ZOSTAVAX and 14.4 % for placebo in subjects 50 to 59 years of age. Most of these adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. In other clinical trials evaluating ZOSTAVAX in subjects 50 years of age or older, including a study of concomitantly administered inactivated influenza vaccine, a higher rate of injection-site adverse experiences of mild-to-moderate intensity was reported among subjects 50-59 years of age compared with subjects ≥ 60 years of age (see section 5.1). ZOSTAVAX was administered either subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM) in subjects 50 years of age or older (see section 5.1). The general safety prof iles of the SC and IM routes were otherwise comparable, but injection-site adverse reactions were significantly less f requent in the IM group (34 %) compared with the SC group (64 %). Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In SPS and ZEST, the number of subjects who reported herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes was less than 0.2 % f or ZOSTAVAX and placebo groups, with no significant difference observed between the two groups. The number of subjects who reported varicella/varicella-like rashes was less than 0.7 % for ZOSTAVAX and placebo.

The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from any specimens in SPS or ZEST. VZV was detected in one (0.01 %) specimen from a ZOSTAVAX recipient reporting a varicella/varicella-like rash; however, the virus strain (wild type or Oka/Merck strain) could not be determined. Across all other clinical trials, the Oka/Merck strain was identif ied by PCR analysis from the lesion specimens of only two subjects who reported varicella-like rashes (onset on Day 8 and 17). d. Special populations Adults with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination ZOSTAVAX was administered to subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination (see section 5.1). The safety prof ile was generally similar to that seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. Adults on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids In subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, and 6 weeks or more following vaccination, the safety profile was generally comparable to that seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS (see sections 4.3 and 5.1). HIV-infected adults with conserved immune function In a clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to HIV-infected adults (18 years of age or older, CD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL) (see section 5.1). The safety profile was generally similar to the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. Adverse events were followed up to Day 42 post vaccination and serious adverse events throughout the entire study period (i.e. through Day 180). Of the 295 ZOSTAVAX recipients, one case of serious vaccine related maculo-papular rash was reported on Day 4 following Dose 1 of ZOSTAVAX (see section 4.3). VZV-seronegative adults Based on limited data f rom 2 clinical trials that enrolled VZV-seronegative or low seropositive subjects (30 years of age or older) receiving live attenuated zoster vaccine, injection site and systemic adverse experiences were generally similar to those reported by other subjects who received ZOSTAVAX in clinical trials, with 2 of the 27 subjects reporting fever. No subjects reported varicella-like or herpes zoster-like rashes. No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were reported. e. Other studies Adults receiving additional doses/revaccination In a clinical study, adults 60 years of age or older received a second dose of ZOSTAVAX 42 days following the initial dose (see section 5.1). The f requency of vaccine-related adverse experiences after the second dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to that seen with the first dose. In another study, ZOSTAVAX was administered as a booster dose to HZ history-negative subjects 70 years of age or older who had received a f irst dose approximately 10 years previously, and as a f irst dose to HZ history-negative subjects 70 years of age or older (see section 5.1). The frequency of vaccine-related adverse experiences after the booster dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to that seen with the first dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

*The analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that included all subjects randomised in the ZEST study

The SPS study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in which 38,546 subjects were randomised to receive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX or placebo and were followed for the development of zoster for a median of 3.1 years (range 31 days to 4.9 years).

Administration of a higher than recommended dose of ZOSTAVAX was reported rarely and the adverse reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of ZOSTAVAX. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine; ATC code: J07BK02 Mechanism of action Anyone who has been infected with VZV, including those without a clinical history of varicella, is at risk f or developing zoster. This risk appears to be causally related to a decline in VZV-specif ic immunity. ZOSTAVAX was shown to boost VZV-specific immunity, which is thought to be the mechanism by which it protects against zoster and its complications (see Immunogenicity). Clinical Ef f icacy The protective clinical ef ficacy of ZOSTAVAX was demonstrated in two large, randomised, placebo controlled clinical trials where subjects received ZOSTAVAX subcutaneously (see Tables 2 and 3). ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in subjects 50 to 59 years of age : The ZEST study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in which 22,439 subjects were randomised to receive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX or placebo and were followed for the development of zoster for a median of 1.3 years (range 0 to 2 years). Final determination of zoster cases was made by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [86 %], or in the absence of virus detection, as determined by a clinical evaluation committee [14 %]. ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared to placebo (see Table 2). Table 2: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on zoster incidence compared with placebo in the ZEST trial in subjects 50 to 59 years of age* Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 years of age and older: Medicinal product no longer authorised

ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared with placebo (see Table 3).

* The analysis was perf ormed on the Modif ied Intent-To-Treat (MITT) population that included all subjects randomised in the study who were followed for at least 30 days post-vaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of  zoster within the first 30 days post vaccination † Age strata at randomisation were 60-69 and ≥ 70 years of  age In the SPS, the reduction in zoster was seen in almost all dermatomes. Ophthalmic zoster occurred in 35 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 69 subjects who received placebo. Impaired vision occurred in 2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 9 who received placebo. ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) compared with placebo (see Table 4). In subjects who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX decreased the risk of subsequently developing PHN. In the vaccine group, the risk of developing PHN after zoster was 9 % (27/315), while in the placebo group it was 13 % (80/642). This effect was more prominent in the group of  older subjects (≥ 70 years of age), where the risk of developing PHN after zoster was reduced to 10 % in the vaccine group vs. 19 % for the placebo group.

ZOSTAVAX reduced the incidence of zoster with severe and long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration score &gt; 600) by 73 % (95 % CI: [46 to 87 %]) compared with placebo (11 vs. 40 cases, respectively).

Reduction of zoster pain severity-by-duration in vaccinated individuals who developed zoster With regard to the acute pain (pain between 0-30 days) there was no statistically significant dif ference between the vaccine group and the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, among vaccinated individuals who developed PHN, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced PHN-associated (chronic) pain compared with placebo. In the period from 90 days after rash onset to the end of follow-up, there was a 57 % reduction in the severity-by-duration score (average scores of 347 for ZOSTAVAX and 805 for placebo; p=0.016).

Overall, among vaccinated individuals who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced overall acute and chronic zoster-associated pain compared with placebo. Over the 6-month (acute and chronic) follow-up period, there was a 22 % reduction (p=0.008) in the severity-by-duration score and a 52 % (95 % CI: [7 to 74 %]) reduction (f rom 6.2 % to 3.5 %) in the risk of having zoster with severe and long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration score of &gt; 600). Zostavax persistence of protection The persistence of protection following vaccination has been evaluated through longer-term follow-up in Short-term Persistence Substudy (STPS) and Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS) and supports the continued benef it of  ZOSTAVAX throughout the f ollow-up periods studied. The STPS was initiated to accrue additional information on the persistence of vaccine eff icacy for subjects who received ZOSTAVAX in SPS. Persistence of ZOSTAVAX efficacy was studied 4 to 7 years post-vaccination in the STPS, which included 7,320 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and 6,950 subjects previously vaccinated with placebo in the SPS (mean age at enrollment was 73.3 years); and 7 to 10 years postvaccination in the Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS), which included 6,867 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (mean age at enrollment into the LTPS was 74.5 years). The median follow-up was ~1.2 years (range is one day to 2.2 years) and ~3.9 years (range is one week to 4.75 years) in STPS and LTPS, respectively. During the course of  the STPS, placebo recipients were offered ZOSTAVAX, at which time they were considered to have completed the STPS. A concurrent placebo control was not available in the LTPS; data from prior placebo recipients were used to estimate vaccine eff icacy. In the STPS, there were 84 evaluable zoster cases [8.4/1,000 person-years] in the ZOSTAVAX group and 95 evaluable cases [14.0/1,000 person-years] in the placebo group. The estimated vaccine efficacy during the STPS follow-up period was 40 % (95 % CI: [18 to 56 %]) for zoster incidence, 60 % (95 % CI: [-10 to 87 %]) for PHN incidence and 50 % (95 % CI: [14 to 71 %]) for zoster BOI. In the LTPS, there were 263 evaluable zoster cases reported among 261 patients [10.3/1000 person-years]. The estimated vaccine ef ficacy during the LTPS follow-up period was 21 % (95 % CI: [11 to 30 %]) for zoster incidence, 35 % (95 % CI: [9 to 56 %]) for PHN incidence and 37 % (95 % CI: [27 to 46 %]) for zoster BOI. Long-term effectiveness study in individuals 50 years of age or older In a large-scale US prospective observational cohort study of the long-term effectiveness of ZOSTAVAX, individuals 50 years of age or older at the time of vaccination were followed for the occurrence of HZ and PHN using validated endpoints. Out of 1,505,647 study individuals, 507,444 received ZOSTAVAX between 2007 and 2018. A total of 75,135 confirmed HZ cases and 4,954 confirmed PHN cases (&gt; 90 days of zoster-associated pain) were observed. The results showed that ZOSTAVAX is effective in reducing HZ and PHN incidence for over 8-10 years in vaccinated individuals as compared to an unvaccinated reference group. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against HZ by age at vaccination and average VE estimates over the first 3, 5, 8 and 10 years postvaccination are shown below (see Table 6).

ZOSTAVAX elicited significantly higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks postvaccination compared with placebo. ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) Within ZEST, immune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a random 10 % subcohort (n=1,136 for ZOSTAVAX and n=1,133 for placebo) of the subjects enrolled in the ZEST. ZOSTAVAX elicited signif icantly higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks post-vaccination compared with placebo. When evaluated at 4 weeks post-vaccination, the immunogenicity of the current refrigerator -stable formulation was shown to be similar to the immunogenicity of the earlier frozen formulation of ZOSTAVAX. Subjects who received ZOSTAVAX by SC (subcutaneous) or IM (intramuscular) route In an open-label, randomised, controlled clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered either by SC route or by IM route to 353 subjects 50 years of age or older. Subjects with severe thrombocytopenia or any other coagulation disorder were excluded. The VZV specific immune responses to ZOSTAVAX at Week 4 post-vaccination were comparable whether administered by SC or IM route. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 473 adults, 60 years of age or older, were randomised to receive a single dose of  ZOSTAVAX either concomitantly (N=237), or nonconcomitantly (N=236) with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. At four weeks post-vaccination, the VZV-specific immune responses following concomitant use were not similar to the VZV-specific immune responses following nonconcomitant administration. However in a US effectiveness cohort study of 35,025 adults ≥ 60 years old, no increased risk of herpes zoster was observed in individuals who received ZOSTAVAX and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine concomitantly (n=16,532) as compared to individuals receiving ZOSTAVAX one month to one year after 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (n=18,493) in routine practice. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing the incidence rate of HZ in the two groups was 1.04 (95 % CI, 0.92, 1.16) over a median follow-up of 4.7 years. The data do not indicate that concomitant administration alters the effectiveness of ZOSTAVAX. Subjects with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 100 subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster prior to vaccination to assess immunogenicity and safety (see section 4.8) of ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX induced a significantly higher VZV-specific immune response at 4 weeks post-vaccination, compared with placebo. VZV-specific immune responses were generally similar in subjects 50 to 59 compared to subjects ≥ 60 years of age. Adults receiving additional doses/revaccination The need for, or timing of, a booster dose with ZOSTAVAX has not yet been determined. In an open-label study, ZOSTAVAX was administered as: (1) a booster dose to 201 zoster history-negative subjects 70 years of age or older who had received a first dose approximately 10 years previously as participants in the SPS, and (2) a f irst dose to 199 zoster history-negative subjects 70 years of age or older. The VZV-specific immune responses to vaccine 6 weeks post-vaccination was comparable in the booster dose and first dose group. Subjects on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 206 subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, and 6 weeks or more following vaccination to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of ZOSTAVAX. Compared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX induced a higher VZV-specific immune response at 6 weeks post-vaccination. HIV-infected adults with conserved immune function In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to HIV-infected adults (18 years of age or older; median age 49 years) on appropriate antiretroviral therapy with conserved immune function (CD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL). Although, ZOSTAVAX is indicated as a single dose regimen (see section 4.2), a two-dose regimen was used. 286 subjects received two doses and 9 subjects received only one dose. The VZV-specific immune responses following Doses 1 and 2 were similar (see section 4.3). Immunocompromised subjects The vaccine has not been studied in subjects with impaired immunity.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with ZOSTAVAX in all the subsets of paediatric population (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine (live)

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are vaccinated because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. -If  you get any of  the side ef f ects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side ef f ects not listed in this leaf let. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX 3. How to use ZOSTAVAX 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store ZOSTAVAX 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for ZOSTAVAX is a vaccine used to prevent shingles (zoster) and zoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles. ZOSTAVAX is used to vaccinate individuals 50 years of age or older. ZOSTAVAX cannot be used to treat existing shingles or the pain associated with existing shingles. Disease information on shingles: What is shingles? Shingles is a painf ul, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of  the body and can last f or several weeks. It may lead to severe and long-lasting pain and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin infections, weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision can occur. Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus becomes active again and causes shingles. What is PHN? After the shingles blisters heal, pain can last f or months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting nerve pain is called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. 2. What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX Do not receive ZOSTAVAX Medicinal product no longer authorised

Contents of the pack and other information 1. What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for ZOSTAVAX is a vaccine used to prevent shingles (zoster) and zoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that f ollows shingles. ZOSTAVAX is used to vaccinate individuals 50 years of age or older. ZOSTAVAX cannot be used to treat existing shingles or the pain associated with existing shingles. Disease information on shingles: What is shingles? Shingles is a painf ul, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several weeks. It may lead to severe and long-lasting pain and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin infections, weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of  hearing or vision can occur. Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus becomes active again and causes shingles. What is PHN? After the shingles blisters heal, pain can last f or months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting nerve pain is called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. 2. What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX Do not receive ZOSTAVAX Medicinal product no longer authorised
