## 1. Introduction

On 31 March 2022, the MAH submitted final results of Study R10933-10987-COV-2069 involving paediatric patients in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure 005.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study R10933-10987-COV-2069 is part of a clinical development program.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

There is no specific paediatric formulation. Each of the casirivimab and imdevimab formulated drug substances (FDS) consist of purified protein in an aqueous buffered solution, containing L-histidine, pH 6.0, sucrose and polysorbate 80. Casirivmab and imdevimab drug products are supplied as liquid solutions for intravenous (IV) and SC administrations. The DPs are preservative-free and nonpyrogenic.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:

Submission of final results of Study R10933-10987-COV-2069 involving paediatric patients in accordance with Art.46 of the paediatric regulation and to address the commitment which arose from the original marketing authorization (EMEA-H-C-005814) as reported in the CHMP list of questions dated 16th September 2021. This study was a part of the PIP procedures EMEA-002964-PIP01-21-M01 and EMEA-002965-PIP01-21-M01 (Study 5) - R19033-10987-COV-2069: Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Household Contacts of Individuals Infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The final analysis for Study COV-2069, reported in clinical study report (CSR) Addendum (#2), presents the completed 7-month follow-up period efficacy results and 8-month safety data of a single subcutaneous (SC) administration of casirivimab / imdevimab 1200 mg on the prevention of SARS CoV-2 infections (overall and symptomatic infections) in participants who were uninfected at baseline (Cohort A) and participants who were asymptomatic and SARS-COV-2 positive at baseline (Cohort B). The analyses presented in this addendum are based on the final database lock date of 4 November 2021.

Findings from the COV-2069 study have been previously presented in two separate reports prior to completion of the study:

● The original COV-2069 Primary Analysis CSR (dated 15 Jun 2021) provided the final primary analysis for the primary and key secondary endpoints at Day 29 (end of the efficacy assessment period [EAP]). Findings were presented on two distinct study populations: Cohort A analyses evaluated infection prevention in participants who were uninfected at baseline, and Cohort B focused on early treatment to prevent symptomatic progression in participants with asymptomatic infection at baseline. A total of 3029 participants were randomized and enrolled in Cohort A (N = 2621) and Cohort B (N = 314). Efficacy data for primary and secondary endpoints up to the cutoff date of 11 Mar 2021 were included. The safety population included all participants randomized through 28 January 2021. Additional 554 participants randomized between the study start date through 16 October 2020 were included in the administrative assessment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

● Subsequently, a Primary Analysis CSR Addendum (#1) (dated 29 Sep 2021) was submitted to summarize the cumulative key efficacy and safety results for all enrolled participants up to the data cut-off of 1 July 2021, which includes an additional 269 participants enrolled in Cohort A and Cohort B after the data cut-off for the original Primary Analysis CSR. The results for CSR Addendum #1 were considered a sensitivity analysis of the findings presented in the Primary Analysis CSR and corroborated the efficacy and safety conclusions from the primary analysis for the study.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study R10933-10987-COV-2069: Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Household Contacts of Individuals Infected with SARSCoV-2

## Methodology

Adults and adolescents (age &gt; 12 years) who were household contacts of the first household member known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection (index case), but who were themselves either not infected or asymptomatic (having no active respiratory or non-respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19) at the time of screening. In this study, the participant must have been sharing the same residence as the index case and must have had a close exposure to the index case.

Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of placebo or casirivimab + imdevimab on Day 1. Randomization was performed on an individual participant basis and was stratified by local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 and age/weight groups. However, for analysis, cohort allocation was based on results from the central laboratory assessment of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR status at baseline: participants who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., uninfected) were allocated to Cohort A, and participants who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., with asymptomatic infection) were allocated to Cohort B. Each cohort was further subdivided based on baseline serology results from the central laboratory. To rule-out prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, participants were assessed for the presence of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicative of prior infection: anti-spike [S1] IgA, anti-spike [S1] IgG, and antinucleocapsid IgG. Participants were considered seronegative if all available serology tests were negative, seropositive if any of the tests were positive, or sero-undetermined if results were missing or inconclusive

No specific paediatric formulation was used in Study COV-2069. Both adult and adolescent participants (i.e., age &gt; 12 years) received a single-dose 1200 mg casirivimab+imdevimab (600 mg per mAb) or single dose matching placebo, administered as 4 SC injections in the abdomen or thigh. For adults and paediatric participants &gt; 10 kg investigators had the option to use an infusion pump for SC administration of study drug containing the combined volume with both mAbs.

For each participant, the study comprised three periods: a 1-day screening/baseline period, a 1-month EAP, and a 7-month follow-up period. During the EAP, nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples for analysis of SARSCoV-2 RT-qPCR (test) were collected for all participants weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed by RT-qPCR by the central laboratory up to Day 29 (end of EAP). During the follow-up period, only participants who were RT-qPCR positive and participants who became symptomatic with COVID-19 would continue to have weekly NP swab samples collected. Assessments continued until there were two consecutive negative (&gt; 24 hours) RT-qPCR results or until the end of study visit.

## Study Participants

In this study, 3375 participants were screened. A total of 3298 participants were randomized, of whom 3270 were treated: 2867 in Cohort A; 335 in Cohort B; 1 in Cohort 1A2; and 67 in the SARS-CoV-2 Undetermined group3 (refer to CSR Addendum #2, Study COV-2069, Table 1). A total of 94.2% of participants completed the end of study visit at the time of the study completion.

In Cohort A, adolescents (age &gt; 12 to &lt; 18 years) comprised a total of 74/1683 (4.4%) participants in the efficacy analysis and 98/2867 (3.4%) participants in the safety analysis (Table 1). In addition, a 10-year-old paediatric participant was enrolled into Cohort A1 (placebo group, baseline-seropositive).

## Results

## Overview of safety

## Safety in Adolescent Participants Who Were Uninfected at Baseline (Cohort A)

Adverse Events in Paediatric Participants (SAF-A and SAFA1) Cohort A included paediatric participants (≥12 years and &lt;18 years of age; termed adolescents). In addition, a 10 -year -old paediatric participant was enrolled into Cohort A1 (placebo group, baseline-seropositive) and did not experience any TEAEs during the study.

In cohort A, the proportion of paediatric participants with TEAEs of Asymptomatic COVID-19 andCOVID-19 were significantly higher in the placebo group than the casirivimab+imdevimab group (Table below). Conversely, the proportion of pediatric participants with TEAEs of Injection site reaction (ISR) was higher in the casirivimab + imdevimab group compared to placebo although comparable to adult participants. Overall, the types of TEAEs experienced by adolescent participants were similar to those observed in the adult population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TEAEs experienced by &gt;1 paediatric participant were:

- Placebo group: Asymptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19, Nasal congestion, and Headache
- Casirivimab+imdevimab group: ISR, Asymptomatic COVID19, Cough, Oropharyngeal pain, and Ligament sprain

## Safety in Adolescent Participants with Asymptomatic Infection at Baseline (Cohort B)

Paediatric participants in cohort B included adolescent particip ants only (age ≥12 to &lt;18 years). No participant&lt;12 years of age enrolled in cohort B.

COVID-19 was the only TEAE reported by &gt;1 paediatric participant during the study. Regardless of age group in cohort B, the incidence of COVID-19 was higher in the placebo group than the casirivimab+imdevimab group.

Overall, the types and severity of TEAEs experienced by adolescent participants were similar to those experienced by adults in the study.

## Overview Efficacy

Supportive exploratory analyses conducted in the paediatric participant population in cohort A was performed.

Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infections (COVID-19) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants (81.2% compared to placebo) in paediatric (≥12 to &lt;18 years old) participants (100% compared to placebo).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for all SARS-CoV-2 infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants (68.2% compared to placebo) for paediatric (≥12 years to &lt;18 years old) participants 74.5% compared to placebo).

## Efficacy Analyses in Participants Regardless of Baseline Serostatus

Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infections (COVID-19) in participants regardless of baseline serostatus (79.7% compared to placebo) (Table below) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants (81.2% compared to placebo);

## Clinical Pharmacology

Key clinical pharmacokinetics results for adolescent participants are listed below:

As of the final database lock (DBL) for this PK analysis, a total of 3270 subjects (3125 adults, 144 adolescents, and 1 paediatric participant [&lt; 12 years]) were allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts based on age (subjects ≥ 12 years in Cohort A and B; and subjects &lt; 12 years in Cohort A1) and SARS -CoV2 infection status at baseline (negative subj ects in Cohort A and A1; positive subjects in Cohort B and B1), as measured by central laboratory SARS -CoV2 RT -qPCR.

All subjects ≥ 12 years were randomized to receive a single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab +imdevimab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio per coh ort. Of the 3270 participants who were in the safety analysis set, 295 participants were included in the PK analysis set (PKAS).

(Subset 3)

Note: PK samples from placebo patients are not analyzed. Percentages are based on the total in the safety analysis set. See Section 2.3for definitions of analysispopulations.

There were three defined subsets for participants ≥ 12 years: sentinel (subset 1) with dense pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling; safety (subset 2) with sparse PK sampling, and all other subjects (subset 3) for which no samples for PK were collected. Paediatric participants &lt; 12 years were to be randomized to receive a single dose of casirivimab+imdevimab (SC [408, 792, or 1200 mg] or intramuscular [48, 96, or 144 mg]; weigh-tiered dose) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio per cohort. There were initially two defined subsets for participants &lt; 12 years: paediatric sentinel (subset 4) with sparse PK sampling schedule, and all other paediatric participants (subset 5) with sparse PK sampling schedule. However, only 1 paediatric participant &lt; 12 years was enrolled in the sentinel subset, in Cohort A1, and received placebo SC.

The concentration over time profiles for total casirivimab and total imdevimab following SC administration were similar to each other and were characterized by an initial absorption phase (adults) followed by a mono-exponential elimination phase.

## Assessor's comment

Concentrations in serum in paediatric participants (≥12 and &lt;18) with body weights ≥40 kg were slightly higher than those observed in adults. The argument that this may be contributed to differences in body weight distribution is agreed. External validation of paediatric PK data by use of pop PK modelling is requested.

Due to the sparse nature of sample collection, non-compartmental analysis was not conducted in the paediatric population.

As shown in Figure 6, in the paediatric participants ≥12 years and &lt;18 years (weighing ≥ 40 kg), mono-exponential elimination phase was similar to that observed for adults.

The first post-dose serum sample in paediatric participants was available at Day28, hence no data are available for assessment of the absorption phase in these participants.

Casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations in serum in paediatric participants (≥12 and &lt;18) with body weights ≥40 kg were slightly higher than those observed in adults likely due to differences in body weight distribution.

Casirivimab and imdevimab were detectable in serum over 224 days of sample collection following a single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab.

## Immunogenicity

In paediatric participants, the ADA incidence and titer and the NAb incidence observed were similar to that observed in overall study population.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Starting from protocol amendment 3, adolescent subjects ≥12 to &lt;18 years of age (weight ≥40 kg) were eligible to be enrolled and randomized into the overall study, therefore all paediatric participants who enrolled were adolescents.

Starting from protocol amendment 4, paediatric participants aged &lt;12 years were eligible to be enrolled and randomized into the overall study. A single paediatric participant (aged 10 years) enrolled into cohort A1 and was randomized to the placebo group but was not included in the efficacy analysis because they were seropositive at baseline; however, the participant was included in the safety analysis.

No specific paediatric formulation was used in Study COV-2069. Both adult and adolescent participants (i.e., age &gt; 12 years) received a single-dose SC of 1200 mg casirivimab+imdevimab (600 mg per mAb) or single dose-matching placebo.

In Cohort A, the safety analysis population included 99 paediatric participants, 98 adolescents (age &gt; 12 to &lt; 18 years) and one child participant (age 10 years). Overall, the types and severity of TEAEs experienced by adolescent participants were similar to those experienced by adults in the study. The single child participant (age 10 years) did not experience any TEAEs during the study

In Cohort B, the safety analysis included 43 adolescents (age &gt; 12 to &lt; 18 years). Overall, the types and severity of TEAEs experienced by adolescent participants were similar to those experienced by adults in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with casirivimab + imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infections (COVID-19) similar to that in baseline seronegative participants (100% compared to placebo in paediatric participants)

Treatment with casirivimab + imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for all SARS-CoV-2 infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants (74.5% compared to placebo in paediatric participants)

The interpretation of results in paediatric participants is limited due to small sample sizes and small number of events.

Casirivimab and imdevimab were detectable in serum over 224 days of sample collection following a single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab.

Due to the sparse PK sample collection, non-compartmental analysis was not conducted in the paediatric population. However, data indicate that in the paediatric participants ≥12 years and &lt;18 years (weighing ≥ 40 kg), mono-exponential elimination phase is similar to that observed for adults. No data are available for assessment of the absorption phase in these participants.

Concentrations in serum in paediatric participants (≥12 and &lt;18) with body weights ≥40 kg were slightly higher than those observed in adults. The argument that this may be contributed to differences in body weight distribution is agreed. External validation of paediatric PK data by use of population PK modelling is requested.

It is agreed that in paediatric participants, the ADA incidence and titer and the NAb incidence observed were similar to that observed in overall study population.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Casirivimab+imdevimab was well tolerated in adolescent (age ≥12 to &lt;18 years). The safety profile in adolescents was comparable to the safety profile in adults. The types of TEAEs experienced by adolescent participants were similar to those observed in the adult population.

The treatment effect observed in supportive exploratory analyses conducted in the adolescent participants in Cohort A was consistent with the treatment effect observed in the adult participants in this cohort for the 8-month study period.

Based on the PK results provided no changes for the SmPC section 5.2 is warranted.

## MAH response

In the overall cohort B population (asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at baseline) including adults and adolescents, and regardless of serostatus at baseline (including seronegative, seropositive, and indeterminate), a single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab (REGN10933+REGN10987) prevented the progression to symptomatic COVID-19 in recently infected asymptomatic participants during the entire 8 month study period, with a relative risk reduction of 37.8% as compared to placebo.

These results are similar to the Cohort B efficacy results in adults and adolescents, regardless of serostatus at baseline, previously reported in Table 34 of CSR addendum 1 demonstrating a 38.5% relative risk reduction during the primary efficacy analysis period (29 days).

In adolescent participants (age 12 to &lt;18 years), casirivimab + imdevimab as compared to placebo, prevented the progression to symptomatic COVID -19 during the entire 8 -month study period with a relative risk reduction of 73.9% (Table 1). In participants who were age ≥18 years, casirivimab+imdevimab, as compared to placebo, preve nted the progression to symptomatic COVID -19 with a relative risk reduction of 29.8% during the entire 8 -month study period.

Although greater relative risk reduction is observed in the seronegative adolescent population (100%) compared to the seronegative adult population (80.4%) (Table 17 in CSR addendum 2) and compared to the combined seronegative adult and adolescent population (81.2%) (Table 16 in CSR addendum 2), interpretation of this post-hoc analysis is limited due to the small number of symptomatic infections in the adolescent population and the small sample size of the adolescent population.

In seropositive adolescents aged 12 to &lt; 18 years, there were no symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in either casirivimab+imdevimab or placebo groups. The interpretation of the relative risk reduction with casirivimab+imdevimab in the seropositive adult population (40.1%) limited due to low symptomatic infection events in both the casirivimab+imdevimab and placebo groups, consistent with pre-existing natural immunity (seropositivity) conferring protection against infection.

Similar to the overall Cohort B efficacy results in seronegative adults and adolescents, previously reported in Table 29 of CSR addendum 1, demonstrating a 31.1% relative risk reduction during the 29day primary efficacy analysis period, new analyses demonstrate a relative risk reduction of 30.3% during the entire 8-month study period. In the new analyses where efficacy results are reported separately by age group, there is a greater relative risk reduction observed in the seronegative adolescent population (62.5%) compared to the seronegative adult population (24.4%).

Interpretation of this post-hoc analysis by age group is limited by the small sample size of the subgroups. The interpretation of the relative risk reduction with casirivimab+imdevimab in the seropositive adolescent (100%) and adult population (20%) is limited to low infection events in both groups, consistent with their known pre-existing natural immunity (seropositivity) conferring protection against infection.

## QUESTION 3

3. External validation of paediatric PK data by use of pop PK modelling should be provided.

## MAH Response

The external validation of population PK modelling is presented below. The results demonstrate that the population PK models, which incorporated allometric scaling and age impact to account for the effect of body weight and age on PK parameters in pediatric subjects, were able to predict

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum in pediatric subjects for the pediatric dose equivalents to the adult 1200 mg SC dose well, indicating the model-based predictions based on adult data are consistent with the observed pediatric data.

## Method

Two population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models with the same model structure were developed for casirivimab and imdevimab based on an analysis dataset comprised of 3687 casirivimab and 3716 imdevimab adult subjects from three clinical studies (R10933-10987-COV-2067, R10933-10987-COV2069, and R10933-10987-COV-20145). The developed PopPK models for casirivimab and imdevimab were 2-compartment models with linear elimination and first-order absorption following subcutaneous (SC) dosing (R10933-PK-21053-SR-01V1). The PopPK models for casirivimab and imdevimab were used to perform simulations in virtual adult and pediatric populations receiving weight-tiered single dose of casirivimab+imdevimab given subcutaneously as outlined below. PopPK model parameters were fixed to the estimates from the final PK models of casirivimab and imdevimab (R10933-PK21053-SR-01V1) with inter-subject variability incorporated via simulated interindividual random effects. Given the uncertainty in the estimation of the weight related exponents scaling the structural parameters in the analyses of the adult data, allometric scaling based on theoretical weight related exponents and age impact were applied to account for the effect of body size and age on PK parameters in pediatric populations (Basu et al., 2020).Simulated concentration-time profiles (median and 90% prediction interval) of casirivimab and imdevimab overlaid with observed data from Study R10933-10987-COV- 2069 are presented.

- Dosing setup:
- 1200 mg SC single dose casirivimab+imdevimab for ≥40 kg group

## MAH's CONCLUSION

Overlay plots of population PK simulated concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum [median (90% Prediction Interval)] versus observed concentrations for each pediatric body weight tier showed good agreement between predicted and observed concentrations through day 112, with the population PK model slightly underestimating concentrations at day 224.

These results from the validation demonstrate that the population PK models, which incorporated allometric scaling and age impact to account for the effect of body weight and age on PK parameters in pediatric subjects, were able to predict concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum in pediatric subjects for the pediatric dose equivalents to the adult 1200mg SC dose well, indicating the model-based predictions based on adult data are consistent with the observed pediatric data.

## Assessor's comment

From a methodological point of view, the MAH's approach is not supported and is contradictory to the EMA Q&amp;A (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/scientificguidelines/clinical-pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-questions-answers).

Maturation effect in terms of additional age-related effects in addition to the weight effect is not expected to affect the PK of mabs in subjects at the age of 12 and above but only at very young age and thus at weight below 20 kg. Thus, the MAH's approach to include age-related effects in addition to weight-related effects for simulating the exposure for adolescents above 20 kg of weight is not supported. Of note, there is data of only one adolescent subjects at weight below 40 kg. The MAH was reasoning that age impact was applied to account for the effect of body size and age on PK parameters in paediatric populations, given the uncertainty in the estimation of the weight related exponents scaling the structural parameters in the analyses of the adult data. Instead, the MAH may have tried to estimate the weight effect based on a comprehensive weight range, to investigate the impact of fixed versus estimated allometric exponents. No definite model selection to justify the chosen maturation function has been provided, in addition. External validation based on the adult pop PK model is thus considered missing, even for the weight category above 40 kg (adolescents).

Simulated concentration-time profiles (median and 90% prediction interval) of casirivimab and imdevimab overlaid with observed data from Study R10933-10987-COV- 2069 are presented, with is supported.

Nevertheless, paediatric PK data (observations) and presented simulations indicate the predominant weight effect and the observed paediatric PK data indicate consistency. Nevertheless, the issue of accounting for weight and age-related effects may become relevant in case of a potential extension of indication for other paediatric age groups.

Issue not further pursued.
