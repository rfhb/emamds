## 2.  Scientific discussion

## 2.1.  Information on the development program

The MAH stated that A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants B7471011 is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

20vPnC is a sterile liquid suspension formulation containing saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F individually conjugated to CRM197. The vaccine is formulated to contain 2.2 μg of each saccharide, except for 4.4 μg of 6B, per 0.5-mL dose. The vaccine contains 5 mM succinate buffer, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.02% polysorbate 80, and 125 μg aluminium as aluminium phosphate, per 0.5-mL dose.

13vPnC is a sterile liquid suspension formulation containing saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated to CRM197. The vaccine is formulated to contain 2.2 μg of each saccharide, except for 4.4 μg of 6B, per 0.5-mL dose. The vaccine contains 295 μg succinate buffer, 0.85% sodium chloride, 100 μg polysorbate 80, and 125 μg aluminum as aluminum phosphate, per 0.5-mL dose. The 13vPnC supply is considered representative of Prevnar 13, as it is manufactured according to the approved Prevnar 13 commercial drug product process using commercially released vaccine drug substances.20vPnC and 13vPnC are both white suspensions and have a matching appearance and were supplied as prefilled syringes.

DTaP combination vaccine is indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus, and poliomyelitis. The vaccine is supplied as a prefilled syringe.

Hib vaccine is indicated for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Hib. The vaccine is supplied in vials.

MMR is a live virus vaccine for vaccination against measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles).  The vaccine is supplied in vials.

## 2.3.  Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1.  Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- B7471011: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double- Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants.

## 2.3.2.  Clinical study

B7471011: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants.

## Description

## Methods

## Study participants

Approximately 2000 infants ≥42 to ≤98 days of age at the time of consent, by their parents/legal guardians, were enrolled. Infants were eligible if they were naïve to pneumococcal vaccination. Healthy male and female infants determined by clinical assessment (including medical history and clinical judgment) and born at &gt;36 weeks of gestation and 2 months of age (≥42 to ≤98 days) at the time of consent (the day of birth is considered day of life 1) were included in the study.

## Study design

This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at investigator sites in the continental United States and the territory of Puerto Rico. The purpose of this study was to describe safety and conduct the noninferiority immunogenicity comparison of 20vPnC to the licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 13vPnC, in infants receiving a 4-dose series. Data were also generated on responses to key routine pediatric vaccines given concomitantly with 20vPnC, where 13vPnC served as an active comparator.

## Treatments

The participants were administered either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. This was consistent with the pneumococcal vaccine recommendations for infants in the United States (including Puerto Rico). 13vPnC served as the comparator to 20vPnC for assessment of safety and immunogenicity. Participants received the same vaccine (20vPnC or 13vPnC) for all 4 doses. It was planned that each participant participated in the trial for approximately 16 to 19 months. Participants received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 20vPnC or 13vPnC intramuscularly into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg at each vaccination visit (Doses 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively). Participants also received a dose of a DTaP-containing vaccine in combination with other antigens (including poliovirus and hepatitis B) (PEDIARIX) and a dose of a Hib vaccine (HIBERIX) at Visits 1, 2, and 3. MMR (M-M-RII) and varicella (VARIVAX). Vaccines were administered concomitantly with 20vPnC or 13vPnC at Visit 5 with Dose 4. All concomitant vaccinations were administered into a limb other than the left leg (the site of 20vPnC or 13vPnC injection).

## Sample size

Approximately 2000 participants were enrolled to achieve a target of 1600 evaluable participants (800 in each vaccine group) at the follow-up time point 1 month after Dose 3.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC (control vaccine) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age (Doses 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) by site-based randomization. Each participant participated in the trial for approximately 16 to 19 months (Figure 1).

## Statistical Methods

The primary safety objectives were evaluated by descriptive summary statistics for local reactions, systemic events, AEs (including SAEs) and NDCMCs. AEs were categorized according to the MedDRA.

The primary and key secondary pneumococcal immunogenicity objectives for the 20vPnC were evaluated by hypothesis tests for noninferiority of 20vPnC to 13vPnC based on serotype-specific IgG results 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4. The primary concomitant immunogenicity objectives were evaluated by hypothesis tests for noninferiority of concomitant vaccines given with 20vPnC to with 13vPnC based on antibody levels induced by the concomitant vaccines 1 month after Dose 3. Other secondary and exploratory immunogenicity objectives were evaluated by descriptive summary statistics.

## Recruitment

Infants ≥42 to ≤98 days of age were eligible if they were naïve to pneumococcal vaccination. This study population was selected as this was the historical population studied for licensure of 13vPnC in infants. The participants were administered either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. This was consistent with the pneumococcal vaccine recommendations for infants in the United States (including Puerto Rico).

## Baseline data

Demographic and baseline characteristics of sex, race, ethnicity, geographic region (USA/Puerto Rico), and age for the safety population were similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups (Table 5). Most participants were White and non-Hispanic/non-Latino, approximately 25% of the study population was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

non-White, with approximately 11% Black or African American and 7% multiracial, and approximately 30% were Hispanic/Latino. Demographic characteristics for the Dose 3 and Dose 4 evaluable immunogenicity populations were similar to those for the safety population.

a.  N = number of participants in the specified group, or the total sample. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculations. Participants who received any incorrect study vaccination during the study are excluded. b.  n = Number of participants with the specified characteristic.

## Numbers analysed

-  There were 1991 (99.7%) participants included in the safety population: 1001 (99.7%) and 990 (99.7%) participants in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  There were 1636 (81.9%) participants included in the Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population: 833 (83.0%) and 803 (80.9%) participants in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively.
-  There were 1500 (75.1%) participants included in the Dose 4 evaluable immunogenicity population: 755 (75.2%) and 745 (75.0%) participants in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively.

## Efficacy results

## Immunogenicity Results

Primary and Key Secondary - Pneumococcal Immune Response (Relevant to 13vPnC)

-  At 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4, 13vPnC elicited serotype-specific IgG GMCs for all vaccine serotypes (Tables 8, 12).
-  At 1 month after Dose 3, the percentages of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations ranged from 67.6% (serotype 3) to 98.1% (serotype 19A) in the 13vPnC group (Table 9).

## Supportive Results - Pneumococcal Immune Responses

-  Strong boosting responses were observed between dose 3 and dose 4 for the vaccine serotypes in the 13 vPnC control group, as serotype-specific IgG responses increased between dose 3 and dose 4 when measured one month after respective doses (Tables 8, 12).
-  13vPnC also elicited functional opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) responses to all vaccine serotypes at 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4, based on OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs), geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs), percentages of participants with ≥4-fold rise, and percentages of participants with OPA titers ≥ lower level of quantification (LLOQ). Evidence of OPA boosting was observed for all serotypes, similar to the boosting observed for the IgG responses. Results from serotypes 1, 3, 4 and 5 as an example can be seen in figures 14 and 15.

## Safety results

-  The most frequently reported local reaction after any dose was pain at injection site (35.7% to 49.1% in the 20vPnC group and 35.8% to 45.3% in the 13vPnC group). There was no strong trend in frequency or severity of local reactions with each subsequent dose. Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 2 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The most frequently reported systemic event was irritability (61.0% to 71.6% in the 20vPnC group and 61.1% to 71.7% in the 13vPnC group), followed by drowsiness (39.5% to 67.2% in the 20vPnC group and 39.5% to 66.0% in the 13vPnC group, which decreased in frequency in both groups after each subsequent dose).  Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity and generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 3 days. The percentages of participants reporting any fever were similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups (7.5% to 17.3%), and fever of &gt;38.9°C was reported infrequently.
-  The percentages of participants with SAEs from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 4 were low and similar in the 20vPnC (4.5%) and 13vPnC (3.1%) groups. Most SAEs reported were consistent with medical events that may occur in this population, and all SAEs were assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention.
-  The percentages of participants with NDCMCs from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 4 were low and similar in the 20vPnC (5.0%) and 13vPnC (5.9%) groups, and consistent with medical events that may occur in these populations.
-  The percentages of participants with local reactions, systemic events, and AEs were generally similar after 20vPnC or 13vPnC administration across each of the sex, race, and coadministered influenza vaccine subgroups.
-  No safety concerns were identified in this study.

## 2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects

In the current study 'A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Infants', the purpose was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 20vPnC in infants and to provide key safety data to support licensure in this population. 20vPnC was compared with 13vPnC, where 13vPnC was included as a control group. Safety results from this study are consistent with the known profile of 13vPnC as reflected in the EU SmPC and support the continued use of 13vPnC.
