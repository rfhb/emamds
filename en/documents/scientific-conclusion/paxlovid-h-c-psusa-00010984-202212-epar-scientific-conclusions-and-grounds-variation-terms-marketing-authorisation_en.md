## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for (1r,2s,5s)-n-{(1s)-1-cyano-2[(3s)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]ethyl}-6,6-dimethyl-3- [3-methyl-n-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-valyl]-3azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide / ritonavir (Paxlovid), the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on dysgeusia from the literature and spontaneous reports, including a high number of patients specifying the altered taste as metallic, bitter taste, the PRAC considers that a more precise description of dysgeusia in section 4 of the PL may be useful for patients. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for (1r,2s,5s)-n-{(1s)-1-cyano-2-[(3s)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3yl]ethyl}-6,6-dimethyl-3- [3-methyl-n-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-valyl]-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2carboxamide / ritonavir (Paxlovid) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing (1r,2s,5s)-n-{(1s)-1-cyano-2-[(3s)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]ethyl}-6,6dimethyl-3- [3-methyl-n-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-valyl]-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide / ritonavir (Paxlovid) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
