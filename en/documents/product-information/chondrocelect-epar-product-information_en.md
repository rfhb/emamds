ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

ChondroCelect 10,000 cells/microlitre implantation suspension

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

## 2.1 General description

Characterised viable autologous cartilage cells expanded ex vivo expressing specific marker proteins.

2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition Each vial of product contains 4 million autologous human cartilage cells in 0.4 ml cell suspension, corresponding to a concentration of 10,000 cells/microlitre. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Implantation suspension Before re-suspension the cells are settled to the bottom of the container forming an off-white layer and the excipient is a clear colourless liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Repair  of  single  symptomatic  cartilage  defects  of  the  femoral  condyle  of  the  knee  (International Cartilage  Repair  Society  [ICRS]  grade  III  or  IV)  in  adults.  Concomitant  asymptomatic  cartilage lesions  (ICRS grade I or II) might be present. Demonstration of efficacy is based on a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of Chondrocelect in patients with lesions between 1-5cm². 4.2 Posology and method of administration ChondroCelect must be administered by an appropriately qualified surgeon and is restricted to hospital use  only.  ChondroCelect  is  solely  intended  for  autologous  use  and  should  be  administered  in conjunction with debridement (preparation of the defect bed), a physical seal of the lesion (placement of a biological membrane, preferentially a collagen membrane) and rehabilitation. Posology The amount of cells to be administered is dependent on the size (surface in cm²) of the cartilage defect. Each product contains an individual treatment dose with sufficient number of cells to treat the predefined lesion size, as measured at biopsy procurement. The recommended dose of ChondroCelect is 0.8 to 1 million cells/cm², corresponding with 80 to 100 microlitre of product/cm² of defect. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Elderly population

The use of ChondroCelect has not been studied in this age group.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents (aged less than 18) have not been established. ChondroCelect is therefore not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

## For implantation.

ChondroCelect is intended solely for use in autologous cartilage repair and is administered to patients in an Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation procedure (ACI).

Implantation  of  ChondroCelect  is  to  be  performed  during  arthrotomy  under  sterile  conditions  and requires both preparation of the defect bed and a seal (biological membrane) to secure the implant. Complete  joint  haemostasis  must  be  achieved  prior  to  membrane  fixation  and  cell  implantation. During the ACI procedure it is important to ensure that a good, direct contact of the implanted cells with  the  defect  bed  is  obtained  as  such  contact  is  of  paramount  importance  for  optimal  tissue regeneration.  In  clinical  studies  with  ChondroCelect  a  periosteal  flap  was  used  as  a  biological membrane. Scientific publications have shown that commercially available collagen membranes can be  used  as  an  alternative  to  the  periost  in  ACI  procedures.  However,  ChondroCelect  has  not  been evaluated  in  combination  with  collagen  membranes  in  clinical  studies,  although  a  commercially available collagen membrane  has been used in patients treated with ChondroCelect under compassionate  use.  The  safety  data  obtained  in  these  patients  do  not  indicate  a  particular  safety concern, and confirm a lower incidence of hypertrophy as suggested by scientific literature on the use of collagen membranes versus periost. A technical variant of the ACI procedure is the cell seeding method, whereby the cells are seeded onto a  collagen  membrane prior to implantation. In this technique, a good fixation using stitches on the edges of the collagen membrane is required, in order to assure a direct contact of the implanted cells with  the  defect  bed.  Using  fibrin  glue  only,  instead  of  stitches,  to  secure  the  implant  is  not recommended. The implantation should be followed by an appropriate rehabilitation schedule for approximately one year, as recommended by the physician (see section 4.4). Full technical details on the procedures associated with this implantation technique are provided in the ChondroCelect user manual. For information on preparation and handling of ChondroCelect, please refer to section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to bovine serum. ChondroCelect must not be used in case of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients with femoral epiphyseal growth plate that is not fully closed 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use General ChondroCelect is an autologous product and should under no circumstances be administered to other patients. Patients  with  acute  or  recent  history  of  bone  or  joint  infections  should  be  temporary  deferred  until documented recovery. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Precautions for use

Concomitant knee problems like early osteoarthritis, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), instability of the knee, cartilage lesions at other locations than the femoral condyle, lesions of knee ligaments or of the  meniscus,  varus  or  valgus  malalignment  (abnormal  weight  distribution  in  the  knee),  and inflammatory joint disease are potential complicating factors. In the pivotal study of ChondroCelect, patients  with  these  comorbidities  of  the  knee  were  excluded  from  treatment.  Where  possible, concomitant knee problems should be corrected prior to or at the latest at the time of ChondroCelect implantation.

In the pivotal study there was no influence of Body Mass Index (BMI) on outcome but bibliographic data shows that a BMI over 30 may adversely affect the success of the procedure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rehabilitation

Upon  implantation,  the  patient  should  follow  an  appropriate  rehabilitation  schedule  and  physical activity should be resumed as recommended by the physician. Depending on the location, the size of the lesion and the patient's profile, appropriate rehabilitation instructions have been developed. Too early  and vigorous activity may compromise the grafting and the durability of clinical benefit from ChondroCelect. Therefore the treated knee should be protected according to the recommendations as outlined in the appropriate rehabilitation schedule, to avoid early damage which might lead to graft failure.

Details and information on the appropriate rehabilitation schedule is provided in the ChondroCelect user manual.

Cases in which ChondroCelect cannot be supplied In some cases it can be possible that the source chondrocytes of the patient are not expandable or that the release criteria are not met, due to poor biopsy quality, patient characteristics, or manufacturing failure. Therefore it can occur that ChondroCelect cannot be delivered. The surgeon will be informed as  early  in  the  process  as  possible,  and  should  hence  select  an  alternative  treatment  for  the  patient concerned. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Fibrin  glues  are  routinely  used  in  ACI  procedures  to  seal  the  outside  margins  and  to  improve  the water-tightness of the compartment of the biological membrane used to cover the defect. The use of fibrin  glue  inside  the  cartilage  defect  bed  is  not  recommended  as  this  may  result  in  a  significantly poorer outcome (see section 5.3). Fibrin sealant products differ significantly in their quantitative  and qualitative  composition. In vitro interaction studies were performed with a commercially available fibrin glue containing aprotinin (a fibrinolysis inhibitor of bovine origin). These studies have demonstrated that this type of fibrin sealant can be safely used with ChondroCelect. No interaction studies with any other type of fibrin glues were performed. However, the concomitant use of another type of fibrin glue with a synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitor (tranexamic acid) in the pivotal clinical trial did not reveal any safety signal. Pain relief  medicinal products should be used according to the recommendations of the responsible surgeon. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Limited clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Conventional reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are not considered relevant, given the nature and the intended clinical use of the autologous cell therapy product. As ChondroCelect is used to repair a cartilage defect of the knee and is implanted with the ACI procedure using open-knee surgery, it is not recommended during pregnancy. Breast-feeding Medicinal product no longer authorised

There  are  no  data  on  the  use  of  ChondroCelect  during  breast-feeding.  Given  the  local  nature  of ChondroCelect adverse reactions on the nursing infant are not anticipated. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding taking into account the potential benefits of the treatment for the woman and the potential risk to the infant.

## Fertility

There are no data on possible effects of ChondroCelect treatment on fertility.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Due to the surgical nature of the underlying procedure, implantation with ChondroCelect has a major influence  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines.  During  the  rehabilitation  period  that  follows treatment with ChondroCelect, patients should refer to their treating physician and follow their advice strictly.

Driving cars and using machines may be limited during the rehabilitation period.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Arthrofibrosis

In the  compassionate use patients, a higher incidence of arthrofibrosis and decreased joint range of motion was observed in a subgroup of patients with a patellar lesion (8.2% and 13.1% respectively) compared to non-patellar lesions (0.6% and 2.6% respectively). Cartilage hypertrophy In the majority of the 370 patients included in the Compassionate Use Program, a collagen membrane instead of a periosteal flap was used to seal the defect. According to current literature the incidence of cartilage hypertrophy can be reduced by using a collagen membrane to cover the lesion site instead of using a periosteal flap (Gooding et al ., 2006; Niemeyer et al ., 2008). When a collagen membrane was used to seal the lesion site after application of ChondroCelect, the incidence of cartilage hypertrophy was reported to be 1.8% compared to 25% in the randomized, controlled trial alone. Synovitis and subchondral bone injuries have been reported in animal models and are possible risks with the use of ChondroCelect. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting  suspected  adverse  reactions  after  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  is  important.  It allows  continued  monitoring  of  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product.  Healthcare professionals  are  asked  to  report  any  suspected  adverse  reactions  via  the  national  reporting  system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system, ATC code: M09AX02 Conventional pharmacodynamic studies for ChondroCelect have not been performed. Clinical efficacy Medicinal product no longer authorised

The efficacy of ChondroCelect was studied in a phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (TIG/ACT/01/2000) and the  first  two  years  of  its  4-year  extension  phase  (TIG/ACT/01/2000EXT). ChondroCelect was compared to the procedure of microfracture in the repair of symptomatic single cartilage lesions of the femoral condyles of the knee. 51 patients were treated with ChondroCelect, 61 patients  were  treated  with microfracture. Patients  aged between  18  and 50  years,  who had  a  single symptomatic cartilage lesion between 1 and 5 cm 2 of the femoral condyles met the inclusion criteria. Patients  could  be  treatment-naïve  or  might  have  undergone  previous  arthroscopic  or  other  surgical repair procedure(s). Patients with patellofemoral cartilage lesion, OCD, depth of lesion &gt;0.5 cm, prior meniscal  transplant,  prior  mosaicplasty  and  prior  microfracture  within  the  last  12  month  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

excluded. Patients had to agree to actively participate in a strict rehabilitation protocol and follow-up program.

The median time since onset of knee injury was slightly longer in the ChondroCelect group than in the microfracture group (2.0 years versus 1.6 years). More patients in the ChondroCelect treatment group, compared to patients in the microfracture group, had undergone previous knee surgery (88% versus 77%). In the ChondroCelect group 77% of patients had a medial and 23% a lateral condyle defect.

Histological examination of the repair biopsy at 12 months showed superior structural repair in the ChondroCelect arm compared to the microfracture arm. There was continuous improvement up to 36 months in the clinical outcome measure KOOS (the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) in both treatment arms. The estimated benefit was larger in the ChondroCelect group but the results did not reach statistical significance. At this time point 41 patients were evaluated in the ChondroCelect arm and 49 were evaluated in the microfracture arm. Patients with less than 3  years since onset of symptoms (n=27 in the ChondroCelect arm and n=32 in the microfracture arm) benefited most from ChondroCelect. For the group with a longer time since onset of  symptoms there  were  no  apparent differences  between  the  2  groups.  Re-intervention  on  the  treated  lesion  for  graft  delamination  or periost  loosening  occurred  in  2  of  51  patients  within  36  months  after  ChondroCelect  implantation, compared to 7 of 61 patients treated with microfracture having generally insufficient or inadequate cartilage repair. After the 5 year follow-up period, 37 patients were evaluated in the ChondroCelect arm and 40 in the microfracture  arm.  Overall,  the  clinically  relevant  benefit  of  ChondroCelect  implantation  observed over  baseline  after  36  months  was  maintained  up  to  60  months  after  treatment.  No  statistically significant difference could be observed in clinical benefit between ChondroCelect and microfracture at that point in time. In the subgroup of patients with recent symptom onset (&lt; 3 years) the clinical benefit  of  ChondroCelect  over  microfracture  was  significantly  larger,  confirming  the  results  at  36 months  after  treatment.  In  patients  with  a  longer  time  since  onset  of  symptoms,  both  treatments performed equally. Seven patients treated with ChondroCelect needed re-intervention, compared to 10 patients  in  the  microfracture  group.  Treatment  failure  in  the  ChondroCelect  group  was  generally related to delamination of the graft. Patients with lesions larger than 5 cm² have been treated under compassionate use only. The safety data  obtained  in  these  patients  do  not  indicate  a  particular  safety  concern.  Further  clinical  data  in patients with larger lesions are foreseen to be collected in the future. Sixteen patients below 18 years have been treated with ChondroCelect under compassionate use. No specific  safety  signal  was  detected  in  these  patients.  If,  based  on  the  benefit/risk  assessment  of  the responsible  surgeon treatment of  patients  below  18  years  is  considered,  special  attention  should  be given to ensure that the growth plate is completely closed. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The product is implanted locally. The  nature  and  intended  clinical  use  of  ChondroCelect  are  such  that  conventional  studies  on pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination are not applicable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data based on implantation of expanded cartilage cells in goats and mice did not reveal special hazard for humans.

In studies in goats, mild signs of synovitis were observed in the majority of the animals, including controls  at  10  weeks  post  surgery.  Inflammation  resolved  with  time  and  parameters  returned  to baseline  levels  with  only  some  very  mild  and  local  signs  of  synovitis  remaining  in  a  few  animals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although  it  is  thought  that  these  reactions  are  mostly  surgery-related,  a  potential  influence  of  the expanded chondrocytes cannot be completely excluded.

In  a  study  in  sheep,  the  majority  of  animals  showed  penetration  of  the  transplanted  cells  in subchondral  bone;  in  two  of  these  cases  complete  penetration  of  underlying  bone  marrow  was observed. This finding might be related to the inability to perform a progressive loading under nonweight bearing conditions post-surgery in these models and therefore cannot be fully extrapolated as such to the human situation.

A technical variant of the ACI procedure is the cell seeding method, whereby the cells are seeded onto a collagen membrane prior to implantation. From a pre-clinical study in the orthotopic goat model it appeared that this technique provided comparable results as the Brittberg technique, on condition that a good fixation is established using stitches on the edges of the collagen membrane. Using fibrin glue in  the  defect  bed  instead  of  stitches  to  secure  the  implant  resulted  in  an  overall  poor  outcome, suggesting the need for a direct contact of the implanted cells with the defect bed

The falcon tube is placed in a plastic screw top container together with surgery materials (one sterile syringe  of  1  ml,  one  18G  intravenous  catheter  and  two  pieces  of  Vicryl  6.0)  and  a  temperature monitor.

## Package leaflet: information for the user

## ChondroCelect 10,000 cells/microlitre implantation suspension

Characterised viable autologous cartilage cells expanded ex vivo expressing specific marker proteins

## Read  all  of  this  leaflet  carefully  before  you  start  using  this  medicine  because  it  contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, surgeon or physical therapist.
- -suffer from advanced osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) in your knee.

-If  you  get  any  of  the  side  effects,  talk  to  your  doctor,  surgeon  or  physical  therapist.  This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What ChondroCelect is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use ChondroCelect 3. How to use ChondroCelect 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store ChondroCelect 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What ChondroCelect is and what it is used for ChondroCelect  consists  of  autologous  cultured  cartilage  cells.  The  product  is  made  from  a  small sample of cartilage cells (a biopsy) taken from your knee. · Autologous means that your own cells are used to make ChondroCelect. · Cartilage is a tissue that is present in every joint. It protects the ends of our bones and allows our joints to function smoothly. ChondroCelect is used to repair  single  symptomatic  cartilage  defects  in  the  femoral  condyle  of  the knee  in  adults.  A  defect  can  be  caused  by  acute  trauma,  such  as  a  fall.  It  can  also  be  caused  by repetitive trauma,  as a result of overweight or due to incorrect weight-bearing on the knee as a result of a knee deformity. · The femoral condyle is the end of the thigh bone, which forms part of your knee. 2. What you need to know before you use ChondroCelect Do not use ChondroCelect if you: -are allergic to any of the ingredients of ChondroCelect (listed in section 6) or to bovine serum Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -have a growth plate of the knee that is not fully closed

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, surgeon or physiotherapist before using ChondroCelect.

- -If you have an acute or recent history of bone or joint infections, you should be temporary deferred until documented recovery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -The use of ChondroCelect is generally not recommended when you are  overweight (i.e. a Body Mass Index over 30) because it could compromise the result of the treatment. Your surgeon will give you more information.
- -ChondroCelect is not recommended for the repair of cartilage defects in other locations than the femoral condyle.
- -ChondroCelect should be implanted in an otherwise healthy knee. This means that other knee problems such as lesions of the knee ligament or of the meniscus should be corrected before or during ChondroCelect implantation.

-You should resume physical activity according to the rehabilitation plan recommended by the physical  therapist.  Too  early  and  vigorous  activity  may  compromise  the  implant  and  the durability of clinical benefit from ChondroCelect. Other cases in which ChondroCelect cannot be supplied Even if the surgeon has already taken a small sample of cartilage cells (a biopsy) needed to produce the product, it is possible that you will not be eligible for treatment with ChondroCelect. This is the case if the biopsy is of insufficient quality to make ChondroCelect, or in some instances, it may be the cells cannot be grown in the laboratory or that the  cells after expansion do not meet all the quality requirements Your surgeon will be informed and might have to select an alternative treatment for you. Children and adolescents The use of ChondroCelect is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years. Other medicines and ChondroCelect Please tell your doctor or physical therapist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. The safe use of ChondroCelect with other medicines has not been studied. Ask your doctor for more information as to which pain medication you can safely use. Pregnancy and breast-feeding The safe use of ChondroCelect has not been demonstrated during pregnancy or breast-feeding. ChondroCelect is not recommended for pregnant and breast-feeding women. Please inform your doctor if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Driving and using machines The surgical procedure will have a major influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Driving cars and using machines may be limited during the rehabilitation period, and the advice of your doctor, surgeon or physical therapist should be strictly followed during this period. 3. How to use ChondroCelect ChondroCelect can only be prescribed and implanted by an orthopaedic surgeon in a hospital. Treatment with ChondroCelect: a two-step procedure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Visit 1: evaluation of the cartilage defect and biopsy

On  the  first  visit,  the  surgeon  will  evaluate  your  cartilage  defect  during  an  exploratory  operation (arthroscopy). An arthroscopy is performed through very small incisions in the skin, using a narrow telescope (arthroscope) to look at the inside of the knee. If the surgeon decides that treatment with ChondroCelect is appropriate  for  you, he/she  will  take  a  small  sample  of  cartilage  cells  (a  biopsy) from your knee. This cartilage sample will be used to make ChondroCelect.

It will take at least four weeks to select and culture the cells to make ChondroCelect.

## Visit 2: ChondroCelect implantation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During open-knee surgery, the cartilage  cells  are  implanted into the  cartilage  defect.  This  is  called 'autologous  chondrocyte  implantation'  (ACI).  The  purpose  is  to  repair  the  defect  with  healthy  and functional cartilage over time.

To keep the cartilage cells in place, a biological membrane is sewn over the defect.

## Rehabilitation

After surgery, you will have to follow a rehabilitation program for approximately one year, to allow your  knee  to  heal  well.  Your  doctor  or  physical  therapist  will  give  you  more  details  on  your rehabilitation.

It  is  very  important to carefully observe the recommendations of your doctor and/or physical therapist.  If you  do  not follow  your  rehabilitation  schedule,  the  risk  of  treatment failure may increase. You  should  be  very  cautious  when  bending  and  putting  weight  on  your  treated  knee.  During  the rehabilitation period, the level of  weight-bearing  will increase  gradually, depending on your weight and the size of the cartilage defect. To protect your knee, you will have to wear a brace. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or physical therapist. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most  side  effects  of  ChondroCelect  implantation  are  side  effects  related  to  open-knee  surgery.  In general, these side effects are quite mild and disappear in the weeks following surgery. You can recognize most of the joint- related side effects if you have symptoms like pain, snapping, grinding, locking, swelling, bending limitations and stiffness in the knee. Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of these symptoms. Very common side effects (affects more than 1 user in 10) include: joint pain (arthralgia), overgrowth of  cartilage  cells  (cartilage  hypertrophy),  crackling  or  clicking  sensation  when  articulating  the  knee (joint crepitation), and joint swelling.

Annex IV Grounds for one additional renewal Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Grounds for one additional renewal

Based  upon  the  data  that  have  become  available  since  the  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing Authorisation,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  ChondroCelect  remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons:

Only  907  patients  have  been  exposed  up  to  now,  including  patients  treated  with  ChondroCelect within the clinical trials conducted to support the MA of ChondroCelect. Post-marketing experience with respect to patient number, i.e. 444 patients and duration of follow-up is still quite limited, and doesn't warrant granting a renewal with unlimited validity.

The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 1-yearly PSURs. Therefore,  based  upon the  safety  profile  of  ChondroCelect,  which  requires  the  submission  of  1yearly  PSURs,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  MAH  should  submit  one  additional  renewal application in 5 years' time.
