| II/0009/G           | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to change the posology recommendations in patients with severe renal impairment based on the results from Study B7461010 (a phase 1, single dose open- label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of lorlatinib in subjects with impaired renal function). The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order to include information regarding drug drug interaction with moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers based on study B7461026 (Phase 1, open-label, fixed sequence, 2-period study to investigate the effect of multiple doses of modafinil on the pharmacokinetics of single dose lorlatinib in healthy participants). | 28/01/2021 | 09/03/2021 | SmPC and PL | The results of study B7461010 investigating the effect of renal impairment on the standard pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of lorlatinib 100 mg in participants with normal renal function and varying degrees of renal impairment showed that the exposure (AUCinf) to lorlatinib increased approximately 4%, 19% and 41% for the mild, moderate and severe renal impairment groups, respectively. No starting dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. A reduced dose of lorlatinib is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (absolute eGFR < 30 mL/min), e.g. a once daily starting dose of 75 mg taken orally. The results of study B7461026 showed a decrease in lorlatinib exposure in healthy adult participants under fasting conditions when administered following multiple doses of modafinil, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer compared with lorlatinib given alone.

| II/0008 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to replace the term 'Hallucinations' with the new term 'Psychotic effects' and to include the new term of 'mental status changes' as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) further to the cumulative review of the data available through Clinical Databases and Safety Database. The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 12/11/2020 | 17/12/2020 | SmPC and PL | Further to a review of the MAH clinical and safety databases for all reported cases including psychotic effects and changes in cognitive function, mood, mental status or speech, the term 'Psychotic effects' was selected to be the cluster term for these AEs to be consistent with other CNS effects (cluster terms: Cognitive effects, Mood effects, and Speech effects). In addition, the cluster term 'Psychotic effects' includes all AEs that are components of the cluster term 'Hallucinations.' Therefore, the cluster term 'Hallucinations' is replaced with the cluster term 'Psychotic effects' in the SmPC. In addition, a new ADR of 'mental status changes' have been added to the SmPC section 4.8 with a 'common' frequency. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. |

| II/0002               | Update of sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to further reflect the induction potential of lorlatinib on CYP2C9, P-gp, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1 substrates based on the results from the drug-drug interaction sub-study of B7461001. Furthermore, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) corrected information regarding ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC and added clarification regarding linearity/non-linearity of lorlatinib PK in section 5.2 of the SmPC. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 02/04/2020   | 17/12/2020 | SmPC, Annex II and PL  | As part of a sub-study of Study B7461001, single oral doses of different probes (100 mg bupropion for CYP2B6, 500 mg tolbutamide for CYP2C9, 500 mg acetaminophen for UGT, and 60 mg fexofenadine for P-gp) were administered alone and then in combination with repeated dosing of lorlatinib (100 mg once daily). On the basis of the results of this study, lorlatinib can be considered as a weak inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and UGT. However, patients should be monitored in case of concomitant treatment with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic indices metabolised by CYP2C9 or UGT. In addition, lorlatinib has been shown to be a moderate inducer of P-gp and medicinal products that are P- gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices should be used with caution in combination with lorlatinib. |
