## 1. Introduction

On 27 February 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Adynovi, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study 261601: ADYNOVATE drug use-results survey is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Adynovate (marketed in the EU as Adynovi) contains rurioctocog alfa pegol, a pegylated recombinant human factor VIII (FVIII) with an extended half-life (EHL) due to the addition of a 20 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG). It belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of blood coagulation FVIII (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code: B02BD02).

Conjugation with the hydrophilic PEG increases the molecular size of the FVIII concentrates and is expected to improve the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, as well as extend the biological half-life (t1/2). ADYNOVATE (PEGylated, recombinant antihemophilic factor; Takeda), an EHL FVIII product, is a fulllength form of ADVATE (recombinant antihemophilic factor; Takeda) covalently conjugated with a PEG moiety (ADYNOVATE (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) PEGylated) 2023).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

ADYNOVATE has been confirmed to be safe and effective in clinical studies in patients with severe hemophilia A. However, because information on the safety and efficacy of ADYNOVATE in Japanese patients is limited and the use of ADYNOVATE is not limited to patients with severe hemophilia A, a drug use-results survey was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of ADYNOVATE in actual use in daily clinical practice.

In this submission, results from the completed ADYNOVATE drug use-results survey (Study 261601), which was conducted in Japan to investigate the safety and efficacy of ADYNOVATE in actual use in daily clinical practice, were summarised. This study included patients &lt;18 years of age; thus, this submission is provided to comply with the requirements as stipulated in Article 46 of the European Union (EU) Pediatric Regulation (Regulation [EC] No 1901/2006, as amended).

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study 261601, ADYNOVATE drug use-results survey

## ADYNOVATE drug use-results survey (Study 261601)

## Description

The ADYNOVATE drug use-results survey (Study 261601) was conducted to understand the following items in the actual clinical use of ADYNOVATE:

-  Unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Occurrence of ADRs in the actual clinical use of Adynovate
-  Factors that could affect safety and efficacy
-  Occurrence of FVIII inhibitor development in patients with hemophilia A
-  Safety and efficacy for hemophilia A patients who received prophylaxis therapy and ondemand therapy

Hemophilia A patients who received ADYNOVATE in the real world clinical setting were eligible for enrollment in this survey. This included the following patients who were treated with ADYNOVATE at the contracting medical institutions.

-  Previously treated patients who had 4 or more exposure days to other products (PTPs)
-  Previously untreated or minimally treated patients who had 3 or less previous exposure days to other products (PUPs)

The observation period was 1 year after the beginning of Adynovate administration for PTPs and 2 years after the beginning of Adynovate administration for PUPs.

## Methods

## Study participants

Hemophilia A patients who received ADYNOVATE in the real world clinical setting were eligible for enrollment in this survey. This included PTPs and all PUPs who were treated with ADYNOVATE at the contracting medical institutions.

## Treatments

Not applicable, as this was a drug use-results survey which aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Adynovate in actual use in daily clinical practice.

## Objective(s), Outcomes/endpoints

The ADYNOVATE drug use-results survey (Study 261601) was conducted to understand the following items in the actual clinical use of ADYNOVATE:

-  Unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
-  Occurrence of ADRs in the actual clinical use of Adynovate
-  Factors that could affect safety and efficacy
-  Occurrence of FVIII inhibitor development in patients with hemophilia A
-  Safety and efficacy for hemophilia A patients who received prophylaxis therapy and ondemand therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessor's comment

No formal definitions for objectives, outcomes, or endpoints were provided in the submission. According to the submitted cover letter, study documentation beyond the final study report, were only available in Japanese (including the study protocol and SAP) and therefore not provided. While this clearly is a limitation for the assessment of the provided data, this issue is not further pursued due to the exploratory character of the submitted survey.

## Sample size

This survey was started by defining the target sample size as 'PTPs, 120 patients; PUPs, no sample size predetermined,' and the target sample size was changed to 165 (PTPs: 140 patients; PUPs: 25 patients) because of the expansion of the indication to children aged &lt;12 years (partial change approval).

## Sample size estimation rationale

Of the patients with hemophilia A in Japan, approximately 4,000 receive genetically recombinant human factor VIII products, of whom approximately 10% are expected to switch from the conventional products to ADYNOVATE in the period of 3 years after launching. However, launching and developments of other extended half-life genetically recombinant human factor VIII products for hemophilia A have been progressing. The number of patients who were actually going to receive ADYNOVATE was expected to fall below approximately one-half of the estimated number described above. Therefore, the target patient number was set to 140 PTPs as the number of collectable cases for ADYNOVATE safety examination. For PUPs, statistics show the birthrate of hemophilia A patients to be 1 out of 5,000 males and the number of annual male births to be 515,000, providing an estimated annual number of births with hemophilia A of 103. With a percentage of severe and moderate hemophilia A patients of 79.3% (2,137/2,696), it is estimated that there are 82 new patients receiving factor VIII annually. However, the target number of PUPs for 3 years after approval of supplemental New Drug Application for pediatrics is estimated at approximately 10% of the above-indicated number of patients treated with ADYNOVATE in view of the progress of clinical development or launch of similar products by competitors nowadays.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable.

## Statistical Methods

## Analysis sets

In this survey, two analysis sets, 'safety analysis set' and 'effectiveness analysis set,' were established. The 'safety analysis set' (patients included for safety evaluation) included the patients who did not meet the following criteria among those for whom registration was completed and CRFs were collected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Had not used ADYNOVATE or was unknown
-  Had not made any visit after the initial prescription
-  Presence or absence of adverse events unknown
-  'Enrollment completion date' or 'observation period completion date' was out of the contract period
-  Not meeting enrollment criteria
-  Registration form or previous separate volume not finalized

The 'effectiveness analysis set' (patients included in efficacy evaluation) included the patients who did not meet the following criteria among those included in the safety evaluation.

-  Off-label use
-  Efficacy evaluation unclear

Patient composition was investigated using the following items:

Number of registered patients, number of patients whose CRFs are collected, number of patients included in the safety evaluation, number of patients included in the efficacy evaluation, number of withdrawal/discontinuation, reasons for and details of withdrawal/discontinuation, and others.

Items investigated related to safety were

-  Occurrence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions/infections (type, severity and incidence, etc.)
-  Factors that may affect safety (type and incidence of adverse drug reactions, etc. according to patient background)

Items investigated related to efficacy were

-  Prophylaxis: ABR
-  On-demand: hemostatic effectiveness, number of doses to treat a bleed

Physician-rated effectiveness ('poor,' 'fair,' 'good,' or 'excellent') using below evaluation criteria

## Assessor's comment

According to the provided study report, a statistical analysis plan was prepared and finalised before the CRFs for all patients were finalised (version 1 dating March 1, 2018, revision to version 2 dating June 8 2023). However, according to information received with the submission, the SAP was only available in Japanese and therefore not provided. The statistical methodology applied is therefore unclear.

## Results

## Recruitment/Participant flow/Number analysed

135 patients were registered from 66 medical institutions. Among the medical institutions from which patients were registered, the mean number of registered patients per medical institution was 2, the minimum number of registered patients was 1, and the maximum number of registered patients was 8. This survey had originally been conducted in patients who received ADYNOVATE for the first time, with a target sample size of 165 patients (140 PTPs and 25 PUPs). However, as the deadline for registration was set as 'within 3 months after the start of administration of ADYNOVATE,' the survey could not be conducted at medical institutions for which contract procedures were to be performed after the confirmation of administration because of the difficulty in meeting the registration deadline, and patients could not be registered immediately after the start of administration at contract medical institutions. For these reasons, the registration period ended with 135 registered patients.

Of the 135 registered patients, the CRFs were collected from all 135 patients. All patients whose CRFs were collected were included in the safety evaluation. Of the patients included in the safety evaluation, 131 patients were included in the efficacy evaluation, and 4 patients whose efficacy evaluation was unclear were excluded.

## Details of treatment

The mean duration of long-term prophylaxis therapy was 353.0 days overall, with 343.0 days in PTPs and 510.7 days in PUPs. The mean dose per administration was 39.8 IU/kg overall, 39.4 IU/kg in PTPs, and 45.8 IU/kg in PUPs. The mean dosing frequency was 2.0 times per week overall, 2.0 times per week in PTPs, and 1.8 times per week in PUPs. The mean total number of doses was 96.2 overall, 93.4 in PTPs, and 140.7 in PUPs.

## Baseline data

All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of congenital hemophilia A. Of 135 patients, 134 (99.26%) were male and 1 (0.74%) was female.

Most patients (80 [59.26%]) were 18-64 years old; 35 (25.3%) patients were aged &lt;12 years, 5 (3.70%) patients were aged ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years, 9 (6.67%) patients were aged ≥ 65 years and the age was unknown in 6 (4.44%) patients (date of birth and age cannot be provided).

By treatment history, among PTPs (N=123), most patients (77 [62.60%]) were 18-64 years old; 29 (23.58%) patients were aged &lt;12 years, 4 (3.25%) patients were aged ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years,

7 (5.69%) patients were aged ≥ 65 years and the age was unknown in 6 (4.88%) patients. Among PUPs (N=12), 6 (50.0%) patients were aged &lt;12 years, 1 (8.33%) patient was aged ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years, 3 (25.0%) patients were aged ≥ 18 and &lt;65 years, and 2 (16.67%) patients were aged ≥ 65 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were 33 (26.83%) patients in PTPs and 2 (16.67%) patients in PUPs with past history of bleeding episodes; the percentage of PTPs tended to be higher than that of PUPs. Hemophilic arthropathy was observed in 60 (48.78%) patients in PTPs and 3 (25.0%) patients in PUPs. There were 29 (23.58%) patients in PTPs and 4 (33.33%) patients in PUPs whose most recent annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was ≥ 0 and &lt;1 times/year. The percentage of PUPs tended to be slightly higher than that of PTPs. Regarding other patient baseline characteristics, the number of patients in the PUP group was small and there was a limitation in interpretation; therefore, the difference could not be evaluated.

## Assessor's comment

The overall study population was comprised of 135 HA patients. Regarding the paediatric study population, 35 (25.3%) patients were under 12 years of age, including 6 PUPs. 5 (3.7%) patients were ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years of age, including 1 PUP. It is noted that the PTP definition applied ( ≥ 4 EDs) differs from the commonly used definition used in the EU ( ≥ 150 EDs). Baseline characteristics were not summarised according to age subgroups and no further comments on the demographics of the paediatric study population can therefore currently be made. A general request for additional analyses on paediatric subgroups is made.

## Efficacy results

Of the patients included in the efficacy evaluation of prophylaxis therapy, 90.70% (117/129) of patients received long-term prophylaxis therapy. Of these, spontaneous bleeding occurred in 20.51% (24/117) of patients and breakthrough bleeding occurred in 27.35% (32/117) of patients. By treatment history, patients who received long-term prophylaxis therapy accounted for 92.44% (110/119 patients) in PTPs and 70.00% (7/10 patients) in PUPs. Among them, spontaneous bleeding occurred in 21.82% (24/110 patients) in PTPs, and breakthrough bleeding occurred in 28.18% (31/110 patients) in PTPs and 14.29% (1/7 patients) in PUPs.

The median annualized rate of spontaneous bleeding was 1.99 times/year (range, 1.00 to 3.59). By treatment history, the rate was 1.99 times/year (minimum, 0.9; maximum, 18.5) in PTPs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median annualized rate of breakthrough bleeding was 3.09 times/year (range, 1.54 to 5.01). By treatment history, the rate was 3.16 times/year (minimum, 0.9; maximum, 45.0) in PTPs and 2.91 times/year (minimum, 2.9; maximum, 2.9) in PUPs.

The ABR (spontaneous bleeding) in the long-term prophylaxis therapy is shown in Table 11.1.1-1, and the ABR (breakthrough bleeding, all bleeds occurring in patients on prophylaxis therapy) in the longterm prophylaxis therapy is shown in Table 11.1.1-2.

Hemostatic effectiveness of treatment of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis therapy

Of 122 patients who received prophylaxis therapy, 139 breakthrough bleeding events occurred in 35 patients (28.69%), and 91 breakthrough bleeding events in 32 patients were treated with ADYNOVATE. Of these, the treatment was rated as 'excellent' for 33 events (36.26%), as 'good' for 56 events (61.54%), and as 'poor' for 2 events (2.20%). There was no evaluation as 'fair.'

The 2 breakthrough bleeding events assessed as 'poor' occurred in patients who had factor VIII inhibition as a serious adverse drug reaction; therefore, the events were considered to be associated with the impact of inhibitor development.

The hemostatic effectiveness of treatment of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis therapy is shown in Table 11.1.2.1-1.

Hemostatic effectiveness of on-demand replacement therapy

In 17 patients who received on-demand replacement therapy, 61 bleeding events were treated. Of these, the treatment was rated as 'excellent' for 20 events (32.79%), as 'good' for 36 events (59.02%), as 'fair' for 4 events (6.56%), and as 'poor' for 1 event (1.64%). The haemophilia A patient in whom treatment was rated as 'poor' was old and the number of days of administration of factor VIII products was '0 days.' ADYNOVATE was administered 3 times for the treatment of subcutaneous hematoma and hematuria (severity, moderate). Inhibitor development was observed 3

## Efficacy summary

Of the 129 patients included in the efficacy evaluation of prophylaxis therapy, 117 (90.70%) received long-term prophylaxis therapy. Among them, spontaneous bleeding occurred in 20.51% (24/117) of patients and breakthrough bleeding in 27.35% (32/117) of patients. By treatment history, patients who received long-term prophylaxis therapy accounted for 92.44% (110/119 patients) in PTPs and 70.00% (7/10 patients) in PUPs. Among them, spontaneous bleeding occurred in 21.82% (24/110

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients) in PTPs, and breakthrough bleeding occurred in 28.18% (31/110 patients) in PTPs and 14.29% (1/7 patients) in PUPs.

The median annualized rate of spontaneous bleeding was 1.99 times/year (range, 1.00 to 3.59), and the median annualized rate of breakthrough bleeding was 3.09 times/year (range, 1.54 to 5.01).

For the treatment of bleeding, hemostatic effectiveness in the administration for breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis therapy and on-demand replacement therapy was evaluated. Of the 122 patients who received prophylaxis therapy, 139 breakthrough bleeding events occurred in 35 patients (28.69%), and 91 breakthrough bleeding events in 32 patients were treated with ADYNOVATE. Of these, the treatment was rated as 'excellent' for 33 events (36.26%), as 'good' for 56 events (61.54%), and as 'poor' for 2 events (2.20%). The treatment was rated as 'fair' in none of the patients. In 17 patients who received on-demand replacement therapy, 61 bleeding events were treated. Of these, the treatment was rated as 'excellent' for 20 events (32.79%), as 'good' for 36 events (59.02%), as 'fair' for 4 events (6.56%), and as 'poor' for 1 event (1.64%).

## Safety results

Overall, 135 patients were included in the safety evaluation; 123 were PTPs and 12 were PUPs.

The primary safety outcome in this survey is 'inhibitor development' and 'shock, anaphylaxis' corresponding to important identified risks in the risk management plan.

## Occurrence of Adverse Events

Overall, 10 (7.41%) patients reported 19 AEs. By treatment history, 5 (4.07%) patients in the PTP group and 5 (41.67%) in the PUP group reported AEs.

The only AE reported in ≥ 2 patients overall was FVIII inhibition with 4 (2.96%) patients; 1 (0.81%) patient in PTPs and 3 (25.0%) patients in PUPs.

Corresponding to primary safety outcome, FVIII inhibition was the only AE reported as the event corresponding to 'inhibitor development' (ADYNOVATE Japan drug use-results survey [261601] CSR, Table 10.3.3.1-1). The AEs reported as those corresponding to 'shock, anaphylaxis' were dermatitis atopic and eczema, reported in 2 (1.48%) patients, all from the PUP group; 1 (0.74%) patient each had AEs dermatitis atopic and eczema (ADYNOVATE Japan drug use-results survey [261601] CSR, Table 10.3.3.1-2).

The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) is shown in Table 4.

## Occurrence of Adverse Drug Reactions/Infections

Overall, 5 (3.70%) patients reported 5 ADRs; 4 (2.96%) patients had FVIII inhibition and 1 (0.74%) patient had a thrombotic cerebral infarction. By treatment history, among PTPs, 2 (1.63%) patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported ADRs (1 [0.81%] patient each had FVIII inhibition and thrombotic cerebral infarction); among PUPs, 3 (25.0%) patients reported ADR FVIII inhibition. Among the reported ADRs, FVIII inhibition was expected and thrombotic cerebral infarction was unexpected.

Corresponding to primary safety outcome, FVIII inhibition was the only ADR reported as the event corresponding to 'inhibitor development'. The ADR was reported as serious in 1 (0.74%) patient and nonserious in 3 (2.22%) patients. The serious ADR of FVIII inhibition was reported in a PUP patient (1 [8.33%] patient). There were no ADRs corresponding to 'shock, anaphylaxis.'

The occurrence of ADRs/infections (hereinafter, ADRs) is shown in Table 5.

Serious ADRs of FVIII inhibition and thrombotic cerebral infarction were reported in 1 (0.74%) patient each. An unexpected serious ADR of thrombotic cerebral infarction reported in 1 adult patient (18-64 years old) in the PTP group was resolved during continued treatment with ADYNOVATE and did not recur after that; thus, it was considered to be attributable to a complication of hypertension and not to be causally related to ADYNOVATE. A serious ADR of FVIII inhibition was reported in a young child in the PUP group and the outcome was not resolved. This pediatric patient had no past history, complications, history of allergy, or family history of inhibitor development while receiving treatment with ADYNOVATE. Severe FVIII inhibition (verbatim term, FVIII inhibitor development) was observed during prophylaxis therapy using ADYNOVATE (500 IU twice weekly). After the development of inhibitor was confirmed in the results of a blood test performed, the inhibitor level increased. Prophylaxis therapy using ADYNOVATE ended, and the treatment was shifted to immune-tolerance therapy using ADYNOVATE. The administration of ADYNOVATE was continued at an increased dose (the dose was increased to 750, 1000, and 1500 IU, and twice-weekly administration was continued). The inhibitor level gradually declined but stopped declining once it reached 8 Bethesda Units. Thus, ADYNOVATE was discontinued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Occurrence of ADRs by time of onset and outcome : The time of onset of FVIII inhibition was from Day 16 to Day 30 in 2 (1.48%) patients, Day 31 to Day 60 and Day 91 to Day 135 in 1 (0.74%) patient each. The time of onset of thrombotic cerebral infarction was from Day 181 to Day 270 in 1 (0.74%) patient. The outcome of FVIII inhibition was resolved in 2 (1.48%) patients, resolving in 1 (0.74%) patient, and not resolved in 1 (0.74%) patient. The outcome of thrombotic cerebral infarction was resolved in 1 (0.74%) patient.

Occurrence of ADRs by age group : FVIII inhibition was reported in 2 (5.71%) patients aged &lt;12 years and 2 (2.50%) patients aged 18-64 years. Thrombotic cerebral infarction was reported in 1 (1.25%) patient aged 18-64 years. In PTPs, FVIII inhibition and thrombotic cerebral infarction were reported in 1 (1.30%) patient each aged 18-64 years. In PUPs, FVIII inhibition was reported in 2 (33.33%) patients aged &lt;12 years and 1 (33.33%) patient aged 18-64 years; no thrombotic cerebral infarction occurred.

Occurrence of ADRs by patient background and treatment factor : The incidence of ADRs by the number of days of administration of FVIII preparation before the administration of ADYNOVATE (cumulative) was 25.0% (3/12 patients) for 0-3 days, 0% for 4-50 days, 0% for 51-150 days, and 1.83% (2/109 patients) for 151 or more days.

The incidence of ADRs by gender was 2.99% (4/134 patients) in males and 100.0% (1/1 patient) in females. The incidence of ADRs by cause of hemophilia A was 3.70% (5/135 patients) for congenital disease and 0% for acquired disease.

The incidence of ADRs by age at the time of diagnosis of hemophilia A was 0% for &lt;1 year, 6.45% (2/31 patients) for ≥ 1 and &lt;12 years, 25.0% (1/4 patients) for ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years, 14.29% (1/7 patients) for ≥ 18 and &lt;65 years, 0% for ≥ 65 years, and 2.0% (1/50 patients) for unknown at the time of diagnosis. The incidence of ADRs by most recent ABR was 0% for 0 to &lt;1 times/year, 2.27% (1/44 patients) for 1 to &lt;10 times/year, 7.14% (1/14 patients) for ≥ 10 times/year, and 6.82% (3/44 patients) for unknown. The incidence of ADRs by details of treatment was 3.39% (4/118 patients) for prophylaxis therapy, 0% for on-demand replacement therapy, and 12.50% (1/8 patients) for prophylaxis therapy and on-demand replacement therapy (patients whose therapy was changed during the observation period).

## Assessor's comment

ADRs were reported in 2 paediatric patients. Both events were FVIII inhibition in previously untreated patients under the age of 12. No ADRs were reported in adolescent patients.

In the adult patient population, FVIII inhibition was reported in two patients and thrombotic cerebral infarction was reported in one patient.

No concerns arise from the limited data presented, however, separate analyses, including summary tables, according to paediatric age subpopulations are requested.

## Safety Summary

Of the 135 patients included in the safety evaluation, 123 were PTPs and 12 were PUPs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, 5 ADRs were reported in 5 (3.70%) patients. The reported ADRs included FVIII inhibition in 4 (2.96%) patients (2 [5.71%] patients aged &lt;12 years and 2 [2.50%] patients aged 18-64 years) and thrombotic cerebral infarction in 1 (0.74%) patient aged 18 to 64 years. Of these, FVIII inhibition and thrombotic cerebral infarction in 1 patient each were reported as serious.

A serious ADR of FVIII inhibition was reported in a young child in the PUP group and the outcome was not resolved.

An unexpected ADR, 'thrombotic cerebral infarction,' was observed, but resolved during continued treatment with ADYNOVATE and did not recur after that; thus, the sponsor considered to be attributable to a complication of hypertension and not to be causally related (reported and analyzed) to ADYNOVATE. Based on the above, no information showing changes in the safety profile of ADYNOVATE has been obtained, and therefore, it was judged unnecessary to take new safety measures at this point in time.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH provided results from the completed Adynovate drug use-results survey, study 26101, which was conducted in Japan to investigate the safety and efficacy of Adynovate in actual use in daily clinical practice. The study included patients &lt;18 years of age and was therefore submitted to comply with the requirements as stipulated in Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation.

Study 261601 was conducted to gather data on real-world evidence on safety and efficacy of Adynovate use in Japan.

Eligible participants were HA patients who received Adynovate in the real-world clinical setting, including both PTPs ( ≥ 4 EDs to other products) and PUPs (previously untreated or minimally treated patients who had ≤ 3 EDs to other products).

In total, 135 paediatric and adult patients from 66 medical institutions were registered into the study. Regarding the paediatric study population, 35 (25.3%) patients were under 12 years of age, including 6 PUPs. 5 (3.7%) patients were ≥ 12 and &lt;18 years of age, including 1 PUP.

No study documentation beyond the final study report were provided, since according to the MAH no English translation was prepared. Therefore, neither study protocol nor SAP were available for review. No individual patient listings or narratives were provided. While clearly limiting the interpretability of the provided data, this issue is not further pursued due to the exploratory character of the submitted survey.

ADRs were reported in 2 paediatric patients. Both events were FVIII inhibition in previously untreated patients under the age of 12. No ADRs were reported in adolescent patients.

In the adult patient population, FVIII inhibition was reported in two patients and thrombotic cerebral infarction was reported in one patient.

No concerns arise from the limited data presented, however, data were initially presented for the overall study population, including adults. Therefore separate analyses according to paediatric age subpopulations were requested. With the responses, the Applicant provided separate analyses, which did not raise concerns (see assessment of response to question 1 below, section 4).

Overall, from the data provided, no update to the PI is deemed necessary.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

## Not fulfilled:

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional analyses for the paediatric study population as part of this procedure. (see section 'Request for supplementary information')

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

1. Separate analyses for the paediatric study population are requested, including baseline characteristics, efficacy, and safety analyses.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Patient Composition

The pediatric population enrolled in Study 261601 included 13 patients aged &lt;6 years, 22 patients aged 6 to &lt;12 years and 5 patients aged 12 to &lt;18 years. All pediatric patients were male, Asian, and were confirmed to have congenital hemophilia A. Overall, 4 pediatric patients (10.00%) had a history of serious bleeding (2 patients [15.38%] aged &lt;6 years and 2 patients [9.09%] aged 6 to &lt;12 years), and 7 pediatric patients (17.50%) had a surgical history (4 patients [30.77%] aged &lt;6 years and 3 patients [13.64%] aged 6 to &lt;12 years) (Table 1.a).

Overall, history of factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor development was reported for 5 pediatric patients (12.50%; 1 patient [7.69%] aged &lt;6 years and 4 patients [18.18%] aged 6 to &lt;12 years). History of FVIII inhibitor development was unknown for 4 pediatric patients (10.00%; 2 patients [15.38%] aged &lt;6 years, 1 patient [4.55%] aged 6 to &lt;12 years, and 1 patient [20.00%] aged 12 to &lt;18 years). Before the start of administration of Adynovate, the majority of pediatric patients received prophylaxis therapy (24 patients [60.00%]) or prophylaxis and on-demand replacement therapy (9 patients [22.50%]). The majority of pediatric patients had a cumulative number of days of administration of FVIII products before the administration of Adynovate of at least 151 days (28 patients [70.00%]) (Table 1.a).

## Performed Therapy

The breakdown of major therapies using Adynovate was prophylaxis therapy performed in 38 pediatric patients (95.0%), including 31 pediatric previously treated patients (PTPs) and 7 pediatric previously untreated patients (PUPs) (100.0%); on-demand replacement therapy was not performed in pediatric patients (Table 1.b).

Prophylaxis therapy and on-demand replacement therapy were performed in 2 pediatric patients (5.0%), both were PTPs (6.1%); they were patients whose therapy was changed during the observation period (Table 1.b).

## Details of Treatment (On-Demand Replacement Therapy)

A total of 2 bleeding events occurring in 2 pediatric patients (1 patient aged &lt;6 years and 1 patient aged 6 to &lt;12 years) were treated with on-demand replacement therapy. The site of bleeding was intramuscular for the patient aged 6 to &lt; 12 years and other for the patient aged &lt;6 years. Both bleeding events were of mild severity and were traumatic bleeding.

The mean duration of on-demand replacement therapy was 5.5 days for pediatric patients (10.0 days for the patient aged &lt;6 years and 1.0 for the patient aged 6 to &lt;12 years); the mean dose per administration and mean number of doses were 63.5 IU/kg and 4.5 doses, respectively, for pediatric patients (Table 1.f).

## Occurrence of Adverse Drug Reactions/Infections by Patient Background and Treatment Factor

Adverse drug reactions/infections were reported by 2 pediatric patients aged &lt;12 years; both were PUPs with 3 or less days of administration of FVIII (incidence: 28.57%). Both pediatric patients were outpatients with no history of serious bleeding, and no surgical history; their most recent annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was unknown. Both had severe hemophilia A (Table 1.i).

Spontaneous bleeding occurred in 6 pediatric patients (15.79%; 2 patients [18.18%] aged &lt;6 years and 4 patients [18.18%] aged 6 to &lt;12 years). No patients aged 12 to &lt;18 years who received long-term prophylaxis therapy had spontaneous bleeding (Table 1.j). The median ABR for spontaneous bleeding for pediatric patients who received long-term prophylaxis therapy was 1.53 times/year (range, 1.0 to 3.9) (1.51 times/year for patients aged &lt;6 years and 2.00 times/year for patients aged 6 to &lt;12 years) (Table 1.j).

Breakthrough bleeding occurred in 11 pediatric patients (28.95%) who received long-term prophylaxis therapy (4 patients [36.36%] aged &lt;6 years, 6 patients [27.27%] aged 6 to &lt;12 years, and 1 patient [20.00%] aged 12 to &lt;18 years) (Table 1.k). The median ABR for breakthrough bleeding for pediatric patients who received long-term prophylaxis therapy was 2.91 times/year (range, 0.9 to 8.9) (2.46 times/year for patients aged &lt;6 years, 2.50 times/year for patients aged 6 to &lt;12 years, and 7.98 times/year for patients aged 12 to &lt;18 years) (Table 1.k).

## Hemostatic Effectiveness of Treatment of Breakthrough Bleeding During Prophylaxis Therapy

A total of 41 breakthrough bleeding events occurred in 13 of the 40 pediatric patients (32.50%) who received prophylaxis therapy, including 6 patients (46.15%) aged &lt;6 years, 6 patients (27.27%) aged 6 to &lt;12 years, and 1 patient (20.00%) aged 12 to &lt;18 years; 24 breakthrough bleeding events in 12 pediatric patients were treated with Adynovate. Treatment was rated as 'excellent' for 15 of these events (62.50%), 'good' for 7 events (29.17%), and 'poor' for 2 events (8.33%). There was no evaluation as 'fair.' The 2 breakthrough bleeding events assessed as 'poor' occurred in patients who had FVIII inhibition as a serious adverse drug reaction (see Section 10.3.7 of the study report); therefore, the events were considered to be associated with the impact of inhibitor development.

## Hemostatic effectiveness of on-demand replacement therapy

In 2 pediatric patients (5.00%) who received on-demand replacement therapy, 2 bleeding events were treated; bleeding sites were intramuscular and other. The treatment was rated as 'excellent' for both events (100.00%) (Table 1.n). Adynovate was administered 1 time for the treatment of the intramuscular event (severity, mild) and at least 4 times for the treatment of the other event (severity, mild). Both events were traumatic bleeding (Table 1.o).

## Assessor's comment:

The Applicant provided the requested separate analyses for the paediatric study population.

The paediatric population comprised overall 40 patients, 13 of whom &lt;6 years of age, 22 aged 6 to &lt;12, and 5 adolescent patients aged 12 to &lt;18. 33/40 (82.5%) were PTPs according to the PTP definition used in the study ( ≥ 4 exposure days). With responses, the Applicant clarified that the majority of patients were PTPs also according to the PTP definition commonly used in the EU ( ≥ 150 EDs; 28/40). As expected from a paediatric HA population, the frequencies for haemophilic arthropathy and target joints were low (1 patient each). The majority of patients had a severe disease phenotype (34/40, 85.0%) and received Advate before the start of Adynovate administration (33/40, 82.5%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean duration of routine prophylaxis with Adynovate was approximately 1 year in the overall paediatric population.

The 2 reported bleeding events reported were both traumatic bleeds of mild severity.

In total, 2 ADRs (FVIII inhibition) were reported, both from previously untreated patients. One of the events was considered a SAE.

Mean ABRs for spontaneous bleeds and breakthrough bleeds in the overall paediatric population who received long-term prophylaxis with Adynovate were 1.98 (SD 1.21) and 3.68 (SD 3.01), respectively. Patient numbers in the analysis subgroups according to paediatric age groups were too low to allow drawing of conclusions from efficacy analyses according to age groups.

In conclusion, the newly provided information from the paediatric study population do not raise concerns. No new safety signals were detected.

The issue is considered resolved.
