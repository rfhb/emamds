(CYP3A inhibition) Concomitant use of boosted PREZISTA/REZOLSTA/SYMTUZA and corticosteroids (all routes of administration) that are metabolised by CYP3A may increase the risk of development of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. Co-administration with CYP3A-metabolised corticosteroids is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid effects. Alternative corticosteroids which are less dependent on CYP3A metabolism e.g. beclomethasone should be considered, particularly for long term use.

The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 5.2 (in version 2 of the RMP template) has also been submitted to reflect the study results and revise due dates for category 3 studies GS - US - 311 - 1717 and GS - US - 292 - 0109. | 29/05/2019 | 01/07/2019 | SmPC and PL | The week 96 analysis of the ongoing, randomized, double- blind, active controlled two phase III studies (TMC114FD2HTX3001 (AMBER) and TMC114IFD3013 (EMERALD)) in HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve and virologically suppressed patients is in line with the week 48 data, and similar conclusions could be drawn. Overall, the data confirmed the efficacy, demonstrating sustained antiviral efficacy, with an acceptable safety profile. Based on 96-week data sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated accordingly. The updated RMP version 5.2 was agreed. |

Co-administration of boosted darunavir with medicinal products primarily metabolized by CYP3A and/or transported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to the co administered medicinal product. Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life threatening events is contraindicated. Based on these sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC of the Product Information for darunavir, darunavir/cobicistat fixed-dose combination, and darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fixed-dose combination have been updated to provide further guidance for use in combination with ivabradine, naloxegol, dapoxetine, irinotecan, fesoterodine, solifenacin, |

Therefore, concomitant treatment with dabigatran is contraindicated. Edoxaban is a substrate of P glycoprotein, which can be inhibited by darunavir when used in combination with low- dose of ritonavir or cobicistat, resulting in its increased plasma levels which may lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, the co-administration is not recommended. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir are substrates for P glycoprotein and/or BCRP. Glecaprevir is also a substrate of OATP1B1/3. Darunavir when used in combination with low- dose ritonavir or cobicistat may increase the exposure to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (P glycoprotein, BCRP and/or OATP1B1/3 inhibition). Therefore, the co-administration is not recommended. Based on these theoretical considerations, the products |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 and 5.2 of the SmPCs for Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuva to reflect the data of the category 3 study TMC114HIV3015 in HIV-1 infected pregnant women. The PL of Prezista, Rezosta and Symtuza are also updated accordingly. Updated RMPs (version 25.6 for Prezista, 4.6 for Rezolsta and 4.0 for Symtuza) are agreed accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement the template version 2 for the Prezista and Rezolsta RMPs, removal of the fulfilled category 4 DAD study from the Prezista and Rezolsta RMPs, | 31/05/2018 | 06/07/2018 | SmPC and PL | The pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data from the darunavir (DRV)/cobicistat (COBI) arm of the Phase 3b Study TMC114HIV3015 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected pregnant women were presented and assessed. In total, 7 subjects were enrolled to the DRV/COBI arm, of which 6 (85.7%) subjects completed the study. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that mean exposure (AUC) of darunavir boosted with cobicistat was 56% and 50% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, respectively, compared with 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. Mean darunavir Cmin concentrations were ~90% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy as compared to postpartum. Mean darunavir Cmin concentrations of 168-184 ng/ml for DRV/COBI during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy were below the previously targeted 550 ng/ml (EPAR Prezista) and considerably lower than the mean darunavir Cmin concentrations of 1100-1200 ng/ml for the DRV/RTV arm of |

Correction of data for TMC114HIV3015 (DRV/rtv arm) in section 5.1 of the SmPC were also implemented. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance   |            |     | study TMC114HIV3015. Exposure of cobicistat was 63% and 49% lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, respectively, compared with 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. As the exposure of cobicistat is reduced in pregnant women, probably the boosting by cobicistat is no longer maximal. In view of the observed low exposure values of darunavir/cobicistat during pregnancy, the CHMP agreed to strongly recommend against the use of darunavir/cobicistat during pregnancy. This should apply to pregnant women who are already on a DRV/COBI containing regimen, as well as to those who are naïve to DRV/COBI.   |

Atorvastatin AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax were 3.9-, 4.3-, and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, following co-administration of DRV+COBI (800 mg + 150 mg q.d.) plus atorvastatin (10 mg) compared to atorvastatin alone. Following co-administration of DRV+COBI (800 mg + 150 mg q.d.) plus drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (3/0.2mg) compared to drospirenone/ethinylestradiol alone, drosperidone AUCinf and AUClast were 1.6- and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, and ethinyl estradiol AUCinf and AUClast were 30% lower (study GS-US-216-4032). The Product Information of Prezista, Rezolsta and Symtuza were updated with the relevant data and information of these Drug-Drug interactions studies. In addition, the DDI information was harmonized between the 3 products and section 4.9 was updated to remove the recommendation regarding emesis and charcoal administration. |
