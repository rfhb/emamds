## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

## Problem statement

Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative disorder affecting the palmar fascia. It is thought to be a genetic disease of autosomal dominant transmission with variable penetrance and with an origin in  the  Celtic  races  of  northern  Europe.  Migration  is  believed  to  have  disseminated  the  disease throughout the world and while the disease is most common in Scandinavia and the British Isles, it  is  also  present  in  Australia  and  North  America.  Dupuytren's  disease  is  estimated  to  affect approximately  15  to  30  million  people  in  the  EU  with  prevalence  in  the  general  population estimated at 3 to 6 percent. Men are more frequently affected than women with an incidence that is 7 to 10 times higher, however this difference disappears with increasing age. It is a condition which has been linked to many risk factors including a history of smoking, alcohol consumption, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, carpal tunnel syndrome, history of manual labour, and hand injury. However, the data supporting the association with these risk factors is inconsistent and remains controversial. Dupuytren's contractures often span several adjacent joints. Four stages of contracture have been described. Stage I is characterized by contracture of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint of the  ring  finger.  Stage  II  is  composed  of  contractures  of  the  MP  and  proximal  interphalangeal  (PIP) joints of the ring finger and the MP of the little finger. Contractures of the MP and PIP of the ring finger and MP and PIP of the little finger and MP of the long finger characterize stage III. Hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the little and ring finger are seen in Stage IV. As the disease progresses beyond an early proliferative stage, it results in joint contracture due to the formation  of  a  fibrotic  cord  comprised  of  collagen.  The  resultant  flexion  contracture  results  in significant  functional  disability  of  the  hand  which  prevents  Dupuytren's  patients  from  performing everyday tasks (e.g. face washing, shaking hands, driving, playing sports, playing musical instruments) and hence causes a burden on quality of life. Currently, no pharmacological therapy exists in the treatment of this affection. Surgery (mainly open fasciectomy or fasciotomy) or percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) are the only available options to treat the disease. Standard of care varies across European countries; some of them use only fasciectomy procedures while others use both fasciectomy and PNF. Overall, the most common surgical procedure in Europe is fasciectomie whereas PNF represents between 4 to 12% of treated patient, depending on the country. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The goal of surgery is to remove and/or release the fibrotic cord and correct the contracture allowing extension of the affected finger(s). However, surgical procedures are not curative in that remaining non-affected  fascia  may  still  develop  Dupuytren´s  disease  later  on.  In  addition,  surgery  can  be complex,  and  may  result  in  significant  perioperative  and/or  postoperative  complications  which  can delay full recovery. In a recent study of limited fasciectomy in 261 cases, Coert et al. reported an overall rate of complications of 26%  (Coert  JH  et al, 2006). Surgical complications occur intraoperatively, as well as during the early and late postoperative periods and include inflammation, haematoma, ischaemic skin necrosis, wound infection, granuloma formation, neuropraxia, neurovascular injury, flexor tendon/ligament injury, scar contracture, persistent PIP flexion contracture,  DIP  hyperextension  deformity,  joint  stiffness,  poor  flexion  and  grip  strength,  pain, circulatory  disturbance  and  complex  regional  pain  syndrome  (CRPS).  Higher  incidences  of  surgical complications  have  been  reported  in  diabetic  patients  including  the  typical  diabetic  stiff  hand. Complications are even more complex in repeat surgery in the case of recurrence. In addition, surgery is  not  always  the  best  option  for  individual  patients  because  of  the  existence  of  comorbidities,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

operative  risks,  prolonged  recovery  period  and  requirement  for  extensive  hand  therapy;  or  simply because the disease is not sufficiently advanced to warrant surgery.

PNF is a medical technique that shares many similarities with collagenase injections. In PNF, patients are treated in an outpatient setting under local anaesthesia using 1 ml or less of lidocaine 1% and epinephrine 1: 100,000 per treatment site. After disinfection and draping, the cord responsible for the flexion  contracture  of  the  ray  is  sectioned  at  as  many  levels  as  possible  in  the  palm  and  fingers, depending on the location and extent of the disease, using a 25 gauge needle mounted on a 10 ml syringe. After division of the cord, the affected finger is passively extended to pull the ends of the sectioned cord apart and to obtain maximal release of the contracture. Patients are encouraged to start flexing and extending their fingers immediately after treatment and to start using their hands normally after 24h. No splint is needed or physiotherapy given.

PNF  is  a  less  invasive  treatment  which  provides  similar  efficacy  than  surgery  but  it  seems  that recurrences  occur  more  frequently  and  at  relatively  early  stage  than  surgery.  Consequently,  this technique could be used in less advanced disease, in elderly patients, in patients with co-morbidities, or in postponing selective fasciectomy.

About the product Xiapex (also referred to as AA4500) contains a fixed mixture of two purified collagenases produced by Clostridium  histolyticum .  It  is  a  novel  pharmacological  treatment  targeting  Dupuytren's  contractures through injection into the fibrotic cords. The collagenase AUX-I (Clostridial type I collagenase, formerly known as ABC-I) and collagenase AUX-II (Clostridial type II collagenase, formerly known as ABC-II) act  in  a  complimentary  manner  to  digest  the  collagen  subtypes  that  predominate  in  the  diseased Dupuytren's  cord  (mostly  type  I  and  III  collagens.  The  drug  product  is  provided  as  a  lyophilized powder for reconstitution in a 3 mL Type I borosilicate glass vial. Each single-use vial of drug product is filled at a target of 0.9 mg protein per vial. The drug product is reconstituted using sterile diluent. Xiapex must be administered by a physician appropriately trained in the correct administration of the product and experienced in the diagnosis and management of Dupuytren's disease. The injection of the collagenase  into  the  Dupuytren's  cord  followed  by  a  finger  extension  procedure  24  hours  after  the injection where needed, allows for the local disruption of the cord. Proposed indication Dupuytren's  contracture:  Xiapex  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  adult patients with a palpable cord. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Proposed dosing regimen

The  recommended  dose  of  Xiapex  is  0.58 mg  per  injection  into  a  palpable  Dupuytren's  cord.  The volume of reconstituted Xiapex to be administered into the Dupuytren's cord differs depending on the type of joint being treated.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The  active  substance  is  composed  of  mixture  of  two  purified  collagenases  (AUX  -  I  and  AUX  -  II) produced by Clostridium histolyticum in a fixed ratio obtained as secreted enzymes in the fermentation of  a  non-recombinant  strain  of Clostridium  histolyticum .  The  individual  enzymes  are  purified  as individual intermediates prior the generation of a drug substance bulk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The finished medicinal product is provided as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in a 3 mL Type I borosilicate glass vial. Each vial contains 0.9 mg of clostridial collagenase.

For reconstitution, a Sterile Diluent in a single-use glass vial will be presented.

The recommended dose is 0.58 mg per injection. For cords affecting metacarpophalangeal joints, each dose  is  reconstituted  with  0.39  ml  diluent  and  administered  in  an  injection  volume  of  0.25  ml.  For cords  affecting  proximal  interphalangeal  joints,  each  dose  is  reconstituted  with  0.31  ml  diluent  and administered in an injection volume of 0.20 ml.

The  proposed  indication  for  Xiapex  (also  referred  to  as  AA4500)  is:  'Treatment  of  Dupuytren's Contracure in adult patients with palpable cord' (a collagen disorder resulting in formation of collagen nodules and cords which cause fixed-flexion contracture of one or more digits of the hand).

Xiapex is a novel pharmacological treatment targeting Dupuytren's contractures through the injection into the fibrotic cords.

## Active Substance

The active substance is a mix of two collagenases (Collagenase I (AUX-I) and collagenase II (AUX-II)) in a fixed ratio. Five toxins are generally secreted by Clostridium histolyticum : toxins α , β , γ , δ and  . AUX-I and AUX-II belong to the β -toxins which comprise several subtypes; the production strain was specifically selected to avoid the expression of the other toxins. Manufacture The  active  substance  is  manufactured,  tested  and  released  by  Auxilium  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. (Horsham, USA). The history of the production strain going back to a strain generated in the 1950ties and deposited at ATCC is sufficiently transparent and traceable. Drug  substance  manufacture  employs  a  two-tiered  system  comprising  a  MCB  and  a  WCB.  No mutagenic  agents  have  been  employed  in  the  establishment  of  the  cell  banks.  Information  on establishment  and  control  of  the  final  cell  bank  system  is  found  acceptable.  Stability  of  the  cell substrate  during  commercial  process  fermentation  has  not  yet  been  completely  evaluated.  Genome sequencing  data  of  the  LIVCA  cells  are  required  to  evaluate  cell  bank  stability  for  the  current manufacturing process. Clostridium  histolyticum is  known  to  synthesize  toxins.  Evaluation  of  the  potential  presence  of clostridial exosubstances in the active substance has been performed. Establishment and control of the final cell bank system and the used raw materials has been presented in a satisfactory manner. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  fermentation  of  the  non-recombinant  bacterium Clostridium histolyticum under anaerobic conditions followed by several purification steps.

Satisfactory information on the manufacture of the active substance and the used raw materials has been presented. The active substance is stored at ≤ -60°C.

## Control of materials

The  control  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  sufficiently  transparent  and  in-process  controls  are adequately included.

An acceptable definition for Critical Performance Parameters and Key Performance Indicators as well as a  rationale  for  the  classification  of  the  IPCs  in  critical  and  non-critical  process  controls  has  been provided. The basis of the risk assessment performed to identify the critical in-process controls has been explained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  has  confirmed  that  the  validated  operating  ranges  and  parameters  will  be  used  as acceptance limits for the fermenter and manufacturing process.

RP-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, CGE, SE-HPLC, AUC, and imaged cIEF have been used for purity analysis.

Product-related impurities have been investigated for product fragments or truncations and aggregates.

In general, the characterisation programme of the applicant is considered adequate.

## Process development and validation

The  process  validation/evaluation  was  generally  sufficiently  documented  and  included  analysis  of consecutive  full-scale  GMP  batches.  The  process  was  found  capable  of  consistent  operation  within predetermined ranges producing product meeting the acceptance criteria.

Information on process-related impurities is overall acceptable.

The  development  of  the  active  substance  manufacture  process  has  evolved  via  some  distinct  but related processes.   The information provided is found satisfactory.

Comparability studies of the materials manufactured are appropriate and analytical methods have been adequately described and validated.

## Specification

The  characterisation  of  AUX-I,  AUX-II  and  active  substance  included  confirmation  of  the  primary structure,  higher  order  structure,  purity,  impurities,  post-translational  modifications  and  biological activity. To evaluate the primary structure, mass spectrometry, N-terminal sequencing and amino acid analysis have been used. Peptide mapping has been performed.

The specification as proposed by the applicant is acceptable.

The specification includes tests and acceptance criteria for: inter alia pH, endotoxins and bioburden, Identity by SDS-PAGE (Coomassie stain) and RP-HPLC, Concentration by A 280, Purity by SEC-HPLC, RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE (Coomassie stain), Potency assays for AUX-I and AUX-II, residual DNA and by Threshold, HCPs by SDS-PAGE (Silver stain).

## Stability

All currently available results met the proposed specification limits with the exception of results for one parameter  at  several  time  points.  The  decreasing  trend  in  this  parameter  over  time  is  under investigation.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  report  additional  results  from  on-going  root  cause analyses.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

An interim acceptance criterion for this parameter has been implemented in the meantime

Based on the stability data provided, shelf-life of 9 months with storage at ≤ -60°C will be set. Both the interim criterion and active substance shelf-life will remain in place until the root cause analyses are closed and permanent limits and shelf-life are fixed.

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

## Finished Medicinal Product

The  finished  medicinal  product  (XIAPEX)  is  a  lyophilisate  in  vial  containing  0.9  mg  of  clostridial collagenase to be reconstituted with a solvent ('Sterile Diluent') containing calcium chloride dihydrate and sodium chloride in water for injections. The powder may be reconstituted with 0.39mL or 0.31mL of solvent depending on the indication.

Concerning appropriate dose to be administered to the patient the data provided is acceptable.

## Pharmaceutical Development

Regarding  pharmaceutical  development  comprehensive  investigations  were  performed  to  justify  the choice  of  the  components  of  the  formulation  mixture  and  their  quantities.  The  results  presented support final composition to be adequate for suitable drug product quality and stability.

Substantial studies were carried out to optimise the lyophilisation process with regard to the critical quality attributes. The conclusions drawn by the applicant are supported.

The  stability  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  container  closures  system  is  compatible  with  the lyophilised  finished  medicinal  product  with  respect  to  strength,  potency  and  purity.  Therefore,  the container closure system is regarded suitable for the drug product.

A risk analysis was performed on the analytes identified from an extraction study on all components in direct  contact  with  the  finished  medicinal  product  with  respect  to  possible  impact  on  product  and patient. Leachables were tested with no critical findings.

## Manufacture of the product

The  finished  medicinal  product  is  manufactured  by  Hollister-Stier  Laboratories  LLC  (Spokane,  USA). The finished medicinal product release testing is performed by Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium (Puurs, Belgium).

The  manufacturing  process  including  in-process  controls  is  described  in  sufficient  detail  in  the application file and the current IPCs and their limits are regarded sufficient to control the manufacture of drug product.

The batch sizes of drug substance used for process validation cover sufficiently the commercial batch size range. All in-process and final product testing results were within specifications. Validation data supports that the production process consistently delivers product of the intended quality.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Product Specification

The specification as proposed by the applicant is considered acceptable. Most of the analytical methods are identical to those used for the active substance, and the reference standards for finished medicinal product and active substance are the same.

The  specification  limits  for  pH  and  reconstitution  time  has  been  tightened  as  required  and  a quantitative  method  has  been  included  in  the  specification  for  the  determination  of  product-related impurities.

## Stability of the product

Stability studies with finished medicinal product have been conducted per ICH Q1A (R2) and ICH Q5C guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the stability data provided, the drug product shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2-8 °C is considered acceptable.

Based on data obtained from the reconstitution stability  studies,  and  upon  considerations  regarding microbiological quality, proposed product labelling will indicate that reconstituted drug product can be kept at room temperature for up to one hour, or refrigerated at 2ºC to 8 û C for up to 4 hours prior to administration.

In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 2 , any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

## Adventitious agents

The Clostridium  histolyticum clone  used  as  the  culture  source  for  production  of  MCB  was  initially propagated  and  preserved  in  a  meat-based  medium  then  further  propagated  using  a  non-animal derived medium peptone (plant-based).

The MCB and WCB were generated in animal component-free medium. Only one animal-derived, but non-ruminant-derived raw material, peptone, is used during fermentation, culture medium is sterilized by moist heat (&gt;121°C exposure for not less than 20 minutes) prior to use.

## Sterile diluent

Sterile Diluent contains 0.03% (2 mM) of calcium chloride dihydrate and 0.9% (154 mM) of sodium chloride in water for injections.

The  manufacturing  process,  including  in-process  controls,  is  described  in  sufficient  detail  in  the application file. The parameters and limits laid down in the finished medicinal product specifications are acceptable.

The applicant's conclusion of a shelf life of 30 months over the temperature range of 2-30°C for Sterile Diluent is acceptable. However, considering that the approved shelf-life for the powder is 24 months, the shelf-life of the finished medicinal product (powder and diluent) is 24 months at 2-8C.

GMP Status: The sites Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 102 Witmer Road, Horsham, PA 19044, USA, and KBI BioPharma, Inc., 1101 Hamlin Road, Durham, NC 27704, USA, Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 40 Valley Stream Parkway, Malvern, PA 19355, USA and at 420 Babylon Road, Horsham, PA 19044, USA have been inspected and accepted.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

During  the  procedure  of  Xiapex,  three  Major  Objections  related  to  Quality  were  initially  identified. These Major Objections concern to the following:

1) Control of process related impurities by the intended commercial process was not addressed.

2 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union

Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 2) Validation data were insufficient to assess the suitability of the analytical methods (DS/DP).

3) Significant trend in one stability indicating parameter after active substance storage at - 70º C was observed which resulted in a consequent proposal to widen the specification.

The applicant, during the review process was able to provide in a satisfactory manner the majority of information requested.

Characterisation  of  the  production  strain  with  regard  to  exotoxins  has  been  adequately  addressed. Whole genome sequencing has been performed and additional tests to confirm the absence of toxins has been added. However, strategies to assess and control the potential presence of product related impurities  had  to  be  amended.  Regarding  validation  issues,  analytical  method  validation  summaries have been provided and all identified. Outstanding Issues have been resolved. With regard to active substance stability testing, root cause analysis for one parameter is ongoing.  Shelf-life limits for this parameter have been deleted from the active substance specifications.

Thus,  at  the  time  of  the  responses  to  the  List  of  Outstanding  issues,  the  applicant  was  able  to satisfactorily address the quality questions. The applicant has committed to provide further information through Post Authorisation Commitments.

AA4500 is a mixture of two purified collagenolytic enzymes (AUX-I (Clostridial type I collagenase, colG ) and  AUX-II  (Clostridial  type  II  collagenase, colH ))  in  a  fixed  mass  ratio),  isolated  from  the  culture medium of Clostridium histolyticum .  These enzymes are generated by the homologous expression of two separate chromosomal genes, colG and colH , which produce the class I and class II collagenases, respectively. Both enzyme classes are metalloproteinases, requiring the metal cofactors Zn and Ca for full activity, but they differ from each other in terms of domain structure, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and preferred cleavage site on the collagen molecule.

The use of class I and class II collagenase Clostridium histolyticum for  the  treatment of Dupuytren's contracture  was  originally  developed  by  Biospecifics  Technologies  Corporation  (BTC).  Following licensing by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, the manufacturing process was optimized (Process 3) and the product was then referred to as AA4500. To distinguish between the different materials used in the development of AA4500, material developed by BTC is designated either ' early BTC process ' or ' BTC Process 1 '  (a  second  process  iteration)  and  the  drug  product  produced  by  Auxilium  is  designated ' AA4500 - Process 3 '.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All pivotal toxicity studies utilized AA4500 - Process 3 material and were conducted in accordance with GLP.

## Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

AA4500 is a mixture of two purified collagenolytic enzymes in a fix ratio (AUX-I and AUX-II) isolated from the culture medium of Clostridium  histolyticum .  Both  classes  of  collagenases  readily  hydrolyze gelatin (denatured collagen) and small collagen peptides, but whereas class II has higher affinity for small collagen fragments, class I cleaves insoluble triple helical collagen with higher affinity than class II  collagenases.  These  properties  account  for  the  ability  of  the  two  classes  of  enzymes  to  digest collagen (particularly types I and III), the most relevant target in Dupuytren's contracture.

The  collagenolytic  activity  of  AUX-I  and  AUX-II  has  been  shown  to  be  comparable  to  purified commercial collagenase in terms of the collagen digestion patterns and their combined complimentary effect on collagen degradation.

Because AA4500 is not intended for systemic use and systemic exposure was either not quantifiable or limited at the first few hours after the initial dose following clinically relevant routes of administration, no systemic secondary pharmacodynamic effects have been evaluated or noted in clinical or animal studies.  However,  local  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  following  administration  of  AA4500, including increased vascular permeability, inflammatory responses and regenerative changes, reflecting enhanced  wound  healing,  may  result  from  the  release  of  small,  pharmacologically  active  peptide fragments from collagen.

Application  of  purified  commercial  collagenase  or  early  BTC  process  to  normal  or  diseased  tissues results  in  histologically  detectable  alterations  in  collagenous  structures.  At  the  doses  evaluated, collagen lysis was focused to the site of application independently of the dose used, indicating limited diffusion of the enzymes to the surrounding fibrous tissues. Preservation of elastic fibers and superficial neurovascular structures was observed even in areas where collagen had been completely dissolved. Despite the fact that clostridium collagenase has been shown to have activity against soluble type IV collagen in vitro and some types of basement membrane in ex vivo preparations, significant lysis of basement membranes has not been reported in the tissue explant studies (with the exception of those in the small venules) or following local administration in animal studies. With administration into looser tissues, collagen lysis may be more widespread but is still well contained. Overall, this suggests that there  is  only  a  low  potential  for  direct  damage  to  normal  tissue  structures  present  either  within  or adjacent to injected tissue following treatment of Dupuytren's contracture with AA4500. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Degradation of a number of extracellular matrix components, including collagen, has been shown to expose biologically active sites that are not normally exposed in the mature secreted matrix protein ('matricryptic sites') which  initiate  a  number  of  physiologic  responses  that  are  important  in regeneration and repair processes.

The  mentioned  effects  are  thus  expected  and  may  be  considered  local  indirect  responses  to  the primary pharmacologic activity of AA4500.

## Safety pharmacology programme

The absence of systemic levels of AA4500 following local injection by clinically relevant routes in either human  subjects  or  in  animal  toxicology  studies  precluded  the  need  for  safety  pharmacology evaluation. Additionally, no evidence of effects indicative of potential safety pharmacology concerns

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(e.g. effects on the cardiovascular or central nervous systems) was apparent following administration of single or repeated IV doses of AA4500 in rats.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

In vitro inactivation of clostridial collagenase by some antibiotics has been described in the literature. A potential interaction with tetracycline derivatives may result from chelation of metal cofactors (Ca and Zn) essential to the activity of AA4500, although direct inhibition of purified clostridial collagenase by tetracycline derivatives at pharmacologically relevant concentrations has not been demonstrated.  The only  documented  drug  interaction  is  inactivation  of  clostridial  collagenase  by  anthracycline  and anthroquinolone antibiotics (e.g. adriamycin, daunarubricin, and related compounds).

## Pharmacokinetics

## Methods

AA4500 contains a fixed ratio mixture of two collagenases, AUX-I and AUX-II (for material produced by Process 3  at  either  the  Cobra  or  Horsham  manufacturing  facilities  (with  corresponding  components referred  to  as  ABC-I  and  ABC-II  for  BTC Process 1  material  originating  from  BTC))  with  no  relevant antigenic cross-reactivity. For this reason, antibody-based assays (double antibody sandwich ELISA/competitive RIA)   were developed to detect each collagenase separately. Analytical methods for the  purpose  of  quantification  of  AA4500  have  been  validated  for  rat  serum,  rat  plasma,  and  dog plasma.  Similar  methods  were  developed  and/or  validated  to  quantify  AUX-I  and  AUX-II  in  human plasma  for  clinical  pharmacokinetic  evaluations.  To  evaluate  the  incidence  and  magnitude  of  antiAA4500 antibody formation, additional antibody based methods were developed to specifically detect anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibodies in rat serum and dog plasma. Absorption Overall, the results of the pharmacokinetic portions of the toxicology studies indicated the following: -  concerning IV administration in rats:  Both AUX-I and AUX-II are short-lived in systemic circulation at dose levels ranging between 50 and 5000 U/dose. In general, AUX-I levels fell below the limit of quantification at  30 minutes postdose, while AUX-II levels fell below the limit of quantification at  2 hours post dose. For both components, calculated half-life values were short, generally ranging from approximately 6 to 30 minutes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  In  general,  exposure  to  both  AUX-I  and  AUX-II  increased  in  proportion  to  dose  or  slightly greater  than  in  proportion  to  dose  and  no  significant  gender-related  differences  in  exposure were observed.
-  Exposure to both AUX-I and AUX-II (as assessed by changes in Cmax, AUC, and/or number of samples with quantifiable analyte levels) decreases after repeated doses, most likely due to the appearance of anti-drug antibodies.
-  Exposure to AUX-I/ABC-I and AUX-II/ABC-II was variable within each study and across studies. For  example,  following  IV  application  to  rats,  AA4500-Process 3 Cobra  material  resulted  in approximately  3  to  5-fold  greater  systemic  exposure  of  AUX-I/ABC-I  and  AUX-II/ABC-II compared  to  the  BTC Process 1  material  (Study DLB00006) and  AA4500-Process 3 Cobra material and AA4500-Process 3 Horsham resulted in more than 2-fold greater Cmax-values for AUX-II/ABC-II than the BTC Process 1 material (Study 1007-1671). However, due to the short half-life,  limited  quantifiable  data  and  the  large  degree  of  variability,  definite  conclusions regarding comparability of different drug manufacturing lots could not be made on basis of these data. However, additional non-clinical data are not considered necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- concerning local administration of AA4500 into the rat or dog paw:
-  Minimal to no quantifiable systemic exposure was detected following the injection into rat or dog paws.

- concerning local administration of AA4500 into the dog penis:

-  Minimal  to  no  quantifiable  systemic  exposure  was  detected  following  injection  into  a  dense fibrous connective tissue structure, the tunica albuginea of the penis.
-  Injection  into  highly  vascular  structures  (those  which  allow  direct  access  to  the  systemic circulation  such  as  corpus  cavernosum)  resulted  on  some  occasions  in  quantifiable  levels  of AA4500 components in the systemic circulation, but only at very low plasma concentrations that disappear rapidly (usually quantifiable only at 5 minutes postdose).

## Distribution

No tissue distribution studies have been performed with AA4500. No significant systemic exposure has been observed, either in animal studies or human subjects (AUX-CC-855), following local administration of AA4500 suggesting very little if any tissue distribution away from the site of injection. After IV administration, volume of distribution estimates were low which is consistent with the nature and size of AUX-I and AUX-II (proteins of approximately 110 kD).

No  pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  AA4500.  AA4500  is  not  a substrate  for  cytochromes  P450  or  other  drug  metabolizing  enzyme  pathways,  and  therefore interaction with other drugs by competition for metabolism or induction or inhibition of cytochromes P450-mediated metabolism should not occur. Furthermore, since no relevant systemic exposure results from local administration, there should be no competition for protein binding sites and/or clearance of other protein therapeutics by receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Metabolism No metabolism studies have been performed with AA4500 in any species. As a protein, AA4500 (AUXI, AUX-II) is not a substrate for cytochromes P450 or other drug metabolizing enzyme pathways, and thus no active metabolites or species differences in metabolites are expected. The  AA4500  clearance  mechanism  has  not  been  directly  assessed  but  it  is  proposed  to  involve  an interaction  with  -2-macroglobulin,  a  serum  protein  which  acts  as  a  substrate/inhibitor  for  various proteases including endogenous collagenolytic MMPs. Excretion No studies on the excretion of AA4500 have been performed. Significant systemic exposure does not occur  either  in  animal  studies  or  human  subjects  (AUX-CC-855)  following  local  administration  of AA4500 and thus excretion into either the urine or feces following transport from the injection site is not  likely.  Furthermore,  both  AUX-I  and  AUX-II  are  too  large  (~  110 kd)  to  pass  through  the glomerular filtration barrier intact and be excreted in the urine.

## Toxicology

## Design of toxicological testing program

Toxicological  studies  have  been  performed  with  AA4500  ( Clostridium histolyticum collagenase) produced by BTC and by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc during the course of development. They include single  and  repeat-dose  studies  by  a  clinically  relevant  route  (SC  injection  into  the  paw)  in  rats  and dogs and repeated dose IV administration (general toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies)  in  rats.  The  rat  and  dog  are  considered  appropriate  non-clinical  species  for  addressing  the safety of AA4500 given that: (1) AA4500 is a combination of two types of bacterial collagenases which are equally pharmacologically active as well as immunogenic in humans, rats, and dogs; (2) The rat and dog are conventional rodent and non-rodent toxicity species; and (3) the anatomic structures of rat and dog paw are analogous to those of concern for inadvertent administration in the human hand. In addition, a range of nonpivotal studies are also summarized in support of this application, along with relevant peer-reviewed literature. All pivotal toxicology studies were conducted to GLPs.

The  following  summarises  the  studies  conducted  by  the  Applicant.  For  the  results  see  section  the discussion section 3.3.6:

## Single dose toxicity

Studies SS-001, SS-002, SS-003 . Single-dose non-GLP toxicity studies have been conducted in mice and  3-day  toxicity  studies  in  rats.  In  both  species,  acute  death  was  associated  with  evidence  of hemorrhage into body cavities (pleural and/or peritoneal spaces) and occurred at lower relative doses in  mice  (  80 U/animal,  equivalent  to  4000  U/kg  or  12000  U/m 2 )  than  in  rats  (  5000 U/animal, equivalent to  20000 U/kg or  140000 U/m 2 ).

Single-Dose Subcutaneous Toxicity Study with a 28-Day Recovery in Rats Study WIL-696001:  AA4500  -  Process  3  Horsham  was  administered  once  by  s.c.  injection  in  the metatarsal-phalangeal area of the right hind paw to rats. Dose levels were 0.015, 0.03, 0.06, or 0.15 mg/animal (7280, 14560, 28840, or 72520 U/m 2 ). On day 4 and day 28 rats were euthanized following a nondosing (recovery) period. Single-Dose Intratendon and Deep Subcutaneous Toxicity Study with an 8-Week Recovery in Dogs Study WIL-696005: AA4500 - Process 3 Horsham was administered once by intratendon injection in the superficial digital flexor of the right forelimb and by deep subcutaneous injection in the metacarpal area  of  the  right  forelimb.  Dose  levels  of  intratendon  injection  were  0.075,  0.15,  or  0.3  mg/animal (corresponding to doses of 1290, 2590, or 5170 U/animal), respectively, and by deep subcutaneous injection were 0.15, 0.45, or 0.75 mg/animal (corresponding to doses of 2590, 7760, or 12930 U/animal) respectively. Recovery was assessed in a group on animals after 8 weeks. Intrapenile Toxicity/Local Tolerance Study in Dogs (Non-pivotal) - Single dose phase Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study 520:  Dogs  received  AA4500  by  single  intrapenile  injection  into  the  tunica  albuginea,  corpus cavernosum, urethra,  or  VAN  complex  and  were  necropsied  at  either  48 hours  or  28 days  following injection.  Toxicokinetics were evaluated following the first dose on Day 1.

## Repeat dose toxicity

## A. LOCAL APPLICATION

## 3-Month Subcutaneous Rat With a 28-Day Recovery

Study WIL-696003: AA4500 was administered once every other week for 3 months (7 total doses) by s.c  injection  into  the  metatarsal-phalangeal  area  of  the  hindlimb.  The  dose  levels  used  were  0.015, 0.03, or 0.045 mg/animal (7280, 14560, or 21728 U/m 2 ). At each dose level, a group of animals was randomly selected for an additional 28-days of nondosing recovery period after the final

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration.  Toxicokinetic  analyses  were  also  performed.  Blood  samples  were  collected  from  all animals for the investigation of anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibody titers at predose, at the primary sacrifice and at the end of the recovery period.

## Intrapenile Toxicity/Local Tolerance Study in Dogs (Non-pivotal) - Repeat dose phase

Study 520:  In  the  repeat-dose  phase  of  this  GLP-study,  dogs  received  injections  of  0,  140,  430,  or 1430 U/animal (0, 336, 1032, or 3432 U/m 2 ) into the tunica albuginea 3x weekly every four weeks for a total  of  three  cycles  (nine  doses).  The  high  dose  was  lowered  to  approximately  1050 U/animal (2520 U/m 2 ) for the second and third cycles due to excessive local reactions.  Necropsy was performed at either 24 hours or 28 days following their last injection for histologic evaluation of tissue damages. Systemic exposures were evaluated during the study.

## A  3-Month  (Once  Monthly)  Deep  Subcutaneous  Toxicity  Study  With  a  28-Day  Recovery Period in Beagle Dogs

Study DLB00006:  GLP  study  to  evaluate  the  potential  toxicity  of  AA4500  when  administered  by  IV bolus injection every other day during a 16-day period. In addition, the study aimed to demonstrate the comparability of AA4500- Process 3  Cobra and the BTC Process 1 material.

Study WIL-696006: AA4500 was administered once every month for 3 months (4 total doses) by deep s.c. injection into the peri-digital flexor tendon fascia/connective tissue area of the right forelimb.  The doses  employed  were  0,  0.15,  0.225,  and  0.375 mg/animal  (0,  259,  388,  or  647 U/kg;  and  6216, 9312, or 15528 U/m 2 ). At each dose level, a group of animals was randomly selected for an additional 28 days of nondosing recovery period after the final administration. Toxicokinetic analyses were also performed. Blood samples were collected from all animals for the investigation of anti-AUX-I and antiAUX-II antibody titers at predose, at the primary sacrifice and at the end of the recovery period. B. INTRAVENOUS APPLICATION 3-Day IV Toxicity Studies in Rats (Non-pivotal) Studies DLB00014 and DLB00018: Two repeat dose range-finding studies were conducted with AA4500 - Process 3 Cobra by the IV route (non-GLP). In  Study  DLB00014, female rats were administered AA4500 daily by IV infusions (slow bolus) once daily for 3 days at dose levels of 5000, 10000, or 20000 U/animal (corresponding to doses of 140000, 280000,  or  560000 U/m 2 ).  Animals  were  observed  further  for  two  days  after  the  cessation  of treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 16-Day IV Toxicity Study Followed by 14-Day Recovery in Rats

Study 1007-1671:  Rats  were  administered  an  IV  bolus  dose  of  AA4500  Process 3-Horsham  every 48 hours for 16 days at 0, 0.029, 0.13, or 0.29 mg protein/animal (0, 14000, 62720, or 140000 U/m 2 ). Recovery and toxicokinetics were investigated in additional groups of animals.

## Genotoxicity

The applicant reported the results of studies conducted with the BTC collagenase.

AA4500  (early  BTC  process)  was  not  mutagenic  in  a Salmonella  typhimurium Reverse  Mutation Assay and was not clastogenic either in a human lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations assay (or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus study.

## Carcinogenicity

In accordance with ICH guidance (ICH, 1995 and ICH, 1997) carcinogenicity studies with AA4500 were not conducted. ICH (1997) indicates that standard carcinogenicity bioassays are generally not required for biotechnology derived pharmaceuticals, particularly proteins with no known growth factor activity.

## Reproduction Toxicity

Two studies on fertility and early embryonic development as well as an embryofetal development study have been submitted. Both studies were conducted in rats (Crl:CD(SD) and in compliance with GLP. The  intravenous  route  of  administration  was  selected  to  maximize  systemic  exposure  and  to  better define systemic and reproductive toxicity and immunogenicity.

## Fertility and early embryonic development

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In Study DLB00012, rats were administered 0, 0.0145, 0.0435, 0.13 mg/animal (0, 250, 750, or 2240 U/animal; 0, 1000, 3000, or 8960 U/kg; and 0, 7000, 21000, or 62720 U/m2) as an IV bolus every other day.

## Embryo-fœtal development

In Study DLB00009, female rats were given 0, 0.0145, 0.0435, or 0.13 mg/animal (0, 250, 750, or 2240  U/animal;  0,  1000,  3000,  or  8960  U/kg;  and  0,  7000,  21000,  or  62720  U/m2)  by  IV  bolus administration, once daily from Day 7 through 17 of gestation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function

A pre- and postnatal study was not conducted given that systemic exposure was very limited or not quantifiable and lack of systemic toxicities following administration of AA4500 by a clinically relevant route (rat and dog paw studies). In addition, AA4500 had no adverse effects on reproduction and early embryonic development; processes considered sensitive to MMP inhibition (a likely target of AA4500 antibodies should cross reactivity to endogenous MMPs occur).

## Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated

As Dupuytren's contracture is extremely rare in patients less than 18 years of age, use of AA4500 in neonates, infants, and children is extremely unlikely. Therefore, studies in juvenile animals are of no clinical relevance and hence have not been conducted with AA4500.

Local Tolerance A  range  of  additional  studies/publications  are  available  on  the  early  BTC  material  that  provides information in support of the local findings with the commercial drug product. Generally, injection into a  variety  of  sites  and  locations  resulted  in  qualitatively  similar  findings  to  those  seen  in  the  pivotal studies.  These  include  a  GLP  local  tolerance  study  in  Zucker  rats  (Study 95-2384;  Tabulated Summary 2.6.7.16)  and  a  non-GLP  local  tolerance  study  in  guinea  pigs  (Study  SS-004;  Tabulated Summary 2.6.7.16), studies with the early material BTC following injection into the tail tendon of rats (&amp;  Hurst,  1996),  perineural  injection  in  rats  (et  al,  1992)  and  rabbits  (et  al,  1985)  and  following dermal administration to pigs (et al, 1986). Other toxicity studies Antigenicity As  a  foreign  bacterial  protein,  AA4500  is  antigenic  following  administration  in  both  animals  and humans. Antibody titers to the components of AA4500 have been consistently reported in the clinical and nonclinical program. Dependence Medicinal product no longer authorised

Given the lack of systemic exposure, the large molecular weight (limiting access to the CNS and brain) and the intermittent exposure of the proposed dosing regime, dependence studies with AA4500 have not been conducted.

## Metabolites

No metabolism studies have been performed with AA4500 in any species. AA4500 is not a substrate for cytochromes P450 or other drug metabolizing enzyme pathways, and thus no active metabolites or species differences in metabolites are expected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Studies on impurities

Impurities in the drug product have been qualified through the nonclinical and clinical testing program for AA4500, as a result no additional toxicity studies have been conducted on impurities within AA4500 drug product.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In  accordance  with  the  CHMP  guidance  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  proteins  are  exempted  because they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.

AA4500 is comprised of two proteins, the enzyme collagenases AUX-I and AUX-II, which are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, an ERA is not provided in this MAA.

## Discussion on non-clinical aspects

A potential interaction with tetracycline derivatives may result from chelation of metal cofactors (Ca and Zn) essential to the activity of AA4500, although direct inhibition of purified clostridial collagenase by tetracycline derivatives at pharmacologically relevant concentrations has not been demonstrated. The  only  documented  drug  interaction  is  inactivation  of  clostridial  collagenase  by  anthracycline  and anthroquinolone  antibiotics  (e.g.  adriamycin,  daunarubricin,  and  related  compounds).  Given  the therapeutic use of these antibiotic agents, concomitant treatment with AA4500 is unlikely to occur. The SmPC adequately reflects that use of Xiapex in patients who have received tetracycline antibiotics (e.g. doxycycline) within 14 days prior to receiving an injection of Xiapex is not recommended. Following  either  IV  or  local  repeat-dose  administration  of  AA4500,  anti-AUX-I  and  anti-AUX-II antibodies were detected in nearly 100% of the animals. Increased antibody titers were observed as early as 7 days following the first dose of AA4500. Neutralizing capacity and potential interactions of these ADAs with endogenous MMPS were not further characterized on the non-clinical level. Since the collagenolytic  activity  of  AA4500  appeared  to  be  maintained  in  non-clinical  studies  even  in  the presence  of  large  ADA  titers  and  since  systemic  exposure  of  AA4500  was  low  or  non-quantifiable following  single  or  repeated  administration  by  a  clinically  relevant  route,  a  relevant  impact  of  these ADAs  on  pharmacodynamic  activity  and  systemic  disposition  of  AA4500  is  considered  unlikely. However,  since  results  of  animal  studies  on  ADA  induction  may  not  be  predictive  for  the  clinical situation,  a  detailed  characterization  of  AA4500-ADAs  in  patient  samples  available  from  the  clinical studies is considered important (see clinical section). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Single-dose  local  toxicity  studies  by  SC  injection  into  the  hindlimb  of  rats  or  SC  and  intratendon injection into the forelimb of dogs demonstrated that AA4500-induced adverse effects are localized to the site of injection and the draining lymph node and are qualitatively similar across both species and sex.

Swelling and discoloration of the limb (injection site and the draining lymph node) were consistently reported,  with  hemorrhage,  edema,  inflammation,  collagen  lysis  and  fibroplasia/neovascularization, arterial intramural hemorrhage,  and  sinus  erythrocytosis  in lymph  nodes  noted  on  histologic evaluation. The lymph node findings were considered secondary to the AA4500-induced injection site changes. No relevant effects on adjacent nerve bundles were observed in these studies.

After injection of higher doses of AA4500 SC into the rat or dog paws, some of the clinical findings extended beyond the initial site of application. In the single dose rat study (at  29 and  5x the HED on U/kg  and  U/m 2 basis  respectively),  inflammation  was  observed  extending  to  the  periosteum  of  the metatarsal bones. However, this finding was not observed in the repeat dose study in rats or the single and repeat dose studies in dogs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Examination  of  the  recovery  phase  animals  indicated  essentially  complete  recovery  of  the  gross findings with ongoing healing processes of all AA4500-related tissue changes.

At dose levels well in excess of the clinical dose (73x the HED on a body weight basis; 13x on U/m 2 basis) skin lacerations (with exposed tendons) resulted in the premature euthanasia of several rats.

The findings in the repeat-dose studies in rats and dogs were consistent with those reported in the single  dose  studies.  No  systemic  toxicity  and  limited  to  no  quantifiable  systemic  exposure  was observed following repeated local administration of AA4500 by clinically relevant routes of exposure into rats and dogs. Further support for the lack of systemic toxicity and limited systemic exposure was provided by the results of the repeat-dose intra-penile toxicity study in dogs.

In general, the clinical observations were less severe and resolved more rapidly following repeated administration in dogs. Ongoing healing processes were reported at the end of the 28-day recovery period in both species. Similar findings were reported following intrapenile injection into dogs.

Treatment related findings following direct injection into superficial digital flexor tendon of the paw or other dense collagenous structures (tunica albuginea) resulted in less severe/extensive findings and more complete recovery than  SC injection  into  the  rat  and  dog  paw  or  application  into  the  looser fibrous connective tissue structures (corpus cavernosum, urethra, and VAN complex) of the dog penis.

-  a  dose-related  exacerbation  of  perivascular  hemorrhage/edema  and  inflammation  with  complete reversal of the perivascular hemorrhage/edema and partial reversal of the inflammation by the end of the recovery period.

Thus,  adverse  effects  observed  after  single  and  repeated  administration  by  the  relevant  route  of injection into the paw of dogs and rats in non-clinical studies were local in nature, and were reversible or showed evidence of ongoing resolution and healing. This is consistent with the spectrum of adverse effects observed in clinical studies, and supports the characterization in the SmPC that the non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans not addressed by the available clinical data. Clinically, the worst scenario following misapplication of AA4500 into the local vasculature would be injection  of  the  full  clinical  dose  of  AA4500  into  the  local  vein  and/or  artery  surrounding  the Dupuytren's cord. The misapplication would be expected to trigger similar systemic effects as induced by an IV injection. In repeat-dose IV studies in rats (Studies DLB00006 and 1007-1671), AA4500 did not induce systemic toxicity  at  500 U/animal  (2.5x  HED,  based  on  U/m 2 ).  Locally,  at  500  U/animal,  the  only  notable clinical  sign  was  blue,  red,  and/or  dark  discoloration  and/or  wound  at  the  injection  site.  However, repeat IV administration at  2240 U/animal (11x HED, based on U/m 2 ) resulted in: - dose-dependent liver findings (Study 1007-1671). The hepatic lesions were reversed partially with evidence  of  ongoing  healing  process  by  the  end  of  the  recovery  period.  Histologic  findings  are consistent with minimal to mild chronic inflammation and perivascular hemorrhage/edema. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Administration  of  even  higher  doses  (5000  U/animal,  25x  HED,  based  on  U/m 2 ),  resulted  in mortality, probably related to adverse effects on the liver.

In conclusion, according to the rat IV studies, following misapplication of a partial or full clinical dose into the local vasculature, no systemic toxicity is to be expected. At  11x HED, the systemic toxicity would likely be related to hepatic findings. However, commonly observed injection site reactions, such as perivascular oedema/hemorrhages and inflammation are expected locally at all doses right after injections.  Based  on  the  pharmacology  of  AA4500,  the  walls  of  the  small-size  and  mid-size  veins, which  are  relatively  relatively  rich  in  collagen,  are  expected  to  be  directly  affected  by  AA4500.  In contrast, mid-size or large arteries, as well as nerve fibers are unlikely direct targets of AA4500 given that they are relatively poor in collagen content.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After single dose IP administration to mice, deaths occurred already at an AA4500 dose of 6000 U/m 2 , corresponding to a HED of about 1 (Non-GLP Study SS-001). Severe hemorrhage in the peritoneal cavity  was  a  consistent  observation,  probably  based  on  direct  local  irritation  of  exposed  visceral organs. Therefore, data generated by the IP route are not considered relevant for the estimation of potential risks associated with the appropriate clinical use or inadvertent misapplication of AA4500 in humans.

Studies  on  the  genotoxic  potential  with  material  from  an  early  development  batch  of  Collagenase Clostridium  histolyticum (early  BTC  process)  were  negative.  Studies  on  the  genotoxic  potential  of Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum produced with the final manufacturing process (AA4500 process 3) have not been performed. This however, is consistent with ICH S6.

Consistent  with  ICH  S6,  conventional  studies  on  the  carcinogenic  potential  are  not  considered appropriate.  As  AA4500  also  does  not  target  any  critical  receptor  types  or  specific  immunological mechanisms, further investigations are not considered necessary.

There is no explicit regulatory guidance for reproductive toxicity studies of products such as AA4500 that  exhibit  limited  or  nonquantifiable  systemic  exposure  and  no  systemic  toxic  effects.  Therefore  a typical ICH-compliant reproductive toxicity program was not conducted with AA4500. In rats a fertility and early embryonic development study as well as an embryofetal development study has been performed. A prenatal and postnatal study was not deemed necessary by the applicant due to the limited or not quantifiable systemic exposure after local application of AA4500 into the paws of rats and dogs. No second species was used for the study on embryofetal development. In the rat studies males and females of the parent generation showed clinical signs at the injection site in the mid and high dose group. In male rats soft and/or liquid feces were observed in the mid and high dose group additionally. Toxicokinetic investigations showed that Cmax of AUX-I and AUX-II were lower in female rats compared to male rats. Mating and fertility were not influenced by treatment and no effects on sperm parameters, estrus cycle and uterine parameters were detected in these studies. The prenatal development of the F1-generation was not affected by treatment. Since  high  anti-AUX-II  titers  were  noted  in  a  few  control  males  in  the  fertility  and  early  embryonic development study, misdosing of these control animals cannot be ruled out. However, after removal of the  control  animals  in  question,  the  data  still  support  the  original  interpretation.  Therefore,  the observed presence of positive ADA titers in some control and pretreatment samples is not expected to have a relevant impact on study interpretation.

The applicant does not provide an environmental risk assessment. As the active ingredient collagenase clostridium histolyticum is composed of two proteins an environmental risk assessment is not required.

## Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Overall the non-clinical program conducted by the Applicant meets the general requirements and the data are acceptable. Furthermore the SmPC adequately reflects the non-clinical findings.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

A total of 13 clinical studies were conducted with AA4500 (one Phase 1, three Phase 2, and nine Phase 3) in subjects with Dupuytren's contracture and have been completed. These include one Phase 1 and seven Phase  3  studies  conducted  by  Auxilium  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  The  studies  in  the  clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

development  programme  were  designed  to  evaluate  pharmacokinetics,  establish  an  efficacy  dose response, and an adequate efficacy and safety profile in subjects with Dupuytren's contracture. Process optimization was undertaken in order to improve the quality (impurity profile) and scalability of the resultant drug substance and drug product for future commercial purposes.

Primary support for efficacy and safety of AA4500 in subjects with Dupuytren's contracture comes from study  AUX-CC-857  (US  study)  and  study  AUX-CC-859  (Australian  study), which  are  considered  as pivotal.

Study DUPY-303 provides supportive efficacy data but cannot be considered as pivotal, contrary to the orginal claim of the Applicant, since it is a monocentric study performed in only 35 patients. This was accepted by the Applicant.

Study AUX-CC-854 was the only study in which European subjects were enrolled. Efficacy results are presented for the subset of European subjects who were enrolled in the open-label study (n=137) to further contextualize the results from the double-blind placebo-controlled study population.

One long term extension trial (AUX-CC-860: 'Long-term follow-up of subjects treated with AA4500 in studies  AUX-CC-854,  AUX-CC-856,  AUX-CC-857/AUX-CC-858,  and  AUX-CC-859')  is  ongoing.  This study follows subjects who received AA4500 in the Phase 3 double blind and open label studies for 2 to 5-years and will evaluate durability of response in joints with measurable improvement, progression of disease in  joints  that  were  not  treated  with  AA4500  or  did  not  have  measurable  improvement,  and assess  the  long-term  safety  in  patients  previously  treated  with  AA4500.  A  detailed  clinical  study protocol for study AUX-CC-860 (Amendment 5) was submitted by the Applicant. The  comparability of the materials manufactured  by  different processes has  been  assessed adequately. The Applicant also confirmed that Phase I study AUX-CC-855 was conducted using the final commercial formulation prepared according to Process 3. GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies have  only been  conducted  in subjects with Dupuytren's contracture. Additionally, because of no quantifiable systemic exposure following a single injection of AA4500 into Dupuytren's cords intrinsic  factor,  extrinsic  factor,  and  population  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not considered necessary and/or possible.

## Absorption

Study AUX-CC-855 was a Phase 1, open-label pharmacokinetic study in subjects  with Dupuytren's contracture. The objectives of this study were to determine if there was systemic exposure following a single injection of AA4500  0.58  mg  directly  into the Dupuytren's  cord affecting either the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and to determine the safety of AA4500.

SUPPORTIVE STUDIES Phase 3, single-center, doubleblind, placebo controlled study (subjects could receive up to 3 injections of AA4500) Phase 3, multi-center, open-label study (subjects could receive up to 5 injections of AA4500; max of 3 per joint) 20/ Australia, United Kingdom, Switzerland , Sweden, Denmark, and Finland AA4500: 0.58 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Sixteen subjects were enrolled and treated with one injection of AA4500 0.58 mg. Fifteen (93.8%) of the 16 subjects completed the study. One subject was lost-to-follow up after being in the study for eight days. This subject had a reduction in contracture from 60 degrees at baseline to 10 degrees   on Day 7.

AUX-I and AUX-II levels were below quantifiable limits in every subject at every time point through the first 24 hours, on Day 7, or on Day 30 following administration of a single 10,000U (equivalent to 0.58  mg)  injection  of  AA4500  into  a  Dupuytren's  cord.  All  samples  were  below  the  lower  limit  of quantification (i.e., ≤ 5 ng/mL for AUX-I and ≤ 25 ng/mL for AUX-II).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion,  there  was  no  quantifiable  systemic  exposure  following  a  single  injection  of  10,000U (equivalent to 0.58 mg) of AA4500 into the cord of the affected finger in subjects with Dupuytren's contracture.

## Distribution

No  tissue  distribution  studies  have  been  performed  with  AA4500,  as  the  absence  of  significant systemic exposure either in animal studies or human subjects following local administration of AA4500 indicates that AA4500 primarily remains confined to the tissues near the injection site and/or is rapidly inactivated either before or upon reaching the systemic circulation.

## Elimination

## Excretion

Excretion  was  not  formally  examined  after  treatment  with  AA4500  because  there  is  no  quantifiable systemic exposure following a single injection of AA4500 in humans. However, literature data on the elimination  of  the  collagenolytic  matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPs),  the  endogenous  mammalian functional  analogs  of  AA4500,  and  commercial  collagenase  clostridium  histolyticum  suggest  the elimination  of  AA4500  in  human  as  follows:    1) Systemically,  AA4500  is  inactivated  by  endogenous serum components, i.e., complex formation with α -2-macroglobulin ( α 2M), a serum protein that serves as a substrate/inhibitor for proteases of a variety of types, resulting in steric inhibition by preventing access  of  macromolecular  substrates  to  the  active  site  of  the  enzyme,  followed  by  removal  of circulating α 2M-protease complexes primarily in the liver (both by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells) 2) Locally,  inactivation  and  uptake  of  AA4500 occur  due to the local release of α 2M by fibroblasts and tissue macrophages, followed by endocytosis and lysosomal proteolysis of the resulting complexes by fibroblasts, tissue macrophages and other in flammatory cells. Metabolism AA4500 is not a substrate for cytochrome P450 or other drug metabolizing enzyme pathways, and thus no active metabolites are expected. Therefore, no metabolism studies have been performed with AA4500. Dose proportionality and time dependencies Dose  and  Time  Dependencies  were  evaluated  in in  vitro studies.  A  definitive  dose  response  was established,  and  a  dose  of  at  least  3600  units  (equivalent  to  0.21  mg)  was  needed  to  disrupt Dupuytren's cords in vitro (Starkweather et al 1996). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

The Phase 3 clinical studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of AA4500 in a subject population that is representative (e.g., in age, gender, and race) of the intended target population. As systemic exposure to AA4500  after  intralesional injection into Dupuytren's  cords  is below  quantifiable level,  no pharmacokinetic  studies  are  deemed  necessary  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  age,  gender  and  race  on AA4500 or in subjects with impaired hepatic or renal function.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions have not been evaluated. AA4500 is not a substrate for cytochrome P450 or other drug metabolizing enzyme pathways; therefore P450 related metabolic drug interaction is not expected. The potential competition for protein binding sites and/or clearance of other protein

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapeutics by receptor-mediated endocytotic pathways at the systemic level is unlikely, as systemic exposure to AA4500 after intralesional injection into Dupuytren's cords is below quantifiable level.

## Immunogenicity

The majority of AA4500 treated subjects developed anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibodies by injection 3 and all developed antibodies by injection 4. Of note, 11% and 22% of the samples in study AUX-CC857 were positive for neutralizing antibodies for AUX-I and AUX-II, respectively. There is a theoretical possibility of cross-reactivity of anti-product antibodies (anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II) with endogenous human  matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPS)  with  similar  homology.  An  MMP  inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal  syndrome  (MSS)  has  been  described  in  literature  after  oral  treatment  with  matrix metalloproteinase  inhibitors  in  knee  osteoarthritis  which  includes  shoulder  arthralgia,  myalgia,  and stiffness,  as  well  as  hand  oedema,  palmar  fibrosis,  tendons/thickening  nodules  (reminiscent  of  the early development of Dupuytren's contracture) (Krzeski et al., 2007).

In  the  feasibility  study,  an  in  vitro  study  conducted  in  5  patients,  there  was  no  clear  direct (experiments with human serum from 5 patients) or indirect evidence to indicate that the anti-AUX-I or anti-AUX-II antibodies cross-react with or neutralize endogenous mammalian MMPs. However, one patient  with  anti-AUX-II  antibodies  had  a  positive  inhibition  results  versus  5  MMP  indicative  of  a possible cross-reaction. Therefore, on the basis of these data the potential for cross-reactivity of antiproduct antibodies with these endogenous human MMPs cannot be really excluded (see also safety section).  In addition, there was indirect evidence in some of the nonclinical repeat dose studies that there  may be the potential for ADAs to neutralize AA4500, although the neutralizing potential was without a significant effect  on  the  pharmacologic  activity  of  AA4500 in  animals;  correspondingly,  a clinical benefit from treatment is observed in patients even after multiple injections, however efficacy results  appear  most  favourable  for  the  first  joint  treated.  The  Applicant  has  provided  a  number  of analyses that indicate a persistence of efficacy even in the presence of high and increasing anti-drug antibody  titres  which  supports  the  lack  of  a  neutralising  antibody  effect.  There  is  no  correlation between efficacy outcomes and antibody titres. There was no evidence of AA4500-related severe systemic hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis in either the nonclinical or clinical setting and there was no correlation with the incidence, severity and duration of adverse events with antibody titre. Pharmacodynamics Mechanism of action Medicinal product no longer authorised

Collagenases are proteinases that hydrolyze native collagen under physiological conditions. Injection of Xiapex into a Dupuytren's cord, which is comprised mostly of interstitial collagen types I and III, results in enzymatic disruption of the cord.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Primary pharmacology

The pharmacologic activity of AA4500 involves selective lysis of collagen at the site of injection (i.e., the Dupuytren's cord). Because its therapeutic activity is localized and does not require or result in quantifiable systemic exposure, the primary pharmacodynamic activity of AA4500 cannot be evaluated in  subjects  and,  therefore,  such  studies  have  not  been  undertaken.  Instead,  evidence  for  primary pharmacodynamic activity of clinical relevance has been obtained from in vitro studies using excised Dupuytren's cords.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary pharmacology

No systemic secondary pharmacodynamic effects have been evaluated or noted in clinical or animal studies.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Because  AA4500  is  not  intended  for  systemic  use  and  systemic  exposure  was  either  nonquantifiable or limited only at the first few hours following the initial dose via clinically relevant routes of administration, there are no systemic primary or secondary pharmacodynamic actions of relevance and no safety pharmacology concerns. Application of purified commercial collagenase or early BTC process to collagenous tissues in explant culture results in a dose and time dependent lysis of collagen fibers, with smaller fibers being more susceptible to lysis. The collagen lysis was focused to the  site  of  application  independently  of  dose  used.  Elastic  fibers  and  superficial  neurovascular structures are well preserved and no damage to tissue adjacent to collagenase injection was observed. However, clostridium collagenase has been shown to have activity against soluble type IV collagen in  vitro  and  some  types  of  basement  membranes  in  ex  vivo  preparations.  Significant  lysis  of basement  membranes  has  not  been  reported  in  the  tissue  explant  studies  or  following  local administration in animal studies with a dose of ≥ 10,000 units which is reassuring but explant studies were not performed with the commercial drug product.

Due  to  the  therapeutic  use  and  non-quantifiable  systemic  bioavailability  significant  interactions  are unlikely. However, use of doxycycline or other tetracycline derivatives during the 14 days before the first dose of study drug was an exclusion criterion which is adequately reflected in the SmPC. No systemic secondary pharmacodynamic effects have been evaluated or noted in clinical or animal studies. However, local secondary pharmacodynamic effects resulting from administration of AA4500 may result from the release of small, pharmacologically active peptide fragments from collagen. These secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  include  vascular  permeability,  inflammatory  responses  and regenerative  changes  reflecting  enhanced  wound  healing.  These  effects  are  expected  and  may  be considered  indirect  responses  to  the  primary  pharmacologic  activity  of  AA4500.  Since  collagen fragments generated from purified type I collagen by clostridium collagenase have been shown to have potent  bradykinin-like  effects  on  skin  capillaries  (increased  permeability)  adjacent  structures  to  the injection site are likely to be affected by the secondary pharmcodynamic properties of AA4500.  From animal studies there is no morphological evidence of primary and secondary pharmacodynamics effects on  tissues  other  than  those  adjacent  to  the  site  of  injection.  These  findings  are  consistent  with observations in clinical studies, ie, no evidence of systemic bradykinin-mediated AEs. Therefore, the risk of systemic bradykinin-like effects can be considered minimal. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted only in the target population. This is acceptable since data  from  study  AUX-CC-855  indicate  that  there  is  no  quantifiable  systemic  exposure  following  a single injection of AA4500 0.58 mg into the cord of the treated finger in subjects with Dupuytren's contracture  or  following  the  subsequent  procedure  to  disrupt  the  cord.  Consequently  no  tissue distribution and metabolism studies have been performed. However, there is a theoretical possibility that  AA4500  might  diffuse  into  adjacent  tissues,  especially  after  cord  disrupture.  This  might  be important  for  antibody  development  and  immunologic  reactions  in  adjacent  tissues.  Furthermore, adjacent structures to the injection site are likely to be affected by the secondary pharmcodynamic properties of AA4500.

Literature data support elimination of α 2M-proteases complexes from the circulation in the liver and/or spleen and locally by fibroblasts, tissues macrophages and other inflammatory cells and in the absence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of systemic plasma levels renal clearance is very unlikely. Based on these considerations, a suitable urine assay was not developed nor validated and no urine samples were collected which is acceptable.

The majority of AA4500 treated subjects developed anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibodies by injection 3  and  all  developed  antibodies  by  injection  4.  The  Applicant's  strategy  to  investigate  anti-drug antibodies is not convincing.

Screening, confirmatory and titer determination assay have been developed based on the identical ELISA  technique.  The  established  assay  format  however  is  not  optimised  in  terms  of  sensitivity. Nevertheless,  as  a  strong  immune  response  against  the  bacterial-derived  collagenases  AUX-I  and AUX-II  is  expected,  the  assay  sensitivity  is  considered  sufficient  for  confirmation  of  anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). This is confirmed by the clinical results indicating ~85 % ADA incidence in patients after first injection and 100% after third or fourth injection.

Since  the  protein  components  in  Xiapex  (AUX-I  and  AUX-II)  have  some  sequence  homology  with human  matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPs),  Anti-product  antibodies  to  the  protein  components  of Xiapex  may  have  the  potential  to  interfere  with  these  endogenous  human  proteins.  Such  crossreactivity  was  assessed  via  limited  in  vitro  data  in  a  feasibility  study  from  only  5  patients  and additional cross-reactivity experiments using a validated assay were provided. However, assay results are not considered to be reliable. On the basis of these data cross-reactivity cannot be really excluded. Whereas formation of ADAs is expected due to the fact that AUX-I and AUX-II are of bacterial origin, potential  cross-reactivity  of  these  antibodies  represents  a  serious  risk  for  adverse  effects,  e.g. development of musculoskeletal syndrome that should be monitored routinely by meaningful assays. Currently, the detection of cross reactivity of anti-AUX-I or anti-AUX-II antibodies versus the selected MMPs  is  restricted  to  binding  assays.  This  is  not  considered  sufficient.  For  the  time  being  this  is addressed in the educational program, the labelling and the RMP. The  potential  for  cross-reactivity  should  be  additionally  investigated  in  terms  of  inactivation  of endogenous MMPs by neutralising ADAs. A respective assay that is based on enzymatic activity of the MMPs should be developed and validated. The Applicant agreed to develop respective assays as postapproval commitment. As  the  full  immune  response  in  some  patients  (~15%)  does  not  occur  until  the  third  or  fourth injection,  cross-reactivity  should  be  also  investigated  at  this  stage  of  treatment.  The  Applicant provided a respective commitment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

11% and 22% of the samples in study AUX-CC-857 were positive for neutralizing antibodies for AUX-I and AUX-II, respectively. The Applicant has provided a number of analyses that indicate a persistence of efficacy even in the presence of high and increasing anti-drug antibody titres which supports the lack of a neutralising antibody effect. There is no correlation between efficacy outcomes and antibody titres.  Extrinsic  factors  such  as  the  type  of  joint  treated  may  explain  the  difference  in  response between the first joint treated and the subsequent ones.

Regarding the neutralising potential of ADAs versus AUX-I and AUX-II, data on the determination of the optimised concentrations of enzymes and substrate were not provided. It is acknowledged that varying  amounts  of  alpha-2-macroglobulin  in  the  sera  to  be  tested  may  disturb  the  assay.  The Applicant should however develop a suitable assay to assess potential neutralising activity of NAbs not only in terms of binding but also in terms of enzymatic and thus pharmacodynamic activity of the drug substance.  The  assay  setup  should  not  only  be  based  on  literature  but  on  experimental  data.  The applicant committed to initiate feasibility studies to evaluate the potential impact of Nabs and /or antiAUX-I or -II on enzymatic activity of endogenous MMPs.

## Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Data from study AUX-CC-855 indicate that there is no quantifiable systemic exposure following a single injection  of  AA4500  0.58  mg  into  the  cord  of  the  treated  finger  in  subjects  with  Dupuytren's contracture or following the subsequent procedure to disrupt the cord.

Adjacent  structures  to  the  injection  site  are  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  primary  and  secondary pharmacodynamic properties of AA4500. However, the risk of systemic bradykinin-like effects can be considered minimal.

Investigation of immunogenicity particularly with respect to the neutralising potential of ADAs versus the drug substance and cross-reactivity to endogenous MMPs needs to be further investigated. For the time  being  this  is  addressed  in  the  educational  program,  the  labelling  and  the  RMP.  Respective commitments to develop meaningful assays were provided by the Applicant.

## 2.5 Clinical efficacy

Dose response studies Dose-response studies An  early  open-label  study  (Badalamente  and  Hurst,  2000)  and  study  DUPY-101  were  available  as publications only. A clinical effect was observed at a dose level of 10,000 U (equivalent to 0.58 mg) (Badalemente al 2002). Study DUPY-202 In  a  Phase  2,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  dose  response  study  (DUPY-202)  80 subjects with Dupuytren's contracture and fixed-flexion deformity of at least 20° to 30° in a single finger were randomized to receive a single injection of placebo or one of three dose levels of AA4500 (ie, 2500 U, 5000 U, or 10,000 U [equivalent to 0.58 mg]), followed approximately 24 hours later with passive extension of the treated finger. Study drug was injected into the cord affecting the MP joint (N=55;  injection  volume=0.25  mL)  or  the  PIP  joint  (N=25;  injection  volume=0.20  mL).  Single injections  of  AA4500  2500  U,  5000  U,  and  10,000  U  (equivalent  to  0.58  mg),  followed  after approximately  24 hours  by  a  finger  extension  procedure  to  facilitate  cord  disruption,  were  all statistically  superior  (p ≤ 0.002)  to  placebo  in  reducing  baseline  contracture  to  5°  or  less  in  the primary joint (2500 U, 50.0%; 5000 U, 45.5%, 10,000 U [equivalent to 0.58 mg], 78.3%; placebo, 0%).  Similar percent responses were observed when the primary joint was analyzed separately by joint  type  (MP  or  PIP).  However  the  10,000 U  (0.58 mg)  dose  was  the  only  dose  in  which  the difference from placebo was statistically significant for both MP (81.3%) and PIP (71.4%) joints. Based on the efficacy and safety results from these studies, the AA4500 dose of 0.58 mg per injection into the Dupuytren's cord was selected for Phase 3. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Main studies

The  efficacy  of  Xiapex  0.58  mg  was  mainly  assessed  in  two  randomized,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled studies in adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture of the MP and/or PIP joints: studies AUX-CC-857 and AUX-CC-859

Study AUX-CC-857 : A Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of AA4500 in the treatment of subjects with Dupuytren's contracture.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

Study AUX-CC-857 was a 90-day double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Before doubleblind treatment, eligible subjects were stratified by:

- -primary joint type (144 MP joints and 72 PIP joints) and
- -severity of the primary joint contracture (i.e., ≤ 50° or &gt; 50° for MP joint and ≤ 40° or &gt; 40° for PIP joint)

Then, patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo.

Upon  completion  of  the  double-blind  phase  (i.e.,  90-day  evaluation  after  the  first  injection),  all subjects entered an open-label extension study where they were followed for an additional 9 months (Study AUX-CC-858).

Subjects who required further treatment because they either did not achieve clinical success (the cord affecting the primary joint received placebo or another cord received &lt; 3 injections of AA4500) during the double-blind phase or they had untreated cords that were affecting other joints had the option to receive up to 5 additional injections of AA4500 in the open label extension study.

Study Participants Study centres: 16 centers in the United States Criteria  for  inclusion:  Men  and  women  of  at  least  18  years  of  age  with  a  diagnosis  of  Dupuytren's contracture with a fixed-flexion (i.e., ≥ 20º but ≤ 80º for PIP joint; ≥ 20º but ≤ 100º for MP joint) deformity  of  at  least  one  finger,  other  than  the  thumb,  that  was  caused  by  a  palpable  cord  and  a positive 'table top test' defined as the inability to simultaneously place the affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top. Treatments A treatment cycle comprised injection, manipulation and 30-days of follow up. AA4500 0.58 mg was administered in a volume of 0.25 mL for cords affecting MP joints and 0.20 mL for cords affecting PIP joints. Study drug was injected directly into the cord affecting the joint using a hubless syringe with an attached 27 gauge ½ inch needle using a standardized technique. No dose adjustments or modifications were permitted under the protocol. If needed, the day after injection, the joints were manipulated to rupture the cords. Patients were given a splint to wear nightly for up to 4 months. They were no physical therapy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If the primary joint met the primary endpoint with one or two injections, a secondary joint could be treated, if primary and secondary joints met the primary endpoint with one injection each, a tertiary joint could be treated.

Patients could receive a maximum of 3 injections of study drug during the double-blind phase and up to 5 additional injections during the open-label phase of the study.

Each injection was separated by approximately 30 days. A cord affecting a joint could receive up to a maximum of three injections of AA4500.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of up to three injections of AA4500 as compared to placebo in reducing the degree of contracture (fixed-flexion deformity) in the primary joint of subjects with advanced Dupuytren's disease. The primary joint was either metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of up to three injections of AA4500 as compared to placebo in reducing the degree of contracture (flexion deformity) in multiple joints (MP and PIP) of subjects with Dupuytren's disease.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in contracture of their primary joint to 5° or less at the Day 30 evaluation after the last injection of study drug.

Secondary endpoints:

- Clinical improvement: defined as a  50% reduction from baseline in degree of contracture after an injection.
- Mean percent change in degree of contracture
- Time to clinical success
- Change in range of motion

- Subject global assessment of treatment satisfaction - Physician global assessment Sample size The sample size calculation for each joint type (MP and PIP) with the estimated response rates above, significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% is presented as follows: Randomisation Primary  joints  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  either  AA4500  0.58  mg  (equivalent  to 10,000 U) or placebo. The randomization was stratified by joint type and also by the severity of the primary joint contracture (i.e., ≤ 50° or &gt; 50° for an MP joint and ≤ 40° or &gt; 40° for a PIP joint). This study design ensured that the efficacy and safety of AA4500 would be evaluated in all degrees of joint contracture. Blinding (masking) Medicinal product no longer authorised Joint MP PIP

This study was double-blind whereby the investigator, study subject, and other study personnel were blinded to the study medication.

Per Protocol: Modified ITT subjects were excluded from this population if their primary joint:

1)  had  a  baseline  contracture  less  than  20°  or  greater  than  100°  for  MP  (80°  for  PIP);  2)  received incorrect  study  medication;  3)  received  reduced  number  &lt;  3  injections  and  did  not  reach  clinical success but still had a palpable cord, and did not stop treatment due to an adverse event; 4) received more than 3 doses of study medication into the primary joint in the double-blind phase; and/or 5) did not receive the Day 30 evaluation after the last injection. Efficacy analyses were performed using this population.

The primary efficacy variable and other variables expressing proportions were analyzed by a CochranMantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, which was stratified by baseline severity and joint type for all primary joints.

b Modified intent-to-treat subjects were excluded from this population if their primary joint: 1) had a baseline contracture less than 20° or greater than 100° for MP (80° for PIP); 2) received incorrect study medication; 3) received reduced number &lt; 3 injections and did not reach clinical success but still had a palpable cord, and did not stop treatment due to an adverse event; and/or 4) did not receive the Day 30 evaluation after the last injection.

a  Intent-to-treat subjects were excluded from this population if they did not have fixed-flexion measurements after the first injection or had both screening and Treatment 1, Day 0 fixed-flexion measurements between 0 and  5 degrees.

Primary joints were randomized to receive 0.58 mg (10,000 units) of AA4500 or placebo in a ratio of 2:1 in favor of AA4500.

Study medication was injected into the cord affecting the MP joint or PIP joint. If the first injection was a clinical success, subjects could receive up to 2 additional injections for treatment of a secondary and tertiary joint, if indicated.

Study treatment consisted of a single treatment visit (to a maximum of 3 treatments) and follow-up visits at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after each injection. Additional follow-up visits were 60

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

days and 90 days after the first injection. At each follow-up visit, subjects were evaluated for degree of contracture (flexion deformity).

Upon  completing  the  Day  90  follow-up,  subjects  who  desired  further  treatment  for  unsuccessfully treated  joints  or  previously  untreated  joints  were  permitted  to  enroll  in  the  open-label  extension study, DUPY-404. Subjects who responded to treatment under DUPY-303 and who did not participate in DUPY-404 were evaluated at 6, 9, and 12 months after their last injection for durability of response. These subjects were also evaluated annually from 2 to 5 years after treatment to assess contracture recurrence and/or need for surgery.

DUPY-303  was  conducted  at  a  single  center  in  the  US  with  only  35  patients  (planned  enrollment included 116 subjects) compared to study AUX-CC-857 which enrolled 308 patients at 16 centers in the US and study AUX-CC-857 which enrolled 66 patients at 5 centers in Australia. Apart from that, study  DUPY-303 was performed with a study drug that was produced by an earlier manufacturing process  whereas  studies  AUX-CC-857  and  AUX-CC-859  were  performed  with  AA4500  produced  by Auxilium's  optimized  manufacturing  process.  In  addition  in  study  DUPY-303  only  1  investigator performed all the injections compared to up to 7 to 33 investigators (principal investigators and subinvestigators)  in  the  other  studies.  The  efficacy  results  of  trials  with  fewer  centers,  patients  and investigators may not be as generalisable as efficacy results of trials with more centers, patients and investigators.Therefore,  data  from  study  DUPY-303  are  considered  only  as  supportive.  This  was accepted by the Applicant and data are not included in the SmPC.

Study AUX-CC-854 Study AUX-CC-854 was the only study in which European subjects were enrolled. Efficacy results are presented for the subset of European subjects who were enrolled in the open-label study (n=137) to further contextualize the results from the double-blind placebo-controlled study population. This was a 9-month, open-label study that investigated subjects who had Dupuytren's contracture in an MP or PIP joint that resulted in a fixed flexion deformity of at least 1 finger, other than the thumb, that was ≥ 20° as measured by finger goniometry and was suitable for injection and evaluation. The study was conducted at 20 sites in Australia, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Subjects were either naïve to AA4500 treatment or had received 1 or 2 injections of AA4500 for  the  treatment  of  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  a  previous  study  (AUX-CC-853).  Subjects  were followed for safety on Days 1, 7, and 30 after each injection, with injections separated by 30 days. All subjects had follow-up visits for safety evaluations on Day 90, Month 6, and Month 9. Subjects were eligible to receive a maximum of 5 injections of AA4500 0.58 mg, with individual joints receiving  a  maximum  of  3  injections.  Approximately  24  hours  after  each  injection  of  study  drug,  a finger extension procedure to facilitate cord disruption was conducted, if needed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This  open  label  study  is  considered  relevant  because  the  pivotal  double-blind  studies  did  not  enrol patients  from  European  countries.  In  AUX-CC-854  patients  had  similar  baseline  characteristics  and comparbale  severity  of  the  disease  to  those  in  pivotal  studies  AUX-CC-857  and  AUX-CC-859.  In addtion,  similar  variables  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  the  treatment  with  AA4500  were  included  in  the study  design.  This  allows  comparisons  of  the  exploratory  results  for  treatment  effects  between populations. No formal sample size estimation was performed for AUX-CC-854. It should be noted that a primary joint was not designated in study AUX-CC-854. In this study, analyses assessed  responses per numbers of joints rather than numbers of subjects, i.e. the results from all treated joints in study AUX-CC-854 are summarized rather than all treated subjects, since there could be more than one joint analyzed  per  subject.  Comparisons  of  secondary  endpoints  between  the  Phase  3,  double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and to European subjects in Study AUX-CC-854 are made where possible throughout.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint: Reduction of Contracture to 5° or less in the Primary Joint

The primary efficacy endpoint of the reduction in contracture to 5  or  less  in  the  primary joint (i.e., clinical  success)  was  assessed  by  goniometry.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  achieved  in  both pivotal  trials  (AUX-CC-857,  and  AUX-CC-859);  that  is,  AA4500  was  statistically  superior  to  placebo with respect to the percentage of subjects who achieved a reduction in contracture of their primary joint to 5° or less after the last injection in each study (p &lt; 0.001). This pertains also to the supportive study (DUPY-303).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall 64,0% of all AA4500 treated primary joints achieved a reduction of contracture to 5° or less in Study AUX-CC-857 (76,7% for MP joints and 40% for PIP joints), and 44,4% in Study AUX-CC-859 (65%  for  MP  joints  and  28%  for  PIP  joints).  The  effect  of  AA4500  at  PIP  joints  is  less  clearly demonstrated and did not reach statistical significance in Study AUA-CC-859. Similarly in the European subjects  from  study  AUX-CC-854,  50.5%  of  all  treated  joints  (MP+PIP)  achieved  a  reduction  in contracture to 5° or less after the last injection; 60.5% of treated MP joints and 37.9% of treated PIP joints achieved clinical success after last injection.

In  addition,  72.2%  (13/18)  of  PIP  joints  did  not  receive  the  full  AA4500  treatment  regimen,  most commonly because there was 'no palpable cord to inject' after only one or two injections of AA4500 0.58 mg.

MP+PIP MP PIP In  both  the  Phase  3  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  and  the  European  subjects  from  study AUX-CC-854, most subjects required one or two injections of AA4500 for a reduction in contracture of the primary joint to 5° or less. In study AUX-CC 859, more primary PIP joints treated with up to three injections had a reduction in contracture to 5° or less compared with placebo (7 joints [28.0%] vs. 0 joints);  however,  the  difference  between  the  groups  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.069). Compared to US subjects from study AUX-CC-857, Australian subjects from study AUX-CC-859 may had more severe disease at baseline as indicated by a greater proportion of affected PIP joints (55.6% versus  34.3%),  greater  proportion  of  affected  PIP  joints  in  the  little  finger  (42.2%  versus  26.5%); more bilateral disease (51% versus 38%) and more medical history of prior surgery for Dupuytren's disease (53% versus 38%). Apart from that there was a higher proportion of individuals older than 65 years or 75 years in the placebo group in study AUC-CC-859. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Secondary Efficacy endpoints

Results of the secondary efficacy endpoints in studies 857 and 859 were consistent with the results of the primary efficacy endpoints in demonstrating treatment benefit with AA4500. This pertains also to the European patient population.

## Clinical Improvement

Clinical improvement was defined as a  50% reduction from baseline in degree of contracture after an injection.

A significantly higher proportion of subjects who were treated with AA4500 in Studies AUX-CC- 857 and AUX-CC-859 had a 50% or greater improvement in the baseline contracture of their primary joint

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared  with  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (p&lt;0.001).  Clinical  improvement  was  84.7%  versus 11.7% (p&lt;0.001) in Study AUX-CC- 857 and 77.8% versus 14.3% (p&lt;0.001) in Study AUX-CC-859 for AA4500 and placebo, respectively. Similar results were observed for primary MP joints treated with AA4500 in both studies and for primary PIP joints in AUX-CC-857.

In  the  pooled  data  across  the  three  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  84.5%  of  all  AA4500 treated  primary  joints  (MP+PIP)  showed  clinical  improvement;  94.0%  for  primary  MP  joints  and 69.2% for PIP joints. Clinical improvement was not a pre-specified secondary endpoint in supportive Study  DUPY-303  but  the  fixed  flexion  contractures  (FFC)  measures  were  collected  allowing  one  to analyze this endpoint in DUPY-303, and to include DUPY-303 in the pooled analysis of this endpoint. However, since it was agreed that study DUPY-303 should not be considered as pivotal data can only be considered supportive.

For subjects enrolled in the AUX-CC-854  study  similar results were  observed, with clinical improvement  in  80.8%  of  all  joints  (MP  +  PIP)  after  the  last  injection.  By  joint  type,  clinical improvement was observed in 91.6% of MP joints and 67.4% of PIP joints after the last injection of AA4500.

The median time to achieve clinical success was not determined for European subjects from the AUXCC-854 study. However, 60.5% of AA4500 treated MP joints and 37.9% of AA4500 treated PIP joints achieved clinical success by Day 30 following the last injection.

Mean percent change in degree of contracture In  all  three  Phase  3  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies,  subjects  who  received  AA4500  had  a significant  mean  percent  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  degree  of  contracture  of  their  primary  joint (&gt;70%)  compared  with  subjects  who  received  placebo  (p&lt;0.001)  at  Day  30  following  the  last injection. Similar results were observed for primary MP joints (&gt;84%) treated with AA4500 in the three studies and for primary PIP joints (&gt;64%) in Studies AUX-CC-857 and DUPY-303. In the pooled data set,  subjects  treated  with  AA4500  showed  a  79.2  percent  reduction  in  baseline  contracture  of  their primary joint compared to an 8.6% reduction in baseline contracture subjects who were treated with placebo in the Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, and 74.2% of all joints (MP + PIP) for European subjects enrolled in the AUX-CC-854 study. By joint type, percent reduction in baseline contracture was 87.3% for MP joints and 66.2% for PIP joints in all three Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; and 84.1% for MP joints and 61.8% for PIP joints in the European subjects enrolled in the AUX-CC-854 study. Time to clinical success In all three Phase 3 studies, time to achieve clinical success (a reduction in contracture of the primary joint    to  5°  or  less),  was  significantly  (p&lt;0.001)  shorter  in  the  AA4500  group  compared  with  the placebo group. The estimated median time to clinical success in AA4500 treated patients was 8, 56 and 57 days in DUPY-303, AUX-CC-857 and AUX-CC-859 respectively. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Change in Range of Motion

Normalisation of ROM is considered as surrogate for functional outcome of surgical procedures. Normal ROM varies with body habitus, age and genetic background, however ROMs of 90 degrees for finger MP joints, and 100 degrees for finger PIP joints are considered normal. In all three Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled  studies,  subjects  treated  with  AA4500  showed  a  significantly  greater  increase  in ROM compared with subjects who were treated with placebo (p&lt;0.001) restoring near normal ROM. Mean ROM after the last injection improved to 87.9°, 83.7°, and 79.5° in MP joints and to 101.1°, 74.9°,  and  72.8°  in  PIP  joints  in  Studies  DUPY-303,  AUX-CC-857  and  AUX-CC-859,  respectively. Similarly in the European subjects from the AUX-CC-854 study, ROM after the last injection improved to 82.4  for MP joints, 80.9  for PIP joints, and 81.7  for MP+PIP joints.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Normalisation  was  not  reached  in  the  pivotal  trials  but  results  for  this  endpoint  were  consistent  in showing a treatment benefit in favour of AA4500.

## Subject Global Assessment of Self Satisfaction

Subjects receiving AA4500 reported a greater level of treatment satisfaction. This pertains also to the European population. Subject global assessment of self-satisfaction was not measured for Study DUPY303.

## Physician Global Assessment

Patient  subjective  rating  is  endorsed  by  observer  results.  Physicians  reported  that  the  majority  of subjects  treated  with  AA4500  were  either  very  much  improved  or  much  improved  as  compared  to placebo (86% vs. 3% and 80% vs. 5%, respectively; p&lt;0.001).  Similarly, in the European subjects enrolled in the AUX-CC-854 study, investigators assessed 84.9% of subjects as very much improved or much improved.

Except for the latter secondary efficacy endpoint, all efficacy endpoints are structural criteria; none of them measures the functional hand status whereas the aim of treatment in DD is not only to disrupt the  contracted  cords  but  to  recover  hand  function  and  activities  of  daily  living  which  are  generally altered by the contractures. Ancillary analyses Persistence of efficacy Across studies AUX-CC-854, AUX-CC-856, AUX-CC-857, AUX-CC-858 and AUX-CC-859 recurrence of contracture was evaluated in primary joints that achieved the primary endpoint (i.e., a reduction in contracture to 5° or less). In these studies, recurrence was defined as an increase in joint contracture to  at  least  20°  in  the  presence  of  a  palpable  cord,  as  determined  by  the  investigator,  at  any  time during the double-blind phase or open-label extension phase, and in the open-label studies. In the pooled controlled and uncontrolled portions of these studies, of the 830 AP4500- treated cords that  achieved  clinical  success,  twenty-nine  subjects  (30  joints)  experienced  a  recurrence  after treatment with AA4500. Of the 30 joints, 21 were PIP joints and 9 were MP joints and of the 21 PIP joints that had a recurrent contracture 15 were in the little finger. Twelve subjects had a prior history of surgery for Dupuytren's disease; 8 surgeries were PIP joints and 4 were MP joints. In only one of the 12 subjects was the prior surgery conducted on the same joint as was treated with AA4500. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall, a low recurrence rate of 3.7% was observed by approximately 9 to 12 months after subjects received the first dose of AA4500. The average time of follow-up after success was 220.7 days in the original application. Meanwhile 2 year data (730 days) from study AUX-CC-860 are available and as expected the recurrence rate has increased. The nominal rate of recurrence is 15.9 % in the presence of a palpable cord and 19.9 % with or without a palpable cord.  Kaplan-Meier estimates of recurrences which  take  into  account  that  not  all  838  joints  were  followed-up  for  one  year  (i.e.,  the  207  nonrecurrent joints with less than 365 days of follow-up), were 25.2 % and 28.7 % respectively. There was a higher proportion of recurrent PIP joints than MP joints at year 1 and year 2. Because no nonsurgical  treatments  are  currently  available,  the  incidence  of  contracture  recurrence  in  the  AA4500 studies was compared to the reported incidence of contracture recurrence following fasciectomy and/or PNF  for  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  literature.  Depending  on  the  definition  of  recurrence,  and  the duration of follow-up, highly variable recurrence rates have been reported. The incidence was 2% (1.5 years) to 51% (3.1 years) following fasciectomy and up to 65% (2.75 years) following PNF.

In summary, the recurrence rate has increased following 2 years of follow up compared to 1 year, but overall  the  recurrence  rates  with  or  without  a  palpable  cord  in  A4500  treated  joints  continue  to  be comparable  to  the  rates  observed  in  the  literature  for  surgical  intervention  and  appear  favorable compared to those reported for PNF.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Few subjects that were treated with AA4500 required surgical intervention in study AUX-CC-860.

While  the  recurrence  profile  continues  to  be  favourable  at  year  2  post  treatment,  the  observation period  is  still  too  short  to  conclude  on  the  persistence  of  effect  of  Xiapex  on  the  treated  joint. Recurrence data from study AUX-CC-860 will continue to be provided annually through interim clinical study reports at Years 3, 4, and 5 post-treatment.

Title: A Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of AA4500 in the treatment of subjects with Dupuytren's contracture

Study identifier

Protocol number: AUX-CC-857

A Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.

Population  stratified  by  the  primary  joint  type  (144  MP  joints  and  72  PIP joints) and by severity of the primary joint contracture (i.e., ≤ 50 o or &gt; 50 o for MP joint and ≤ 40 o or &gt; 40o for PIP joint) and then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo.

Upon completion of the double-blind phase (i.e., 90-day evaluation after the first injection), all subjects entered an open-label extension study where they were followed for an additional 9 months (Study AUX-CC-858). Subjects who required  further  treatment  because  they  either  did  not  achieve  clinical success (the cord affecting the primary joint received placebo or another cord received &lt; 3 injections of AA4500) during the double-blind phase or they had untreated cords that were affecting other joints had the option to receive up to 5 additional injections of AA4500 in the open label extension study.

Protocol number: AUX-CC-859 This 12-month study had two phases; a 90-day double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase, and a nine-month open-label extension phase. Before treatment, eligible subjects were stratified by the primary joint type (30 MP joints and 30 PIP joints) and by severity of the primary joint contracture (i.e., ≤ 50° or &gt; 50° for MP joint and ≤ 40° or &gt; 40° for PIP joint) and then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo. Upon completion of the double-blind phase (i.e., 90-day evaluation after the first injection), all subjects were eligible to enter the open-label extension phase of the study in which they were followed for an additional nine months. Subjects who required further treatment because they either did not achieve reduction in contracture to 5° or less (the cord affecting the primary joint received placebo or another cord received &lt; three injections of AA4500 0.58 mg) during the double-blind phase or they had untreated cords that were affecting other joints had the option to receive up to five additional injections of AA4500 0.58 mg in the open-label extension phase, with individual joints receiving a maximum of three injections.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Efficacy data from the 3 Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (DUPY-303, AUX-CC-857, and AUX-CC-859) were combined and summarized with descriptive statistics for selected intrinsic and extrinsic factors and for the effect of joint type and baseline severity on outcome.

## Efficacy by Joint Type and Baseline Disease Activity

In the combined analysis of data from all three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, 254 MP joints (low severity [  50°] N = 154 and high severity [&gt; 50°] N=100) and 153 PIP joints (low severity [  40°] N=44 and high severity [&gt; 40°] N=109) were studied. The efficacy results by joint type and baseline  severity  indicate  that  AA4500  is  efficacious  in  both  MP  and  PIP  joints  and  across  a  broad range of severity of joint contractures. On average, less severely contracted MP and PIP joints had a reduction in contracture to &lt;10° after treatment with AA4500. Severely contracted MP and PIP joints responded to treatment with AA4500 to a lesser extent (to 12° for MP joints of high severity and 25.6° for PIP joints of high severity).

Efficacy  on  MP  joints  was  well  demonstrated  whereas  for  PIP  joints,  efficacy  was  not  so  obvious. Indeed, in study 857, a statistically significant proportion of patients met clinical success for PIP joints but  in  study  859,  the  statistical  difference  versus  placebo  was  not  reached.  Although  surgical procedures provide also less good efficacy results in PIP joints than in MP joints (due to a greater difficulty  to  treat  little  joints),  the  efficacy  of  collagenase  injections  in  PIP  joints  seems  not  so  well established than for MP joints.

Since study DUPY-303 is not considered as a pivotal study, data were presented also separately for studies AUX-CC-857 and AUX-CC-859 and are consistent with the pooled analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical studies in special populations

No  clinical  studies  were  conducted  in  special  populations.  As  systemic  exposure  to  AA4500  after intralesional injection into Dupuytren's cords is below quantifiable level, no clinical studies are deemed necessary  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  age,  gender  and  race  on  AA4500  or  in  subjects  with  impaired hepatic or renal function.

Subgroup  analysis  across  placebo-controlled  studies  for  age,  weight,  BMI,  gender  and  history  of diabetes  was  undertaken.  In  the  combined  analysis  of  data  from  all  three  double-blind,  placebocontrolled studies, no notable differences in efficacy were observed by age category (&lt; 45, 45-54 , 5564, 65-74, ≥ 75 years), weight quartile (first, second, third, fourth quartile), body mass index (BMI) category  (normal,  overweight,  obese),  and  history  of  diabetes  (yes,  no).    The  only  exception  was country  location  and  gender.  When  all  primary  joints  were  analyzed  by  country  location,  a  higher percentage of subjects treated in the United States had a reduction in contracture of the primary joint to 5° or less compared with subjects treated in Australia (66.8% versus 44.4%). While the percentage of  subjects  with a reduction in contracture to 5° or less was similar between the United States and Australia  for  primary  MP  joints,  the  success  rate  for  primary  PIP  joints  tended  to  be  higher  in  the United  States  compared  with  Australia.  Australian  subjects  however  may  have  had  more  severe disease at baseline.

In general, the criteria established for surgical intervention of Dupuytren's disease specify fixed-flexion contractures of &gt;30  for  MP joints and &gt;15  for PIP joints. Using these criteria in the two Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (AUX-CC-857 and AUX-CC- 859), 85.6% of subjects (131 of 153) with primary MP joints experienced a reduction in contracture to &lt;30 ◦ with 75.2% (115 of 153) achieving  clinical  success  (reduction  to  &lt;5 ◦ ).  Mean  change  in  contracture  was  41.3 ◦ at  Day  30 following  the  last  injection  for  all  153  subjects.  Approximately  52.6%  of  subjects  (50  of  95)  with primary PIP joints experienced a reduction in contracture to &lt;15 ◦ with  36.8% (35 of 95) achieving clinical success (reduction to &lt;5 ◦ ). Mean change in contracture was 31.3 ◦ at Day 30 following the last injection for all 95 subjects. Taken together these results indicate that surgical intervention would be either no longer indicated and/or delayed in the majority of the subjects that received injections of AA4500 to treat their Dupuytren's contracture.

A higher percentage of females (70.7%) treated with AA4500 had a reduction in contracture of the primary joint to 5° or less compared with male (61.7%) subjects. This difference may be attributed to females having less severe disease as evidenced by fewer joints of high severity compared to males (45.5% vs. 52.7%) and lower overall baseline fixed flexion contracture in MP joints (41.4  vs  48.7  ) and PIP joints (51.5  vs.  55.4  ).  No  conclusions could be drawn about race, as only one of the 409 subjects  who  were  treated  in  the  three  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  was  non-white.  The low  number  of  non-white  subjects  was  to  be  expected  as  Dupuytren's  disease  has  a  genetic predisposition  to  occur  in  men  of  Northern  European  ancestry.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  a history  of  diabetes  who  had  a  reduction  in  contracture  to  5°  or  less  was  similar  to  that  of  subjects without a history (63,6% and 63,1% respectively). However, no final conclusion can be drawn since the overall number of diabetic patients was low (22 of 271). Change in Surgical Eligibility Status Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Supportive studies

Studies DUPY-101, DUPY 202, DUPY 404, AUX-CC-851/852, AUX-CC-853, AUX-CC-854, AUX-CC-856, AUX-CC-858  and  AUX-CC-859  were  considered  as  supportive.  AUX-CC-851/852  and  AUX-CC-853 were terminated early due to a manufacturing issue. Data from these latter studies were not included in the pooled analyses of efficacy but were included in the safety analyses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  list  should  have  included  Study  DUPY-303  for  the  reasons  mentioned  above.  In  these  studies subjects could receive up to a total of 5 injections of AA4500 0.58 mg (10,000 U) with individual cords receiving up to three injections of AA4500. Each injection was separated by approximately 4 weeks. The primary endpoint in each study was the proportion of joints with a reduction in contracture to 5° or less after treatment.

The results for MP joints were generally comparable across all studies. The results for PIP joints were more variable than for MP joints across all studies, perhaps in part due to few number of PIP joints. Clinical Success ranges from 24.0% to 100%. Clinical improvement was more consistent with a range of  46.2%  to  67.1%  in  studies  for  which  that  endpoint  was  determined.  In  general  the  results  are consistent with the results of the pivotal trials.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Study  DUPY-202  has  been  performed  with  early  BTC  process  material  which  cannot  be  regarded representative  for  the  commercial  process  manufacturing  the  final  formulation.  Therefore,  the relevance of this study is put in question and data can only be considered supportive. However, based on the overall in vitro and in vivo data the selected AA4500 dose of 0.58 mg per injection and the dosing interval seem to be supported by sufficient data. The efficacy results observed with the highest dose of 10,000 U AA4500 (equivalent to 0.58 mg) were similar to those reported for surgical intervention. Therefore, no higher dose levels were studied. This is considered acceptable. The statistical  methods  for  the  pivotal  studies  AUX-CC-857,  AUX-CC-859  and  the  supportive  study DUPY-303  are  appropriate.  Both  pivotal  studies  AUX-CC-857  and  AUX-CC-859  had  open-label extension  phases  to  assess  the  effect  of  additional  treatments  for  joints  that  did  not  receive  3 injections and other joints. Up to 8 injections (5 in open-label phase) were allowed. In AUX-CC-854 up to 5 injections in total were allowed. Sample size calculations were based on 80% and 70% rates for clinical success for MP and PIP joints, respectively. Clinical success rates of 10 % for placebo injections were assumed. This is reasonable, although success rates were not achieved in the AUX-CC-859 study. A  randomization  ratio  of  2:1  was  selected  with  a  stratified  randomization  by  MP/PIP  joints  and baseline severity of contracture. The allocation selected is reasonable as the clinical success of placebo injections  was  expected  to  be  low.  Furthermore,  the  statistical  tests  for  primary  and  secondary analyses take into account the stratification used for randomisation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Inferential  statistics  are  based  on  the  comparisons  for  primary  joints.  This  is  appropriate  since  the randomization is based on the first treated joint and due to the limited clinical success rate of the placebo treatment most of the patients treated with placebo were expected to be treated only on one joint.

No interim analyses were performed or specified in the protocols.

Multiple hypothesis testing for efficacy was performed with a closed testing procedure that controlled the family-wise type I error on the 5% significance level. This approach is appropriate. The First 15 hypotheses in the AUX-CC-857 and AUX-CC-859 studies are related to the last injection, the last 12 hypotheses are related to first injection.  For the  AUX-CC-859 the hierarchical  procedure  had to  be stopped  after  the  tenth  level  ('reduction  in  contracture  to  5°  or  less'  for  PIP  joints)  and  no confirmative testing for the levels higher than 10 could be performed.

The primary efficacy variable and other variables expressing proportions were analyzed by a CochranMantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, which was stratified by baseline severity and joint type for all primary joints.  This  approach  is  appropriate.  For  the  rate  comparisons  only  the  statistical  results  and  listed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

proportions in 2x2 tables are provided. No adjusted odds ratio or confidence intervals are reported. This is not optimal but acceptable, since various aspects of the data that additionally allow assessing the clinical relevance are documented by the results for other secondary variables.

A  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  primary  efficacy  comparison  with  missing  values  rated  as  failures  is appropriate and confirms the robustness of the results for the primary efficacy comparison.

The  statistical  methods  for  the  secondary  variables  'change  from  baseline  in  ROM'  and  'Time  to achieve reduction in contracture to 5° or less' are appropriate.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

A  total  of  407  subjects  (AA4500  271  and  placebo  136)  were  enrolled  and  received  up  to  three injections  of  study  drug  into  the  cord  affecting  their  primary  joint  in  the  3  Phase  3,  double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The majority of subjects in each treatment group completed the study with few discontinuing  due  to  adverse  event  (3  subjects  in  the  AA4500  group  and  none  in  the  placebo group). Baseline demographics were similar between the two treatment groups from the two doubleblind, placebo-controlled pivotal studies. The subject population from these studies and the European subjects from the open-label study AUX-CC-854 were typical of subjects with Dupuytren's contracture. The majority (84.9% AA4500 0.58 mg group and 72.1% placebo group) of subjects were men, and most  subjects  were  white  (99.6%  AA4500  0.58  group  and  100%  in  both  the  placebo  group  and European  subjects  from  AUX-CC-854).  The  median  age  of  subjects  overall  was  63  years  in  the AA4500 0.58 mg treatment group, 64 years in the placebo  treatment  group,  and  63  years  in  the European subjects. The subject population from the Phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled studies and the European subjects from the open-label study AUX-CC-854 were similar with respect to years of disease (9.4 years and 8.4 years, respectively), presence of bilateral disease (38.6% and 38.7%, respectively), disease severity (modified Tubiana score of 3.1 and 2.9, respectively), fingers affected (majority of ring and little fingers), number of affected joints (73.9% and 72.9% had 1 or 2 joints affected, respectively) and number of affected fingers (89.8% and 86.2% had 1 or 2 fingers affected, respectively).  39.1  %  of  patients  in  the  AA4500  0.58  mg  treatment  group  had  prior  surgery  for Dupuytren's disease compared to 43.3% in the placebo group and 39.4% in the European subjects.

Of note, compared to US subjects from study AUX-CC-857, Australian subjects from study AUX-CC859 may had more severe disease at baseline as indicated by a greater proportion of affected PIP joints  (55.6%  versus  34.3%),  greater  proportion  of  affected  PIP  joints  in  the  little  finger  (42.2% versus 26.5%); more bilateral disease (51% versus 38%) and more medical history of prior surgery for  Dupuytren's  disease  (53%  versus  38%).  Apart  from  that  there  was  a  higher  proportion  of individuals older than 65 years or 75 years in the placebo group in study AUC-CC-859.

The severity of disease at baseline as assessed by the median total contracture index (about 50° of contracture)  and  the  number  and  type  of  affected  joints  seemed  to  suggest  that  included  patients have  a  moderate  Dupuytren's  disease  (approximately  50%  of  patients  had  a  stage  II  of  modified Tubiana's classification). Nevertheless, other clinical features such as positive family history, recurrent disease, presence of bilateral disease, total number of digits affected, number of surgical procedures, functional disability also reflect disease severity. Of note, the standard Tubiana's classification which is defined as the sum of the FFC at baseline in all joints (MP, PIP and DIP) was not used in the pivotal studies since angles at the DIP joints were not recorded. Hence, a modified Tubiana score was used, that does not take into account contracture angles at the DIP joints. Therefore, this modified score is likely to represent an underestimate of the true disease severity.

In addition, approximately 20% of patients had a severe disease at inclusion (stages 3 and 4 of the modified  Tubiana's  classification).  Overall,  it  is  considered  that  included  patients  correspond  to  the target population.

The primary endpoint was achieved in each of the two pivotal double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that is, AA4500 0.58 mg was statistically superior to placebo with respect to the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in contracture to 5° or less of their primary joint after the last injection (p&lt;0.001). Overall, 64,0% of all AA4500 treated primary joints achieved a reduction in contracture of the primary joint to 5° or less in Study AUX-CC-857 (76.7% for MP joints and 40% for PIP joints), and 44,4% in Study AUX-CC-859 (65% for MP joints and 28% for PIP joints) compared to 6,8% and 4,8% respectively for placebo. In study AUX-CC 859, although more primary PIP joints treated with up to three injections had a reduction in contracture to 5° or less compared with placebo (7 joints [28.0%] versus 0 joints),  the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p=0.069).

In  addition,  72.2%  (13/18)  of  the  subjects  in  the  AA4500  group  who  did  not  have  a  reduction  in contracture to 5° or less in their primary PIP joint did not receive the full treatment regimen of up to 3 injections,  most  commonly  because  there  was  'no  palpable  cord  to  inject'  after  only  one  or  two injections of AA4500 0.58 mg. In the pooled placebo-controlled studies 271 cords affecting primary joints were treated with 455 injections.

Heterogeneity observed for the primary variable between regions and centers is of concern, as the application of AA4500 involves a complex procedure and this might influence the generalizability of the results of the studies. The Applicant comprehensively discussed the difference in clinical success rates between regions (US and  Australia)  for  the  AUX-CC-857  and  AUX-CC-859  studies  and  provides  valid  reasons  for  the observed differences.  However,  there  is  a  considerable  heterogeneity  found  for  the  clinical  success rate  in  the  AUX-CC-857  study  conducted  in  16  US  centers.  Data  of  tests  for  heterogeneity  of  the success  rates  in  the  different  centers  for  the  AUX-CC-857  study  were  provided.  Due  to  the  small sample size the power for possible tests of heterogeneity is limited. It is agreed that the results of the presented tests are not incompatible with homogeneity and that observed heterogeneity could be due to variability in a binomial endpoint given the small sample size. For further exploration of a possible center effect and its cause without the use of statistical methods, links to baseline data for centers with the highest and lowest success rates were provided. Different baseline fixed flexion contracture may have had an influence on the success rates. It is acknowledged that the success rates in each center for the AA4500 treatment group were higher than in the placebo group. Although  no  specific  concerns  on  the  heterogeneity  of  the  results  of  study  AUX-CC-857  remain,  a carefully planned and conducted training of prescribing physicians for treatment with AA4500 seems warranted to ensure high success rates for varying baseline conditions.

Study DUPY-303 can be considered only as supportive trial since it was conducted at a single center in the US by one investigator and included only 35 patients. Generalisability of efficacy results of trials with fewer centers, patients and investigators may be questioned. Apart from that, it was performed with a study drug that was produced by an earlier manufacturing process.

The efficacy results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies were comparable to the results observed from European subjects in the AUX-CC-854 open-label study. 50.5% of all treated joints (60.5 % for MP joints and 37.9 % for PIP joints) achieved a reduction in contracture to 5° or less after the last injection. This open label study is considered relevant because the pivotal doubleblind  studies  did  not  enrol  patients  from  European  countries.  In  AUX-CC-854  patients  had  similar baseline characteristics and comparable severity of the disease to those in pivotal studies AUX-CC-857 and AUX-CC-859. In addition, similar variables to assess the efficacy of the treatment with AA4500 were included in the study design. This allows comparisons of the exploratory results for treatment effects between populations. No formal sample size estimation was performed for AUX-CC-854.

It has been demonstrated that the absolute change in fixed flexion contracture was highest in subjects with  severe  and  very  severe  disease  whereas  the  primary  endpoint  clinical  success  (defined  as  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reduction in contracture to 5 ◦ or less) was generally highest in subjects with low severity. This is also reported  in  literature  for  surgical  interventions  including  PNF.  From  the  data  presented,  it  can  be concluded that subjects with more severe disease also benefit from treatment with Xiapex. For PIP joints,  efficacy  was  less  clearly  demonstrated  than  for  MP  joints.  However,  of  the  95  collagenase treated PIP joints, 73 (76.8%) were in the little finger which are considered the most difficult to treat due to anatomical structure and other variables. The small sample size could also explain for a part the difference observed in efficacy. However, the Applicant presented an analysis to show that even the most severely affected PIP joints showed meaningful clinical improvement. Overall, these findings are similar to what is observed for surgical corrections or PNF outlined in published literature.

Tubiana  classification  is  a  measurement  used  to  determine  disease  severity  in  patients  with Dupuytren´s contracture and is defined as the sum of the fixed flexion contractures (FFC) at baseline in all joints (MP, PIP and DIP) which is then translated to a scale of 1 to 4 based on the calculated FFC. Since DIP joints were not recorded in the studies a modified Tubiana score was used in the analyses presented which due to the lack of the DIP joints is likely to represent an underestimate of the true disease severity.

Therefore, the responder rates of ROM, instead of mean change from baseline, might be helpful to provide more insight and are considered more relevant to assess a clinical relevance of this outcome. The  efficacy  profile  was  similar  to  that  seen  across  surgical  procedures,  and  a  more  thorough comparison between collagenase injections and percutaneous needle fasciotomy suggests that efficacy outcomes  with  AA4500  are  similar  to  those  observed  following  PNF  with  perhaps  a  slightly  better outcome for PIP joints. No clinically meaningful differences in the efficacy of AA4500 0.58 mg were observed by age, gender, weight quartile, BMI category, or history of diabetes.  However, included patient numbers for this latter subgroup was low and no final conclusion can be drawn. In addition, efficacy  data  from  the  non-primary  joints  evaluated  in  the  open-label  studies  provide  supportive evidence of the efficacy of AA4500 0.58 mg in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.

In  all  studies,  AA4500  met  the  primary  endpoint  demonstrating  consistently  efficacy  in  reducing contractures  in  both  MP  and  PIP  joints  in  patients  with  moderate  (about  50%  of  patients  had moderate  disease  at  inclusion,  i.e.  a  modified  Tubiana  score  of  2)  and  severe  disease  (20%  of included patients, i.e a modified Tubiana score of 3 and 4). Therefore, a wide indication to all types of severity (low and high severity) in Dupuytren's disease is considered acceptable. The significant  correction  in  finger  deformity  was  associated  with  significant  improvements  in  both ROM and subject global assessment of treatment satisfaction indicating clinically relevant benefit to the patients. Patient subjective ratings are endorsed by physician global assessment of improvement. However, only surrogate endpoints and indirect evidence is given to justify an improvement of clinical hand-function. The Applicant justifies the lack of functional hand assessment tools (such as DASH) which were designed and validated for conditions other than Dupuytren's contractures. Overall,  the  proposed  indication  'treatment  of  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  adult  patients  with  a palpable cord' is supported by sufficient data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Because no non-surgical treatments are currently available, the incidence of contracture recurrence in the  AP4500  studies  was  compared  to  the  reported  incidence  of  contracture  recurrence  following fasciectomy  and/or  PNF  for  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  literature.  Depending  on  the  definition  of recurrence, and the duration of follow-up, highly variable recurrence rates have been reported.

The recurrence rate of 4% is at the lower range of the reported incidence of contracture recurrence after  surgery  in  literature  (2%-  65%)  and  provides  evidence  of  the  durability  of  treatment  effect within the 12-month period after the first injection of AA4500 0.58 mg. Meanwhile 2 year data (730 days) are available and as expected the recurrence rate has increased. The nominal rate of recurrence is 15.9 % in the presence of a palpable cord and 19,9 % with or without a palpable cord. In summary, the recurrence rate has increased following 2 years of follow up compared to 1 year, but overall the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recurrence rates with or without a palpable cord in A4500 treated joints continue to be comparable to the rates observed in the literature for surgical intervention and appear favorable compared to those reported for PNF.

However,  more  long-term  follow-up  data  are  needed  and  will  be  provided  post-approval  on  the ongoing extension trial AUX-CC-860 through interim clinical study reports at Years 3, 4, and 5 posttreatment.

## Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In summary in both pivotal Phase 3 studies (AUX-CC-857 and AUX-CC-859), AA4500 0.58 mg was demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease across a broad range of fixed flexion contractures (high and low severity). Therefore, a wide indication to all types of severity (low and high severity) in Dupuytren's disease is considered acceptable .

For PIP joints, efficacy was less clearly demonstrated than for MP joints. Severely contracted MP and PIP joints responded to treatment with AA4500 to a lesser extent .

The efficacy profile was comparable to the current mainstay of treatment, i.e. surgical intervention and percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF), a minimally invasive technique until now not so commonly used across Europe. The recurrence rate of 4% provides evidence of the durability of treatment effect for the 9 to 12month period after first injection. The recurrence rate has increased following 2 years of follow up (19,9%), but overall the recurrence rates with or without a palpable cord in AA4500 treated joints continue to be comparable to the rates observed in the literature for surgical intervention and appear favourable compared to those reported for PNF. However, more long-term follow-up data are needed. Recurrence data from AUX-CC-860 will continue to be provided annually through interim clinical study reports at Years 3, 4, and 5 post-treatment. Overall,  the  proposed  indication  'treatment  of  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  adult  patients  with  a palpable cord' is supported by sufficient data. 2.6 Clinical safety Patient exposure Overall there were 1196 subjects who were enrolled and treated in the AA4500 clinical programme with  1082  subjects  receiving  at  least  1  dose  of  AA4500  0.58  mg  comprising  the  formal  safety database.  Two  early  development  studies  (DUPY-101  and  Badalamente  and  Hurst,  2000)  which collectively treated 84 subjects were excluded from the pooled analyses, as they lacked formal study databases; results from these studies are not included in the Formal Safety Database. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Seventeen (17)  subjects  who  received  less  than  0.58  mg  of  AA4500  and  participated  in  the  dose ranging studies were not in the All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population.

Three integrated populations were analyzed in order to characterize the safety of AA4500 0.58 mg in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture:

-  The  Phase  3  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled  population  comprised  409  subjects  who received at least 1 injection of double-blind study medication (137 placebo subjects, 272 AA4500  0.58  mg  subjects)  in  Studies  DUPY-303  and  AUX-CC-857,  and  the  double-blind phase  of  Study  AUX-CC-859.  Subjects  in  this  population  could  have  received  up  to  3 injections of either AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo.
-  The All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population included 1082 subjects who received at least 1 dose of AA4500 0.58 mg across 11 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (Studies  DUPY-202, DUPY-303, DUPY-404, AUX-CC-851, AUX-CC-853, AUX-CC-854, AUX-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CC-855,  AUX-CC-856,  AUX-CC-857,  AUX-CC-858,  and  AUX-CC-859;  excludes  DUPY-101 and  Badalamente  and  Hurst,  2000,  which  lacked  formal  databases).  Subjects  in  this population could have received up to 8 injections of AA4500 0.58 mg.

-  The All Subjects With 12 Months Post First Dose AA4500 0.58 mg population was a subset of the All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population and included 268 subjects  whose  final  study  visit  was  more  than  48  weeks  (336  days)  after  their  first injection  of  AA4500  0.58  mg  from  Studies  DUPY-202,  DUPY-303/404,  AUX-CC-85  1/852, AUX-CC-853, AUX-CC-857/858, and AUX-CC-859. This analysis set was used to evaluate the long-term safety profile of AA4500 0.58 mg.

Additionally,  a  safety  sub-analysis  was  performed  on  those  subjects  from  investigator  sites  in  EU countries that participated in Study AUX-CC-854.

## Adverse events

Across  all  populations,  the  majority  of  TEAEs  and  treatment-related  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in severity and occurred in the treated extremity. In the All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population, few subjects experienced AEs during the posttreatment period (from Day 31 after last  injection  through  the  end  of  the  study)  compared  to  during  the  treatment  period  (32.3%  vs. 97.0%). Results were similar in the other populations. In the Phase 3 Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled population, approximately two times as many AA4500 treated  patients  than  placebo-treated  patients  had  an  AE  (97,8%  versus  54%).  The  majority  of AA4500 associated AE were local reactions. The most frequently reported TEAEs and treatment-related AEs were oedema peripheral, contusion, injection site  pain, injection  site  haemorrhage,  and  pain  in extremity and were likely related to AA4500 injection. A greater proportion of AA4500 treated patients compared to the placebo group experienced pain at the injection site (39% vs. 9.5%) or pain in the extremity (33.1% vs. 3.6%). The  AE  profile  of  AA4500  0.58  mg  in  the  All  Subjects  With  At  Least  1  Dose  of  AA4500  0.58  mg population was similar to that of the AA4500 0.58 mg treatment group in the Phase 3 Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled population (oedema  peripheral,  contusion, injection site pain, injection site haemorrhage, pain in extremity and tenderness). Most adverse reactions resolved within 2 weeks after injection.  However,  some  adverse  reactions  such  injection  site  vesicles  and  blisters  had  a  longer median duration. Furthermore, an analysis of AEs by SOCs was consistent and revealed no new safety signals. The adverse event profile for European subjects enrolled in Study AUX-CC-854 was similar to that for the All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Some  exceptions  to  this  were  haematoma  and  injection  site  vesicles  which  occurred  in  a  higher frequency  in  the  European  population.  One  explanation  for  differences  in  the  incidence  of  specific events (eg, contusion, ecchymosis, haematoma) observed among study location may be differences in local diagnostic classification and/or choice of Preferred Term for a given AE.

Further analysis of treatment-related AEs in the All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population demonstrated that most treatment-related AEs started on the day of injection or the day of the finger extension procedure. The overall percentage of subjects treated with AA4500 0.58 mg who reported treatment-related AEs was similar across injections 1 through 8. Moreover, with the exception of oedema peripheral and pruritus, no clinically meaningful increase or trend in duration of the most frequently  reported  treatment-related  AEs  was  observed  with  increased  number  of  injections  of AA4500 0.58 mg. The term oedema peripheral represents the most common adverse reaction in the AA4500 clinical programme. This preferred term describes not only oedema in the treated extremity but also other oedematous states. Similarly, the PT Pruritus not only describes localized pruritus in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treated extremity but also cases of generalized Pruritus. The Applicant provided a comprehensive table separating  oedema  in  the  treated  extremity  and  other  oedematous  states  and  similarly  localized pruritus and cases of generalized Pruritus. There was no hint for a generalised reaction.

Of  subjects  who  had  between  2  to  5  injections  of  AA4500  0.58  mg  and  who  experienced  oedema peripheral,  the  majority  experienced  these  events  at  nearly  every  injection.  For  other  TEAEs,  the majority of subjects who received multiple injections of AA4500 0.58 mg had no consistent pattern of specific treatment-related events occurring with subsequent injections with the exception of pruritus. There  were  too  few  subjects  who  received  between  6  and  8  injections  (N=13  or  14)  to  draw meaningful conclusions regarding a pattern of treatment-related AE occurrence.

For the All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population, TEAEs were summarized by age (&lt; 45 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, ≥ 75 years), gender (male, female), weight quartile  (first,  second,  third,  fourth  quartile),  BMI  category  (normal,  overweight,  obesity),  diabetes history  (history  of  diabetes,  no  history  of  diabetes),  and  study  location  (United  States,  Europe, Australia).  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  observed  between or  among subgroups. Due to the  small  sample  size  of  non-white  subjects  compared  to  white  subjects,  no  clinically  meaningful comparisons of the incidence of TEAEs by race could be made.

Serious adverse events and deaths Serious adverse events A total of 94 subjects experienced at least one nonfatal SAE across all 13 studies among which were at least 88 subjects who received at least one injection of AA4500 0.58 mg. Eleven (1.0%, 11/1082) subjects who received at least 1 injection of AA4500 0.58 mg experienced a treatment-related SAE or SAE with unknown relationship to study drug. The percentage of subjects prematurely discontinuing due to an AE was also low (0.8%, 9/1082). Three subjects had the adverse reaction of tendon rupture (3/1082) and one subject had an adverse reaction of ligament injury (flexion pulley rupture) in the little PIP joints. All of these adverse reactions occurred  in  little  finger  PIP  joints  and  were  classified  as  serious  adverse  events.  The  cause  of  the adverse reaction is thought to be the inadvertent exposure or injection of AA4500 into or around the tendon/ligament structure rather than the Dupuytren's cord. After two of these initial serious adverse reactions of tendon rupture following 734 injections had been reported, all investigators were informed of these events, the study protocols were modified and all investigators were trained with the revised injection  procedure.  The  training  introduced  a  refined  injection  technique  for  little  finger  PIP  joints. Subsequent to these steps being taken, there was only one additional tendon rupture over a total of 1896 additional injections of AA4500. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There  were  no  reports  of  nerve  injury  or  division,  artery  damage,  circulatory  disturbance,  wound infection,  scar  contracture  or  stiffness  following  treatment  with  AA4500.  The  incidence  rate  for neuropraxia (including paresthesia, dysesthesia) was uncommon, (less than 3%) and reversible. In addition, only one case of CRPS was reported which occurred in a female patient with a history of CRPS  following  surgical  release  of  a  carpal  tunnel  syndrome.  In  Study  AUX-CC-856  one  patient underwent amputation of the right little finger and MP joint. The patient narrative was provided and mentions injury of the right little finger which had advanced Dupuytren's disease while throwing out trash with subsequent amputation of the right little finger and MP joint. The event is not considered related to the study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A literature research of surgical complications was undertaken, however a direct comparison of the incidence  of  SAE  of  injection  versus  surgical  intervention  was  not  feasible  since  literature  does  not specifically discuss adverse events in the context whether or not they were serious.

Overall,  the  numbers  of  serious  adverse  events  reported  as  related  to  AA4500  from  the  clinical programme are low and the risks associated have been well characterised and are largely based on anticipated pharmacology of collagenase. The majority of AA4500 treatment related SAEs occurred in the treated extremity. Four of these were related to the effect of inadvertent injection or extravasation of AA4500 into or around the tendon/ligament structure rather than the Dupuytren's cord.

The number of tendon ruptures was comparable to surgery but higher than that reported for PNF. Other  SAEs  related  to  events  of  the  hand  included  tendonitis,  finger  deformity,  CRPS,  sensory disturbance and Dupuytren's contracture. Events associated with fasciectomy that would be judged to be medically serious by inspection of the surgical literature also indicate surgical damage to nerves, tendons, and arteries as well as CRPS, pain, issues of wound healing, and infection which generally occurred at increased frequencies relative to treatment with AA4500.

Overall, as far as one can judge given the lack of direct comparison of the incidence of SAE and AE between collagenase injection and surgical procedures or PNF, the safety profile of collagenase seems better than surgery and generally similar to PNF. Deaths Seven subjects died during the course of the clinical programme. All serious adverse events leading to these deaths are not unexpected in this elderly population and none of these deaths were considered to be related to study drug. Each of the subjects was treated with AA4500 with the deaths occurring from 2 months to more than 1 year after the last dose of study drug. Special Safety Topics  Local Reactions Local reactions at or around the site of injection is a nearly universal finding in subjects treated with AA4500,  as  captured  in  the  PTs:  Oedema  peripheral,  Contusion,  Injection  site  pain,  Injection  site haemorrhage, Injection site swelling, Pain in extremity, Tenderness, Ecchymosis, Blood blister, Blister, Inflammation,  Erythema,  and  Swelling.  The  majority  of  adverse  reactions  in  subjects  treated  with AA4500  (0.58  mg)  either  began  on  the  day  of  injection  or  on  the  day  of  the  finger  extension procedure  (one  day  post-injection).  Almost  all  treatment-related  AEs  resolved  without  intervention before the next scheduled injection of AA4500 and typically within 2 weeks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Skin Lesions

In some cases of Dupuytren's contracture, especially in patients with more advanced disease, the cord may  become  adherent to the skin overlying the cord and often becomes  thin and easily damaged. Patients with Dupuytren's contractures that adhere to the skin are at higher risk for AEs of skin lesions as a result of the pharmacological effect of AA4500 and the finger extension procedure on the  skin  overlying  the  targeted  cord.  Event  terms  that  describe  adverse  reactions  linked  to  the breakdown of the skin overlying pathologic cords observed in clinical studies of AA4500 occurred at the following  frequencies:  skin  laceration  (120/1082;  11.1%),  wound  (6/1082;  0.6%),  skin  exfoliation (2/1082;  0.2%),  skin  lesion  (2/1082;  0.2%),  skin  necrosis  (1/1082;  0.1%),  and  injection  site desquamation (3/1082; 0.3%).  All but 4 events of skin laceration were mild or moderate in severity and all healed without complication.

-  Injection Site Bleeding in Patients with Coagulation Disorders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  clinical  development  programme  for  AA4500,  subjects  receiving  anticoagulant  medication (except for daily low-dose aspirin, i.e., doses up to 150 mg daily) within 7 days of enrolment were excluded.  Adverse  reactions  involving  injection  site  haemorrhage  were  frequent,  occurring  in 369/1082 (34.1%) of the subjects in the clinical programme, though less than 1% of these subject experienced  injection  site  haemorrhage  that  was  considered  severe  (10/1082,  0.9%).  Importantly, the  events  with  PT  injection  site  haemorrhage  are  representative  of  ecchymosis  and  subcutaneous haemorrhage and do not indicate active bleeding. None of the subjects participating in  the  clinical programme required any invasive procedures to control bleeding.

## Laboratory findings

No  clinically meaningful  changes  were  observed  between  baseline  and  final assessment  for haematology, chemistry, and vital sign parameters. Mean changes in hand grip strength from baseline to the final assessment for the primary and secondary hand were not considered clinically meaningful in any analysis population.

Safety results in the All Subjects With 12 Months Post First Dose AA4500 0.58 mg population were similar to those in the All Subjects With At Least 1 Dose of AA4500 0.58 mg population with respect to AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign results, and hand grip strength assessment.

## Safety in special populations

No  clinical  studies  were  conducted  in  special  populations.  As  systemic  exposure  to  AA4500  after intralesional injection into Dupuytren's cords is below quantifiable level, no clinical studies are deemed necessary to evaluate the effects of age, gender and race on AA4500 or in subjects with impaired hepatic or renal function.

## Immunological events

As  expected  when  foreign  proteins  are  injected  into  tissues  and  an  antibody  response  is  elicited, immune-mediated reactions have been reported with the use of AA4500. The adverse reaction profile of AA4500 includes PTs that are possibly consistent with immune-mediated reactions: Lymphadenopathy,  Lymph  node  pain,  Axillary  pain,  Erythema,  Oedema  peripheral,  Pruritus,  and Injection site pruritus. As noted above, the etiology of the local reactions to injection is likely partially immune-mediated, and adverse reactions coded to these PTs are possibly consistent with an immune response  to  the  injection  of  AA4500.  These  adverse  reactions  were  nearly  always  in  the  treated extremity, and there were no findings of diffuse adenopathy or anaphylaxis in the clinical programme that could be consistent with severe systemic hypersensitivity.

Most  subjects  ( ≥ 85.8%)  had  positive  antibodies  to  AUX-I  and/or  AUX-II  30  days  after  the  first injection of AA4500, with all subjects developing antibodies to both AUX-I and AUX-II by the fourth injection. Mean log titre levels were almost 2-fold higher after the second injection compared with the first. Levels continued to increase after the first three injections, appearing to plateau after the fourth injection. Among those subjects who received one injection of AA4500 0.58 mg, there was diminution of titre levels 1-year after injection. Antibody titres also decreased at 1-year after the last injection in those subjects that received more than 1 injection although the rate of decrease seemed slower than in subjects that received only 1 injection. Kinetics of titer levels of anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II revealed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in summary that all Injection Cohorts increase to a maximum level that depends on the number of injections received, with 4 or more injections giving approximately the same Maximum Sample mean titer  levels  of  5  to  5.5  (titer  level  of  100,000  to  300,000).  Furthermore,  all  Injection  Cohorts  are showing a decrease in titer levels by the time of the Year 2 Sample but only subjects who received a total of 1 or 2 injections have started to become serum negative at Year 2.

More information on the impact of these antibodies on re-treatment after treatment pause and the impacts  this  might  have  on  treatment  recommendations  are  expected  from  the  three  Phase  3b/4 studies.

There were few immune mediated adverse events such as pruritus, lymphadenopathy, hypersensitivity  and  urticaria.  The  incidence  of  pruritus  increased  with  subsequent  injections  but generally  resolved  prior  to  the  next  injection  (median  4.0  days).  The  incidence  of  some  of  these events also seemed to increase in subjects with 90 days or more between injections. There was no evidence  of  severe  systemic  hypersensitivity  or  anaphylaxis  in  the  safety  population  including  the evaluation of patients who had experienced a drug holiday of greater than 90 or 180 days in between two doses of AA4500.

In addition, exacerbation of autoimmune diseases secondary to cross-reactivity of AUX-1 and AUX-2 is a  potential  adverse  reaction.  A  post-hoc  analysis  was  performed  on  33  subjects  that  had  a  preexisting autoimmune condition (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (13), Rheumatoid Arthritis (7), Dry Eye (5), Hepatitis (2), scleroderma (2), Connective Tissue Disorder (2), and Inclusion Body Myositis (1)). No acute  exacerbations  of  the  underlying  condition  were  reported  except  for  one  moderate  case  of exacerbation  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  a  76  year  old  male  which  was  considered  not  related  to AA4500 by the investigator. The rate of all adverse reactions was similar in this group compared to all subjects without pre-existing autoimmune disease in the clinical programme for AA4500.

There was also no correlation between antibody titre and severity or duration of adverse events. An MMP inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS) has been described in literature after oral treatment  with  matrix  metalloproteinase  inhibitors  in  knee  osteoarthritis  which  includes  shoulder arthralgia,  myalgia,  and  stiffness,  as  well  as  hand  oedema,  palmar  fibrosis,  tendons/thickening nodules (reminiscent of the early development of Dupuytren's contracture) (Krzeski et al., 2007) In  the  AA4500  clinical  programme,  review  of  all  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  revealed  no signals identified for a combination of AEs suggestive of the musculoskeletal syndrome. Oedema, joint stiffness and musculoskeletal stiffness were found in the treated extremity following the first dose (in the  absence  of  anti-drug  antibodies)  as  well  as  following  subsequent  doses.   However,  the  patient numbers included up till now are too low to really exclude this adverse event. As discussed above in vitro  data  from  5  patients  indicated  at  least  a  potential  for  the  cross-reactivity  of  anti-product antibodies  with  endogenous  proteins  and  should  be  further  investigated  to  identify  an  unexpected serious risk of inhibiting enzymatic activity of the endogenous matrix metalloproteinases with Xiapex treatment.

Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with AA4500 0.58 mg, as human pharmacokinetic studies show that AA4500 0.58 mg is not significantly absorbed into the systemic circulation following injection  into  a  Dupuytren's  cord.  Whilst  there  is  no  clinical  evidence  of  an  interaction  between tetracycline and anthraquinone derivatives and Xiapex, such derivatives have been shown to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-mediated collagen degradation at pharmacologically relevant concentrations .    Therefore,  use  of  Xiapex  in  patients  who  have  received  tetracycline  antibiotics  (e.g.

in  vitro doxycycline) within 14 days prior to receiving an injection of Xiapex is not recommended.

## Discontinuation due to AES

Across  the  13  studies,  nine  subjects  had  a  nonfatal  AE  recorded  as  a  reason  for  premature discontinuation  (0.8%,  9/1082).  Only  three  events  (injection  site  pain,  dizziness,  complex  regional pain syndrome) were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug.  No specific TEAEs led to premature discontinuation in more than one subject. There was no pattern in the types of AEs leading to premature discontinuation.

## Post marketing experience

No post marketing data is available.

Discussion on clinical safety Overall  there  were  1196  subjects  who  were  enrolled  and  treated  in  the  AA4500  clinical  programme with  1082  subjects  receiving  at  least  1  dose  of  AA4500  0.58  mg  comprising  the  formal  safety database.  Based  on  the  review  of  the  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  of  the  AA4500  development programme,  the  adverse  events  of  interest  include:  local  reactions,  potential  immune-mediated events, tendon/ligament rupture or injury, skin lesions, and injection site bleeding. Proposed activities to mitigate the risk associated with those adverse reactions are described in the Risk Management Plan. The influence of investigator training on adverse events, especially serious adverse events like tendon ruptures is crucial for the safe application of the drug. Investigator  training  in  the  clinical  studies  included  intensive  injection  technique  instructions  via manuals and DVDs, workshops and investigator meetings and it has to be ensured that the training for the education of healthcare professionals in clinical practice is adequate. The safety results studies with AA4500 0.58 mg indicate that the majority of TEAEs were non serious, mild or moderate in intensity, confined to the treated extremity, and resolved within a short period without sequelae.

In  the  Phase  3  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled  population,  approximately  two  times  as  many AA4500  treated  patients  than  placebo-treated  patients  had  an  AE  (97.8%  versus  54%).  Among subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  AA4500  0.58  mg,  most  patients  experienced  adverse reactions  in  the  treated  extremity,  with  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  reported being: oedema peripheral, contusion, injection site pain, pain in extremity, injection site haemorrhage, and  tenderness.  A  greater  proportion  of  AA4500  treated  patients  compared  to  the  placebo  group experienced pain at the injection site (39% vs. 9.5%) or pain in the extremity (33.1% vs. 3.6%).

Eleven (1.0%, 11/1082) subjects who received at least 1 injection of AA4500 0.58 mg experienced a treatment-related SAE or SAE with unknown relationship to study drug.

The majority of treatment-related SAEs were related to events of the treated hand. Four of these were related to unintended effects of AA4500 on collagen (three tendon ruptures and one ligament injury [pulley injury]). The cause of these adverse reactions is thought to be the inadvertent exposure or injection  of  AA4500  into  or  around  the  tendon/ligament  structure  rather  than  into  the  Dupuytren's cord. A physician training plan is part of the risk minimization plan and includes tendon rupture and severe systemic hypersensitivity as specific scopes which is of utmost importance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the highly immunogenic potential of AA4500 the majority of subjects developed ADAs after the first  injection  and  all  subjects  had  antibodies  after  four  or  more  injections.  However,  no  adverse reactions  consistent  with  systemic  hypersensitivity  or  anaphylactic  response  were  observed  in  the Dupuytren's disease programme. Except for pruritus and oedema peripheral, no clear increase in the number of adverse events with subsequent injections were observed. ADA titres were not predictive of the rate, severity, or duration of any of the adverse events. Potential cross-reactivity of neutralising antibodies (Nabs) against AUX-I or AUX-II to endogenous MMPs represents a serious risk for adverse effects, e.g. development of musculoskeletal syndrome which is characterized by one or more of the following  signs  and  symptoms: arthralgia,  myalgia,  joint  stiffness,  stiffness  of  the  shoulders,  hand oedema, palmar fibrosis and thickening or nodules forming in the tendons. Adverse events did not reveal  any  clinical  findings  indicative  of  the  musculoskeletal  syndrome.  This  suggests  that  ADAs  to both AUX-I and AUX-II, while present in all subjects after four or more injections, did not affect the safety profile of AA4500.

However, although in the clinical programme there was no signal identified for a combination of AE suggestive of the musculoskeletal syndrome, a potential for cross-reactivity of anti-product antibodies (anti-AUX-I and  anti-AUX-II) with endogenous  human  matrix  metalloproteinases  with  similar homology could not really be excluded. In vitro assessment of cross-reactivity has been performed in 5 patients and additional cross-reactivity experiments using a validated assay were provided. However, assay results are not considered to be reliable. Currently, the detection of cross reactivity of anti-AUXI  or  anti-AUX-II  antibodies  versus  the  selected  MMPs  is  restricted  to  binding  assays.  This  is  not considered sufficient. The cross-reactivity should be additionally investigated in terms of inactivation of endogenous MMPs by neutralising ADAs. The applicant committed to develop and validate a respective assay that is based on enzymatic activity of the MMPs. For the time being this is addressed in the educational program, the labelling and the RMP. Long-term  safety  data  after  repeated  administration  are  lacking  and  potential  long-term  effects  of MMP cross-allergy need to be monitored. Regarding the neutralising potential of ADAs versus AUX-I and AUX-II, data on the determination of the optimised concentrations of enzymes and substrate were not provided. It is acknowledged that varying  amounts  of  alpha-2-macroglobulin  in  the  sera  to  be  tested  may  disturb  the  assay.  This however  does  not  release  the  Applicant  from  developing  a  suitable  assay  to  assess  potential neutralising  activity  of  NAbs  not  only  in  terms  of  binding  but  also  in  terms  of  enzymatic  and  thus pharmacodynamic  activity  of  the  drug  substance.  The  assay  setup  should  not  only  be  based  on literature but on experimental data. The applicant committed to initiate feasibility studies to evaluate the potential impact of Nabs and /or anti-AUX-I or -II on enzymatic activity of endogenous MMPs.

## Conclusions on the clinical safety

In  conclusion,  the  safety  results  studies  with  AA4500  0.58  mg  indicate  that  the  majority  of  TEAEs were non serious, mild or moderate in intensity, confined to the treated extremity, and resolved within a short period without sequelae.

-  Among  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  AA4500  0.58  mg,  most  patients experienced adverse reactions in the treated extremity, with the most frequently reported adverse reactions reported being: oedema peripheral, contusion, injection site pain, pain in extremity, injection site haemorrhage, and tenderness.
-  The majority of treatment-related SAEs were related to events of the treated hand. Four of these were related to unintended effects of AA4500 on collagen (three tendon ruptures and one ligament injury [pulley injury]). The cause of these adverse reactions is thought to be the  inadvertent  exposure  or  injection  of  AA4500  into  or  around  the  tendon/ligament structure rather than into the Dupuytren's cord.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Most  subjects  had  positive  antibodies  to  AUX-I  and/or  AUX-II  by  30  days  after  the  first injection of AA4500, with all subjects developing positive antibodies to both AUX-I and AUXII by the fourth injection of AA4500.
-  The  adverse  reaction  profile  of  AA4500  includes  events  that  are  consistent  with  both immune-mediated  reactions  to  collagenase  clostridium  histolyticum  and  inflammatory response to collagen breakdown peptides as a result of the collagenase activity of AA4500 on the Dupuytren's cord. These reactions were limited to the treated extremity
-  There  were  no  observed  cases  of  severe  systemic  hypersensitivity  or  anaphylaxis  in  the clinical development programme for AA4500, including the evaluation of patients who had experience a drug holiday of greater than 90 or 180 days in between two doses of AA4500.
-  No clinically meaningful effects on hand grip strength or laboratory or vital sign parameters were observed.
-  The  universal  formation  of  anti-drug  antibodies  does  not  seem  to  affect  the  safety  and efficacy profile of AA4500.
-  Although in the clinical programme there was no signal identified for a combination of AE suggestive of the musculoskeletal syndrome, a potential for cross-reactivity of anti-product antibodies (anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II) with endogenous human matrix metalloproteinases with  similar  homology  could  not  really  be  excluded  by  the  existing  data  and  should therefore be further investigated.  More information on the development of antibody titres after treatment and the impacts this might have on re-treatment is expected from ongoing studies. The question of re-treatment using  Xiapex  following  previous  treatment  will  be  addressed  in  Study  AUX-CC-862-Retreatment study that will  utilize  patients  with  recurrent  joints  requiring  further  treatment from the existing long term follow-up study AUX-CC-860.  As far as one can judge given the lack of direct comparison of the incidence of SAE and AE between  collagenase  injection  and  surgical  procedures  or  PNF,  the  safety  profile  of collagenase seems better than surgery and generally similar to PNF. The  SmPC  adequately  describes  the  current  safety  profile  and  the  elements  to  mitigate  the  risks associated with the product. 2.7 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system Medicinal product no longer authorised

Risk Management Committee

## Proposed Activities Risk Minimization SmPC (Section 4.8):

'The most frequently reported adverse reactions during the Xiapex clinical studies were local injection site reactions such as oedema peripheral (local to the injection site), contusion (including ecchymosis), injection site haemorrhage and injection site pain. Injection site reactions were very common, occurring in the vast majority of patients, were mostly mild to moderate in severity and generally subsided within 1-2 weeks post injection. Serious adverse reactions of tendon rupture (3 cases), tendonitis (1 case), other ligament injury (1 case) and complex regional pain syndrome (1 case) related to the medicinal product were reported.'

## SmPC (Section 4.9):

'Administration of Xiapex at greater than recommended dosages is expected to be associated with increased local reaction at the site of injection. Routine supportive care and symptomatic treatment must be provided in the case of overdose.'

'Like all medicines, Xiapex can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most of the side effects that occurred in the clinical studies were mild or moderate in severity and were localized to the hand treated. However if any of the side effects becomes more severe or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor.'

Physician training/educational materials will educate physicians regarding the most frequently reported local reactions and instructions will also be provided with respect to the proper documentation and reporting of adverse events occurring associated with the use of AA4500.

'Xiapex must be administered by a physician appropriately trained in the correct administration of the product and experienced in the diagnosis and management of Dupuytren's disease.'

## SmPC (Section 4.4): 'Tendon rupture or other serious injury to the injected

## extremity

Xiapex must only be injected into the Dupuytren's cord. Because Xiapex lyses collagen, care must be taken to avoid injecting into tendons, nerves, blood vessels, or other collagen-containing structures of the hand. Injection of Xiapex into collagen containing structures may result in damage to those structures, and possible permanent injury such as tendon rupture or ligament damage. When injecting a cord affecting a PIP joint of the fifth finger, the needle insertion must not be more than 2 to 3 mm in depth and not more than 4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease. Patients should be instructed to promptly contact the physician if there is trouble bending the finger after the swelling goes down (symptoms of tendon rupture).

Active surveillance: A physician safety questionnaire will be distributed and collected to determine additional information associated with postmarketing cases of tendon/ligament injury in order to enhance signal detection.

Skin Lesions

Patients with Dupuytren's contractures that adhere to the skin may be at higher risk of skin lesions as a result of the pharmacological effect of Xiapex and the finger extension procedure on the skin overlying the targeted cord.'

## SmPC (Section 4.8):

'The most frequently reported adverse reactions during the Xiapex clinical studies were local injection site reactions such as oedema peripheral (local to the injection site), contusion (including ecchymosis), injection site haemorrhage and injection site pain. Injection site reactions were very common, occurring in the vast majority of patients, were mostly mild to moderate in severity and generally subsided within 1-2 weeks post injection. Serious adverse reactions of tendon rupture (3 cases), tendonitis (1 case), other ligament injury (1 case) and complex regional pain syndrome (1 case) related to the medicinal product were reported.'

## PIL Section 2: Take special care with Xiapex

'This medicine must only be injected into the collagen cord in your hand by your doctor. Your doctor will take care to avoid injecting into tendons, nerves or blood vessels. Incorrect injection into tendons, nerves or blood vessels may result in bleeding or damage and possible permanent injury to these structures.  If your cord to be treated is attached to the skin, you are at higher risk of the skin splitting during the finger extension procedure following the injection of Xiapex.

Physician training/educational materials will be presented to physicians eligible to use AA4500. Physicians training will be available regarding the proper injection and finger extension technique, expected tissue reaction, recognition and treatment of localized reactions. Additionally, training will be provided with respect to the proper documentation and reporting of adverse events occurring associated with the use of AA4500.

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) have been associated with the potential risk of tendon injury, including tendonitis and tendon rupture, therefore physicians will be informed that patients receiving these medicinal products may be at greater risk from tendon related injury.

## SmPC (Section 4.4): Allergic reactions

'In the double blind portion of the three phase 3 placebocontrolled clinical studies, 17 % of Xiapex-treated patients had mild allergic reactions (i.e. pruritus). Although there was no severe allergic reaction observed in the Xiapex studies (e.g. those associated with respiratory impairment, hypotension, or end-organ dysfunction) physicians must be prepared to address any severe local or systemic allergic reactions including the potential for anaphylaxis that may occur following injection Whilst there is no evidence from the clinical data of an increased risk of serious allergic reactions upon re-challenge, the potential for such reactions following repeated use  cannot be excluded.'

Additional pharmacovigilance activities Risk Management Committee Study AUX-CC-860 (Long-term follow-up of subjects treated with AA4500) SmPC (Section 4.4): Immunogenicity 'As with any non-human protein product, patients may develop antibodies to the therapeutic protein. During clinical studies, blood samples from patients with Dupuytren's contracture were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to the protein components of the medicinal product (AUX-I and AUX-II). At 30 days post the first injection, 92 % of patients had circulating antibodies detected against AUX-I and 86 % of patients against AUXII. After a third or fourth injection, all subjects developed positive antibodies to both AUX-I and AUX-II. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse reactions was observed. Since the enzymes in Xiapex have some sequence homology with human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), anti-drug antibodies (ADA) could theoretically interfere with human MMPs. No safety concerns related to the inhibition of endogenous MMPs have been observed, in particular no adverse events indicating the development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases or the development of a musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS).  Whilst there is no clinical evidence from the current safety data of a musculoskeletal syndrome developing following the administration of Xiapex, the potential for it to occur cannot be excluded.  If this syndrome were to develop, it would occur progressively and is characterized by one or more of the following signs and symptoms: arthralgia, myalgia, joint stiffness, stiffness of the shoulders, hand oedema, palmar fibrosis and thickening or nodules forming in the tendons.'

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that the following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product:

The MAH, in agreement with the competent authorities in the Member States, shall implement, prior to the launch, an educational programme for physicians aiming to ensure proper injection placement to minimize occurrence of injection-related adverse events and to inform on expected and potential risks associated with the treatment.

The physician educational programme should contain the following key elements:

-  Injection technique and dosing interval.
-  Proper amount of volumes for both reconstitution and injection differences in the metocarpophalangeal (MP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints.
-  Recognition and treatment of severe immune-mediated reaction, including anaphylaxis.
-  Information on bleeding risk in patients with coagulation disorders including those on concurrent anti-coagulation therapy.
-  Information on the potential risk of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) cross reactivity including the development of musculoskeletal syndrome and exacerbation/initiation of autoimmune disorders.
-  Reminder of the need to report adverse events, including medication errors.
-  The need to inform the patient about the signs and symptoms associated with the treatment and when to seek attention from the health care provider.
-  The summary of product characteristics and the patient information leaflet.

## 2.8 Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

In  both  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  (AUX-CC-857  and  AUX-CC859),  AA4500  met  the  primary  endpoint demonstrating consistently efficacy in reducing contractures in both MP and PIP joints, in patients with moderate (about 50% of patients had moderate disease at inclusion, i.e. a modified Tubiana score of 2) and severe disease (20% of included patients, i.e. a modified Tubiana score of 3 and 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AA4500 0.58 mg was statistically superior to placebo with respect to the proportion of subjects who achieved  a  reduction  in  contracture  to  5°  or  less  of  their  primary  joint  after  the  last  injection (p&lt;0.001). Overall, 64.0% of all AA4500 treated primary joints achieved a reduction in contracture of the primary joint to 5° or less in Study AUX-CC-857 (76.7% for MP joints and 40% for PIP joints), and 44.4% in Study AUX-CC-859 (65% for MP joints and 28% for PIP joints) compared to 6.8% and 4.8% respectively for placebo. The modified Tubiana score used in the studies led likely to an underestimate of the true disease severity since DIP joints were not recorded. Therefore, a wide indication to all types of severity (low and high severity) in Dupuytren's disease is considered acceptable.

In  study  AUX-CC  859,  although  more  primary  PIP  joints  treated  with  up  to  three  injections  had  a reduction in contracture to 5° or less compared with placebo (7 joints [28.0%] versus 0 joints),  the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p=0.069). For PIP joints, efficacy was less clearly demonstrated than for MP joints, probably due to the small sample size and to the fact that most PIP joints  were  in  the  little  finger  that  is  usually  the  most  difficult  to  treat  due  to  anatomical reason.

Severely contracted MP and PIP joints responded to treatment with AA4500 to a lesser extent.

The recurrence rate of around 4% provides evidence of the durability of treatment effect within the 9 to  12-month  period  after  first  injection.  Meanwhile  2  year  data  (730  days)  are  available  and  as expected the recurrence rate has increased. The nominal rate of recurrence is 15.9 % in the presence of a palpable cord and 19.9 % with or without a palpable cord. In summary, the recurrence rate has increased following 2 years of follow up compared to 1 year, but overall the recurrence rates with or without a palpable cord in A4500 treated joints continue to be comparable to the rates observed in the literature for surgical intervention and appear favourable compared to those reported for PNF.

However, the Applicant presented an analysis to show that even the most severely affected PIP joints showed meaningful  clinical  improvement  that  is  similar  to  what  is  observed  for  surgical  corrections outlined in published literature. All  these findings were also reported in literature for surgical interventions including PNF. Therefore, Xiapex efficacy considers similar to that of surgery and PNF The European patient experience is limited to the 137 subjects who were enrolled in the open label study AUX-CC-854 but the patient demographics, disease characteristics and the efficacy and safety results are very similar to those from the overall population.  Therefore, the data from the double-blind placebo-controlled  studies  carried  out  in  the  United  States  and  Australia  are  fully  applicable  to European subjects as there are no genetic or physiological reasons why subjects in Europe would not respond in a similar manner than those in the United States and Australia. Overall, the efficacy profile as described above was comparable to the current mainstay of treatment, i.e. surgical intervention (fasciotomy, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNF)). The goal of surgery is  to  remove  and/or  release  the  fibrotic  cord  and  correct  the  contracture  allowing  extension  of  the affected  finger(s).    However,  surgical  procedures  can  be  complex,  and  may  result  in  significant perioperative and/or postoperative complications which can delay full recovery.

However, more long-term follow-up data are needed and will be provided on the ongoing extension trial AUX-CC-860 through interim clinical study reports at Years 3, 4, and 5 post-treatment.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The Applicant comprehensively discusses the difference in clinical success rates between regions (US and  Australia)  for  the  AUX-CC-857  and  AUX-CC-859  studies  and  provides  valid  reasons  for  the observed differences.  However,  there  is  a  considerable  heterogeneity  found  for  the  clinical  success rate in  the  AUX-CC-857 study conducted in 16 US centers.  Data of tests for heterogeneity of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

success  rates  in  the  different  centers  for  the  AUX-CC-857  study  were  provided.  Due  to  the  small sample size the power for possible tests of heterogeneity is limited. The approach to only include data of the patients receiving AA4500 is justified. It is agreed that the results of a  2 -test for comparison of success rates are not incompatible with homogeneity and that observed heterogeneity could be due to variability in a binomial endpoint given the small sample size.

Further exploration of a possible center effect and its cause without the use of statistical methods was expected and the links to baseline data for centers with the highest and lowest success rates were provided. Different baseline fixed flexion contracture may have had an influence on the success rates.

It is acknowledged that the success rates in each center for the AA4500 treatment group were higher than in the placebo group. Although no specific concerns on the heterogeneity of the results of study AUX-CC-857  remain,  a  carefully  planned  and  conducted  training  of  prescribing  physicians  for treatment with AA4500 seems warranted to ensure high success rates for varying baseline conditions.

The Applicant has provided a number of analyses that indicate a persistence of efficacy even in the presence of high and increasing anti-drug antibody titres  which  supports the  lack  of  a  neutralising antibody  effect.  There  is  no  correlation  between  efficacy  outcomes  and  antibody  titres.  Extrinsic factors such as the type of joint treated may explain the difference in response between the first joint treated and the subsequent ones.

Long  term  data,  particularly  data  on  the  impact  of  repeated  treatment  on  the  rate  of  recurrence, complications, and  hand  functionality/QoL  are  not  available.  In  clinical  practice,  Xiapex  may complement surgical treatment. Studies investigating the recurrence rate and rate of complications if Xiapex  and  surgical  interventions  are  utilised  sequentially,  intermittently  or  at  the  same  time  are lacking.  The  Applicant  commits  to  undertake  post-marketing  activities  to  collect  and  analyse  such data. Risks Unfavourable effects Overall  there  were  1196  subjects  who  were  enrolled  and  treated  in  the  AA4500  clinical  programme with  1082  subjects  receiving  at  least  1  dose  of  AA4500  0.58  mg  comprising  the  formal  safety database.  Based  on  the  review  of  the  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  of  the  AA4500  development programme,  the  adverse  events  of  interest  include:  local  reactions,  potential  immune-mediated events,  tendon/ligament  rupture  or  injury,  skin  lesions,  and  injection  site  bleeding.  In  the  Phase  3 Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled  population,  approximately  two  times  as  many  AA4500  treated patients  than  placebo-treated  patients  had  an  AE  (97.8%  versus  54%).The  majority  of  AEs  were nonserious,  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  confined  to  the  treated  extremity,  and  resolved  within  a short period without sequelae. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Among  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  AA4500  0.58  mg,  most  patients  experienced adverse  reactions  in  the  treated  extremity,  with  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions reported  being:  oedema  peripheral,  contusion,  injection  site  pain,  pain  in  extremity,  injection  site haemorrhage, and tenderness.

Eleven (1.0%, 11/1082) subjects who received at least 1 injection of AA4500 0.58 mg experienced a treatment-related SAE or SAE with unknown relationship to study drug.

The majority of treatment-related SAEs were related to events of the treated hand. Four of these were related to unintended effects of AA4500 on collagen (three tendon ruptures and one ligament injury [pulley  injury]).  The  cause  of  these  adverse  reactions  is  thought  to  be  the  inadvertent  exposure  or injection  of  AA4500  into  or  around  the  tendon/ligament  structure  rather  than  into  the  Dupuytren's cord.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The influence of investigator training on adverse events, especially serious adverse events like tendon ruptures  is  crucial  for  the  safe  application  of  the  drug.  Investigator  training  in  the  clinical  studies included intensive injection technique instructions via manuals and DVDs, workshops and investigator meetings and it has to be ensured that the training for the education of healthcare professionals in clinical practice is adequate. The Applicant should maintain a list of trained, enrolled physicians and the product  must  only  be  distributed  to  these  prescribers.  These  requirements  as  well  as  the  minimum contents of the training program and minimum requirements for a qualified trainer should be included in Annex II B - Conditions of the Marketing Authorisation.

Due to the immunogenic potential of AA4500 the majority of subjects developed ADAs after the first injection and all subjects had antibodies after four or more injections.  In study AUX-CC-857, 11% and 22%  of  detected  antibodies  had  neutralising  capacity  against  AUX-1  and  AUX-II,  respectively. However, no adverse reactions consistent with systemic hypersensitivity or anaphylactic response were observed in the Dupuytren's disease programme. Except for pruritus and oedema peripheral, no clear increase in the number of adverse events with subsequent injections were observed. ADA titres were not predictive of the rate, severity, or duration of any of the adverse events. Potential cross-reactivity of  neutralising antibodies (Nabs) against AUX-I or AUX-II to endogenous MMPs represents a serious potential risk for adverse effects, e.g. development of musculoskeletal syndrome.  An MMP inhibitorassociated musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS) has been described in literature after oral treatment with matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors in knee osteoarthritis which includes shoulder arthralgia, myalgia, and stiffness, as well as hand oedema, palmar fibrosis, tendons/thickening nodules (reminiscent of the early development of Dupuytren's contracture) (Krzeski et al., 2007) So far, musculoskeletal syndrome has not been observed in patients treated with Xiapex. Overall, the available data suggest that ADAs to both AUX-I and AUX-II, while present in all subjects after four or more injections, did not affect the safety profile of AA4500. For the time being this is addressed in the educational program, the labelling and the RMP. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Although in the clinical programme there was no signal identified for a combination of AE suggestive of the musculoskeletal syndrome, a potential for cross-reactivity of anti-product antibodies (anti-AUX-I and  anti-AUX-II)  with  endogenous  human  matrix  metalloproteinases  with  similar  homology  cannot finally  be  excluded. In  vitro assessment  of  cross-reactivity  has  been  performed  in  5  patients  and additional cross-reactivity experiments using a validated assay were provided. However, assay results are not considered to be reliable. Currently, the detection of cross reactivity of anti-AUX-I or anti-AUXII antibodies versus the selected MMPs is restricted to binding assays. This is not considered sufficient. The cross-reactivity should be additionally investigated in terms of inactivation of endogenous MMPs by  neutralising  ADAs.  The  applicant  committed  to  develop  and  validate  a  respective  assay  that  is based on enzymatic activity of the MMPs.

Long-term  safety  data  after  repeated  administration  are  lacking  and  potential  long-term  effects  of MMP cross-allergy need to be monitored.

Regarding the neutralising potential of ADAs versus AUX-I and AUX-II, data on the determination of the optimised concentrations of enzymes and substrate were not provided. It is acknowledged that varying  amounts  of  alpha-2-macroglobulin  in  the  sera  to  be  tested  may  disturb  the  assay.  The Applicant committed to develop a more suitable assay to assess potential neutralising activity of NAbs in terms of enzymatic and thus pharmacodynamic activity of the drug substance. For the time being this is addressed in the educational program, the labelling and the RMP.

## 3.9 Benefit-Risk Balance

Overall, the proposed indication 'treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in adult patients with a palpable cord'  is  supported  by  sufficient  efficacy  data.  Overall,  64.0%  of  all  AA4500  treated  primary  joints achieved a reduction in contracture of the primary joint to 5° or less in Study AUX-CC-857 (76.7% for MP joints and 40% for PIP joints), and 44,4% in Study AUX-CC-859 (65% for MP joints and 28% for PIP joints) compared to 6.8% and 4.8% respectively for placebo.  The success rate is similar to the current mainstay of treatment in this disease and Xiapex provides an alternative option to surgery for physicians to use in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. The majority of TEAEs were non serious, mild or moderate in intensity, confined to the treated extremity, and resolved within a short period without sequelae. Efficacy and safety data suggest that collagenase is intended to the same category of patients than PNF.

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Overall,  the  proposed  indication  'treatment  of  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  adult  patients  with  a palpable cord' is supported by sufficient efficacy data. Overall, 64,0% of all AA4500 treated primary joints  achieved  a  reduction  in  contracture  of  the  primary  joint  to  5°  or  less  in  Study  AUX-CC-857 (76,7% for MP joints and 40% for PIP joints), and 44,4% in Study AUX-CC-859 (65% for MP joints and 28% for PIP joints) compared to 6,8% and 4,8% respectively for placebo.  The success rate is similar to the current mainstay of treatment in this disease and Xiapex provides an alternative option to surgery for physicians to use in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. The majority of TEAEs were non serious, mild or moderate in intensity, confined to the treated extremity, and resolved within a short period without sequelae. Efficacy and safety data suggest that collagenase is intended to the same category of patients than PNF. Benefit-risk balance Medicinal product no longer authorised

A positive benefit risk profile has been established across a broad range of Dupuytren's contracture (MP and PIP joints of low, moderate and high severity) that supports the proposed indication of 'for the  treatment  of  patients  with  Dupuytren's  contracture  in  adult  patients  with  a  palpable  cord.'  The subjects  enrolled  across  the  clinical  programme  were  typical  to  what  has  been  described  in  the literature  and  included  a  wide  range  of  contracture  severity.  AA4500  has  been  found  to  have  an acceptable  safety  profile  in  treating  Dupuytren's  contractures.  The  majority  of  AEs  were  mild  to moderate in severity, local, confined to the treated extremity, and resolved prior to the next injection, generally  within  2  weeks.  Due  to  the  immunogenic  potential  of  AA4500  the  majority  of  subjects developed ADAs after the first injection and all subjects had antibodies after four or more injections. ADA titres were not predictive of the rate, severity, or duration of any of the adverse events and did not negatively affect efficacy.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

Based on the available data, efficacy and safety data show that collagenase is intended to the same category of patients than percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNF). The Applicant has one ongoing and three planned Phase 3b/4 clinical studies that will provide post-approval relevant data to assess long  term  recurrence  rate  and  complications  associated  with  Xiapex  treatment  relative  to  currently available  treatment  options,  i.e.  surgery  and  PNF.  Hence,  the  therapeutic  value  of  Xiapex  in comparison to PNF will be better characterised.

In  addition,  the  potential  of  cross-reactivity  of  anti-product  antibodies  (anti-AUX-I  and  anti-AUX-II) with endogenous human matrix metalloproteinases with similar homology will be further investigated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Whereas formation of ADAs is expected due to the fact that AUX-I and AUX-II are of bacterial origin, potential  cross-reactivity  of  these  antibodies  represents  a  serious  risk  for  adverse  effects,  e.g. development of musculoskeletal syndrome that should be monitored routinely by meaningful assays. As  the  full  immune  response  in  some  patients  (~15%)  does  not  occur  until  the  third  or  fourth injection, cross-reactivity should be also investigated at this stage of treatment.

Overall, investigation of immunogenicity particularly with respect to the neutralising potential of ADAs versus the drug substance and cross-reactivity to endogenous MMPs should be further investigated.

Overall,  the  CHMP  recommendations  to  investigate  further  post-approval  the  above  mentioned aspects are part of the Risk management plan and are without prejudice to the CHMP conclusion on the benefit ratio of the product based on the data currently available.

## 2.9 Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Xiapex in the treatment of Dupuytren´s contracture in adult patients with  a  palpable  cord  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing authorisation.
