## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study number: LPS17250
- Title: Open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in Chinese patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis

## Study LPS17250, Open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in Chinese patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis

## Description

Study LPS17250 (BALISTAD China) was a Phase 4, open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in adolescent (aged 12 to 17 years) and adult (aged 18 to 65 years) Chinese participants with moderate-to-severe AD with a healthy volunteer cohort as a reference comparator, and to evaluate the relationship between skin barrier function and disease activity measured by clinical assessments and patient reported outcomes in Chinese population.

## Methods

## Study design and participants

The LPS17250 study was a Phase 4, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in adolescent (aged 12 to 17 years) and adult (aged 18 to 65 years) Chinese participants with moderate-to-severe AD, with a healthy volunteer cohort as a reference comparator.

Male and female participants with moderate-to-severe AD were enrolled. Healthy volunteers matched for age, gender, location of skin area served as reference comparators for skin barrier function.

The maximum study duration per participant was 24 weeks.

The study comprised (see Fig. 1):

- Screening Period 1 (Day -28 to -1): Participants were evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
- Baseline Visit (Day 1): Eligible participants were enrolled.
- A 16-week treatment period for AD patients and a 16-week observation period for healthy volunteers.
- A 4-week safety follow-up period.

Atopic dermatitis participants were enrolled based on the following key criteria:

- Participant must be between 12 to 65 years of age (inclusive), at the time of signing the informed consent.
- Patients with AD diagnosis according to Hanifin and Rajka (6) criteria at least 1 year before screening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- IGA score of ≥3 at screening (on the 0 to 4 scale).
- Patients with AD must have active lesions on the upper limbs or lower limbs, with severity for lesion erythema or edema/papulation ≥2 at screening on the 0 -3 scale of the ISS.

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the study protocol.

Age and gender were matched to a selected AD patient between the dupilumab cohort and the healthy volunteer cohort. Adolescents ( aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years ) were matched by post puberty status.

## Treatments

Dupilumab was given to AD patients depending on their age and body weight. The study intervention included dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg in a prefilled syringe for subcutaneous administration. AD participants aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years with baseline body weight &lt;60 kg received a SC loading dose of dupilumab 400 mg (2 injections of dupilumab 200 mg) on Day 1 (Week 0), followed by Q2W SC dosing of dupilumab 200 mg from Week 2 to Week 14. AD participants with baseline body weight ≥ 60 kg received a SC loading dose of dupilumab 600 mg (2 injections of dupilumab 300 mg) on Day 1 (Week 0), followed by Q2W SC dosing of dupilumab 300 mg from Week 2 to Week 14.

No change in dosing was made when body weight increased or decreased during the study. AD patients aged 18 years and older received a SC loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1, followed by 300 mg Q2W SC through Week 14. Dupilumab was administered by study site staff at baseline, Week, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. Dupilumab was self-administered by AD patients at home at Week 10 and 14.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objective(s)

The study design comprised 2 parallel study cohorts: the AD patients cohort, which received open-label dupilumab treatment for 16 weeks, and the healthy volunteer cohort, which did not receive any treatment and served as a reference comparator group for the skin barrier assessment parameters.

The objective of this study was to assess dupilumab treatment effects on skin barrier function measured as TEWL and on skin lipidomics in conjunction with STS in Chinese AD population. TEWL is commonly used for physiologic assessments of skin barrier function. In addition to baseline TEWL to assess the undisturbed permeability of the skin barrier, TEWL measurements were combined with skin barrier perturbation using STS to measure skin barrier function and integrity (3). The STS technique uses a standardized tape for removing the epidermis layer by layer. The advantages of this technique are as follows: it is noninvasive, causes no pain in participants, and leaves no scars. With this technique it is possible to follow reactions within the same skin area over time, and to study precisely in which depth of the epidermis the different substances are located (4, 5). Through these assessments, the study will explore the interplay between skin barrier function kinetics and clinical disease severity and therapeutic response. TEWL is the loss of water that passes from inside a body through the epidermis. A higher value of TEWL means more water is passing through the skin, such as in AD patients. It is influenced by many environmental and individual factors, including age, gender, race, anatomical region, skin temperature, environmental conditions, season, smoking status, measurement technique, and many others. Therefore, it was important to include a 'normal' TEWL from an age-, gender-, targeted lesion area-, and study site-matched healthy volunteer cohort assessed at the same time under the same conditions on the same anatomical region with reference thresholds of skin barrier function evaluation indicating pathological relevance.

Key objectives, endpoints, and estimands are shown in Table 2 and Table 3.

## Sample size

Approximately 24 patients with moderate to severe AD were planned to be enrolled to study intervention to achieve 20 evaluable patients.

Approximately 20 evaluable healthy volunteers matched for age, gender, location of skin area, and study site will serve as a reference comparator for skin barrier function.

Sample size for this exploratory study in Asian population was based on medical/clinical judgement and is consistent with the sample size from similar studies in the literature (39). No formal sample size calculation was performed.

Allowing for drop-out rate of 15%, a total of approximately 24 patients with moderate to severe AD will be enrolled to achieve 20 evaluable patients: ie, patients with no major or critical deviations related to IMP and/or TEWL measurements, for whom the TEWL data for primary analysis: ie, TEWL at baseline and Week16, are considered sufficient and interpretable. An approximately equal number of age, gender, location of targeted lesion area and site matched healthy volunteers serving as a reference comparator cohort will be enrolled. Drop-out rate in healthy volunteers is expected to be zero. Any drop-out healthy volunteer for whom the matched patient is considered as evaluable will not be replaced.

## Randomisation and Blinding

The study was conducted from 25 November 2022 (first participant first visit) through 25 January 2024 (last participant last visit) and included 11 pediatric participants (aged ≥12 and &lt;18 years) in China.

## This was an open-label study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

A detailed description of participant accountability including number of participants by analysis population, participants who did not complete the study observation period along with the main reason for permanent treatment discontinuation, and participants who requested permanent treatment discontinuation was generated by cohort. Continuous variables (age, weight) and qualitative variables (gender, race, and body mass index) were summarized by cohort in descriptive statistics (summary tables).

The efficacy evaluation was based on a review of the individual values (graphics), descriptive statistics (summary tables, graphics), and where applicable, exploratory statistical analysis.

The safety evaluation was based on a review of vital signs parameters and reported AEs. All the safety analyses were performed using the safety population. When applicable, results were reported by cohort and overall.

## Results

## Recruitment

The study was conducted from 25 November 2022 (first participant first visit) through 25 January 2024 (last participant last visit) and included 11 pediatric participants (aged ≥12 and &lt;18 years) in China.

## Baseline data

A total of 44 participants (24 participants in the dupilumab cohort [AD cohort] and 20 participants in the healthy volunteer cohort) were screened and enrolled in the study. There was no screening failure and no participants were excluded from the populations analyzed. The intent-to-treat (ITT), modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and safety populations included 44 participants). Of the 44 participants enrolled, 33 participants (17 participants in the AD cohort and 16 participants in the healthy volunteer cohort) were adults and 11 participants (7 participants in the AD cohort and 4 participants in the healthy volunteer cohort) were adolescents. Detailed demographics of age, gender, ethnicity, and weight for AD patients and healthy volunteers are presented in the LPS17250 CSR [Section 4.4.1]. Demographics for the adolescent participants in the AD cohort are presented in Table 4.

## Number analysed

A detailed description of participant accountability including number of participants by analysis population, participants who did not complete the study observation period along with the main reason for permanent treatment discontinuation, and participants who requested permanent treatment discontinuation was generated by cohort.

Continuous variables (age, weight) and qualitative variables (gender, race, and body mass index) were summarized by cohort in descriptive statistics (summary tables). The efficacy evaluation was based on a review of the individual values (graphics), descriptive statistics (summary tables, graphics), and where applicable, exploratory statistical analysis. The safety evaluation was based on a review of vital signs parameters and reported AEs. All the safety analyses were performed using the safety population. When applicable, results were reported by cohort and overall.

## Efficacy results

## Primary endpoint analysis

The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline in TEWL after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin at Week 16 in AD patients.

Overall, mean TEWL values after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin at baseline and Week 16 were 63.073 ±19.1351 g/h/m² and 36.018 ±18.4224 g/h/m², respectively. The mean (SD) absolute change from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline was -25.641 (26.0180), and the corresponding mean percent change was -36.8510% (37.1486%), both representing significant decrease with 1 sided pvalue p&lt;0.0001. Results in detail are presented in the LPS17250 CSR [Section 5.1.2]. In both ITT and mITT populations, 17 patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) and 7 were adolescents (aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years). Subgroup analysis was conducted for adolescents and adults on the primary endpoint in both ITT and mITT populations. The subgroup analysis results were generally consistent with results of the primary analysis.

Compared with the baseline value, the mean TEWL value after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin in in adolescent participants at Week 16 was significantly reduced, similar to the results found in all AD patients.

## Secondary endpoint analysis

Secondary endpoint analysis was performed on the ITT population.

Subgroup analysis of the secondary endpoint was performed based on the ITT and mITT populations with same age categories as in the primary endpoint (aged &lt;18 years, and ≥18 years) . Overall, mean TEWL values before and after 10, 15, 20 STS assessed on lesional skin were 51.2028 ±14.1574 g/h/m², 73.2146 ±20.6552 g/h/m², 81.6246 ±21.7895 g/h/m² and 84.6833 ±19.9446 g/h/m² among 24 participants at baseline, and 27.5163 ±9.7373 g/h/m², 50.5209 ±23.6596 g/h/m², 62.4013 ±24.5885 g/h/m², 77.7839 ±23.0836 g/h/m² at Week 16, respectively among 23 AD participants.

A significant decrease of TEWL was observed after 10 and 15 STS but not after 20 STS. Reduction trends observed in adolescent were similar to the trends seen in all AD patients. Results in detail are presented in the LPS17250 CSR [Section 5.1.3].

## Tertiary/exploratory endpoints

The mean scores of EASI, ISS, POEM, SCORAD, DLQI (among 20 patients aged ≥16 years), and peak pruritus NRS decreased from study baseline as early as Week 1 and sustained through Week 16. Among four AD patients (aged ≥12 and &lt;16 years), the average score of CDLQI reduced from baseline over time, with similar extent of reduction at different timepoints (eg, Week 8 and Week 16). The CDLQI assessment in adolescents are presented in Appendix 16.2.6 Efficacy response data [Table 14.2.3.2.6] of the LPS17250 CSR. An increasing trend was displayed in average score of sleep quality NRS over time as early as Week 1, indicating improvements in sleep with dupilumab treatment in AD patients. Similar results were also found in changes (percent and absolute) from baseline in EASI, ISS, POEM, SCORAD, DLQI / CDLQI, peak pruritus NRS and sleep quality NRS over time. Detailed results of tertiary/exploratory endpoints including TEWL assessments, are presented in Section 5.1.4 of the LPS17250 CSR.

## ADVERSE EVENTS

## Overview of the safety population

A total of 20 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 11 participants (45.8%) in the dupilumab cohort of the safety population. No drug withdrawal happened due to TEAEs. In the dupilumab cohort, the most common TEAEs by PTs (≥ 10.0%) reported were upper respiratory tract infection and conjunctivitis (3 participants [12.5%] for both). A total of 9 AEs were reported for 6 participants (30.0%) in the healthy volunteer cohort, among which the most common AEs was upper respiratory tract infection (4 participants, [20.0%]). All reported events were of mild or moderate intensity. None of the participants in either of the cohorts experienced a severe AE. Treatment emergent adverse events of special interest (AESIs), treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths were not reported in the study. At all timepoints (baseline, Week 8 and Week 16), the mean values of vital sign parameters (including pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body temperature and respiratory rate) and the mean changes from baseline were minimal and similar between the two cohorts. There were no participants with PCSA in the safety population.

## TEAEs in the adolescent population

Four out of the 7 adolescents (57.14%) in the dupilumab cohort presented with TEAEs. TEAE reported in the 4 adolescents in the dupilumab cohort by PT were as follows:

- Upper respiratory tract infection: 2 participants (3 events),
- Conjuctivitis: 1 participant,
- Gastritis: 1 participant,
- Abdominal pain: 1 participant.

One out of 4 adolescents in the healthy volunteer cohort presented with AEs of pyrexia and upper respiratory tract infection.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

The applicant submitted efficacy and safety results from study LPS17250, a phase 4, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in Chinese adult and pediatric patients aged between 12 and 65 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Atopic dermatitis is associated with skin barrier defects, which has, amongst others, implications for the immune function of the skin. The purpose of this phase 4 study was the analysis of the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin-barrier function in adolescent and adult AD patients, i.e. on (patho)physiological features such as transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin lipidomics and proteomics, etc. using skin rape stripping (STS) to measure skin barrier function and integrity. In addition, disease activity was measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as highdefinition standard photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas.

The intent-to-treat (ITT), modified intent-totreat (mITT) and safety populations included 44 participants). Of these, 33 participants were enrolled. Overall 11 adolescents were included in the study; 7 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 4 healthy volunteers (HV) to the control group which served as reference comparator for the skin barrier assessment parameters. The participants were enrolled if they had an AD diagnosis according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria at least 1 year before screening, moderate-to-severe symptoms, and active lesions on the upper limbs or lower limbs with Individual Signs Score ≥2 at screening . The demographic characteristics were balanced between both groups. The mean age was 23.3±8.98 years in the AD group with a median disease

duration of 52.1 months (range, 30.7 to 84.3 months). Accordingly, the majority of AD patients had concomitant medications and prior medications such as antipruritics and corticosteroids, emollients and protectives. Further medications included ophthalmologicals, drugs for the treatment of obstructive airway disease, and nasal preparations indicating concomitant type 2 inflammatory diseases. To establish similar conditions for the subsequent analysis of dupilumab's treatment effect on the skin barrier, individuals were matched with AD patients for age, gender, examined skin area and study site.

The patients assigned to the dupilumab group were treated according to product label. The duration of the open-label treatment or observation period was 16 weeks, and the total study duration per participant including screening and follow-up was 24 weeks.

The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin barrier function measured by TEWL and measurement of lipids, proteins, and gene expression associated with skin barrier function from STS in the participants. In addition, this study evaluated the relationship between skin barrier function, integrity and disease activity measured by clinical assessments and patientreported outcomes. The measurement of TEWL to quantify the skin barrier functionality as well as noninvasive techniques such as STS to determine TEWL are commonly used in clinical trials. Here, 5-20 STS over a period of 16 weeks were performed in lesional and non-lesional skin areas in AD patients under dupilumab treatment and for comparison in HV. The STS time points are acceptable as the onset of dupilumab's effect was observed after 2 treatment weeks in clinical trials.

TEWL measurements were combined with skin barrier perturbation using STS to measure skin barrier function and integrity. The primary endpoint for this study was the Percent change from baseline in TEWL after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin at Week 16 in AD patients. After 5 STS on lesional skin in AD participants the TEWL was reduced by 36.85% at week 16. There was no significant difference of mean TEWL value among AD participants before 15 STS on non-lesional skin at week 16 compared with baseline, however, the mean TEWL after 20 STS at week 16 was significantly decreased from baseline. In HV, the mean TEWL values after 5 and 20 STS at week 16 were significantly increased from baseline. As to subgroup analyses, similar results were noticed in adults and adolescents.

As demonstrated before, dupilumab had a positive effect on further clinical and patient-reported outcomes EASI, ISS, POEM, SCORAD, and skin pruritus NRS. Major protocol deviations are deemed not to have impacted efficacy analyses.

The safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. Overall, no new safety findings were identified in this study. No amendments of the product information were introduced by the applicant which is supported.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The efficacy results indicate that TEWL of lesional skin was significantly reduced for the total AD ITT population over a period of 16 treatment weeks compared with the TEWL of healthy volunteers suggesting an improved skin barrier. Treatment benefits also included improvements in quality of life. Regarding the limited analysed patient number, the generated data are considered to be supportive information. The collected safety data are consistent with the known safety profile. It is concurred that no amendment of the PI is indicated.
