## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Zemcelpro ≥ 0.23×10 6  viable CD34+ cells/mL / ≥ 0.53×10 6 viable CD3+ cells/mL dispersion for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

## 2.1 General description

Zemcelpro is a cryopreserved allogeneic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell therapy containing two cell components, namely the expanded and unexpanded components, both derived from the same patient-specific umbilical cord blood unit (CBU).

The expanded component, referred to as dorocubicel which is the expanded CD34+ cells, is composed of the CD34+ fraction expanded ex-vivo in the presence of UM171.

The unexpanded component, referred to as unexpanded CD34- cells, is composed of the CD34fraction from which the CD3+ cells are the active fraction.

## 2.1 Qualitative and quantitative composition

## Dorocubicel

Each patient specific infusion bag of Zemcelpro contains a batch-dependent concentration of ex-vivo UM171 expanded CD34+ cells enriched population. The medicinal product is packaged in up to four infusion bags containing a dispersion for infusion of at least 0.23×10 6 viable CD34+ cells/mL suspended in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution.

Each infusion bag contains 20 mL dispersion for infusion.

## Unexpanded CD34- cells

Each patient-specific infusion bag contains a batch-dependent concentration of unexpanded CD34cells. The medicinal product is packaged in four infusion bags containing a dispersion for infusion of at least 0.53×10 6 viable CD3+ cells/mL suspended in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution.

Each infusion bag contains 20 mL dispersion for infusion.

## Quantitative information

The quantitative information for each cell component of the medicinal product, including the batch dependent cell concentration and the number of infusion bags to be administered, is presented in the Release for infusion certificate (RfIC) accompanying the medicinal product for treatment. There is one RfIC for both cell components (see section 6).

## Excipients with known effect

This medicinal product contains a maximum of 477 mg sodium, 50 mg potassium, and 10% v/v DMSO per dose (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Dispersion for infusion.

## Dorocubicel

Colourless to slightly yellow cell dispersion for infusion.

## Unexpanded CD34- cells

Reddish cell dispersion for infusion.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Zemcelpro is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with haematological malignancies requiring an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation following myeloablative conditioning for whom no other type of suitable donor cells is available.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Zemcelpro must be administered in a qualified transplant centre with expertise in haematopoietic stem cell transplant by a physician with experience in the treatment of haematologic malignancies.

## Posology

Treatment consists of a single dose for infusion containing a dispersion for infusion of expanded CD34+ cells in 1 to 4 infusion bags and unexpanded CD34- cells in 4 infusion bags.

The target dose is 0.4 to 7.5×10 6 viable CD34+ cells/kg for the expanded CD34+ cell component (dorocubicel) and ≥ 0.52×10 6 viable CD3+ cells/kg for the unexpanded CD34- cell component.

See the accompanying Release for infusion certificate (RfIC) for additional information pertaining to dose.

## Cord blood unit selection

Erythrodepleted cord blood unit (CBU) for expansion is to be selected by the prescriber while respecting minimal requirement for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching and cell dose (i.e. prefreeze CD34 cell count ≥ 0.5×10 5 /kg and total nucleated cell (TNC) ≥ 1.5×10 7 /kg). Matching for at least 4 of 6 HLA (HLA-A antigens, HLA-B antigens, and HLA-DRB1 alleles) is recommended, with a target 6 out of 8 HLA-match (high resolution typing). The HLA typing and nucleated cell content for each individual CBU used as starting material in the manufacture of Zemcelpro are provided in the accompanying RfIC.

## Pre-treatment myeloablative conditioning (lymphodepleting chemotherapy)

An appropriate myeloablative conditioning regimen must be administered according to institutional guidelines. Selected regimen should be of high or intermediate intensity, i.e., with a transplant conditioning intensity (TCI) score of 2.5 and above. The conditioning regimen must not be initiated before ensuring that the availability of the patient-specific Zemcelpro is confirmed at the transplant centre.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incorporation of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is not recommended as part of the conditioning regimen (see section 4.5).

## Prophylactic and supportive therapy for prevention of transplant complications

Prophylactic and supportive therapies for prevention of transplant complications (e.g., Graft-versusHost Disease (GvHD), infection) must be administered according to institutional guidelines. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil combination is the preferred GvHD prophylaxis.

In the immediate post-transplant period, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) is recommended to minimize the risk of neutropenia and infection (see section 4.4).

## Pre-medication

It is recommended that pre-medication with antipyretics, histamine antagonists, and antiemetics, according to local institutional guidelines, be administered 30-60 minutes before the infusion of both fractions of Zemcelpro to reduce the possibility of an infusion reaction. Moreover, pre-medication with corticosteroids is also recommended prior to administering the unexpanded CD34- component of Zemcelpro to reduce the possibility of an infusion reaction in case of major HLA histocompatibility.

## Special populations

## Elderly

The safety and efficacy of Zemcelpro in the elderly population (aged ≥65 years or older) have not been established.

## Renal impairment

Zemcelpro has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Patients should be assessed for renal impairment to determine transplant eligibility.

## Hepatic impairment

Zemcelpro has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients should be assessed for hepatic impairment to determine transplant eligibility.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Zemcelpro in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1.

## Method of administration

Prescribed number of bags of dorocubicel (1 to 4 bags) and of unexpanded CD34- cells (always 4 bags) must be infused to complete a single dose of Zemcelpro. The total number of infusion bags to be administered must be confirmed with the patient specific information on the RfIC.

Dorocubicel is infused first, followed by the unexpanded CD34- cells. It is recommended that the unexpanded CD34- cells be infused the same day as dorocubicel, but no later than the following day.

If dorocubicel is not administered, the unexpanded CD34- cells must not be infused to avoid any untoward immune reaction.

In case of infusion reaction, pausing infusion and instituting supportive care is recommended, as needed (see section 4.4).

Do not dilute, wash or sample Zemcelpro prior to infusion.

Intravenous use only. Central venous access is recommended for the infusion of Zemcelpro.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Prepare infusion material. A latex-free tubing with a standard infusion filter (170-260 µm) must be used. Do NOT use a leukocyte depleting filter.
- Confirm i) the patient's identity with the patient identifiers on the bag and ii) the cell component identity (dorocubicel or unexpanded CD34- cells).
- Remove the overwrap and inspect the content of the thawed infusion bag for any visible cell aggregates. If visible cell aggregates are present, gently mix the contents of the bag, small aggregates of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Remaining aggregates are effectively removed through filtration before infusion.
- The thawed and inspected bag must be infused promptly at approximately 10 to 20 mL per minute by gravity flow. Zemcelpro is stable between 15°C-30°C for up to 1 hour after end of thawing.
- -Prime the tubing prior to infusion with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.
- -Infuse all contents of the infusion bag (20 mL per bag).
- -Rinse twice the infusion bag with 10 mL to 30 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure the totality of cells are infused into the patient.
- The procedure for infusion must be repeated for the other bags. Wait to thaw and infuse the next bag until it is determined that the previous bag is safely administered.

Do not infuse Zemcelpro if the infusion bag is damaged or leaking or otherwise appears to be compromised.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Contraindications of the myeloablative chemotherapy must be considered.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

The traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. To ensure traceability, the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient must be kept for a period of 30 years after expiry date of the medicinal product.

## Transmission of an infectious agent

A risk of transmission of infectious agents exists.  Virus testing performed on cord blood units are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and HIV 2, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) I and HTLV II, syphilis and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Specific viruses from the mother may be documented as part of the medical history, such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), toxoplasma, hepatitis E (HEV) and malaria. Cord banks also document if the infant is free of any finding suggestive of disease potentially transmissible through administration of a cord blood unit.

Test results may be found on the accompanying product documentation.

Healthcare professionals administering Zemcelpro must, therefore, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections after treatment and treat appropriately, if needed.

## Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation

Patients treated with Zemcelpro must not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to ingredients contained in Zemcelpro, e.g., DMSO. Reactions should be treated appropriately in accordance with institutional guidelines.

## Infections

Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections occurred in patients after Zemcelpro infusion (see section 4.8). Median onset was 109 days post-transplant, with some late events (ranging 0-945). Patients should be informed of the importance of a prompt notification of signs of infection to their treating physician. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, using appropriate diagnostic tests, and treated appropriately in accordance with institutional guidelines. As appropriate, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered, and surveillance testing should be employed prior to and after treatment with Zemcelpro (see section 4.2).

## Graft-vs-Host disease

Fatal and life-threatening events of acute and chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease (GvHD) have occurred following treatment with Zemcelpro (see section 4.8). GvHD following treatment with Zemcelpro do not differ from standard allogeneic stem cell transplant, with a median onset at 40 days posttransplant, and 93% of them resolving in a median of 18 days. It is recommended that patients be monitored for evidence of GvHD and appropriately treated in accordance with institutional guidelines. Prophylactic and supportive care should be considered following treatment with Zemcelpro. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil combination is the preferred GvHD prophylaxis (see section 4.2).

## Engraftment syndrome

Life threatening cases of engraftment syndrome have been reported during clinical trials with Zemcelpro (see section 4.8), occurring at a median time of 13 days post-transplant. Occurrence of unexplained fever, rash, hypoxemia, weight gain, and pulmonary infiltrates in the peri-engraftment period should be monitored. Patients should be treated in accordance with institutional guidelines with corticosteroids as soon as engraftment syndrome is recognized to ameliorate symptoms. If untreated, engraftment syndrome may progress to multiorgan failure and death.

## Graft failure

Life threatening cases of graft failure, defined as failure to achieve an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500 per microliter blood by Day 42 after transplantation, have been reported during clinical trials with Zemcelpro (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for laboratory evidence of hematopoietic recovery.

Because it could interfere with engraftment of cord blood cells, the use of ATG is not recommended as part of the conditioning regimen and prior to engraftment. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) should be administered to minimize the risk of neutropenia and infection, 5 µg/kg/day starting 13 days post-transplant until neutrophil count reaches 1 000 per microliter blood (see section 4.2).

## Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage (PAH)

PAH is a well-documented adverse reaction in patients undergoing treatment with Zemcelpro. Cases of PAH were reported, occurring at a median time of 22 days post-transplant, including fatal events (see section 4.8). It is characterized by the development of dyspnea, fever, sometimes haemoptysis, multifocal infiltrates on chest X-ray, and rapid progression to respiratory failure. It is recommended that patients be monitored for evidence of PAH and appropriately treated in accordance with institutional guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pneumonitis

Pneumonitis, such as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), is a well-documented event after treatment with Zemcelpro. Cases of pneumonitis were reported in the clinical trials of Zemcelpro including fatal events (see section 4.8). Both IPS and COP usually manifest with shortness of breath, cough, and sometimes fever. While IPS usually occur on average on day +22 after transplant, partly related to pre-transplant conditioning regimen, COP usually occur 3-6 months after transplant. It is recommended that patients be monitored for evidence of pneumonitis and appropriately treated in accordance with institutional guidelines.

## Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is an adverse reaction observed in patients after treatment with Zemcelpro. Cases of PTLD have been reported among patients who were transplanted with Zemcelpro in the clinical trials (see section 4.8). PTLD is one of the most common posttransplant malignancies, in most cases associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B cells, either as a consequence of reactivation of the virus post-transplant or from primary EBV infection. Serial monitoring of blood for EBV DNA may be warranted in patients with persistent cytopenias. PTLD must be appropriately treated in accordance with institutional guidelines.

## Infusion-related reactions (IRR)

Infusion-related reactions may occur following infusion with Zemcelpro. These reactions predominantly occur during the initial infusion(s) and can be characterised by flushing, rash, fever, rigors, chills, dyspnoea, mild, and/or severe hypotension with(out) bronchospasms, cardiac dysfunction, and/or anaphylaxis.

Premedication with antipyretics, histamine antagonists, anti-emetics, and corticosteroids may reduce the incidence and intensity of infusion reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during and after Zemcelpro administration. When an IRR occurs, pause the infusion and institute supportive care as needed (see section 4.2). Resuming the infusion must follow institutional guideline recommendations.

## Hypogammaglobulinaemia

Hypogammaglobulineamia is a well-documented event that has been reported following treatment with Zemcelpro and that could be associated with decreased survival. It has been reported in 19% of the patients transplanted with Zemcelpro (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients be monitored for laboratory evidence of hypogammaglobulinaemia and treated appropriately in accordance with institutional guidelines.

## Veno-occlusive disease

Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a well-documented event sometimes reported following HSCT. Rare cases of VOD were reported in the clinical trials of Zemcelpro (see section 4.8, Table 1), including one fatal event. Whereas not different from a usual HSCT, it is recommended that patients be monitored for evidence of VOD and treated appropriately in accordance with institutional guidelines.

## Haemolytic uremic syndrome

Haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a well-documented event sometimes reported following HSCT. Rare cases of HUS were reported in the clinical trials of Zemcelpro (see section 4.8, Table 1). Whereas not different from a usual HSCT, it is recommended that patients be monitored for evidence of HUS and treated appropriately in accordance with institutional guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excipients

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains 477 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 24% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult.

## Potassium

This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1.3 mmol (50 mg) per dose.

## Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)

This medicinal product contains 17.6 g DMSO per dose. For an adult of 70 kg, the DMSO infused represents 25% of daily maximal recommended dose of 1 g of DMSO/kg. This excipient is known to possibly cause anaphylactic reaction following parenteral administration.

All patients should be observed closely during the infusion period.

## Theoretical risks associated with the donor

Whereas not supported by the clinical experience, clonal haematopoiesis and risks associated with the donor (e.g. malignancies or hereditary genetic disorders) could occur after treatment with Zemcelpro. Patients should be appropriately monitored in accordance with institutional guidelines.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

## Live vaccines

The safety of immunisation with live vaccines during or following treatment with Zemcelpro has not been studied. Vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of conditioning regimen, and until immune recovery following treatment with Zemcelpro.

## Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)

Use of ATG is not recommended as part of the conditioning regimen and prior to engraftment.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

For risks related to myeloablative conditioning therapy needed before the use of Zemcelpro and the concurrent advice, the product information of the myeloablative conditioning therapy should be consulted.

## Women of childbearing potential

Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 30 days before treatment with Zemcelpro and must be willing to use an effective contraceptive method.

## Contraception in males and females

There is insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of contraception following treatment with Zemcelpro. Effective methods of contraception should be used in males and females of reproductive potential who have received Zemcelpro.

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of dorocubicel in pregnant women. No animal studies have been conducted with dorocubicel to assess whether it can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). Zemcelpro should not be used during pregnancy or by women of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether dorocubicel is excreted in human milk. Use of Zemcelpro is not recommended during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

There is no human or animal data on the effect of dorocubicel on fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

It is unknown whether Zemcelpro has an influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As conditioning, prophylactic, and supportive therapy administered in conjunction with Zemcelpro may result in fatigue and alter mental ability, patients are advised to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during this initial period.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently occurring adverse reactions of Grade 3 of higher were lymphopenia (46.6%), infections (44.8%), anaemia (44.0%), neutropenia (35.3%), thrombocytopenie (31.9%), leukopenia (20.3%), hypogammaglobulinaemia (18.1%), febrile neutropenia (15.5%), hypertension (12.9%), engraftment syndrome (11.2%), and pneumonia (11.2%). According to NIH criteria, acute GvHD was reported in 60.0% of patients, and chronic GvHD was reported in 16.0% of patients.

*** infections and infestations presented reflect high-level group terms.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infections

Severe infections including life-threatening and fatal infections occurred after Zemcelpro infusion. The overall incidence of CTCAE Gr ade ≥3 post -transplant infections was 75.0% (62.1% severe, 6.0% life-threatening and 6.9% fatal). They were from bacterial (52.6% with sepsis and pneumonia being the most frequent), viral (45.7% with Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, coronavirus and adenovirus being the most frequent), fungal (9.5%) or unspecified (8.6%) origins. Their onset is widely spread out with a median of 109 days post-transplant. Most of them resolved with a median duration of 13 days. Fatal infections include sepsis, septic shock and pneumonia. See section 4.4 for management recommendations.

## Engraftment syndrome

Engraftment syndrome was reported in 11.2% (13/116) of patients transplanted with Zemcelpro, with an incidence of 8.6% without severe cases among those treated with tacrolimus/MMF as GvHD prophylaxis. The median onset was 13 days post-transplant (range: 8-25). All cases recovered with corticosteroid therapy with a median duration of 5 days (range: 1-18. See section 4.4 for management recommendations,

## Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage

Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage was reported in 3 (2.6%) patients transplanted with Zemcelpro with a median onset of 22 days post-transplant (range: 20-355). Whereas one patient recovered at 9 days, 2 patients died despite appropriate therapy. See section 4.4 for management recommendations.

## Pneumonitis

Pneumonitis was reported in 8 (6.9%) patients transplanted with Zemcelpro with a median onset of 157 days post-transplant (range: 7-283). Cases included 3 idiopathic pneumonia syndromes (IPS) (2.6%), 4 cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (3.4%) (COP) and 1 unspecified pneumonitis (0.9%). Recovery was achieved in 66.7% of cases, with a median duration of 29 days (range: 9-201). Two patients (1.7%) (one with IPS and one with COP) succumbed to the condition. See section 4.4 for management recommendations.

## Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease was reported in 3 (2.6%) patients transplanted with Zemcelpro with a median onset of 90 days post-transplant (range: 70-112). All recovered with rituximab therapy with a median duration of 39 days (range: 33-157). See section 4.4 for management recommendations.

Overall, the incidence of acute and chronic GvHD were 66.4% and 14.7%, respectively. At 100 days post-transplant, grade II, III and IV acute GvHD was reported in 52.0%, 11.8% and 1.0%, respectively. Similarly, mild and moderate-severe cases of chronic GvHD was reported at 1-year posttransplant in 12.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Most of the case could be controlled with a corticosteroidbased therapy with a median duration of 18 (0-321) days, but 2 (1.7%) patients died of GvHDassociated infections. GvHD management should follow local institution guidelines (See section 4.4 for management recommendations).

## Graft failure

Graft failure was reported in 5.2% of patients transplanted with Zemcelpro with a median onset of 26.5 days post-transplant (range: 7-28). Rescue therapy could be implemented with a median duration of 23 days (range: 7-32) in all but one patient who died from a non-related non-relapse mortality event prior to been rescued.

## Prolonged cytopenias

Prolonged cytopenias, including neutropenia (64.7%), thrombocytopenia (63.8%), leukopenia (62.9%), lymphopenia (61.2%), and anaemia (56.9%) are very common following a myeloablative conditioning regimen. See section 4.4 for management recommendations.

## Paediatric population

Although data is limited, safety profile is similar to that in adults (Adverse Drug Reactions with a frequency ≥ 20%: anaemia, decreased appetite, febrile neutropenia, nausea, stomatitis, and epistaxis). Median follow-up time of 7 months does not allow further interpretations of the clinical outcomes.

## Reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Risk of overdose is limited. There were no cases of overdose during clinical trials.

All 4 bags of the unexpanded CD34- cells component resulting from the manufacturing of Zemcelpro will always be infused. In very rare circumstances only, the release for infusion certificate (RfIC) will dictate not to administer all 4 bags of the expanded CD34+ cells component (dorocubicel) resulting from the manufacturing of Zemcelpro. Should this not be strictly followed, the resulting overdose of dorocubicel could be associated with an increased risk of infusion reactions and engraftment syndrome. Patients will need to be monitored for the occurrence of such events.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Blood substitutes and perfusion solutions, other blood products. ATC code: B05AX04

## Mechanism of action

Dorocubicel is a cryopreserved UM171 ((1R, 4R)-N1-(2-benzyl-7-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-9Hpyrimido[4,5-b]indol-4-yl)cyclohexane-1,4-diamine dihydrobromide) expanded allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell therapy derived from a single cord blood unit and used as an allogeneic stem cell donor source.

The primary mechanism of action of dorocubicel lies in promoting hematopoietic recovery and immune reconstitution through the activity of expanded CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells.

The unexpanded CD34- cells, consisting primarily of CD3+ T cells, play a complementary role by supporting immune reconstitution and providing graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects posttransplantation.

Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from Zemcelpro migrate to the bone marrow where they divide, mature, and differentiate in all haematological cell lineages. The mature cells are released into the bloodstream, where some circulate and others migrate to tissue sites, partially or fully restoring blood counts and function, including immune function, of blood-borne cells of marrow origin.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Transplantation of Zemcelpro resulted in haematological reconstitution, with full donor chimerism in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

all hematopoietic stem cell lineages. T cell reconstitution was also prompt, with T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity at 6- and 12-months post-transplant.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The safety and efficacy of Zemcelpro treatment in patients with haematological malignancies requiring a haematopoietic stem cell transplant has been evaluated in two open label, uncontrolled, single-arm studies without comparison to other types of donor cells; in patients with high-risk leukaemia and myelodysplasia (ECT-001-CB.002 (002), n=30 and ECT-001-CB.004 (004), n= 30).

The safety of Zemcelpro was also evaluated in 3 additional open label, uncontrolled, single-arm studies without comparison to other types of donor cells; (one (1) study in patients with blood cancers lacking standard HLA matched familial or unrelated donors (ECT-001-CB.001 (001); one (1) study in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma (ECT-001-CB.003 (003); n=18); one (1) study in paediatric patients with high risk myeloid malignancies (ECT-001-CB.007 (007); n=12). See section 4.8.

To assess efficacy of Zemcelpro in a representative population of adult patients with haematological malignancies requiring an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation who lack a readily available suitable donor, pooled data from studies 002, and 004 were analysed, focusing on a pivotal population of 25 patients enrolled to receive cryopreserved Zemcelpro manufactured from a small CBU, following high or intermediate myeloablative conditioning regimen. See Table 2 for patients' characteristics. Small CB is defined as below the Be The Match &amp; National Marrow Donor Program/ American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (NMDP/ASTCT)'s minimal cell dose criteria for single CB transplant, i.e., TNC and CD34 cell content prior to cryopreservation of less than 2.5×10 7 TNC/kg and 1.5×10 5 CD34 cells/kg, respectively.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Zemcelpro in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in HSCTs in patients with haematological malignancies (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

At time of approval in adults, paediatric data is limited to 9/12 subjects less than 18 years old transplanted with Zemcelpro for high-risk myeloid malignancies in 007 study (6 with AML, 3 with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MDS). Zemcelpro resulted in 88.9% and 77.8% neutrophil and platelet engraftment, respectively at a median time of 21.5 and 48 days, respectively.

This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.

The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In clinical studies, Zemcelpro resulted in a full donor chimerism (defined as ≥ 95% cells of donor's origin) in myeloid cells in all patients, as early as 0.5 months post-transplant. Only patients in the process of disease recurrence subsequently showed donor chimerism &lt; 95% at later time points. In accordance with the longer time required for T cell reconstitution post-transplant, full donor chimerism in the T cell subset was achieved slightly later:  63% and 88% of patients achieved full donor chimerism in the T cell population at 0.5- and 1-month post-transplant.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Engraftment of the UM171 expanded CD34+ cells after primary or secondary transplantation and haematological reconstitution for up to 28 weeks in immunocompromised NSG mice transplanted with up to 5 000 000 cells (equivalent to up to 2.5×10 8 cells/kg in human thus exceeding the human dose) did not result in adverse toxicity.

No repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted.

No carcinogenicity studies were conducted.

In vitro cytogenetic analysis of the expanded CD34+ cells did not reveal any abnormal chromosomal changes in the expanded cells.

Given the nature of the product, non-clinical studies on fertility, reproduction and development were not conducted.

## 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS

## 6.1 List of excipients

Dimethyl sulfoxide Human albumin solution Magnesium chloride (E511) Potassium chloride (E508) Sodium acetate (E262) Sodium chloride Sodium gluconate (E576)

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

In the absence of compatibility studies, Zemcelpro should not be mixed with other medicinal products.

## 6.3 Shelf life

Cryopreserved: 1 year.

Once thawed: 1 hour at 15 °C - 30 °C. Do not refreeze thawed medicinal product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Zemcelpro must be stored and transported in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen (≤ 150 °C) and must remain frozen until the patient is ready for treatment to ensure viable cells are available for patient administration.

For storage conditions after thawing of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container and special equipment for use, administration or implantation

Zemcelpro is packaged in an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) infusion bag (50 mL) two ports containing 20 mL cell dispersion.

Each infusion bag is placed into an overwrap. This secondary packaging layer made of EVO copolymer is sealed twice. Each infusion bag in sealed overwrap is placed into a metallic cassette. The cassettes are subsequently placed in a labelled modpak within a standard, controlled cryoshipper.

One individual treatment dose comprises up to eight (8) infusion bags of 20 mL each, up to four (4) bags of dorocubicel, and four (4) bags of unexpanded CD34- cells.

Also provided with Zemcelpro is a cryovial containing the sample of the original cord blood unit for chimerism monitoring.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

Zemcelpro must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers.

Zemcelpro must be transported in a container maintaining the product below -150 o C and should be handled with appropriate protective gowning and gloves.

This medicinal product contains human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Zemcelpro must take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves, protective clothing and eye protection) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases.

## Preparation prior to administration

Zemcelpro is composed of two (2) allogeneic hematopoietic cell components:

- Dorocubicel (expanded CD34+ cells)
- Unexpanded CD34- cells

Confirmation of the number of dorocubicel bags (1 to 4 bags) and the number of bags for unexpanded CD34- cells (always 4 bags) to be infused must be done based on release for infusion certificate (RfIC) prescription. The RfIC includes both components.

Dorocubicel is infused first, followed by the unexpanded CD34- cells. It is recommended that the unexpanded CD34- cells be infused the same day as dorocubicel, but no later than the following day.

Coordinate the timing of Zemcelpro thaw and infusion in the following manner: confirm the readiness of the patient to be infused in advance and adjust the start time of Zemcelpro thaw such that it will be available for infusion when the patient is ready.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Thawing

Prior to Zemcelpro thawing, confirm patient's identity and numbers of bags to infused according to the infusion certificate (RfIC). Thaw all prescribed bags of dorocubicel before bags from unexpanded CD34- cells. Thaw one (1) bag at a time. Wait to thaw the next bag until it is determined that the previous bag is safely administered.

Figure 1. Zemcelpro Storage Cassette

<!-- image -->

- Retrieve the storage cassette from the cryoshipper. Confirm i) the patient's identity with the patient identifiers on the cassette and ii) the cell component identity (dorocubicel or unexpanded CD34- cells) (Figure 1).
- After cassette verification, immediately remove the infusion bag from the cassette. Confirm i) the patient's identity with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag and ii) the cell component identity (dorocubicel or unexpanded CD34- cells) (Figure 2).
- Inspect the infusion bag(s) for any breaks or cracks prior to thawing. If a bag is compromised, do not infuse the contents.
- Place immediately the infusion bag contained in its sealed overwrap in a 37 °C water bath. When semi-liquid consistency is reached, start to gently knead the bag until no crystal ice remains. The complete thawing duration takes approximately 2-5 minutes per bag.
- Remove bag with overwrap from the water bath. Once the infusion bag has been thawed, it should be infused as promptly as possible. Zemcelpro has been shown to be stable between 15 °C - 30 °C for up to 1 hour. Do not dilute, wash, or sample Zemcelpro prior to infusion.
- Unless prepared at the patient's bedside, transport the product to the bedside at room temperature in a closed box/bag to protect the product during transport.

Do not infuse Zemcelpro if the infusion bag is damaged or leaking or otherwise appears to be compromised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Administration

Prescribed number of bags of dorocubicel (1 to 4 bags) and of unexpanded CD34- cells (always 4 bags) must be infused to complete a single dose of Zemcelpro. The total number of infusion bags to be administered must be confirmed with the patient specific information on the RfIC.

Dorocubicel is infused first, followed by the unexpanded CD34- cells. It is recommended that the unexpanded CD34- cells be infused the same day as dorocubicel, but no later than the following day.

If dorocubicel is not administered, the unexpanded CD34- cells must not be infused to avoid any untoward immune reaction.

In case of infusion reaction, pausing infusion and instituting supportive care is recommended, as needed (see section 4.4).

Do not dilute, wash or sample Zemcelpro prior to infusion.

Intravenous use only. Central venous access is recommended for the infusion of Zemcelpro.

Figure 2. Zemcelpro Infusion Bag

<!-- image -->

- Prepare infusion material. A latex-free tubing with a standard infusion filter (170-260 µm) must be used. Do NOT use a leukocyte depleting filter.
- Confirm i) the patient's identity with the patient identifiers on the bag and ii) the cell component identity (dorocubicel or unexpanded CD34- cells) (Figure 2).
- Remove the overwrap and inspect the content of the thawed infusion bag for any visible cell aggregates. If visible cell aggregates are present, gently mix the contents of the bag, small aggregates of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Remaining

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aggregates are effectively removed through filtration before infusion.

- The thawed and inspected bag must be infused promptly at approximately 10 to 20 mL per minute by gravity flow. Zemcelpro is stable between 15 °C - 30 °C for up to 1 hour after end of thawing.
- -Prime the tubing prior to infusion with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.
- -Infuse all contents of the infusion bag (20 mL per bag).
- -Rinse twice the infusion bag with 10 mL to 30 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure the totality of cells are infused into the patient.
- The procedure for infusion must be repeated for the other bags. Wait to infuse the next bag until it is determined that the previous bag is safely administered.

Do not infuse Zemcelpro if the infusion bag is damaged or leaking or otherwise appears to be compromised.

## Measures to take in case of accidental exposure

Follow local guidelines on handling of human-derived material in case of accidental exposure. Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with Zemcelpro must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.

dorocubicel/ unexpanded CD34- cells

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Zemcelpro is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given Zemcelpro
3. How Zemcelpro is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Zemcelpro
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Zemcelpro is and what it is used for

Zemcelpro is a blood-based cell therapy. This medicine is specifically made for you from human blood stem cells (cells in your blood that can grow into any other type of blood cell) that are taken from donated umbilical cord blood. The medicine contains both the active substance dorocubicel together with unchanged donor cells (called CD34- cells).

Zemcelpro is used to treat adults with blood cancers who need a blood stem cell transplant after chemotherapy, and who don't have an available suitable donor.

## How does Zemcelpro work

The blood stem cells in this medicine are changed and multiplied in the laboratory. This ensures they will work optimally to treat you. Before you are given this medicine, you will be given chemotherapy to destroy the cancer cells in your blood. When you are then given Zemcelpro, the new stem cells in this medicine will replace your own stem cells. This will help your immune system (your body's natural defences) protect you against or fight blood cancer.

If you have any questions about how Zemcelpro works or why Zemcelpro has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Zemcelpro

## You must not be given Zemcelpro

- If you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- If you cannot tolerate an appropriate chemotherapy treatment prior to receiving Zemcelpro.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Zemcelpro is specifically made for you from donor blood cells and should only be given to you.

## Before you are given Zemcelpro, tell your doctor if

- you notice the symptoms of your cancer are getting worse (such as fever, feeling weak, bleeding gums or bruising);
- have signs of infections (such as fever, cough, chills, sore throat).

Your doctor will check your lungs, heart and blood pressure, your blood for your general health status, and if your leukaemia (blood cancer) is getting worse.

## During or after you have been given Zemcelpro

## Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following:

- Chest tightness, cough, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, fast heartbeat, swelling, rash, itching, trouble breathing, while or after using this medicine. These may be symptoms of a serious allergic or infusion-related reactions that may warrant pausing or stopping the therapy (see section 3 - How Zemcelpro is given.
- Fever, which may be a symptom of an infection.  Take your temperature twice a day for 3-4 weeks after treatment with Zemcelpro. If your temperature is high, see your doctor immediately as some infections may be life-threatening.
- Diarrhoea, fever, rash, unexplained weight gain, or yellow eyes (jaundice). These may be symptoms of serious conditions called graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) or engraftment syndrome. They may be life threatening and additional treatment may be required.
- General feeling of illness, swollen glands, weight loss, or yellow skin and eyes. These may be signs of a secondary cancer, such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Your doctor may administer additional tests.
- Shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, blood in the sputum may be signs of a pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage (PAH). PAH may be life-threatening that require additional treatment.
- Shortness of breath, cough, and fever may be signs of a pneumonitis (inflammation of your lungs). Pneumonitis, including Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Syndrome (IPS) may be life-threatening, and additional treatment may be required.
- Recurrent infections may be signs of a hypogammaglobulinaemia that may require additional treatment.
- Jaundice, liver tenderness (under the right ribs), fluid in the abdomen and sudden weight gain may be sign of veno-occlusive disease that may require specific treatment.
- Vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, stomach pain, fever, chills and headache may be sign of haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
- Serious or frequent bleedings or infections may be sign of graft failure, a life-threatening condition that requires specific attention.

Zemcelpro is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses (such as HIV, hepatitis B or C) or may be related with theoretical risks associated with the donor (e.g. malignancies or genetic diseases) to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.

Your doctor will regularly monitor your blood counts after you receive Zemcelpro as you may experience a reduction in the number of blood cells and other blood components.

Speak to your doctor before considering donating blood, organs, tissues or cells.

## Children and adolescents

Zemcelpro is not recommended to be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because there is limited experience in this age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Zemcelpro

Before you are given Zemcelpro tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including live vaccines and medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because other medicines can affect the way Zemcelpro works.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Zemcelpro is not recommended during pregnancy and during breast-feeding.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine.

The effects of Zemcelpro during pregnancy are not known. This medicine may harm your unborn baby or your newborn/infant.

- If you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with this medicine, talk your doctor immediately.
- If you are a woman who is able to have a baby, you will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Zemcelpro should only be given if the result shows you are not pregnant.

It is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. This medicine may harm your nursing infant.

## Contraception

Effective methods of contraception should be used in males and females of reproductive potential who have received Zemcelpro. Talk to your doctor about them.

## Driving and using machines

It is unknown whether Zemcelpro has an influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Medicines used in conjunction with Zemcelpro could cause fatigue or decrease alertness. Refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during this initial period.

## Zemcelpro contains sodium, potassium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)

This medicine contains 477 mg sodium per dose. This is equivalent to 24% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. You should be observed closely during the infusion period.

This medicine contains potassium, less than 1.3 mmol (50 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassiumfree'.

This medicine also contains DMSO which may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions.

## 3. How Zemcelpro is given

Zemcelpro is given to you by a doctor in a qualified transplant centre.

Zemcelpro is a one-time treatment. Before you are given Zemcelpro, your doctor will give you a type of treatment called conditioning regimen to prepare your body for the stem cell transplant.

During the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Zemcelpro you may be given other medicines. This is to help prevent infusion reactions and fever (see section 2 - What you need to know before you are given Zemcelpro). These other medicines may include antipyretics (against fever), histamine antagonists (anti-allergy), and antiemetics (against nausea and vomiting). This may also include corticosteroids to reduce the possibility of an infusion reaction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## How you are given Zemcelpro

- Your doctor will check that the individual patient identifiers on the Zemcelpro infusion bags match your details.
- Your doctor will give you this medicine as an infusion (drip) through a tube into your vein.
- You will receive 1 to 4 bags containing the active substance (dorocubicel, composed of cells grown and multiplied in the laboratory. This is the expanded component) followed by 4 bags of the unchanged donor cells (this is the unexpanded component). The time for infusion will vary, but usually each bag will be infused in less than 15 minutes.
- During the infusion your doctor will check if you have difficulty breathing or dizziness (possible symptoms of an allergic reaction) (see section 2 - What you need to know before you are given Zemcelpro). In certain cases, the infusion with Zemcelpro may be paused.

## After Zemcelpro is given

As part of the transplant procedure, you will be given medicine to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a complication that occurs when the cord blood stem cells recognise the patient's body as foreign and attack it. The medicine may initially be given through a central venous catheter (a thin tube into a large vein, also known as a central line), and then changed to a pill form when you can take medication orally.

You will also be given medicine to help your blood cells recover as quickly as possible and signals the bone marrow to make white blood cells, which are needed to fight and prevent infections. This medicine will be given to you through your central line or as an injection under the skin the day after you receive Zemcelpro. You will continue to receive it daily until the levels of your white blood cells recover.

## Before and after you are given Zemcelpro

Your doctor will recommend that you stay at the hospital as an in-patient during the week before the infusion, so you can receive the conditioning regimen, and for 3-4 weeks after you have been given Zemcelpro. After your hospital stay, your doctor will ask you to come on a regular basis for follow-up visits. This is so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and help you if you have any side effects.

If you miss an appointment, call your doctor or the hospital as soon as possible to reschedule.

## 4. Possible side effects

## This leaflet was last revised in

This medicine has been given 'conditional approval'. This means that there is more evidence to come about this medicine. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicine at least every year and this leaflet will be updated as necessary.

## Other sources of information

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: https://www.ema.europa.eu

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

Zemcelpro must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers.

Zemcelpro must be transported in a container maintaining the product below -150 °C and should be handled with appropriate protective gowning and gloves.

This medicinal product contains human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Zemcelpro must take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves, protective clothing and eye protection) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases.

## Preparation prior to administration

Zemcelpro is composed of two (2) allogeneic hematopoietic cell components:

- Dorocubicel (expanded CD34+ cells)
- Unexpanded CD34- cells

Confirmation of the number of dorocubicel bags (1 to 4 bags) and the number of bags for unexpanded CD34- cells (always 4 bags) to be infused must be done based on release for infusion certificate (RfIC) prescription. The RfIC includes both components.

Dorocubicel is infused first, followed by the unexpanded CD34- cells. It is recommended that the unexpanded CD34- cells be infused the same day as dorocubicel, but no later than the following day.

Coordinate the timing of Zemcelpro thaw and infusion in the following manner: confirm the readiness of the patient to be infused in advance and adjust the start time of Zemcelpro thaw such that it will be available for infusion when the patient is ready.

## Thawing

Prior to Zemcelpro thawing, confirm patient's identity and numbers of bags to infused according to the infusion certificate (RfIC). Thaw all prescribed bags of dorocubicel before bags from unexpanded CD34- cells. Thaw one (1) bag at a time. Wait to thaw the next bag until it is determined that the previous bag is safely administered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1. Zemcelpro Storage Cassette

<!-- image -->

- Retrieve the storage cassette from the cryoshipper. Confirm i) the patient's identity with the patient identifiers on the cassette and ii) the cell component identity (dorocubicel or unexpanded CD34- cells) (Figure 1).
- After cassette verification, immediately remove the infusion bag from the cassette. Confirm i) the patient's identity with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag and ii) the cell component identity (dorocubicel or unexpanded CD34- cells) (Figure 2).
- Inspect the infusion bag(s) for any breaks or cracks prior to thawing. If a bag is compromised, do not infuse the contents.
- Place immediately the infusion bag contained in its sealed overwrap in a 37 °C water bath. When semi-liquid consistency is reached, start to gently knead the bag until no crystal ice remain. The complete thawing duration takes approximately 2-5 minutes per bag.
- Remove bag from the water bath. Once the infusion bag has been thawed, it should be infused as promptly as possible. Zemcelpro has been shown to be stable between 15 °C - 30 °C for up to 1 hour. Do not dilute, wash, or sample Zemcelpro prior to infusion.
- Unless prepared at the patient's bedside, transport the product to the bedside at room temperature in a closed box/bag to protect the product during transport.

Do not infuse Zemcelpro if the infusion bag is damaged or leaking or otherwise appears to be compromised.

## Administration

Prescribed number of bags of dorocubicel (1 to 4 bags) and of unexpanded CD34- cells (always 4 bags) must be infused to complete a single dose of Zemcelpro. The total number of infusion bags to be administered must be confirmed with the patient specific information on the RfIC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dorocubicel is infused first, followed by the unexpanded CD34- cells. It is recommended that the unexpanded CD34- cells be infused the same day as dorocubicel, but no later than the following day.

If dorocubicel is not administered, the unexpanded CD34- cells must not be infused to avoid any untoward immune reaction.

In case of infusion reaction, pausing infusion and instituting supportive care is recommended, as needed (see section 4.4).

Do not dilute, wash or sample Zemcelpro prior to infusion.

Intravenous use only. Central venous access is recommended for the infusion of Zemcelpro.

Figure 2. Zemcelpro Infusion Bag

<!-- image -->

- Prepare infusion material. A latex-free tubing with a standard infusion filter (170-260 µm) must be used. Do NOT use a leukocyte depleting filter.
- Confirm i) the patient's identity with the patient identifiers on the bag and ii) the cell component identity (dorocubicel or unexpanded CD34- cells) (Figure 2).
- Remove the overwrap and inspect the content of the thawed infusion bag for any visible cell aggregates. If visible cell aggregates are present, gently mix the contents of the bag, small aggregates of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Remaining aggregates are effectively removed through filtration before infusion.
- The thawed and inspected bag must be infused promptly at approximately 10 to 20 mL per minute by gravity flow. Zemcelpro is stable between 15 °C - 30 °C for up to 1 hour after end of thawing.
- -Prime the tubing prior to infusion with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- injection.
- -Infuse all contents of the infusion bag (20 mL per bag).
- -Rinse twice the infusion bag with 10 mL to 30 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure the totality of cells are infused into the patient.
- The procedure for infusion must be repeated for the other bags. Wait to thaw and infuse the next bag until it is determined that the previous bag is safely administered.

Do not infuse Zemcelpro if the infusion bag is damaged or leaking or otherwise appears to be compromised.

## Measures to take in case of accidental exposure
