Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 16 February 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Litfulo, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study B7981031 titled 'An interventional PK, PD, Phase 1, open-label study to investigate PK and PD of multiple-dose ritlecitinib in children 6 to less than 12 years of age with severe alopecia areata' is a stand-alone study and also part of a clinical development program. A line listing of all the concerned studies was provided by the MAH.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The ritlecitinib formulation used in study B7981031 was 20 mg capsules. For administration, the capsules were dissolved in water and the contents of the capsule in water were taken.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- study B7981031 titled 'An interventional PK, PD, Phase 1, open-label study to investigate PK and PD of multiple-dose ritlecitinib in children 6 to less than 12 years of age with severe alopecia areata'.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Clinical study number B7981031, An interventional PK, PD, Phase 1, openlabel study to investigate PK and PD of multiple-dose ritlecitinib in children 6 to less than 12 years of age with severe alopecia areata.

## Description

Study B7981031 was a single-group, uncontrolled, open-label, interventional PK, PD study to estimate the systemic exposures of 20 mg QD of ritlecitinib in at least 12 children with alopecia areata (AA), 6 to less than 12 years of age, including at least 4 participants 6 to less than 9 years of age.

The PK and PD assessments from this study are used for dose selection in subsequent paediatric studies.

## Methods

Participants were planned to be screened and, if all eligibility criteria were met, to receive the first dose of study intervention within 28 days after the screening visit. Participants were planned to receive 20 mg ritlecitinib once daily in one dose for 7 consecutive days. On Day 7 (EOT) blood samples for PK were planned to be collected at 0 hr (pre-dose), 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 3 hrs, and 8 hrs after dosing. At least 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evaluable participants with respect to the primary endpoint were planned to be enrolled in the study. Participants that were not able to provide a full set of evaluable PK data or missed more than 1 dose could be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor. A follow-up visit was planned to be conducted by phone 28 to 35 days after the last dose of ritlecitinib (Refer to Figure 1).

The following ritlecitinib PK parameters were calculated for each participant using NCA analysis of concentration-time data. PK parameters are described in Table 1. Samples below the LLOQ were set to 0 ng/mL for analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis.

Plasma samples were analysed for ritlecitinib by a validated analytical method.

## a. If data permitted

Pharmacokinetic parameter values were calculated using an internally validated software system, oNCA (version 2.7.8).

The following supporting data from the estimation of t½ were also reported: kel, kel,t(lo), kel,t(hi), and kel,t(n); r2; and the percent of AUCinf, obtained by forward extrapolation (AUCextrap%). Unless otherwise noted, parameters marked if data permitted were reported only where a well-characterised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

terminal phase was observed. A well-characterised terminal phase is defined as one with at least 3 data points, r2 ≥ 0.9 and AUCextrap% ≥ 20%.

## Study participants

Enrolled in this study were 6 to less than 12-year-old children with a diagnosis of severe AA, including AT and AU, with ≥ 50% scalp hair loss due to AA (ie, a SALT score of ≥ 50) at both the Screening and Baseline visits, without evidence of terminal hair regrowth within the previous 12 months.

## Treatments

The study intervention was ritlecitinib capsules dissolved in water. The first dose was administered at the study site, in presence of the investigator or designee.

The daily oral dose was 20 mg and the treatment lasted up to 7 days.

The study included a screening period of up to 28 days, a 7-day interventional period, and a 28-35 day follow-up period. The duration of study participation for each participant was approximately 9-10 weeks.

Each site received an initial shipment with enough study intervention for 2 participants. Replacements were provided to the study site as the initial supply was used or expired.

The manufacturing lot number for the study intervention dispensed in this study is provided in Table 2.

## Sample size

A sample size of 12 participants was expected to provide adequate PK information.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Allocation:

The investigator's knowledge of the treatment assignment had to not influence the decision to enroll a particular participant or affect the order in which participants were enrolled. Given the small number of participants and the nature of the study (PK, PD) it was very unlikely that the investigator decisions may be affected by bias.

Blinding:

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical Methods

The plasma PK parameters were listed and summarised descriptively by nominal PK sampling time. Individual participant and median profiles of the plasma concentration-time data were plotted using actual and nominal times, respectively. Median profiles were presented on both linear-linear and loglinear scales.

Taste acceptability assessment questionnaire was included; results were listed and summarised descriptively (frequencies and percentages).

No statistical hypothesis were tested in this study.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 16 participants were screened and 15 of them were assigned to study intervention, enrolled at 6 centers in the US (see Table 4). Except for 1 participant who discontinued from the study intervention after 2 days of oral administration of ritlecitinib 20 mg QD due to an AE of urticaria on Day 3, all other 14 participants received ritlecitinib 20 mg QD from Day 1 to Day 7. All enrolled participants (n = 15) completed the follow-up.

## Recruitment

## Number analysed

All enrolled participants (n=15) were included in the safety and PD parameter analysis sets.

A total of 13 participants were included in the PK concentration analysis set and PK parameter analysis set. Two participants were excluded as they had no evaluable PK data (one of them discontinued from study intervention on Day 3 and the other one had the important protocol deviation of PK samples not collected on Day 7).

## Baseline data

Demographic characteristics and physical measurements of 15 enrolled participants in this study are summarised in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively. Twelve (80%) participants were female. The median (range) of age (years) was 8.0 (6,11). The majority of the enrolled participants were White (13 participants, 86.7%) and around half of the enrolled participants were Hispanic or Latino (8 participants, 53.3%). The median (range) of the BMI (kg/m2) was 17.06 (13.09, 22.31).

## Prior and concomitant therapy

A total of 5 participants had concomitant medications (iron supplement, dexmethylphenidate (2x), fexofenadine, levothyroxine) during this study and one of them took medications to treat an AE of urticaria.

## Exposure and study intervention compliance

One participant received ritlecitinib 20 mg QD at day 1 and day 2 only; all other 14 participants received ritlecitinib 20 mg QD from Day 1 to Day 7. The first and last dose were administered at the study site and doses 2 through 6 were taken at home.

No important protocol deviations related to study intervention compliance were reported in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two occurrences of the NSAE vomiting were experienced by a participant on Day 6 (no exact time was collected), and it is unknown if the vomiting occurred within 1 hour after the administration of study intervention. As only PK data are used at day 7 to support the popPK model, and there is no accumulation of ritlecitinib, this would not impact the pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacodynamics results

Baseline and change from baseline at day 7 in CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD3CD16+CD56+ NK cells are presented in Table 8.

## Efficacy results

Study B7981031 was a Phase 1 PK/PD study with a 7-day intervention period. Therefore, there was no efficacy data.

## Safety results

Among 15 participants in the safety analysis set, 4 AEs were experienced by 3 participants. No SAEs, severe AEs or dose reductions/temporary discontinuations due to AEs were reported. One AE of urticaria led to discontinuation of study intervention and this AE was considered as treatment related (Table 10).

Except for the Number of Adverse Events participants are counted only once per treatment in each row.

Serious AdverseEvents - according to theinvestigator's assessment.

a. Participants who have an AE record that indicates that Action Taken with Study Treatment was Drug Withdrawn. MedDRA v26.0 coding dictionary applied.

## Frequency of AEs by System Organ Class and Preferred Term

The incidence and severity of TEAEs for all participants in the safety analysis set are summaried by SOC and PT in Table 11.

Three participants experienced 4 TEAEs during the study: one experienced vomiting and nausea (both mild and not treatment-related), one experienced myalgia (mild and not treatment-related), and one experienced urticaria (moderate and treatment-related) (Table 10).

The treatment-related non-serious adverse event (NSAE) of urticaria (investigator term: acute urticaria on both legs) started on Study Day 1 and lasted for 3 days and it resulted in the permanent discontinuation from the study intervention of ritlecitinib 20 mg QD after 2 dose administrations.

a. If the same participant in a given treatment had more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the most severe occurrence is counted.

Participants are counted only once per treatment per event.

For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as severe unless the participant experienced another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity was recorded. In this case, the reported severity is summarized. Missing baseline severities are imputed as mild. Treatment (Trt) column gives study treatment at time of adverse event.

Includes data up to 28 days after last dose of study drug.

MedDRA v26.0 coding dictionary applied.

Maximum severity at any dictionary level is calculated after the report subset criteria is applied.

No deaths, adverse events of special interest (AESIs) or modifications or temporary discontinuation of the study intervention due to AEs were reported in this study.

## Taste assessment

All 15 participants were eligible for the pediatric taste questionnaire; 14 of them completed the questionnaire. The scale ranged from 1 (most favorable) to 5 (least favorable).

On Day 1 (Table 13), all 14 (93.3%) participants selected 'Yes' to 'take medicine as directed'. Approximately half of the participants (n=7, 46.7%) scored the overall taste of medicine with a maximum of 5. Overall mouthfeel of medicine score varied from 2 - 5; most frequent score was 2 (n=5, 33.3%), which was similar to the most frequent score for the overall volume of medicine.

On Day 7 (Table 14), all 14 (93.3%) participants selected 'Yes' to 'take medicine as directed.' Approximately half of the participants scored the overall taste of medicine with a maximum of 5. The most frequent scores for the overall mouthfeel of medicine were 2 and 4 (5 participants, 33.3%, respectively). The most frequent score for overall volume of medicine was 2 (6 participants, 40.0%).

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Results from study B7981031 titled ' An Interventional PK, PD, Phase 1, Open-Label Study to Investigate PK and PD of Multiple-Dose Ritlecitinib in Children 6 to Less Than 12 Years of Age With Severe Alopecia Areata ' in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The aim of the study is to provide characterisation of PK in children and will be utilised to update the popPK model. Further, PD and safety results as well as palatability results were reported.

According to the PIP the doses to be investigated in the planned phase 3 study should be informed by the results of the submitted study B7981031.

The dose determination to support dosing in study B7981031 is based on the following considerations:

1. The systemic exposure data generated in B7981015 for adult and adolescent participants were utilised to derive the dose recommendations for children (6 to &lt;12 years of age) using population PK modeling and simulation analysis.

2. The dose selected for children 6 to &lt;12 years of age in study B7981031 is expected to provide lower exposures than the 50 mg dose in the B7981015 study in adults and adolescents.

The dose of 20 mg selected for evaluation in this PK, PD study is predicted to provide exposures in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age approximating the exposure of a 30 mg dose in adults and adolescents. Upon CHMP's request, the MAH confirmed that the bioavailability of the 20 mg capsule in relation to the 50 mg capsule and the dissolving in water is comparable. The CHMP considers that the bridge between the 20 mg formulation and the 50 mg formulation has been sufficiently supported.

Overall, the dose of 20 mg was considered to be adequate to meet the objectives of the study to characterise the PK of ritlecitinib in children.

In addition, opening the capsule and dispersing the content in water before intake may have an impact on disintegration. Nevertheless, the MAH has demonstrated that difference in in vitro disintegration did not influence the in vivo performance. Furthermore, sprinkling the content on jam, yoghurt or apple sauce did not clinically significantly impact the exposure. The somewhat lower Cmax after administration with yoghurt is not clinically relevant, as food reduces Cmax by 32%, and Litfulo can be taken with or without food. Therefore, opening the capsule and dispersing the content in water before intake is justified.

## Pharmacodynamics

Only minor, and clinically irrelevant changes in lymphocyte subsets and IP-10 levels were shown from baseline to day 7. The short duration of the intervention likely explains the absence of change in lymphocyte subsets, as described in the SmPC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma samples were analysed for ritlecitinib by a validated analytical method. Upon CHMP's request, the MAH confirmed that the analytical method was submitted at the time of initial MAA. In addition, accuracy and precision have been demonstrated. The issue is considered to be resolved.

During analysis of subject plasma samples results showed acceptable performance of the method. Incurred sample reanalysis indicated good reproducibility.

Following multiple oral q.d administration of 20 mg ritlecitinib capsules, plasma concentrations of ritlecitinib on day 7 had a median tmax of approximately 0.5 hour. Ritlecitinib mean terminal t½ was approximately 1.19 hours. Geometric mean values for ritlecitinib exposure parameters AUC0-24h and Cmax were 437.5 ng.hr/ml and 208.7 ng/ml, respectively. The geometric mean CL/F was 45.70 l/h and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mean Vz/F was approximately 74.92 l. The variability (geometric %CV) for AUC0-24h and Cmax was 30% and 38%, respectively.

The data will be utilised to update the population PK model which was previously developed for adults and adolescents and submitted within the initial MAA. Based on the updated population PK model, the following doses will be chosen for the efficacy and safety Phase 3 Study B7981027 in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age with AA as agreed in the PIP

- a high dose which provides exposures equivalent to the currently authorised 50 mg ritlecitinib dose in adults and adolescents;
- a low dose which provides exposures equivalent to 30 mg ritlecitinib dose which was efficacious in the adult and adolescent Study B7981015.

## Efficacy

No efficacy data were available in study B798031.

## Safety

Four AEs were reported by three participants (20%), most were mild and not treatment-related (vomiting, nausea, myalgia) and one was assessed moderate and treatment-related (urticaria) which led to study discontinuation.

Two occurrences of the NSAE vomiting were experienced by a participant on Day 6 (no exact time was collected), and it was unknown whether the vomiting occurred within 1 hour after the administration of study intervention. As this could impact the PK and thus impact the outcome of the popPK modelling, the MAH was requested to clarify how the data will be handled in the popPK modelling. The MAH sufficiently justified that vomiting on day 6 will not impact the PK at day 7 due to the short elimination half-life and the fact that there is no accumulation (no pre-dose concentration).

Urticaria is a known side effect in adults treated with ritlecitinib; it was among the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the adult AA study population and is listed as 'common' in section 4.8 of the currently approved SmPC.

No SAEs, severe AEs, deaths, dose reductions or temporary discontinuation due to AEs and no AESIs were reported. No clinically significant changes were observed in laboratory parameters and vital signs.

Overall treatment was safe and well tolerated, without new safety signals. No changes to the SmPC are indicated based on the current study.

## Taste assessment

The overall palatability, acceptability, and tolerability of the ritlecitinib formulation were generally acceptable.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled

No regulatory action required.
