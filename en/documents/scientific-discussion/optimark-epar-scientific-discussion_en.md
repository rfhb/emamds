## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1. Introduction

## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  has  proved  to  be  an  extremely  valuable  diagnostic  imaging modality since its introduction as a clinical tool in the 1980s. MRI has provided several benefits over previously existing diagnostic imaging modalities. These advantages include multiplanar capabilities (axial,  coronal,  and  sagittal  sections),  no  exposure  to  ionizing  radiation,  visualization  of  contrast resolution between various tissues and the determination of several intrinsic tissue characteristics (T1, T2, and proton density). Large lesions may be detected with MRI without a contrast agent; however, the detection of small lesions such as early brain metastases or small liver metastases requires high lesion contrast.

The  magnitude  of  signal  detected  and  displayed  in  MRI  is  dependent  upon  the  imaging  pulse sequence (a set of variables controlled by the Radiologist), and several intrinsic tissue characteristics. These intrinsic tissue characteristics include the proton density (PD) and proton T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times.

The potency of a contrast agent is determined by measuring its effect on the relaxation rate (1/T1), which is the inverse of the relaxation time. Larger 1/T1 values translate into larger signal intensities. In vitro 1/T1 is directly proportional to the concentration of the contrast agent in a solution or a tissue sample.  The relaxivity of a contrast agent is this experimentally determined proportionality constant, and the larger the relaxivity of a contrast agent, the larger the increase in signal intensity for a given concentration of the agent. The enhancement of brain tumours using a gadolinium (or iodine) containing contrast agent depends on the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB). As a result, these agents have been referred to as markers for sites of abnormal BBB breakdown. When the BBB is disrupted, the gadolinium molecules diffuse into the interstitial compartment thereby producing the characteristic paramagnetic effect of T1 and T2 shortening. In general, the addition of contrast to MRI, at the standard clinical dose of 0.1  mmol/kg,  has  led  to  a  significantly  improved  lesion  detection,  definition  and  specificity  as compared to CECT. Concerning  the  detection  of  liver  lesions  the  hepatic  artery  and  portal  venous  system  supply approximately 20% and 80% of the hepatic blood supply, respectively. The earlier (hepatic arterial phase)  images  provide  optimal  lesion  conspicuity  for  hypervascular  lesions  and  the  portal  venous phase images are useful for hypovascular lesions. Typical hepatic imaging protocols are designed to include a series of imaging sequences with the understanding that some lesions will be detected more readily during the hepatic arterial phase, some during the portal venous phase and some during the equilibrium phase of contrast enhancement.

## About the product

OptiMARK is a gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agent to induce signal intensity changes within a lesion, thereby facilitating its recognition from the surrounding normal structures. This is done by the  use  of  the  metal  gadolinium,  which  due  to  its  atomic  structure,  acts  indirectly  on  the  local magnetic environment to alter proton T1 relaxation times.

Gadoversetamide  is  similar  in  structure  to  the  active  substance  in  the  Magnevist  formulation (gadopentetate  dimeglumine).  Both  OptiMARK  and  Magnevist,  extracellular  gadolinium  chelates, have  similar  biodistribution  and  elimination  characteristics  when  compared  to  each  other  and  to iodine  contrast  agents  like  those  used  during  contrast  enhanced  computed  tomography  (CECT). Therefore,  a  significant  portion  of  both  the  Nonclinical  and  Clinical  Pharmacology  program  was designed to explore the relaxivity and pharmacokinetics of OptiMARK and to compare them to those of previously approved MRI contrast agents such as Magnevist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A marketing authorisation application for OptiMARK was submitted in 1998 and was withdrawn in 1999 following an oral explanation in front of the CPMP due to the fact that some outstanding clinical and biostatistical questions could not be satisfactorily resolved. Based on a CHMP scientific advice received in May 2005 a complete re-read of the magnetic resonance images which formed the basis for the pivotal phase 3 study results was undertaken by an independent consulting firm.

OptiMARK was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 and subsequently in 15 countries over the world. In the countries where it is registered, OptiMARK is used with MRI in patients suspected of abnormal blood brain barrier breakdown or abnormal vascularity of the brain, spine and associated tissues. OptiMARK is also used with MRI to provide contrast enhancement and facilitate visualization of lesions with abnormal vascularity in the liver of patients highly suspected of liver structural abnormalities.

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

OptiMARK is a clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution for injection, containing 0.5 mmol/ml of gadoversetamide,  in  a  formulation  also  containing  the  novel  excipient  versetamide  as  a  stabiliser. OptiMARK is a novel contrast medium for magnetic resonance imaging. Gadoversetamide is a chelate of  gadolinium  and  the  ligand  versetamide,  and  is  structurally  related  to  the  existing  contrast  media gadopentetate dimeglumine ('Magnevist') and gadodiamide ('Omniscan').

It is supplied in glass vials and in polypropylene pre-filled syringes. The concentration of 0.5 mmol/ml is appropriate in view of the intended dosage of 0.1 mmol per kg of body weight, administered as a bolus i.v. injection.

OptiMARK was the subject of a centralised application in 1998, which was subsequently withdrawn.

## Active Substance

Gadoversetamide is the recommended INN for the complex of Gd 3+ and a novel ligand, versetamide (recommended INN), which is a derivative of the chelating agent diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA ) . The  Gd 3+ ion  is  bonded  to  three  nitrogens  on  the  diethylenetriamine  backbone,  to  three carboxylate oxygens and to two carboxamide oxygens, as is shown in the figure below:

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The molecular formula is C20H34N5O10Gd and the molecular weight is 661.8.

Gadoversetamide's Generic Name is Gd-DTPA- bis (methoxyethylamide) and is structurally related to gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA dimeglumine) and to gadodiamide (Gd-DTPAbismethylamide) - agents that  are  currently  widely  used  as  contrast  media  for  magnetic  resonance imaging.  It  is  hygroscopic  and  highly  soluble  in  water  (~1.2  g/ml).  In  relation  to  its  diagnostic function, its molar  relaxivity in water  is  4.3  mM -1 S -1 , a  value  similar  to  gadopentate.  The butanol:buffer  partition  coefficient  (log  P)  was  determined  to  be  -1.82.  Two  polymorphs  were identified using X-Ray diffraction, however both are equally soluble and IR and NMRD spectroscopy demonstrate that they are equivalent in solution. Because OptiMARK is a dilute solution the existence of two polymorphs is of no practical significance for the product.

## · Manufacture

The manufacture involves a three-stage synthesis and one purification step and has been satisfactorily described. In the whole process no catalysts used. Several reprocessing steps have been laid down. In these steps no other materials are used than in the main process. The specifications for all reagents and solvents are considered to be satisfactory. In-process controls are specified for each step in the process and are considered to be acceptable.

## · Specification

The specification for the control of the active substance includes tests for appearance, colour (UV), identification (HPLC, Colorimetric test), assay of gadoversetamide (HPLC) and free gadolinium (III) and  total  chelating  material  (titration),  Water,  (Karl-Fischer),  residual  solvents  (GC),  heavy  metals (Ph.  Eur.),  endotoxin  (LAL),  total  viable  aerobic  count  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  related  substances  (HPLC). Three different HPLC methods are used for the determination of impurities and degradation products depending on the nature of each one of them. All impurities were qualified with relevant toxicological studies.

## · Stability

Stability results have been provided for three commercial-scale batches of gadoversetamide packaged in  the  commercial  packaging.  A  long-term  study  is  being  conducted  at  25  ºC/60%  RH  and  will continue for 36 months. A study under accelerated conditions was conducted at 40 ºC/75% RH for six months. Results have been provided for 24 months under long-term conditions and for six months under the accelerated conditions. All batches fully complied with the specification at all test points. Apart from an increase in water content, no clear trends emerge from a review of the stability data and, therefore, the proposed retest period is accepted. Additionally, a report of forced degradation studies conducted using samples of gadoversetamide was submitted.  The  results  of  the  study  indicate  that  the  stability  of  the  active  substance  is  only significantly  affected,  when  heated  in  aqueous  solution  at  pH  9.0,  with  degradation  to  form  two specified impurities. Photostability testing has not been performed on the active substance, however it is accepted that the proposed  container  sufficiently  protects  the  active  substance  from  UV  light  during  storage.  In addition,  OptiMARK  medicinal  product,  which  consists  of  the  active  substance  and  the  ligand versetamide in water, was found to have limited photosensitivity in stability testing, and therefore it can be safely assumed that the active substance and ligand should have limited photosensitivity as well. Finally, no impact of gadoversetamide polymorphism on the thermodynamic stability was observed. In  conclusion,  on  the  basis  of  the  submitted  stability  data,  as  discussed  above,  the  claimed  re-test period and storage condition can be granted.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

OptiMARK is a sterile injectable solution intended for intravenous administration. The concentration of 0.5 mmol/ml was chosen to facilitate the administration of the standard clinical dose for MRI contrast media.  The  osmolality  is  approximately  3.9  times  that  of  plasma,  which  is  similar  to  that  of  other agents  in  the  class.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  safety  of  OptiMARK,  established  in  nonclinical  and clinical models suggests that a bolus dose of maximum 1-2 ml/min of a 500 micromol/ml dose would be  sufficiently  diluted  in  the  blood  ensuring  that  any  potential  safety  issues  associated  with  the hypertonicity would not occur. Furthermore, the viscosity is appropriate for a small volume injection at  the  anticipated  human  dose  and  the  pH  of  the  solution  is  close  to  physiological  values.  Product stability was found to be optimum at pH &lt; 6.8 and it is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. It has been found that the product is stable at elevated temperatures provided the initial pH value was less than 6.8.

Other studies showed that the stability of the product is not affected by exposure to air or oxygen, however, as an additional precaution, the product is filled under nitrogen. It was found that the impact of the tested buffers did not improve significantly the stability profile of the formulation so they were omitted from the final formulation. In addition, since the product is a solution and the active substance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is very soluble in water, the polymorphic form, particle size distribution and surface area of the later do not affect the bioavailability and/or the stability of finished product.

The active substance is a complex of gadolinium and versetamide, which is a novel excipient. The active substance and the new excipient are manufactured largely in the same way and only the last step of the synthesis differs. Satisfactory data on the manufacturing, control, stability and toxicology of this new excipient have been submitted.

Appropriate studies were done with regard to stabilising the gadoversetamide complex, and the most suitable  counter-ion  for  the  free  versetamide.  The  molar  ratios  of  versetamide  and  calcium  were chosen based on appropriate toxicity studies. Finally, holding times, filtration and sterilisation have been identified as critical process steps. Individual studies were conducted to validate them and have been satisfactorily validated.

## · Adventitious Agents

No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of OptiMARK.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process involves several steps of dissolution of the drug substance and excipients in water for injections while adjusting the pH of the solution to the desired levels. Vials are filled and concurrently purged with nitrogen, capped and sterilised by autoclaving. Syringe barrels are washed, siliconised and filled, then the pistons are fitted onto the filled barrels and the syringes are sterilised by autoclaving. The sterilisation occurs at standard Ph. Eur. conditions.

· Product Specification The specification for OptiMARK  includes tests for appearance, odour, colour (UV), pH (potentiometric), identification (HPLC, colorimetric test), assay of gadoversetamide (HPLC), free and total  gadolinium  (UV),  total  chelating material  (titration)  and  calcium  (atomic  absorption),  specific gravity  (density  meter),  osmolality  (vapour  pressure  lowering  apparatus),  particulates  (Ph.  Eur.), sterility  (Ph.  Eur.),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.  Eur.),  extractable  volume  (only  for  vials,  volumetric cylinder),  syringe  function  tests  (in-house  force  gauge)  and  related  substances  (HPLC).  Three different  HPLC  methods  are  used  for  the  determination  of  impurities  and  degradation  products depending on the nature of each one of them. The  tests  and  limits  of  the  specifications  for  OptiMARK  solution  for  injection  are  appropriate  to control the quality of the finished product for the intended purpose. · Stability of the Product Glass vials: Three batches per vial volume (12 batches in total) were stored long term, under 30 °C/60 % RH for 12 months, and under accelerated conditions at 40°C/75 % RH for 6 months, in both the upright and inverted positions. The long-term conditions are more severe (30 rather than 25 °C) than those envisaged in the current stability guidelines, but this is acceptable as it will tend to produce a more conservative estimate of the shelf-life. In addition, stability samples were tested for container closure integrity using a dye bath. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Polypropylene syringes: Three  batches  per  vial  volume  (12  batches  in  total)  were  stored  long-term under 25 °C/40% RH for 36 months and under accelerated conditions at 40 °C/20% RH for 6 months; all samples were stored in a sideways orientation. The temperatures used comply with current stability guidelines, but the relative humidity was considerably lower than the guidelines' recommendations. In the case of an aqueous solution supplied in a plastic container, low ambient humidity would increase the rate of vapour transmission, while high ambient humidity would not compromise product stability. The conditions used in the trial would therefore tend to shorten the shelf-life.

In addition, stability samples were tested for vapour transmission, for container closure integrity using a dye bath and for extraction of additives from the polypropylene syringe.

The container/closure integrity of the syringes was also tested after freeze-thawing. It was found that the integrity of the closure was compromised in samples that had been frozen and thawed. In addition samples of OptiMARK were stored at 60°C for 14 days. No evidence of instability was observed during this period.

Results  for  both  vials  and  syringes  at  all  the  different  conditions  and  for  all  batches  were  found  to comply with the product specification at all test points.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Photostability  was  investigated  for  both  vials  and  syringes  by  exposing  one  batch  of  each  packaging material under a xenon light source to 1.2 million lux hours. Results revealed an increase in the content of  unspecified  impurities  and  a  slight  increase  in  pH,  indicating  that  the  product  should  be  protected from light.

In  addition,  four  batches  of  each  packaging  material  were  subjected  to  double  autoclaving  but  no significant  differences  were  observed  between  the  product  samples  that  were  single-  and  doubleautoclaved.

Based on the overall stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  quality  of  OptiMARK  solution  for  injection  is  adequately  established.  In  general,  sufficient chemical and pharmaceutical documentation relating to development, manufacture and control of the active substance and medicinal product has been presented. Satisfactory data have been provided in support of the novel excipient used in the finished product.

There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics.  Stability  tests indicate that the product is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product. The applicant committed to resolve these as FollowUp Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

All pivotal studies were conducted according to GLP. The studies conducted were sufficient in number and  type,  contained  adequate  group  sizes  to  assess  the  toxicological  effects  of  gadoversetamide  in laboratory animals and permitted determination of the drug's safety in humans.

## Pharmacology

OptiMARK has a similar structure, although chemically distinct, to an already marketed gadolinium chelate product, Magnevist. Primary pharmacodynamic studies focused on comparisons of the ability of OptiMARK and Magnevist to alter proton relaxation times in vitro and in vivo.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

The main in vitro study tested the equivalency of OptiMARK and Magnevist in terms of ability to alter T1 and T2 relaxation times in water and in 4% BSA using a Bruker NMR Minispec PC120 (20 MHz,  0.47T).  In  each  solution,  for  two  concentrations  (0.25  to  10  mM),  the  agents  had  similar relaxivity  values,  R,  both  in  value  and  in  gradient.  In  all  cases,  R  for  OptiMARK  was  statistically significantly more relaxive than Magnevist.

Difference  between  phantom  samples  of  OptiMARK  and  Magnevist  were  also  tested.  16  sealed samples  ranging  in  concentrations  from  1  microM  to  10  mM  were  placed  upright  in  a  Styrofoam

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

container within the headcoil of either a whole body scanner (1.5T) or an animal scanner (4.7T). For each  scanner,  a  single  coronal  slice  was  taken  (TR-500  ms,  TE  =  20  ms)  which  yielded  an  image containing 16 circles representing the 16 solutions. Signal intensities were plotted as a function of the concentration of each agent, reaching a maximum intensity at 1 mM, where after the signal decreased. Resulting  curves  were  nearly  identical,  supporting  the  evidence  that  the  imaging  properties  of OptiMARK and Magnevist are equivalent.

In  vivo  the  renal  contrast  enhancement  of  OptiMARK  versus  Magnevist  was  evaluated  in  a  7-day crossover  direct  comparison  study  in  rabbits.  Contrast  was  injected  into  anaesthetised  male  New Zealand rabbits via i.v. ear drip as a bolus agent (0.1 mmol/kg) followed by a 6 ml flush of saline. Rabbits were imaged with a 4.7 T/440 animal scanner and phantom samples were measured. Images were taken pre and post injection using similar specifications and TS= 300 ms, TE = 18 ms. A second imaging was performed one week later. The signal intensity was greatest at 5 minutes post injection, gradually  decreasing  over  the  90  minutes.  For  qualitative  assessment,  films  from  the  20  min  postcontrast image were prepared and compared by two blinded radiologists. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data from the study time intensity curves were similar for each agent and there were no appreciable differences in the imaging effects of OptiMARK and Magnevist.

And additional study was performed in an experimental model of cerebral metastatic disease. Twenty male New Zealand rabbits were injected intracerebrally with 1 million VX2 carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) cells suspended in 0.1 ml buffered saline. At 10-14 days post injection, the animals were  imaged  twice  with  a  24-hour  delay  between  scans.  For  the  first  image,  the  animals  received OptiMARK bolus 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 mmol/kg i.v. In the second image, the animals received 0.05, 0.2 or 0.1 mmol/kg respectively. There were 5-6 animals per dose pair. In addition, 5 animals received either 0.1 mmol/kg of OptiMARK or 0.1 mmol/kg Magnevist. Imaging was performed on a 1.5T scanner and parameter specifications for both scans were identical. The presence and extent of tumours were compared with T1 weighted pre and post contrast spin echo scans and T2 weighted scans. Contrast enhancement  values  (CEV)  were  calculated  for  each  tumour.  For  concentrations  of  0.05  to 0.4 mmol/kg, there was an increase in CEV intensity with a plateau at &gt; 0.4 mmol/kg. 0.05 mmol/kg doses were able to identify 50% of what 0.3 mmol/kg could identify. 0.1 mmol/kg was able to identify 71% of what 0.5 mmol/kg could identify. At 0.2 mmol/kg, it was possible to identify all tumours seen with the 0.4 mmol/kg doses. OptiMARK was shown to be equivalent to Magnevist at equivalent doses (same number of tumours seen in the same animals). Medicinal product no longer authorised

To address OptiMARK permeability to the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) 12 New Zealand rabbits were injected  with  VX2  carcinoma  cells  into  their  brains,  and  10-14  days  later,  MRI  studies  were performed using a bolus i.v. dose of OptiMARK (0.3 - 0.5 mmol/kg). A 1.5T clinical scanner was used and T1 weighted scans were conducted pre-contrast injection and every minute for 15 minutes post injection. A comparison was made between the MRI images and microscopic histopathological findings.  Analysis  was  made  on  the  basis  of  blinded  and  non-blinded  interpretation.  Using  T1 weighted imaging scanning, OptiMARK was able to identify experimental cerebral tumours as small as 0.6 mm 2 in size. T2W MRI identified only 20 of 104 tumours and therefore the authors considered that this imaging method was poor for diagnosis of cerebral tumours. OptiMARK and Magnevist have comparable performance in detecting experimental metastatic disease at 0.1 mmol/kg.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

A general pharmacology study including both in vivo and in vitro tests investigated the comparative effects of OptiMARK and Magnevist on general signs and symptoms, CNS, smooth muscle, digestive system, somatic nervous system and renal function. The doses used were: 0.5 mmol/kg, 1.5 mmol/kg, and 5 mmol/kg i.v. of OptiMARK or Magnevist. OptiMARK showed some CNS activity, but only at the  highest  dose  (50  times  higher  than  clinical  doses)  and  for  some  responses  such  as  on  body temperature, convulsions or analgesia no effect was noted. There were no effects on the digestive, renal and somatic nervous system. High doses of Magnevist caused some renal, smooth muscle and somatic  nervous  system  effects,  however  none  of  these  effects  are  considered  to  be  a  concern  at clinically relevant doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional  studies  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations  of  OptiMARK  show  that  there  are  no respiratory,  CVS,  CNS,  smooth  muscle  or  renal  system  effects.  All  the  studies  performed  are summarized in the following table:

*Study 1101/05/93/027-E: OptiMARK versus Magnevist: Effect on histamine induced contraction of guinea  pig  trachea.  Isolated  tracheas  were  treated  with  histamine  2  microM  and  allowed  to  reach equilibrium, and then 0.9% (900 microl/bath) saline was added to the bath. Following a 30-minute wash period, three further contractions were elicited with 2 microM histamine. Then the tissues were retreated with histamine 2 microM, and after equilibrium was reached, tissues were treated with either 15  mM  OptiMARK  or  Magnevist.  Saline  resulted  in  a  5%  and  9%  reduction  of  the  contractile response induced by histamine in the two tested groups of tracheas (one for OptiMARK and one for Magnevist)

$Study  1101/05/93/028-E:  methodology  was  almost  identical  to  study  1101/05/93/027-E.  Whereas histamine alone was used as an agonist in the previous study, the tissue samples in this study were also stimulated with acetylcholine. 0.9% saline was added at either 90, 300, 900 microl/bath in study 1101/05/93/028-E  and  did  not  produce  any  significant  reductions  in  histamine  or  acetylcholine contractile response.

Study  1101/05/93/029-E:  0.9%  saline  added  at  either  90,  300,  or  900  microl/bath  produced statistically  significant  (p&lt;0.05)  increases  in  contractility  of  rat  aorta  that  was  not  considered biologically  relevant.  The  reduction  of  contractile  response  noted  at  high  doses  of  contrast  agents were not considered biologically relevant.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

The potential of OptiMARK to prolong QT intervals was assessed by examining its effects on the cardiac action potential of an appropriate in-vitro test system such as isolated Purkinje fibres from the beagle  dog.  The  effects  of  OptiMARK  were  compared  to  those  of  the  commercially  available magnetic resonance contrast agents Magnevist, Omniscan and ProHance and to gadolinium chloride. The contrast agents were studied at concentrations of 2.5, 7.5, 25, 75 and 250 micromol/ml (2.5-250 mM) with an exposure time of 30 minutes (6 fibres per each test). Gadolinium chloride was tested at 1,  3,  10,  30  and  100  µM  concentrations.  OptiMARK,  Omniscan  and  ProHance  all  produced significant  prolongation  of  APD60 (96.3%  p&lt;0.0005)  and  APD90  (81.6%,  p&lt;0.0005)  at  the  highest concentration,  250  micromol/ml,  which  was  at  least  100x  the  maximum  plasma  concentration  that would  be  achieved  under  conditions  of  clinical  use.  Purkinje  fibres  treated  with  Magnevist  at  the highest concentration, 250 micromol/ml, were unable to generate action potentials. At 75 micromol/ml, Magnevist caused a reduction in UA and MRD. Gadolinium chloride had little effect on the cardiac action potential.

No studies available.

In  vivo safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  potential  effects  of  OptiMARK prolonging  the  QT  interval  as  well  as  its  effect  on  other  cardiovascular  parameters  using  dogs. Animals were anaesthetized, had their sino-atrial nodes destroyed and the heart artificially paced. Test drugs were injected into the femoral vein and then flushed with 5 ml saline. A 30 min time lapsed between successive doses. Measurements of cardiovascular parameters were made at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240  sec  and  longer  after  injection.  In  all  the  studies,  the  findings  showed  that  there  was  no  QT prolongation potential of OptiMARK at the doses tested which were as high as 20x the clinical dose (on BW basis) and 10x (on BSA basis) of 0.1 mmol/kg. The rate of administration did not influence these results. One further  study  evaluated  OptiMARK  in  conscious telemetered dogs. This study also noted that OptiMARK should be unlikely to have effects on QTc and other parameters at the clinical dose. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacokinetics

Absorption, biodistribution, metabolism and excretion of OptiMARK were studied in rats and dogs, the  two  species  in  which  principal  toxicology  studies  were  conducted.  Special  studies  included  a study of the secretion in milk of lactating female rats, biodistribution in maternal and foetal tissues after administration to pregnant rats and a study of biodistribution and excretion in anephric rats.

Analytical methods  used  in these studies included a gadoversetamide-specific reverse phase chromatographic  assay,  detection  of  Gd 153 from  radiolabelled  gadoversetamide  in  OptiMARK  (a gamma  emitter  readily  detected  by  gamma  scintillation  counters)  and  an  assay  of  gadolinium  by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

## · Absorption

A series of studies were carried out to determine some pharmacokinetic parameters for gadoversetamide (see table below). In the first study rats (SD) received dose of 0.03-0.10-1.0 mmol/kg iv  Gd 153 -labelled  gadoversetamide,  followed  by  serial  plasma  sampling.  Additional  groups  of  rats received  0.10  mmol/kg  iv.  In  two  separate  studies  male  dogs  received  0.1  mmol/kg  iv  Gd 153 -labelled gadoversetamide and female dogs received 0.1-0.9 mmol/kg iv Gd 153 -labelled gadoversetamide. Serial samples of blood, urine, faeces and tissues were taken. The volume of distribution (Vd) was equivalent to the extra-cellular fluid space and the clearance (Cl) was equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate in dogs.

study) 007 Wible and Hynes (New data) * - AUC0-∞ ** serum data The labelled gadoversetamide distributes in the plasma but doesn't enter RBC, 90-93% is excreted in the urine with negligible amounts found in other tissues. · Distribution An organ  distribution  assay  was  conducted  using  Gd 153 radiolabelled  OptiMARK.  Twelve  SD  rats were dosed with 0.1 mmol/kg OptiMARK and 12 SD rats were dosed with 0.9 mmol/kg OptiMARK. Faeces and urine were also collected for examination. Greatest radioactivity was found 0.5 hours after dosing (1-8%) in the kidney and in organs making up the most of body mass (blood, muscle, skin, skeleton). Radioactivity declined rapidly and 24 hours after dosing, less than 1% of the original dose remained  in  any  organs.  After  48  hours,  0.25%  of  the  radioactivity  still  remained  in  the  skeleton. Most  of  the  radioactivity  appeared  in  the  urine.  In  conclusion,  OptiMARK  is  rapidly  excreted primarily via the urine without selective organ retention. Medicinal product no longer authorised

T1  and  T2  relaxation  times  were  measured  in  serum,  muscle  and  kidney  of  12  male  SD  rats  with 0.1 mmol/kg OptiMARK. Another group of twelve rats was treated with the same dose of Magnevist. These values (with Gd concentrations) were used to calculate tissue relaxivities (R1 and R2). There was  no  difference  in  biodistribution,  half-life  and  volume  of  distribution  or  clearance  between OptiMARK and Magnevist. Similar R1 and R2 values suggested that imaging capability in-vivo is comparable.

Two additional 7-day biodistribution studies were conducted in male rats. Gd 153 was rapidly cleared from blood, liver, spleen, kidneys and bone. At 24 hours, no radioactivity was found in blood with 0.5-0.7%  of  the  injected  dose  in  the  kidney,  &lt;0.3%  of  the  injected  dose  in  bone  and  liver,  and ~0.005% of the dose in spleen. Thereafter, radioactivity continued to decline through the 7-day period

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  kidneys,  liver  and  spleen,  but  remained  relatively  constant  in  bone  at  ~0.2-0.3%  of  the  injected dose.

Biodistribution  was  also  studied  in  female  beagle  dogs.  Four  dogs  were  administered  with  either 0.1  mmol/kg  i.v.  or  0.9  mmol/kg  i.v.  Elimination  half-life  was  between  0.736  and  0.878  hours. Volume of distribution was 22-31% of body weight and clearance was 0.208-0.254 l/kg/hr (similar to the glomerular filtration rate in the dogs). Recovery of 92-94% of dose was found in the faeces and urine (predominantly urine). Less than 1% radioactivity remained in organs after 48 hours of dosing.

In  pregnant/lactating  rats  the  concentration  of  Gd 153 in  the  placenta/amnion  reaches  0.4-times  the maternal plasma Tmax, but takes longer to clear, it was still detectable at 24 hr. As a percentage of dose,  exposure  peaks  at  1.95%,  0.7%  at  24  hr.  Exposure  of  the  foetus  is  negligible,  0.013-times maternal  or  0.25% of dose. Gadoversetamide is secreted in the milk; Tmax = 1 hr, Cmax = 10.98 gee./ml,  still  detectable  at  24  hr.  The  milk:plasma  ratio  increases  with  time,  0.5-3  hr,  due  to  faster excretion from plasma, 0.14-3.64% of dose.

In  vitro studies  using  human,  dog  and  rat  plasma  demonstrated  that  OptiMARK  does  not  bind  to plasma proteins. Binding ranged from -1.96 to 2.36% in the three species tested with concentrations of  0.33  mM  and  3.33  mM  OptiMARK.  These  concentrations  represent  an  estimate  of  the concentration  that  will  be  present  in  plasma  after  0.1  mmol/kg  (clinical  dose)  and  0.9  mmol/kg administrations.

Study 3: This rat study investigated the metabolic fate and protein binding of Gd 153 OptiMARK in plasma, urine, bile, faeces, liver, testes and bone. No metabolism was detected in any tissue or excreta specimen. Binding to plasma protein was nil at 15 minutes and minimal (~1.0%) at 45 minutes. Little protein binding was found in urine, bile or faeces. Protein binding was greatest in liver and testicular specimens (27% of liver radioactivity and 33% of testicular radioactivity at 45 minutes).

· Metabolism The metabolism of OptiMARK was analyzed in several in vivo studies. Study 1:  Male  rats  were  treated  with  a  dose  of  0.9  mmol/kg  of  Gd 153 labelled  drug.  24-hour  urine collections  were  assayed  for  radioactivity  and  also  subjected  to  liquid  chromatographic  assay  of gadoversetamide.  In  both  assays  all of the Gd 153 was  in  the form  of  the active  substance gadoversetamide. No spurious peaks were seen in the chromatographic assay. These results show no evidence of metabolism of gadoversetamide. Study  2:  A  rat  study  examined  plasma  and  urine  for  metabolites  after  a  dose  of  0.1  mmol/kg OptiMARK using liquid chromatographic assay. Plasma levels of gadoversetamide decreased from ~0.2  mg/ml,  at  5  minutes  post-injection,  to  less  than  detectable  (&lt;0.002  mg/ml)  at  2  hours  postinjection.  Twenty-four  hour  urine  collections  contained  0.5-0.7  mg/ml  of  gadoversetamide.  Small chromatographic  peaks,  estimated  to  be  about  0.002-0.008  mg/ml,  and  seen  at  the  solvent  front  in both plasma and urine samples, were later determined to be artefacts of the analytical method.

Study 4: The metabolism of gadoversetamide was studied in plasma and urine of female dogs after a 0.1 mmol/kg dose of OptiMARK using liquid chromatography. Plasma samples were obtained at 2, 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes, and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 8 hours after dosing.  Urine samples were obtained at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after dosing.  No metabolism was observed.  Small chromatographic peaks seen at the solvent front were later determined to be artefacts of the analytical method.

## · Excretion

Results from the studies already described suggest that unchanged gadoversetamide is rapidly eliminated in the urine in both rats and dogs (see table below).

The  rats  received  0.3  mmol/kg  iv  Gd 153 -labelled gadoversetamide  followed  by  sampling  of  blood,  urine  and  tissues  at  0.5-4  hours.  Serum  chemistry showed that anephria was successfully induced (increased creatinine and BUN). At 30 min post-dose most of the Gd 153 in normal animals was in the kidneys and bladder, in anephric animals it was still in the blood, plasma and carcass.  After 4 hours 91.83% of the dose remains in the tissues of the anephric animals while only 4.93% remains in normal animals. The GI-tract and liver are proposed as potential secondary elimination routes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single-dose  toxicity  testing  of  the  gadoversetamide  was  conducted  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  using various formulations. In addition, single-dose toxicity testing of the chelating ligand versetamide was performed using the sodium salt (mice only) or calcium complex (mice, rats and dogs).

CD-1 mice received  0,  10,  20,  25  and  30  mmol/kg  gadoversetamide  in  Tris  buffer.  The  minimum lethal dose was 20 mmol/kg, and LD50 = 25mmol/kg. In addition ICR mice, received 0, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 mmol/kg gadoversetamide. The minimum lethal dose was 8 mmol/kg, and LD50 = 10 mmol/kg. In  both  studies  clinical  signs  included  lethargy,  tremors,  pallor,  staggering  gait,  clonic  convulsion, hyperactivity,  hypothermia,  dyspnoea,  exophtalmos  and  piloerection.  Most  deaths  occurred  within

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

days after administration, some animals died within minutes after administration. No NOAEL could be established.

In one part of the study, formulations contained constant concentrations of gadoversetamide (~0.5 M) and  versetamide  (~0.02  M)  with  varying  amounts  of  calcium  (0-0.03  M).  Administration  of versetamide as the sodium salt, without addition of calcium, results in a relatively toxic formulation of gadoversetamide (LD50 &lt; 6 mmol/kg). The optimal formulation contained a stoichiometric ratio of calcium and versetamide. In the second part of the study, the concentration of gadoversetamide was held constant (~0.5 M), a stoichiometric ratio of calcium/versetamide was maintained, but the calcium versetamide  concentration  was  varied  (0.005-0.025  M).  High  LD50  values  (~30  mmol/kg)  were observed with all /calcium versetamide formulations. The LD50 for the calcium versetamide alone was approximately 15 mmol/kg. Hypoactivity was seen with each formulation and occasional dyspnoea and  convulsions  were  noted.  With  only  two  exceptions,  deaths  were  observed  within  the  first  few minutes after dosing.

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  LD50-values  when  different  manufacturing processes or lots that were stored in either glass vials or plastic syringes were compared.

Toxicities  of  OptiMARK  and  Magnevist  were  compared  in  ICR  mice.  The  animals  received OptiMARK (16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 mmol/kg gadoversetamide) or Magnevist (2, 4, 6 mmol/kg). Clinical  signs  observed  in  both  groups  consisted  of  dyspnoea,  convulsions,  hyperactivity  and  mild ataxia. Additionally, some of the gadoversetamide treated animals showed mild hypoactivity, tremors, prostration and unkemptness and red scaly sore areas on the tail. Surviving animals appeared normal 30 minutes after Magnevist and up to 4 hours after OptiMARK. The combined sex LD50 value for OptiMARK was 24 mmol/kg and for Magnevist 4.9 mmol/kg. In  rats  acute  intravenous  toxicity  of  gadoversetamide  was  assessed  (doses  up  to  16  mmol/kg)  with special emphasis on the kidneys and testes/epididymides. There were no deaths or clinical signs of toxicity. A dose related mild vacuolation of the renal proximal convoluted tubule was observed which tended to recover by day 15. In addition in some animals' degeneration of late stage spermatids or spermatozoa  in  testes  and  epididymides  was  observed  and  could  be  a  possible  drug  related  effect. NOAEL with gadoversetamide is 0.5 mmol/kg. To investigate the potential CNS neurotoxicity of OptiMARK, two single-dose toxicity studies were conducted using intracisternal  injection.  Rats  received  doses  up  to  0.20  mmol/kg  gadoversetamide. Clinical signs included tremors, convulsions, rearing/pawing, salivation and vocalization. Most of the surviving  animals  appeared  to  be  normal  within  24  hours  and  all  deaths  except  for  one  occurred within 24 hours. Intracisternal toxicity of Magnevist (0.05 and 0.1 mmol/kg) was similar in terms of clinical signs. Occasional focal lesions detected in the brain were found with a higher frequency in the Magnevist group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a study in Beagle dogs treated with a single intravenous dose of Tris containing gadoversetamide solution  (3,  6  or  12  mmol/kg)  all  animals  survived.  There  were  neither  treatment  related  physical observations nor effects on body weight, haematological results or pathological findings at necropsy after  an  observation  period  of  14  days.  Slight  increases  in  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  and  slight decreases  in  phosphorus  levels  in  the  6  and  12  mmol/kg  group  were  considered  to  be  treatment related. NOAEL with gadoversetamide is 3 mmol/kg

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Rats  (20/sex/group)  were  given  0-0.1-0.6-3.0  mmol/kg/day  gadoversetamide/tris  i.v.  for  4  weeks. There were no deaths that could be attributed to treatment. Clinical signs seen from Day 11 included erythema, ulceration encrustation and/or exfoliation of the injection site. In addition rapid irregular respiration,  dry  skin,  poor  grooming,  reduced  body  weight  accompanied  by  marginally  lower  food consumption  was  observed.  Some  top  dose  animals  had  focal  corneal  opacity  and  brown  mucous discharge from the eyes, which fully recovered on withdrawal. During the recovery period generalized hair  loss  and  scabbing  or  encrustation  of  the  skin  or  at  least  ungroomed  appearance  was  noted  in males  that  had  received  0.6  or  3.0  mmol/kg.  In  animals  given  3.0  mmol/kg  haematological

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

examination after 25 days of treatment showed a marked reduction in erythrocytic parameters (low haematological concentrations, erythrocyte counts) and an increase of abnormally shaped red cells, accompanied by an increase in platelet and leukocyte counts and a slightly shorter activated partial thromboplastin  time  in  the  males.  Full  resolution  of  symptoms  was  evident  after  seven  weeks  of respite  from  treatment,  but  not  after  three  weeks.  Macroscopic  examination  at  necropsy  after  four weeks of treatment showed that testes of most males that had received 3.0 mmol/kg gadoversetamide appeared small and soft. Epididymides and prostates of most of these males were also noted to be small  and  to  have  reduced  weights.  Histopathological  examination  showed  degeneration  of  the testicular  germinal  epithelium  with  presence  of  spermatid  giant  cells  and  markedly  reduced  sperm content in the epididymides. There was no significant recovery from these changes after four or eight weeks of recovery. Furthermore, there is evidence from the reproductive toxicity studies that there is an  irreversible  loss  of  germinal  epithelium  in  the  majority  of  semiferous  tubules  after  a  recovery period of 8 or 19 weeks. The absolute and relative kidney weight of males and females treated with 3.0  mmol/kg  gadoversetamide  was significantly elevated at the end of treatment and after the four week  recovery  period  and  still  slightly  higher  after  eight  weeks.  Histopathological  examination revealed  macro  and  micro-vacuolization  of  the  cytoplasm  in  proximal  convoluted  tubules  in  some male rats of the mid-dose group and all animals of the high-dose group. After four weeks of treatment examination of the stomach of several males that had received 3.0 mmol/kg revealed thickening of the glandular  mucosa  and  some  punctate  dark  areas,  which  were  identified  as  red  blood  cells.  These findings were reversible after the recovery period. NOAEL of gadoversetamide is 0.1 mmol/kg.

A  comparative  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  was  performed  in  rats  of  gadoversetamide  with  three concentrations of the stabilizer calcium  versetamide. Three  groups  of  4 male  rats received intravenously doses of 5 mmol/kg gadoversetamide containing either 1 %, 5 % or 10 % versetamide for 5 days. Fur loss and skin lesion were observed in all animals treated with gadoversetamide. The onset  of  skin  lesions  occurred  earlier  in  the  10%  calcium  versetamide  group.  This  group  also  had lower tissue (liver, spleen skin) concentrations of gadolinium. Beagle dogs received gadoversetamide 0-0.1-0.5-1.0 mmol/kg/day i.v. for 28 days. Two animals of the high-dose group died. Prior to death, both animals showed lethargy, uncoordinated movements, tremors, decreased food consumption and watery and discoloured stool. The other males of the highdose  group  had  decreased  food  consumption  and  decreased  body  weight gain during the treatment period. The female animal, which was sacrificed in moribund condition, showed signs indicative of renal malfunction and electrolyte imbalance, consisting of a significant decrease in calcium and an increase in phosphorus levels. There were no signs of adverse effects in ophthalmic or haematological evaluations.  A  dose  related  reduction  in  serum  phosphorus  and  increase  in  serum  chloride  during treatment as well as a marked decrease in urinary calcium levels at the end of the treatment period were  observed.  All  values  of  the  surviving  animals  returned  to  normal  at  the  end  of  the  recovery period  (8  weeks).  At  necropsy  there  was  dose  related,  reversible  tan  discoloration  of  kidneys  and bilateral vacuolation of the epithelium of the convoluted tubules in the kidney. The kidney weights were significantly increased in these animals. At the end of the 8-week recovery period some recovery was evident, but the values of the high-dose group remained still slightly higher compared to controls. At the end of the recovery period the kidneys were microscopically normal. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  order  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  repeated  doses  of  gadoversetamide  on  urine  calcium  levels,  2 additional dogs were given 3 mmol/kg for 12 days. Dogs were sacrificed because of their moribund condition. Urine calcium levels of daily collected urine samples were investigated by spectrophotometry  and  atomic  absorption.  Both  methods  showed  no  meaningful  treatment  related decrease in urine calcium as observed in the main study. The presence of OptiMARK in the urine had been  shown  not  to  interfere  with  these  analytical  methods.  The  NOEL  for  gadoversetamide  is 0.1 mmol/kg.

## · Genotoxicity

The mutagenic potential of OptiMARK has been assessed in a battery of standard in vitro and in vivo tests.  With  the  exception  of  the  in  vitro  chromosomal  aberration  assay  all  tests  showed  negative results. The clastogenic effects were associated with severe cytotoxicity (decreased of mitotic index

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and decreased cell number). In an in vivo assay evaluating the potential induction of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of mice OptiMARK was found to be non-clastogenic. Structural and numerical chromosome aberrations observed in vitro at very high concentrations were not considered as relevant for the in vivo situation. Thus, under conditions of recommended clinical use is regarded as safe with respect to genotoxicity.

## · Carcinogenicity

No studies are required as the product is for single dose only.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

## Fertility and early embryonic development

Rats were given 0, 0.1 and 0.5 mmol/kg/day OptiMARK. The males from week 9 pre-mating to day 21 post-partum, the females from week 2 pre-mating to day 20 of gestation or day 21 post-partum. Male animals at 0.5 mmol/kg showed reduced weight gain from the start of the mating period (study week  10).  No  obvious  toxicity  was  apparent  in  females.  Mating  performance  and  fertility  were unimpaired. Two of the top dose females had total litter abortion/resorption. There were no adverse effects  on  in  utero  litter  development  (corpora  lutea,  implantation,  losses,  number,  sex  ratio,  etc). Parturition,  postnatal  development,  maturation  and  fertility  of  the  F1  generation  appeared  to  be unaffected, except for a slight reduction in F1 pup growth rate from birth to Day 8 postpartum and a lower absolute body weights at age 28 days of the F1 generation at 0.5 mmol/kg. The NOEL in this study was 0.1 mmol/kg.

As part of the above study a group of males received 2 mmol/kg/day. Treatment was terminated after 7  weeks  due  to  excessive  toxicity  (reduced  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption,  skin  effects, periorbital discharge, pale extremities, 2 deaths). Animals were subsequently sacrificed or mated with untreated females after a 4-8 week recovery period. Mating was normal after 4 weeks recovery but only  1/12  females  became  pregnant;  after  8  weeks  recovery  2/12  mated  1/12  became  pregnant. Spermatogenesis  was  severely  inhibited  with  depletion  of  stem  cells  and  there  was  little  or  no recovery after treatment had been withdrawn for a total of 19 weeks. Similar changes were observed in a 28-day repeated dose study in rats where testis, epididymis and prostate weights were reduced in the  high  dose  given  3  mmol/kg/day.  Histopathology  showed  degeneration of the atrophic testicular tubules,  spermatid  multinucleated  cells  and  absence  of  mature  spermatozoa  and  presence  of  round spermatids in epididymides. Embryo-fœtal development Pregnant rats SD were given 0-0.1-0.7-4.9 mmol/kg/day gadoversetamide on days 7-17 of gestation. Prenatal  effects  were  restricted  to  the  high  dose  (4.9  mmol/kg/day)  with  decreased  maternal  food consumption and body weight gain during the treatment period. Some skeletal and visceral variants (unossified sternebrae, abnormal  liver lobation) occurred with a higher frequency. Postnatal development  of  offsprings  remained  largely  unaffected.  The  top  dose  was  associated  with  subtle developmental delays (startle response and air righting reflex). NOEL = 0.7 mmol/kg. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pregnant  rabbits  received  0,  1,  2  or  4  mmol/kg  from  Day  6  through  Day  18  of  pregnancy  in  a preliminary dose-ranging study of gadoversetamide. Treatment with 4 mmol/kg/day produced severe weight loss and reduced food intake. At necropsy, pale/enlarged kidneys were seen in 5/6 high-dose animals.  At  1  and  2  mmol/kg/day,  similar  less-pronounced  effects  on  body  weight  and  food consumption were seen in the pregnant females and there were a slightly higher number of malformed foetuses compared to saline controls. In the pivotal study pregnant rabbits were given 0-0.1-0.4-1.6 mmol/kg gadoversetamide from day 6-18 of gestation, with caesarean section on day 29. The dams showed no clinical signs of toxicity apart from a slight loss in body weight gain at the top dose. There was  a  slight,  dose  related  increase  in  the  number  of  litters  and  the  number  of  foetuses  showing forelimb flexure or hind limb malrotation and cardiovascular defects. Maternal NOEL = 0.4 mmol/kg. Foetal NOEL = 0.1 mmol/kg.

## Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function

A dose ranging study (0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 mmol/kg/day) was carried out in rats, there was no dose limiting toxicity.  Pregnant  rats  were  given  0-0.1-0.7-4.2  mmol/kg/day  gadoversetamide  from  day  17  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gestation  to  Day  22  post-partum.  The  only  effect  in  female  rats  treated  during  late  pregnancy  and during lactation was a red-brown periorbital staining during the last week of lactation in the high dose group. There was no effect on gestation index but high implantation losses were recorded for two top dose dams. Fertility of the F1 animals was normal.

## · Local tolerance

OptiMARK was compatible  with  (human)  RBC's  and  plasma  proteins  in  vitro.  Administration  of gadoversetamide in arteries in rabbits induced minimal to moderate venous inflammation caused by the trauma of the injection. Subcutaneous and intra-muscular injection of gadoversetamide produced a similar degree of irritation as induced by saline but did appear to be more persistent.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Antigenicity

The antigenicity of gadoversetamide was investigated in guinea pigs and mice/rats. Guinea pigs were sensitized by subcutaneous injections of gadoversetamide. Sera from these animals were subsequently used  for  homologous  passive  cutaneous  anaphylaxis  reaction  (PCA),  passive  hemagglutionation reaction (PHA) and active systemic anaphylaxis reaction (ASA). Gadoversetamide or gadoversetamide coupled to guinea pig serum albumin (GVS-GSA) were used as challenging agents. A weak antigenicity  of  gadoversetamide  was  observed  only  in  the  ASA  test  when  GVS-GSA  was used  as  a  challenging  agent.  Heterologous  PCA  testing  was  conducted  in  rats  using  sera  from  two different strains of sensitized mice. Challenges were done with gadoversetamide or gadoversetamide coupled to rat serum albumin. No positive results were obtained.

One newly identified impurity was identified in new production lots. It arises from trace amounts of ammonia present in MEA used in the production of versetamide. The amount of ammonia increased slightly after production changes by the supplier. It has proven difficult to synthesize this impurity for toxicity  testing.  Up  to  0.3%,  it  is  considered  that  this  impurity  will  not  alter  the  safety  profile  of OptiMARK.

Immunotoxicity No  other  immunotoxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  OptiMARK.  There  were  no  signs  of compromised  immune function  or  sensitization  in  animals  receiving  daily  repeat-doses  for  periods ranging from 4 to 18 weeks. Studies on impurities Impurities present in OptiMARK are closely related to the active substance, gadoversetamide, and to the  stabilizer,  versetamide,  and  fall  into  the  category  of  polyamino  polycarboxylates  and  their derivatives. Single dose studies with a 14-day observation period were conducted in the mouse. Impurities were administered at doses that were either at the maximum quantity that would be present in OptiMARK, based on specification limits, or that were significant multiples of the doses that would be achieved clinically. All five specified impurities had very good safety margins relative to their specifications. No toxic effects were seen with any of the four polyaminocarboxylate compounds (NOAEL doses for each were the highest doses administered). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Impurities, if present, would be at extremely low levels and the majority would be present as calcium or  gadolinium  chelates.  Based  on  their  structural  similarities  to  the  contrast  agents  and  other compounds  with  known  toxicity  the  analysis  of  potential  impurity  toxicity  concluded  that  these potential impurities would present no risk in OptiMARK

## Other studies

Three in vitro tests were employed to study the cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and haemolytic effects of molded syringe barrels. Extracts of the syringe barrels in cell culture medium were non-cytotoxic in the  ISO  Elution  assay  to  mouse  L-929  fibroblasts.  Saline  extracts  of  syringe  barrels  were  nonmutagenic in the Ames test. Saline extracts of syringe barrels were non-haemolytic when incubated with diluted rabbit blood.

The USP systemic toxicity test for class VI plastic used extracts of syringe barrels was done in mice. Extracts of syringe barrels were prepared in saline, ethanol/saline (1:20), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and  cottonseed  oil  and  another  extracts  were  prepared  in  Optiray  350  ( containing an iodine X-ray contrasting  agent )  or  OptiMARK.  There  was  no  mortality  or  evidence  of  systemic  toxicity  of  the extracts during a 72-hour observation period after dosing, except for extracts prepared in Optiray 350. The animals receiving Optiray 350 appeared lethargic immediately after dosing. However a ten mouse retest was conducted in which no mortality or evidence of systemic toxicity was observed.

The saline extract of syringe barrels was intradermally injected and occlusively patched in a guinea pig sensitization test. The saline extract showed no evidence of delayed dermal contact sensitization when patches were challenged after a 14-day recovery period.

The primary pharmacodynamic effect of OptiMARK, a gadolinium chelate based MRI contrast agent, has been demonstrated by its effect on tissue proton relaxation times (T1 and T2) and impact on the clarity of the MRI image. Gadolinium chelates have already shown their therapeutic efficiency in the field  of  MRI.  Pharmacodynamic  studies  presented  here  have  shown  that  the  imaging  effects  of OptiMARK and Magnevist (a standard gadolinium chelate available in the market) are quantitatively equivalent. The equivalence on qualitative grounds may be however questionable. Direct comparison of  efficacy  of  OptiMARK against Magnevist was made only in clinical studies, where OptiMARK was shown to be non-inferior to Magnevist.

The  saline  extract  of  syringe  barrels  was  intravenously  injected  via  the  marginal  ear  vein  of  New Zealand White rabbits. The maximum change in rabbit temperatures during the 3 hours observation period was ≤ 0.2 o C which is within acceptable limits. The test solution was judged as nonpyrogenic. Additionally extracts of syringe barrels were prepared in saline, ethanol/saline, PEG and cottonseed oil and injected intracutaneously in New Zealand White rabbits. There was no evidence of irritation or  toxicity  from  the  extracts.  Also  in  rabbits,  sterile  samples  of  syringe  barrels  were  aseptically implanted in muscle for an intramuscular toxicity test. The implanted syringe material did not elicit a macroscopic reaction and was considered as non-irritant. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment The  values  for  PECSURFACEWATER  for  both  gadoversetamide  and  versetamide  have  been  incorrectly calculated.  After  the  correction  both  values  are  greater  than  the  phase  I  limit  of  0.01  microg/l.  A Phase II assessment has not been conducted. Discussion on the non-clinical aspects Pharmacology Medicinal product no longer authorised

The safety pharmacology studies clearly set out that effects on the QT interval are unlikely to occur. The effects of OptiMARK and other agents were mimicked by comparable increases in osmolarity produced by mannitol. These results suggest that OptiMARK caused prolongation of cardiac action potentials largely as a result of hypertonicity rather than specific ion-channel interactions. These in vitro effects were observed only at the highest concentration, which was at least 100x the maximum plasma concentration that would be achieved under conditions of clinical use. No significant effect on QT interval  was  noted  either  in  the in  vivo safety  pharmacology studies that  used  of  10x  doses  in excess in the proposed clinical use.

## Pharmacokinetics

Gadoversetamide,  the  active  active  substance  in  OptiMARK,  appears  to  have  an  appropriate pharmacokinetic profile for its intended application as an extracellular magnetic resonance contrast agent.  Gadoversetamide  distributes  between  plasma  and  interstitial  fluid,  does  not  penetrate  the blood-brain  barrier,  undergoes  minimal  passage  of  the  placental  barrier  and  is  rapidly  excreted  in urine in unchanged form. It is known that the clearance of gadolinium-derivatives is highly delayed in patients with renal insufficiency, therefore excretion might be a problem in this type of patients.

A low residual level of radioactivity (~ 0.2-0.3 % of the injected dose) in the rat skeleton was found to be constant over a 4-7 day interval after administration of Gd 153 OptiMARK. Data for these studies were consistent with published reports showing residual radioactivity in the bones of rodents, days after  administration  of  a  single  dose  of  Gd 153 labelled  commercial  products.  The  absence  of toxicological effects on bone makes this issue a minor concern.

No pharmacokinetic studies were carried out after repeated administration. Although the product is intended for single use only, data on repeated administration might be useful to support repeated dose toxicity studies.

Toxicity Studies with OptiMARK did not elicit classical signs of single-dose gadolinium toxicity.  Specifically with respect to cardiotoxicity, extensive pharmacology safety testing demonstrated a very high degree of  cardiovascular  safety  for  OptiMARK  and  it  compared  very  favourably  with  other  commercially available agents. There  appears  to  be  an  effect  on  male  reproduction  that  is  permanent.  There  were  still  marked numbers of atrophic testicular tubules accompanied by minimal diffuse interstitial cell hyperplasia 8 and  19  weeks  after  dosing  was  stopped.  No  mature  spermatozoa  were  seen  in  rats  after  19  weeks recovery,  only  some  slight  reversibility  in  the  small  number  of  tubules  where  germinal  epithelium survived. The effects on male reproduction have not been considered of clinical concern because the effects were not noted in single dose toxicity studies, and the intended clinical application is for one use only. There is also a potential for serious adverse effects in foetal development. Increases in skeletal and visceral  variations,  some  delays  in  the  attainment  of  reflexes  and  increased  prevalence  of  postural limb anomalies and of cardiovascular malformations have been described in rats and rabbits following repeated exposure to gadoversetamide. The threshold of adverse effects for the foetus appears to be below a clearly toxic level for the mother. The proposed indication involves a single administration and  serious  reproductive  effects  would  not  be  anticipated,  nonetheless,  caution  in  the  use  of gadoversetamide in pregnant women is warranted and has been highlighted accordingly in the SPC.

IV: intravenous; CNS: central nervous system

## METHODS

## In vitro

The  in-vitro  studies  confirmed  the  absence  of  any  binding  of  the  product  to  plasma  proteins  and confirmed the blood compatibility of OptiMARK.

## In vivo

Validated analytical methods were used to measure gadoversetamide [liquid chromatography (HPLCUV) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)] and/or gadolinium [inductively-coupled  plasma-mass  spectrometry  (ICP-MS)  or  inductively-coupled  plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES)] in serum (or plasma) and urine of clinical studies.

## · Absorption

Medicinal product no longer authorised

No  biopharmaceutic  (bioavailability,  bioequivalence,  food  effect,  etc.)  studies  of  gadoversetamide were performed.

## · Distribution

At the 0.1 mmol/kg dose, the mean t1/2α in normal subjects calculated by the method of residuals in 12 normal volunteers (studies 489 and 538) is 13.3 ± 6.8 min.

Mean VDSS at the 0.1 mmol/kg dose in non-renally impaired patients (including both normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology) range from 158.7 ± 29.0 to 214.3 (range 116.4 to 295.0) mL/kg (studies 538 and 789, respectively). This volume of distribution (approximately 10-15 L for a body weight of 70 kg) is consistent with a drug that distributes into the extracellular fluid.

Gadoversetamide does not undergo protein binding in vitro.

In pregnant and lactating rats that received radiolabelled gadoversetamide, radioactivity was detected in the placenta, foetus and maternal milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Elimination

The t1/2 at the 0.1 mmol/kg dose range from 1.49 ± 0.15 hr in healthy volunteers (study 433) to 2.11 ± 0.62 hr in non-renally impaired patients (including normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology) (study 538).

The mean plasma clearance of OptiMARK in healthy subjects (111.0 ± 14.1 mL/min/1.73m 2 BSA) is not significantly different from the mean renal clearance (study 433). Similar results are obtained in all subjects of study 538 (including normal subjects and patients with various combinations of liver, CNS and renal dysfunctions) with renal clearance of OptiMARK being approximately 95% of the total plasma clearance.

OptiMARK is eliminated into the urine as the intact complex, as it is not metabolized in humans, with a mean of 95.5% eliminated within 24 hours

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

The pharmacokinetics of OptiMARK appear to be linear within the dose range (0.1 - 0.7 mmol/kg) studied.  Dose  level  has  no  consistent  effect  on  V DSS in  any  of  the  studies.  The  AUC 0-∞ is  dose proportional,  regardless  of  the  renal  status,  within  an  OptiMARK  dose  range  of  0.1-0.5  mmol/kg (study 489).

Statistical  analysis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  showed  no  significant  differences  (p&lt;0.05) between  the  4  gadolinium  chelates  OptiMARK,  Magnevist,  Omniscan  and  ProHance  for  the elimination t1/2, VDSS, AUC(0-t) and CLT.

· Special populations At each dose level examined, AUC0-∞ was increased 3- to 4-fold in the renally-impaired group versus the  non  renally-impaired  group.  The  effect  of  renal  impairment  on  V DSS appeared  to  increase  the volume slightly, by about 20-70 mL/kg. Total plasma clearance decreased by about 50 mL/hr/kg in the renally-impaired groups. The t1/2  ranged  from means of 7.8 to 8.9 hours in the renally-impaired groups. These 3- to 4-fold changes in clearance and half-life are consistent with the differences in AUC 0-∞ .  Renal  impairment  has  been  shown  to  delay  the  elimination  of  gadoversetamide  (mean elimination half-life of 7.83 ± 3.8 hours). The mean cumulative urinary excretion of gadoversetamide at 72 hours was approximately 93.5 % for renal impaired patients and 95.8% for subjects with normal renal function. The mean dialysis clearance of gadoversetamide, estimated from the recovery rate in dialysate was 93.2 ± 17.1 mL/min or 48% of the creatinine clearance (194 ± 18.6 mL/min). The AUC 0-∞ , a surrogate endpoint of systemic exposure, shows that exposure to OptiMARK increases significantly  with  age.  When  corrected  for  body  weight,  the  total body clearance of OptiMARK is greater in the 19 to 64 year age group (82.1 ± 16.8 mL/hr/kg) than that observed in the ≥ 65 year of age group (56.5 ± 9.7 mL/hr/kg). The t1/2 in the 19 to 64 is shorter than that observed in the ≥ 65 year of age group (1.9 ± 0.5 and 2.5± 0.5 hr -1 , respectively). No  effects  of  hepatic  impairment  neither  of  gender  on  pharmacokinetic  parameters  and  urinary recovery were observed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The AUC 0-∞ of the youngest subjects (2 to 11 year age group) is smaller than that observed in adults ≥ 65 year of age (114 ± 25.7 versus 285 ± 54.1 µ g x hr/mL). When corrected for body weight, the total body clearance of OptiMARK is greater in the 2 to 11 year age group (143 ± 27.9 mL/hr/kg) than that observed in the 12 to 18 year age group (117 ± 26.1 mL/hr/kg). When corrected for body surface area, the total body clearance of OptiMARK is similar for the 2 to 11 and 12 to 18 year age groups (3847 ± 879  and  4239  ±  719  mL/hr/m 2 , respectively)  but  is  greater  than  that  observed  in  the  two  adult populations  (3363  ±  664  and  2209  ±  268  mL/hr/m 2 in  the  19  to  64  and  ≥  65  year  of  age  groups, respectively). The VDSS in the 2 to 11 and 12 to 18 year age groups (216 ± 39.1 and 212 ± 36.2 mL/kg, respectively)  is  higher  than  that  observed  in  the  two  adult  populations  (175  ±  33.7  and  161  ±  8.4 mL/kg, respectively). The t1/2 in the 2 to 11 and 12 to 18 year age groups (1.4 ± 0.3 and 1.6± 0.3 hr -1 , respectively) is shorter than that observed in the two adult populations (1.9 ± 0.5 and 2.5± 0.5 hr -1 in the 19 to 64 and ≥ 65 year of age groups, respectively).

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No studies performed

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

The  purpose  of  a  gadolinium-containing  MRI  contrast  agent  is  to  induce  signal  intensity  changes within  a  lesion,  thereby  facilitating  its  recognition  from  the  surrounding  normal  structures.  This  is done by the use of the metal gadolinium which, due to its atomic structure, acts indirectly on the local magnetic environment to alter proton T1 relaxation times. The clinical utility of MRI contrast agents depends  on  both  the  relaxivity  of  the  agent  and  the  relative  concentrations  present  in  tissues  of interest at the time of imaging. Differing rates of contrast agent diffusion into and out of lesions and normal surrounding tissues significantly increases the ability to detect and characterize lesions.

## · Primary pharmacology

Study  789 compared  the  contrast-to-noise  time-intensity  curves  for  OptiMARK  among  three extracellular  gadolinium  chelates  currently  on  the  European  market:  Omniscan,  Magnevist  and ProHance.

Two pivotal phase 3 CNS studies (Study 488 and Study 525) and the two pivotal phase 3 liver studies (Study 490 and Study 526) were considered as supportive to the claimed indications and the results of the re-read are fully presented in the marketing authorisation application.

The four gadolinium chelates produced an increase in the contrast-to- noise ratio for the Regions of Interest (ROIs) measured in the abdominal aorta, liver parenchyma, portal vein, renal cortex and renal medulla. No statistically significant differences were detected among the four gadolinium chelates for the contrast-to-noise time-intensity curves parameters: Imax, Tmax, AUCtmax and AUCt, for the 5 ROIs except for some differences in the renal medulla ROIs. The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of Imax,  AUCtmax  and  AUCt,  comparing  OptiMARK  to  Magnevist,  all  fell  within  the  standard pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence  interval  of  80%  and  125%.  These  confidence  intervals  were  also within the proposed estimated Imaging Equivalence Interval with a few exceptions, which occurred in renal medullary ROIs. · Secondary pharmacology OptiMARK produces transient decreases in serum zinc and transient increases in urinary zinc (Study 489 shows an increased excretion of 8mg zinc at the 0.1 mmol/kg dose in the first 24 hrs post-dose). OptiMARK has no apparent effect on serum or urine iron levels (Study 489 demonstrated an increase in excretion of &lt; 0.3 mg more iron than placebo at the 0.5 mmol/kg dose) After  the  administration  of  OptiMARK  and  Omniscan,  serum  calcium  levels  did  not  change significantly  when  measured  by  the  ICP-MS  and  AZ-III  techniques.    However,  the  OCP  method reported transient decreases in calcium values immediately after injection of these two agents. None of the analytical methods used detected any significant change in serum calcium after the injection of Magnevist and ProHance. Clinical efficacy Medicinal product no longer authorised

Because the two pivotal phase 3 CNS studies and the two pivotal phase 3 liver studies were similar in terms of indication, study objectives, study design, efficacy endpoints and statistical analyses, the data is presented together.

## · Dose response studies

Four studies: 464 , 465 , 467 (phase 2) and 489 (phase 1) were conducted in patients with CNS/liver diseases utilizing more than one dose. The 3 phase 2 trials were similar in design and were conducted in 258 dosed patients to evaluate the dose-related safety, tolerance and efficacy of OptiMARK for use in MRI of the Brain (Study 464), Spine (Study 465), and Liver (Study 467). These trials utilized a cross-over, randomized, double-blind design evaluating two of the following OptiMARK doses 0.1, 0.2,  0.3,  0.4,  or  0.5  mmol/kg.  The  results  from  these  studies  demonstrated  safety  and  efficacy  of OptiMARK at the dose of 0.1 mmol/kg and were used to design the pivotal phase 3 Brain/Spine and Liver clinical studies.

All non-clinical data indicated that the in vitro and in vivo behaviour of OptiMARK was the same as Magnevist for which the recommended standard dose is 0.1 mmol/kg.

Several studies published in the literature also support a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium as being an efficacious dose. Gadodiamide (Omniscan), another gadolinium chelate was approved by FDA at a dosage of 0.1 mmol/kg. This dosage was also prescribed on the basis of non-clinical imaging studies showing safety of this dose and comparable published studies of Gd-DTPA (Magnevist), taking into account that the relaxivity of the two compounds was the same.

· Main studies Four  pivotal  studies  were  conducted  in  patients  with  known  or  highly  suspected  CNS  pathology ( Studies  525  and  488 )  and  liver  pathology  ( Studies  526  and  490 ).  These  were  presented  in  the original MAA in 1998 that was subsequently withdrawn. After consultation with CHMP through a scientific  advice  application  in  2005,  the  Company  proposed  the  creation  of  a  new,  independent database, to be accomplished by subjecting the original images of the phase 3 pivotal studies to a new and complete blinded re-read. Accordingly these studies were re-submitted. METHODS Study Participants The pivotal  studies  were  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomized,  parallel  group,  single-dose  studies comparing the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of OptiMARK and Magnevist. Adult male and female subjects  who were at least 18 years of age with known or highly suspected CNS (Studies 525 and 488) or liver pathology (Studies 526 and 490) were eligible. A  total  of  813  subjects  were  enrolled,  804  were  randomised,  467  received  OptiMARK  and  337 received Magnevist at the 0.1 mmol/kg dose level. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the demographics between the treatment groups. Treatments Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Subjects for these studies received either 0.1mmol/kg of OptiMARK or Magnevist, hand-administered by intravenous bolus injection.

All patients were scanned on a commercially available MRI device. In patients with CNS pathology, the following sequences were acquired prior to contrast agent administration:

- patients scheduled for an intracranial MRI examination received T1-weighted (short TR, short TE), T2-weighted (long TR, long TE) and Proton Density (long TR, short TE) images using imaging parameters and an imaging plane determined by the principal investigator.
- patients scheduled for a spinal MRI examination received T1-weighted Spin Echo and T2-weighted  Spin  Echo  images  using  imaging  parameters  and  an  imaging  plane determined by the principal investigator.

Post-contrast images after OptiMARK or Magnevist administration were a repeat of the pre-contrast T1-weighted  sequence  using  the  same  imaging  plane  and  same  acquisition  parameters  in  order  to obtain identical sets of pre and post-contrast images for direct comparison.

In  patients  with  liver  pathology  the  following  sequences  were  acquired  prior  to  contrast  agent administration: T1-weighted Spoiled Gradient Echo images and T2-weighted Fast/Turbo Spin Echo or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

conventional Spin Echo images covering the entire liver in the axial plane using sequence parameters determined by the principal investigator.

Post-contrast  images  after  contrast  agent  administration  were  T1-weighted  Spoiled  Gradient  Echo using the same imaging plane and same acquisition parameters as pre-contrast series in order to obtain identical  sets  of  pre  and  post-contrast  images  for  direct  comparison.  Post-contrast  images  were acquired  at  the  following  times  in  order  to  capture  the  arterial,  venous  portal  and  equilibrium (delayed) phases:

- -15-25 seconds after the initiation of the bolus injection (arterial phase),
- -55-65 seconds after the initiation of the bolus injection (portal phase),
- -and, ~5 minutes after the initiation of the bolus injection (delayed phase).

In the liver studies all patients were scanned using a 1.5 Tesla MR unit.

In  the  CNS studies the majority of patients (312/389, 80.2%) were scanned using a 1.5 Tesla MRI unit. The remainder were scanned using field strengths less than 1.5 Tesla (range 0.3 to 1.0 Tesla). The  proportion  of  patients  imaged  at  field  strengths  less  than  1.5  Tesla  were  the  same  for  both contrast agents.

## Objectives

Primary  objective was  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  OptiMARK  versus  Magnevist  as assessed by the change in contrast score between pre and post-contrast images. The primary efficacy endpoint was a contrast score taking into account lesion delineation, lesion conspicuity and contrast enhancement.  Contrast  score  is  assessed  using  a  4-point  rating  scale  where  grade  0  =  no  contrast, grade 1 = equivocal, grade 2 = good, and grade 3 = excellent. Secondary  objectives were  to  compare  OptiMARK  and  Magnevist  with  respect  to  the  following secondary efficacy radiological endpoints: o Change in contrast scores as assessed from pre to pre+post-contrast images o Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy o Assessability to characterize a lesion o Quantitative assessment of contrast enhancement on pre and post-contrast images o Relative variation of signal intensity measurement at lesion level o Qualitative assessment of contrast enhancement o Change in the total number of detected lesions as assessed on pre and pre+post-contrast images o Adequacy of images for a first diagnosis based on T1 weighted sequences o Change in first diagnosis confidence score as assessed from pre to post-contrast images. o Adequacy of images for an overall diagnosis based on all imaging sequences For each treatment group and for all treatment groups combined, a comparison between pre and postcontrast images was also performed for the contrast score.

Inter-  and  intra-reader  variability  for  the  contrast  score  and  the  overall  diagnosis  and  intra-reader variability for signal intensity measurements were also assessed.

The  radiological  variables  were  assessed  at  three  different  levels:  imaging  sequence,  lesion  and patient level. From these primarily assessed variables, derived variables such as contrast difference scores, sensitivity, specificity, etc. were computed.

## Assessments at imaging sequence level

For each reading (pre, pre+post, post) and for each imaging sequence, evaluation of technical quality of  images  was  performed by the blinded readers with respect to (1) Image quality: (1 = poor; 2 = fair;3  =  good),  (2)  Assessability  of  images:  (yes/no  question),  (3)  presence  of  significant  artifacts: Yes/No question.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessments at lesion level

For each reading (pre, pre+post, post), the blinded reader was asked to score and record a maximum of 3 clinically significant lesions on T1 sequences only. For each lesion, the following attributes were assessed:  (1) T1 sequence phase on which the contrast score is the highest (for liver studies only), (2) contrast score, (3) lesion characterization, (4) signal intensity measurements,  (5) qualitative assessment  of  contrast  enhancement,  (6)  first  diagnosis  confidence,  (7)  lesion  location,  (8)  lesion aspect, (9) lesion size (for liver studies only)

## Assessments at patient level

For each reading (pre, pre+post, post) and considering all imaging sequences together [T1, T2 and PD (for  CNS only)], the following attributes were assessed: (1) overall diagnosis, (2) overall diagnosis confidence, (3) final characterization of the patient, (4) final diagnosis: harmonized by the expert of concordance based on the final diagnosis documented in the investigator's CRF and (5) total number of detected lesions in CNS or liver studies recorded by the blinded reader.

## Sample size

Power simulations were carried out to verify that a correct inference could be drawn from the new reading protocol and the new objective of non-inferiority. These Monte Carlo simulations also tested the proposed ANOVA model performances on the change in contrast score, given the actual sample size, (using several distributions for the change in contrast score). Monte Carlo simulations were performed on study 525 and on data pooled from CNS studies (525 and 488)  as  these  studies  exhibited  the  greatest  disparity  in  patient  numbers  between  the  two  contrast agents and therefore would be the least powered studies. Simulations results showed that for a possible expected difference of -0.35 and with ∆ = -0.50, the non-inferiority  test  power  remains  acceptable  (&gt;  80%).  For  the  smallest  study  (study  525),  power points below 80% correspond to distribution types that are not expected (Exponential increasing and Bimodal). For greater sizes, the power remained constantly above 80%. The ANOVA model appeared to have a satisfactory robustness for expected distribution types. Blinding (masking) An  independent  CRO  conducted  the  re-reading  of  all  the  MR  images  according  to  a  blinded centralized reading protocol. Three independent and blinded readers re-read each of the 4 studies (12 readers in all), allowing for assessment of reader variability. After completion of the blinded reading, a fourth independent expert for each study (called expert of concordance) performed a concordance assessment.  Blinded  readers  and  experts  of  concordance  were  selected  based  on  their  professional expertise  (board-certified  radiologists)  and  training  in  CNS  or  liver  MR  imaging.  To  ensure standardization of reading, the readers attended a joint training session using cases coming from the previous phase 2 studies. The readers then independently read a validation set where only the main endpoints (contrast score and overall diagnosis) were assessed. When validation results were judged to be satisfactory, readers were allowed to start the readings. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Statistical methods

The pre- to post-injection change in contrast score will be used as the primary endpoint in the noninferiority analysis.

Linear  mixed  models  analysis of variance with repeated measures will be performed on the pre to post-injection  change  in  contrast  score.    Fixed  effects  are  treatment,  reader  and  treatment  x  reader interaction; patient effects are treated as random. The pre-injection contrast score was included in the model as a covariate in case of a strong correlation between with change and pre-treatment contrast score. A one-sided lower 97.5% confidence bound was calculated on the difference in change from baseline between OptiMARK and Magnevist.

Main secondary efficacy analyses concerned a comparison of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy.  The  statistical  analyses  will  use  a  generalized,  linear  mixed  model  approach  that accommodates  repeated  correlated  measurements  on  a  binary  endpoint  and  will  incorporate  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

binomial probability error distribution with the log it link function. This approach allows a unified and comprehensive analysis of diagnostic and diagnostic accuracy scores from all readers simultaneously.

The non-inferiority margin of Δ = - 0.50 is supported by data from the Summary Basis of Approval for  Magnevist  indicating  that  the  mean  difference  between  Magnevist  and  Placebo  in  pre-  to  postinjection Contrast Scores was between 1.00 and 1.34 which is one-half of 0.5 points.

## RESULTS

## CNS studies

## Participant flow

Due to the role of the different imaging sequences in the assessment of the radiological parameters, two intent-to-treat (ITT) populations were defined for the re-read:

The ITT1 set was defined as patients who have received treatment after randomization with a MRI exam performed, and having at least the T1 pre-contrast sequence available for the reading. The ITT2 set was defined as a sub-set of ITT1 patients having T2 sequence available for the reading.

A per protocol (PP) population was defined as ITT1 patients for whom no major protocol deviation to the imaging protocol has been identified (PP1). No PP2 population was defined.

A  first  list  of  major  deviations  to  the  imaging  protocol  included  a  T1  post-contrast  sequence  not available  for  the  reading  andT1  post-contrast  sequence  available  for  the  reading  but  not  acquired according to the imaging protocol.

## Conduct of the study

One patient presented a major deviation to the imaging protocol as the T1 post-contrast sequence was not acquired according to the imaging protocol.

## Baseline data

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  the demographic characteristics age, sex, race, height, weight and BSA.

## Numbers analysed

A  total  of  403  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  2  CNS  studies;  265  were  randomized  to  receive OptiMARK and 136 were randomized to receive Magnevist. In each treatment group, 3 patients were withdrawn prior to dosing. A total of 395 patients were dosed and included in the combined re-read population.

## Outcomes and estimation

The Primary Efficacy Endpoint, the mean difference in change in contrast score as assessed from pre to post-contrast images between OptiMARK and Magnevist was -0.018 ± 0.061. The lower bound of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  two-sided  95%  CI  (-0.14)  for  this  difference  was  superior  to  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority margin (Δ = -0.5).

There  was  no  significant  treatment-by-reader  interaction  effect  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint. There was a significant reader effect ♦ (p&lt;0.0001). Results are summarized in the following table.

Analysis on the ITT1 population with the sub-set of lesions with qualitative contrast enhancement ♦ : The mean difference in change in contrast score as assessed from pre to post-contrast images between OptiMARK and Magnevist was -0.003 ± 0.089. The lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI (-0.18) for this difference was superior to the predefined non-inferiority margin (Δ=- 0.5). Therefore, it can be concluded that OptiMARK is not inferior to Magnevist with respect to the change in contrast score in the sub-set of lesions.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

Comparable results  were  observed  for  both  OptiMARK  and  Magnevist in  any  of  the  measured secondary endpoints except in assessability to characterize a lesion (on pre+post-contrast images; p=0.018, but not observed on the post-contrast images).

There was a significant reading effect (i.e. difference between pre and post contrast) on sensitivity (patient  characterization 1 and  diagnosis 2 )  specificity  and  accuracy  (patient  characterization)  as shown in the following tables.

Regarding  the  nature  of  the  first  diagnosis  (grouped  by  diagnosis  classes),  the  percentage  of  nonspecific lesions tended to decrease in both treatment groups from pre (23.5% and 24.1%) to pre+post (15.1%  and  14.8%)  and  post-contrast  images  (16.1%  and  18.6%)  in  OptiMARK  and  Magnevist group, respectively for all readers combined.

A significant reader effect was noted on the following secondary endpoints: change in contrast score as  assessed  from  pre  to  pre+post  contrast  images,  sensitivity  and  specificity  for  both  patient characterization  and  diagnosis,  accuracy  for  patient  diagnosis,  change  in  first  diagnosis  confidence score as assessed from pre to post-contrast images, and change in overall diagnosis confidence score as assessed from pre to pre+post-contrast images.

For  both  studies,  inter-reader  variability  for  contrast  scores  ranged  from  37.4%  to  65.5%  (kappa ranging  from  0.059  -  0.654).  While  inter-reader  variability  for  the  overall  diagnosis  ranged  from 60.6% 70.7% (kappa: 0.536 - 0.64).

For both studies, intra-reader variability among repetitions for the contrast scores ranged from 64.0 % to 93.1% (kappa ranging from 0.567-0.919).

## Liver studies

## Participant flow

The efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT1, PP1 and ITT2 populations (see CNS studies). One patient was excluded from the ITT1 and ITT2 populations because no T1 pre-contrast images were available.  Ten  patients  were  excluded  from  the  PP1  population:  6  patients  because  they  did  not receive  the  correct  dose  of  contrast  agent,  2  patients  because  the  T1  post-contrast  sequences  were incomplete, 1 patient because T1 sequences were not acquired according to the imaging protocol and 1  patient  because  the  T1  pre-contrast  images  were  not  available  (corresponding  to  the  patient excluded from the ITT1 and ITT2 populations).

## Conduct of the study

Among the patients included in the ITT1 population, nine patients presented a major deviation to the imaging protocol. Six patients did not receive the correct dose of contrast agent, two patients had the T1 post-contrast  sequences  not  acquired  according  to  the  imaging  protocol  and  one  patient  had  an incomplete set of post-contrast T1 sequences acquired

## · Clinical studies in paediatric populations

Study 552 was an open-label, single-centre, phase 1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of  OptiMARK  in  seventeen  healthy  paediatric  subjects  (2-18  years),  dosed  with  0.1  mmol/kg OptiMARK and followed up for 72 hours.

Study 597 was an open-label, single-dose phase 4, multicentre (n = 10) study conducted in the USA. The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety,  efficacy,  and  pharmacokinetic  profile  of OptiMARK in paediatric patients referred for MRI of the liver or CNS.  Patients were stratified by age to one of two groups (2 to 11 and 12 to 18 years of age) and all patients were to receive a single intravenous injection of OptiMARK at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. A total of 100 patients were dosed. Serial blood and pooled urine samples were collected from a subgroup of 30 patients (17 patients 2 thru 11 years of age and 13 patients 12 thru 18 years of age) for pharmacokinetic analysis.

The primary efficacy endpoints included the degree of Confidence in Diagnosis (CD) and Level of Conspicuity (LC) for lesion visualisation as determined by the investigator and independent blinded readers. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were also analysed as primary efficacy endpoints.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included the overall differences between the pre- and post-contrast Gray Scale  Pixel  (GSP)  statistics  for  each  lesion,  the  Receiver  Operating  Characteristic  (ROC)  used  to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging test, and the ability to characterise the lesion area from parenchyma/structures based on both pre-contrast and combined pre-contrast and post-contrast images scored.

The  4  pivotal  studies  shared  the  same  design,  being  multi-centre,  randomized,  double-blind,  noninferiority  studies  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerance,  and  efficacy  of  OptiMARK  compared  to Magnevist  in CNS  or  liver lesion. No  major  differences in patient demographics  or  basic characteristics were noted.

Additional secondary efficacy analyses included an assessment by the Principal Investigator on the changes in Confidence in Diagnosis (CD) and Level of Conspicuity (LC) for lesion visualization in the presence and absence of OptiMARK. Efficacy  results  demonstrated  that  the  administration  of  OptiMARK  significantly  increased  the accuracy and sensitivity for blinded reviewers to detect the presence of a CNS lesion in the paediatric population of 2 through 18 years of age and significantly increased the level of lesion conspicuity, and confidence in diagnosis. The Post-T1 images showed a significant increase in the intensity and the variability of the grey scale measurements for the lesion core. In addition, OptiMARK produced an increase in the intensity of the parenchyma grey scale signal but not the variability. Injection of OptiMARK caused no statistically significant  change in the cross sectional area of the measured lesions. ROC curve analysis showed that  the  administration  of  OptiMARK  significantly  increased  lesion  conspicuity  and  increased accuracy for making a correct diagnosis. The same analysis showed that OptiMARK had little effect on confidence in diagnosis when evaluated under totally blinded conditions. · Discussion on clinical efficacy The currently presented studies are re-reads of the original studies following the scientific advice of the CHMP in 2005. Two studies support the CNS indication (488 and 525) and 2 studies the liver indication (490 and 526). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  the  two  pivotal  CNS  studies  the  Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint,  the  mean  difference  in  change  in contrast score as assessed from pre to post-contrast images between OptiMARK and Magnevist was 0.018 ± 0.061. The lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI (-0.14) for this difference was superior to the  pre-defined  non-inferiority  margin  (Δ  =  -0.5)  demonstrating  that  OptiMARK  is  not  inferior  to Magnevist with respect to the change in contrast score

In the two pivotal liver studies the mean difference in change in contrast score as assessed from pre to post-contrast images between OptiMARK and Magnevist was 0.013 ± 0.049. The lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI (-0.08) for this difference was superior to the pre-defined non-inferiority margin (Δ=- 0.5), demonstrating that OptiMARK is not inferior to Magnevist with respect to the change in contrast score as assessed from pre to post-contrast images.

Analysis  of  multiple  secondary  endpoints  like  sensitivity,  specificity  and  accuracy  showed  a comparable performance between OptiMARK and Magnevist.

## Clinical safety

All  of  the  twenty-six  studies  included  in  the  clinical  development  program  of  OptiMARK  are included in the Summary of Clinical Safety of the present application. Seven of these studies were performed since the initial MAA was withdrawn in 1999 due to CPMP concerns - 4 Phase 2 studies and 3 Phase 4 studies. Of the 26 studies, 4 were pharmacokinetic studies, 1 was a pharmacodynamic study, 4 evaluated efficacy and safety in subjects with CNS and liver pathology, 15 were designed to evaluate  safety,  1  was  a  safety  and  pharmacokinetic  study  and  1  evaluated  safety,  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics.

## · Patient exposure

In the clinical development program, a total of 2752 injections of OptiMARK were administered in 2398 subjects, 137 subjects were exposed to placebo, and 475 subjects were exposed to three other gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents used as active comparators (Magnevist, Omniscan, and ProHance). The demographics of the studied population are summarized in the following table.

SD = standard deviation

OptiMARK was administered in all 26 studies. Placebo (saline) was administered in Studies 433, 489, 716, and 717. Studies with active comparators were: Magnevist (Studies 488, 490, 525, 526, 555, 716, and 789); ProHance and Omniscan (Study 789), 789), which was a crossover study. Therefore, the 26 subjects who received ProHance are the same 26 subjects who received  Omniscan.  Each  of  those  26  subjects  also  received  Magnevist  in  the  study  and  are  included  in  the  Magnevist treatment group. Magnevist was also administered in Studies 488, 490, 525, 526, 555, and 716.

In the Phase 3 pivotal studies, a total of 262 subjects with CNS indications and 199 subjects with liver indications received OptiMARK. All studies investigating other indications, safety, and pharmacokinetics,  although  not  pertinent  to  the  CNS  or  liver  indication  are  also  included  for  the global safety assessment of OptiMARK.

## · Adverse events

Among the 3364 subjects who participated in all phases of the clinical development of OptiMARK, the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  comparable  in  subjects  receiving  OptiMARK  (757/2752,  27.5%) compared with 30.1% (143/475) in the active comparator group, and 36.5% (50/137) in subjects who received placebo. Overall, more females had AEs than did males (34.3% compared with 23.0%) and each of the common AEs was reported by more females than males with the exception of dizziness. The proportion of subjects with any AE was similar for both white and non-white racial subgroups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(26.9% for non-whites compared with 28.4% for whites). Overall, no trend was observed with respect to race for any AE.

The most common AE in the combined OptiMARK group were headache (5.5%), dysgeusia (4.0%), feeling hot (3.9%), dizziness (2.4%), nausea (2.0%), and diarrhoea (1.2%). Only 1 of these, feeling hot,  occurred  more  often  in  subjects  treated  with  OptiMARK  versus  placebo.  Other  commonly reported AEs occurred at a similar frequency in the OptiMARK versus the comparator group.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Eighteen  subjects  experienced  serious  adverse  events  while  enrolled  in  an  OptiMARK  clinical studies.  All  serious  adverse  events  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  the administration of the study drug except one case. There was no evidence of an increase in serious adverse events in any body system or of a relationship to dose.

Mean changes between baseline and all post-baseline values were small for most urinalysis laboratory parameters, and were comparable in the All OptiMARK Combined, placebo, and Magnevist groups, with  the  exception  of  zinc  levels,  which  increased  shortly  after  the  injection  for  those  subjects receiving OptiMARK, and returned to the normal range by 48 hours.

The reported case of serious AE was case of anaphylactic reaction in a female patient administered 0.1  mmol/kg  OptiMARK.  The  patient  was  known  to  have  a  prior  adverse  reaction  to  iodinated contrast agent, but had never received gadolinium contrast agents for a MRI. The patient recovered after treatment. One death occurred during the clinical studies of OptiMARK. A 45 years old AIDS patient receiving a single dose of OptiMARK 0.1 mmol/kg, died within 3 days of study participation. The Investigator did not consider the death related to OptiMARK and the FDA was notified. In addition, the Sponsor was notified of the deaths of 7 subjects subsequent to their participation in the OptiMARK clinical development program. None of the deaths of subjects exposed to OptiMARK occurred within less than 1weeks from study participation, and none was considered related to study drug. · Laboratory findings Mean changes between baseline and all post-baseline values were small for most haematology and clinical  chemistry  laboratory  parameters,  and  were  comparable  in  the  'All  OptiMARK  Combined', placebo, and Magnevist groups. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC-AA)  increased for the OptiMARK-treated  subjects  after  the  injection,  but  returned  to  close  to  baseline  values  within 24 hours of the injection. Serum zinc values decreased after injection, returning to the normal range by 24 hours post-injection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No clinically significant changes were noted for either of the target patient populations with CNS or liver pathology.

No clinically significant trends or changes in vital signs occurred by treatment group or dose group.

No  clinically  significant  trends  or  changes  in  ECG  measurements  occurred  by  treatment  or  dose group.

## · Safety in special populations

No trend was observed with respect to race for any AE.

With  respect  to  AEs  reported  for  &gt; 1%  of  subjects  of  either  sex    who  received  OptiMARK 0.1 mmol/kg  in  any  study,  overall,  more  females  had  AEs  than  did  males  (34.3%  compared  with 23.0%, respectively, a difference of approximately 10% overall).

Among the 3 adult subgroups, the proportions of subjects reporting each common AE were similar, and none of the AEs appeared to increase with increasing age.  The AE profile for the youngest age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subgroup appears to be qualitatively different. No subject in the youngest age subgroup experienced headache, dysgeusia, dizziness, or feeling hot, which were 4 of the 5 most commonly reported AEs for the adults.  The incidences of nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, injection site reaction, and prolonged electrocardiogram QT were similar among all the age subgroups.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug interactions with other contrast agents or other drugs were not studied.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Discontinuations for adverse events were reported for 3 subjects (2 OptiMARK, 1 Magnevist) who received at least 1 dose of study drug that were either unrelated or unlikely to have been related to the study drug.  In addition, 12 subjects were identified in review of final clinical study reports to have discontinued  prior  to  receiving  treatment.  Investigators  assessed  each  of  these  adverse  events  as unrelated to study drug.

## · Post marketing experience

A post-marketing safety report for the period from the launch of OptiMARK in the year 2000 (United States) to 31 December 2005 was provided in the current application. Furthermore, additional postmarketing safety data covering the period until December 2006 have been submitted. As of December 2006,  more  than  4.4  million  doses  of  OptiMARK  have  been  administered  to  patients,  worldwide. OptiMARK is distributed  in  containers  for  single  use.    Hence,  it  is  estimated  that  on  average  the number of units sold throughout the report period equals the number of exposed subjects.

The recorded increase in QTc from baseline was between 5 and 15 msec using the 0.2 mmol/kg and 0.5  mmol/kg  at  2  hours  and  immediately  post  injection  respectively.  No  cases  of  ventricular arrhythmias were recorded using OptiMARK. These changes do not warrant concern regarding the effect of OptiMARK on QTc.

· Discussion on clinical safety Among the 3364 subjects who participated in all phases of the clinical development of OptiMARK, the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  comparable  in  subjects  receiving  OptiMARK  (27.5%)  the  active comparator  group  (Magnevist,  Omniscan,  and  ProHance)  (30.1%),  and  36.5%  in  subjects  who received placebo. The most common AE in the combined OptiMARK group were headache (5.5%), dysgeusia (4.0%), feeling hot (3.9%), dizziness (2.4%), nausea (2.0%), and diarrhoea (1.2%). %). The reported AE are conforming to that known of similar gadolinium chelate diagnostic agents and these AE are reflected in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC.  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  increased  in  a  dose-related  manner in the OptiMARK treatment groups, but higher doses of OptiMARK were not associated with an increase in the severity of AEs. A special paediatric study was conducted in patients between 2 and 18 years and revealed no special AEs. All  serious  adverse  events  were  considered  to  be  unrelated  to  the  administration  of  the  study  drug except one case of anaphylaxis. The possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis is documented in the SPC. Eight deaths were reported, but none was considered related to OptiMARK. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Important identified risks are the use of gadolinium in patients with kidney failure. Acute renal failure was reported  after  administration  of  gadolinium-based  contrast  agents  in  patients  with  moderate  to severe  chronic  renal  failure.  Risk  factors  for  ARF  after  gadolinium  toxicity  include  diabetic nephropathy and low GFR (Ergun et al., 2006 et al).

Important missing safety information is about gadolinium-containing contrast agents and Nephrogenic Systemic  Fibrosis  or  Nephrogenic  Fibrosing  Dermopathy  (NSF/NFD)  that  occurs  in  patients  with renal failure.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no  unresolved  quality  issues,  which  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Benefit  Risk  balance  of  the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The primary pharmacodynamic effect of OptiMARK, a gadolinium chelate based MRI contrast agent, has been demonstrated by its effect on tissue proton relaxation times (T1 and T2) and impact on the clarity of the MRI image. Gadolinium chelates have already shown their therapeutic efficiency in the field of MRI. Pharmacodynamic studies presented have shown that the imaging effects of OptiMARK and Magnevist (a standard gadolinium chelate available in the market) are quantitatively equivalent. The safety pharmacology studies clearly set out that effects on the QT interval are unlikely to occur. The effects of OptiMARK and other agents were mimicked by comparable increases in osmolarity produced by mannitol. These results suggest that OptiMARK caused prolongation of cardiac action potentials largely as a result of hypertonicity rather than specific ion-channel interactions. These in vitro effects were observed only at the highest concentration, which was at least 100x the maximum plasma concentration that would be achieved under conditions of clinical use. No significant effect on QT interval  was  noted  either  in  the in  vivo safety  pharmacology studies that  used  of  10x  doses  in excess in the proposed clinical use.

Gadoversetamide,  the  active  active  substance  in  OptiMARK,  appears  to  have  an  appropriate pharmacokinetic profile for its intended application as an extracellular magnetic resonance contrast agent.  Gadoversetamide  distributes  between  plasma  and  interstitial  fluid,  does  not  penetrate  the blood-brain  barrier,  undergoes  minimal  passage  of  the  placental  barrier  and  is  rapidly  excreted  in urine in unchanged form. It is known that the clearance of gadolinium-derivatives is highly delayed in patients with renal insufficiency therefore excretion might be a problem in this type of patients. A low residual level of radioactivity (~ 0.2-0.3 % of the injected dose) in the rat skeleton was found to be constant over a 4-7 day interval after administration of Gd 153 OptiMARK. Data for these studies were consistent with published reports showing residual radioactivity in the bones of rodents, days after  administration  of  a  single  dose  of  Gd 153 labelled  commercial  products.  The  absence  of toxicological effects on bone makes this issue a minor concern. No pharmacokinetic studies were carried out after repeated administration. Although the product is intended for single use only, data on repeated administration might be useful to support repeated dose toxicity studies. Studies  with  OptiMARK  did  not  elicit  classical  signs  of  single-dose  gadolinium  toxicity.    There appears to be an effect on male reproduction that is permanent. There were still marked numbers of atrophic  testicular  tubules  accompanied  by  minimal  diffuse  interstitial  cell  hyperplasia  8  and  19 weeks after dosing was stopped. No mature spermatozoa were seen in rats after 19 weeks recovery, only some slight reversibility in the small number of tubules where germinal epithelium survived. The effects on male reproduction have not been considered of clinical concern because the effects were not noted in single dose toxicity studies, and the intended clinical application is for one use only.

There is also a potential for serious adverse effects in foetal development. Increases in skeletal and visceral  variations,  some  delays  in  the  attainment  of  reflexes  and  increased  prevalence  of  postural limb anomalies and of cardiovascular malformations have been described in rats and rabbits following repeated exposure to gadoversetamide. The threshold of adverse effects for the foetus appears to be below a clearly toxic level for the mother. The proposed indication involves a single administration and  serious  reproductive  effects  would  not  be  anticipated,  nonetheless,  caution  in  the  use  of gadoversetamide in pregnant women is warranted and has been highlighted accordingly in the SPC.

## Efficacy

The  currently  presented  studies  are  a  re-evaluation  of  the  original  studies  following  the  scientific advice of the CHMP in 2005. Two studies support the CNS indication (study 488 and 525) and 2 studies the liver indication (study 490 and 526).

The  4  pivotal  studies  shared  the  same  design  of  being:  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind, non-inferiority  studies  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerance,  and  efficacy  of  OptiMARK  compared  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Magnevist  in  CNS  or  liver  lesion.  The  primary  endpoint  was  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of OptiMARK  versus  Magnevist  as  assessed  by  the  change  in  contrast  score  between  pre  and post-contrast images in CNS and liver studies.

The results of the individual studies as well as the pooled results show that the pre-defined primary endpoint of the non-inferiority of OptiMARK versus Magnevist with respect to the change in contrast score  from  pre-  to  post-contrast  images  was  achieved.  Analysis  of  multiple  secondary  endpoints endpoints including sensitivity, specificity and accuracy showed a comparable performance between OptiMARK and Magnevist.

## Safety

The most common AE in the combined OptiMARK group were headache (5.5%), dysgeusia (4.0%), feeling hot (3.9%), dizziness (2.4%), nausea (2.0%), and diarrhoea (1.2%). %). The reported AE are conforming to that known of similar gadolinium chelate diagnostic agents and these AE are reflected in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC.  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  increased  in  a  dose-related  manner in the OptiMARK treatment groups, but higher doses of OptiMARK were not associated with an increase in the severity of AEs. A special paediatric study was conducted in patients between 2 and 18 years and revealed no special AEs.

All  serious  adverse  events  were  considered  to  be  unrelated  to  the  administration  of  the  study  drug except one case of anaphylaxis. The possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis is documented in the SPC. Eight deaths were reported, but none was considered related to OptiMARK.

Important identified risks are the use of gadolinium in patients with kidney failure. Acute renal failure was reported  after  administration  of  gadolinium-based  contrast  agents  in  patients  with  moderate  to severe  chronic  renal  failure.  Risk  factors  for  ARF  after  gadolinium  toxicity  include  diabetic nephropathy and low GFR (Ergun et al., 2006 et al).

Important missing safety information is about gadolinium-containing contrast agents and Nephrogenic Systemic  Fibrosis  or  Nephrogenic  Fibrosing  Dermopathy  (NSF/NFD)  that  occurs  in  patients  with renal failure.

Post-marketing experience did not reveal any new AE but was consistent with that reported with other gadolinium-based contrast agents.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## · User consultation

An appropriate test was conducted on behalf of the Applicant to assess the readability and usability of the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for OptiMARK 500 micromol/ml solution for injection in line with EU directive 2004/27/EC.

The PIL is regarded as having successfully passed the test with 90% of the subjects achieving greater than 90% correct answers in rounds 2 and 3, following amendments after round 1.

The final PIL (page 40 of the Readability testing document) is, therefore, acceptable for consideration for opinion.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Results  of  the  four  pivotal  studies  as  well  as  the  pooled  results  show  that  the  pre-defined  primary endpoint of the non-inferiority of OptiMARK versus Magnevist with respect to the change in contrast score  from  pre-  to  post-contrast  images  was  achieved.  Analysis  of  multiple  secondary  endpoints endpoints  like  sensitivity,  specificity  and  accuracy  showed  a  comparable  performance  between OptiMARK and Magnevist. Overall the administration of OptiMARK is safe. Taking the safe use and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the evidence of demonstrated non-inferiority to Magnevist  into account, the risk-benefit of OptiMARK in the claimed indication is positive.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

It should be emphasized that the chosen primary endpoints were measures of technical performance. According  to  the  Ptc  Diagnostic  Agents  CPMP/EWP/1119/98  the  primary  endpoints  of  efficacy should be measures of diagnostic performance. Future studies investigating similar products should be designed accordingly.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of OptiMARK in the diagnosis of focal lesions and abnormal structures in the CNS and liver in patients with known or highly suspected pathology was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
