## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and high premature  mortality.  Lumacaftor/ivacaftor  (LUM/IVA;  VX-809/VX-770;  Orkambi™)  is  a  medicine designed  to  treat  the  underlying  molecular  defect  and  enhance  the  function  of  CFTR  in  patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation (F/F) as young as 2 years of age.

CF greatly affects the paediatric population, as nearly half of the total CF population is less than 18 years of age. Even before the widespread adoption of newborn screening, the majority of patients with CF  were  diagnosed  in  infancy  or  early  childhood  due  to  manifestations  of  the  disease.  Pancreatic destruction  leading  to  pancreatic  exocrine  insufficiency  begins  in  utero,  and  lung  involvement  is manifest by pulmonary inflammation and infection that begins shortly after birth.

The MAH submitted a final report for Study 121.

## Clinical study number and title

## Description

Study 121, an exploratory Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study designed to explore the impact of LUM/IVA on disease progression in subjects aged 2 through 5 years with Cystic fibrosis (CF), homozygous for F508del.

The present study was designed to explore the long-term disease progression and efficacy of LUM/IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, homozygous for F508del in a placebo-controlled setting, with a window of opportunity to halt disease progression and prevent organ damage by early intervention with  therapies  that  treat  the  underlying  cause  of  CF.  The  impact  of  LUM/IVA  on  lung  function  was explored using 2 methods:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 1) thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an imaging assessment used to determine structural and functional lung abnormalities and to monitor disease progression and
- 2) LCI, a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity that is based on tidal breathing techniques that have been evaluated in patients as young as infants.

The long-term data are aimed to provide information about disease progression and the potential for disease  modification  by  early  CFTR-targeted  intervention  and  to  support  the  efficacy  and  safety  of LUM/IVA in this younger CF population.

## Methods

ETT : Early Termination of Treatment; LUM/IVA: lumacaftor/ivacaftor; Pbo: placebo; q12h: every 12 hours

- a The  Safety  Follow-up  Visit  was  scheduled  to  occur  2  weeks  ( ± 4  days)  after  the  last  dose,  as  described  in  Appendix 16.1.1/Protocol Version 4.0/Section 9.1.3.

b In Part 1, approximately 50 subjects were planned to be randomized (2:1) to receive LUM/IVA or placebo.

Subjects received LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg q12h (subjects weighing &lt;14 kg at screening), LUM 150 mg/IVA 188 mg q12h (subjects weighing ≥ 14 kg at screening), or matching placebo, regardless of age. In Part 2, subjects &lt;6 years of age and weighing &lt;14 kg received LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg q12h; subjects &lt;6 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 kg received LUM 150 mg/IVA 188 mg q12h; and subjects ≥ 6 years of age received LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h.

- c No downward dose adjustments were made if a subject ' s weight decreased. Doses may have been adjusted upward for changes in weight and age, as described in Appendix 16.1.1/Protocol Version 4.0/Section 9.6.

d Subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug had an ETT Visit as soon as possible.

## Treatments

## Dose of LUM/IVA

Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive LUM/IVA or placebo. The dose regimens of LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg every 12 hours (q12h; subjects weighing &lt;14 kg at screening) and LUM 150 mg/IVA 188 mg q12h (subjects  weighing ≥ 14  kg  at  screening)  were  chosen  based  on  Study  115A,  a  safety  and  PK study of LUM/IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, and an interim analysis of confirmatory PK data obtained during Study 115B. Subjects who turned 6 years of age at or after the Week 48 Visit received LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h (starting at the Week 48 Visit or the next scheduled visit after turning 6 years of age), regardless of weight.

## Duration of Dosing

The duration of 48 weeks of placebo-controlled treatment in Part 1, plus an additional 48 weeks of open-label LUM/IVA treatment in Part 2, was expected to provide an adequate assessment of efficacy and  safety,  including  long-term  impact  on  disease  progression,  in  particular,  structural  damage assessed  via  MRI.  If  the  Treatment  Period  was  extended  to  allow  for  recovery  from  a  pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) and the Week 48 and/or Week 96 Visit was delayed, subjects continued to take study drug until the Week 48 and/or Week 96 Visit was completed.

## Objective(s)

Primary  objective :  to  explore  the  impact  of  LUM/IVA  on  disease  progression  in  subjects  aged  2 through 5 years with CF, homozygous for F508del .

Secondary  objective :  to  explore  the  relationship  between  lung  clearance  index  (LCI)  and  imaging modalities for LUM/IVA in subjects aged 2 through 5 years with CF, homozygous for F508del .

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) global  chest  score  at  Week  48.  Secondary  endpoints  included  the  absolute  change  from  baseline  in number of  lung  turnovers  required  to  reduce  the  end  tidal  inert  gas  concentration  to  1/40th  of  its starting value (LCI2.5) through Week 48 and growth parameters at Week 48.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The proposed sample size of 50 subjects (2:1 randomization: 33 LUM/IVA subjects and 17 placebo subjects) is based on the number of potential subjects expected to be available for participation. No formal sample size calculation was conducted.

## Randomisation

## Study Part 1

The  proposed  sample  size  of  50  subjects  will  be  randomized  by  2:1  ratio  to  the  LUM/IVA  arm  or placebo arm. An interactive web or voice response system (IXRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment or placebo. The randomization code will be produced by Vertex Biostatistics or a qualified randomization vendor.

## Study Part 2

Part 2 is an open-label extension period. Randomization is not applicable.

## Blinding (masking)

Subjects/caregivers and all site personnel, including the investigator, the study monitor, and the study team, were blinded until database lock for Part 1 (i.e., database lock for data up to and including the Week  48  Visit).  Unblinding  of  an  individual  subject's  treatment  by  the  investigator  was  limited  to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study drug was necessary for clinical management.

## Statistical Methods

Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses described in this section were based on the FAS and presented by treatment group in Part 1 analysis and by treatment sequence from Part 1 to Part 2 in final  analysis.  The  study  baseline  was  used  to  calculate  the  change  from  baseline  for  continuous efficacy endpoints.

## Primary endpoint

Definition  of  Endpoint  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  MRI global chest score at Week 48. MRI Chest Scores: MRI scans were assessed semi-quantitatively via a standardized chest MRI scoring system. Each subject had 6 lobes scored with the lingula treated as a separate lobe. The scoring parameters, score aggregation, and global score calculations are described below. After scans were reviewed, MRI scores were captured using the following 7 scoring parameters for each of the 6 lobes: 1. Bronchiectasis/wall thickening 2. Mucus plugging 3. Abscesses/sacculations 4. Consolidations 5. Special findings 6. Mosaic pattern 7. Perfusion abnormalities.

Primary Analysis The primary analysis was performed using Bayesian methods. Specifically, the actual Bayesian posterior probability of LUM/IVA being superior to placebo in the MRI global chest score at Week  48  was  calculated  using  a  vague  normal  prior  distribution.  In  addition,  descriptive  summary statistics for both between-treatment group difference and within-treatment group change at Week 48 were presented. Descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum) with the corresponding 95% CIs were provided

## Results

## Participant flow and number analysed

In Part 1, 51 subjects were randomized (2:1) to receive LUM/IVA or placebo and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Two subjects in the LUM/IVA group prematurely discontinued from both LUM/IVA treatment  and  the  study.  One  subject  discontinued  due  to  pre-treatment  AEs  that  started  4  days before the first dose of study drug; the subject discontinued after 26 days of LUM/IVA treatment. One subject  discontinued  for ' other ' reasons  (the  subject  began  taking  commercial  drug).  All  other subjects completed treatment and completed the Part 1 study. Forty-nine subjects continued to Part 2.

Notes: Study baseline is defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in Part 1. Through Week 48 was defined as the average of the applicable visits up toWeek 48.

## Additional Endpoints

Additional  efficacy  endpoints,  such  as  MRI  outcomes  (i.e.,  reduction  in  scores),  LCI5.0,  additional growth parameters, and markers related to pancreatic function and intestinal inflammation, have been analysed both in a part 1 or final (part 1 and 2) analyses.

Within-group numerical improvements in several efficacy outcomes were observed after 48 weeks of LUM/IVA treatment (see table 11-6)

Note: Study baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. Through Week 48 was defined as the average of all postbaseline measures at scheduled visits up to Week 48.

The final analysis for the additional efficacy endpoints that were continuous are summarized in Table 11-9. Subjects who received LUM/IVA in both Parts 1 and 2 are hereafter referred to as the LUM/IVALUM/IVA group. Subjects who received placebo in Part 1 and LUM/IVA in Part 2 are hereafter referred to  as  the  PBO-LUM/IVA group. Because 'through Week 96' was defined as the average of all postbaseline measures at scheduled visits up to Week 96, the continuous endpoints from baseline through Week 96 were only applicable to the LUM/IVA-LUM/IVA group.

As such, the continuous endpoints from baseline through Week 96 were only applicable to the LUM/IVA-LUM/IVA group.

## Results on additional endopoints

Numerical improvements were also observed after LUM/IVA treatment for other additional continuous endpoints,  based  on  within-group  changes  from  baseline  at  or  through  Week  48,  including  MRI outcomes  (i.e.,  reduction  in  scores),  LCI5.0,  additional  growth  parameters,  and  markers  related  to pancreatic function and intestinal inflammation.

For subjects who received LUM/IVA in both Parts 1 and 2 (LUM/IVA-LUM/IVA group), these numerical improvements  were  generally  sustained  in  Part  2,  demonstrating  the  clinical  benefit  of  LUM/IVA treatment  over  a  cumulative  period  of  96  weeks.  For  subjects  who  initiated  LUM/IVA  in  Part  2 (placebo-LUM/IVA group), the numerical improvements in efficacy outcomes observed after 48 weeks of LUM/IVA treatment were consistent with those observed in Part 1.

## Safety results

The majority of subjects had AEs that were considered mild (LUM/IVA: 28.6%; placebo: 37.5%) or moderate (LUM/IVA: 68.6%; placebo: 62.5%) in severity (Table 12-1.). One subject in the LUM/IVA group had a severe AE (ALT increased). No subjects had life-threatening AEs. No subjects had an AE

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that led to study drug discontinuation. Three (8.6%) subjects had AEs that led to LUM/IVA interruption (autoimmune  hepatitis,  intussusception,  and  increased  AST).  No  AEs  led  to  placebo  interruption.  A total of 7 (20.0%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 2 (12.5%) subjects in the placebo group had SAEs; none were considered related or possibly related to study drug. No subjects had AEs leading to death.

Notes: Events were coded with MedDRA Version 23.1. When summarizing number of events, a subject with and percentage of subjects, a subject with multiple events within a category was counted only once in that category. When summarizing the number of subjects with related SAEs, SAEs with relationship of related, possibly related, or missing were counted.

The  most  common  SOCs ( ≥ 30% incidence  overall)  in  which  AEs  were  reported  were  infections  and infestations; gastrointestinal disorders; and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (see Table 12-2).

Note: MedDRA Version 23.1. Table is sorted in descending order of frequency of the LUM/IVA column by PT.

PTs were provided only for AEs that occurred in ≥10% of subjects in any treatment group. A subject with multiple events within a PT was counted only once within the PT.

AEs were generally consistent with common manifestations and complications of CF in this young age group. The most common AEs ( ≥ 20% incidence) in both treatment groups by PT were nasopharyngitis (LUM/IVA: 62.9%; placebo: 50.0%), infective PEx of CF (LUM/IVA: 45.7%; placebo: 56.3%), cough (LUM/IVA: 28.6%; placebo: 31.3%), and rhinitis (LUM/IVA: 25.7%; placebo: 37.5%).

Overall, the majority of subjects had AEs that were considered mild (16 [31.4%] subjects) or moderate (34 [66.7%]) in severity. One subject in the LUM/IVA group had a severe AE of increased ALT that was considered  unlikely  related  to  study  drug  and  resolved  without  any  change  in  study  drug  dose.  No severe  AEs  were  reported  in  the  placebo  group.  No  subjects  in  either  treatment  group  had  lifethreatening AEs.

## Relationship of AEs

The incidence of AEs considered related to study drug is presented in Table 12-3. The most common (occurring in ≥ 8% subjects) related AEs in the LUM/IVA group were abdominal pain and cough. The most common (occurring in ≥ 12% subjects) related AEs in the placebo group were upper abdominal pain and nasal congestion. All other related AEs occurred in 1 subject each, except for diarrhea.

Note: MedDRA Version 23.1.

- If a subject had multiple events within a PT, the subject was counted only once under the strongest relationship in that category.
- Related included either possibly related or related study drug categories.

## AESIs of Respiratory Events and Elevated Transaminases

Respiratory events and elevated transaminases were the adverse events of special interest (AESIs).

Two (5.7%) subjects on LUM/IVA and 3 (18.8%) subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 AESI of respiratory  events,  all  of  which  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  No  serious  AESIs  of  respiratory events occurred, and no AESI of respiratory events led to treatment discontinuation or interruption.

Three  (8.6%)  subjects  on  LUM/IVA  had  at  least  1  AESI  of  elevated  transaminases.  For  1  subject, treatment  was  interrupted  due  to  the  event  (AST  increased).  None  of  the  AESIs  of  elevated transaminases  were  serious  and  none  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  No  subjects  in  the  placebo group had AESIs of elevated transaminases.

## Deaths, Other Serious AEs, and Other Significant AEs

There were no deaths in Part 1.

A total of 7 (20.0%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 2 (12.5%) subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 SAE. Three (8.6%) subjects in the LUM/IVA group and 1 (6.3%) subject in the placebo group had an SAE of infective PEx of CF, which is a common manifestation of CF disease. The other SAEs included pneumonia, constipation, hematemesis, and intussusception in the LUM/IVA group and lung infiltration in the placebo group (in 1 subject each).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

None of the SAEs were considered related to study drug The SAE of intussusception led to study drug interruption;  study  drug  dose  was  not  changed  for  any  other  SAEs.  All  SAEs  had  an  outcome  of resolved, except lung infiltration that was ongoing at the time of this report.

A subject with multiple events within a category was counted only once in that category. The table is sorted in descending order of the LUM/IVA column by SOC and by PT within each SOC.

## AEs That Led to Discontinuation or Interruption of Study Drug

No AEs led to discontinuation of study drug in either treatment group.

Three (8.6%) subjects each had 1 AE that led to LUM/IVA interruption as follows:

- One subject had moderate intussusception that worsened to serious, was unlikely related to study drug, and resolved with treatment after 12 days.
- One subject had mild increased AST that was unlikely related to study drug and resolved after 17 days.
- One subject had an AE of moderate autoimmune hepatitis on Study Day 200 that was considered possibly related to LUM/IVA by the investigator; the event resolved after 50 days. Before and during the event, the subject had ALT elevations &gt;5 × ULN but &lt;8 × ULN, and AST elevations &lt;3 × ULN; the subject had no clinical signs or symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis. After resolution of the event and resumption of study drug, ALT remained &lt;5 × ULN for the rest of the study and was mostly &lt;3 × ULN. Vertex assessed the event as more consistent with CF liver disease because the autoimmune hepatitis was  not  supported  by  biopsy,  positive  antibodies  are  common  in  the  general  population,  and  the subject  had  a  rapid  resolution  of  the  transaminase  elevations  without  steroid  treatment,  with  a negative response to LUM/IVA rechallenge.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

In  accordance with Article  46 of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006, the MAH has submitted the results of Study 121.

The present study was designed to explore the long-term disease progression and efficacy of LUM/IVA in subjects  2  through  5  years  of  age,  homozygous  for  F508del  in  a  placebo-controlled  setting,  with  a window of opportunity to halt disease progression and prevent organ damage by early intervention with therapies that treat the underlying cause of CF.

This is an exploratory Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study designed to explore the impact of LUM/IVA on disease progression in subjects aged 2 through 5 years with Cystic fibrosis (CF), homozygous for F508del.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The duration of 48 weeks of placebo-controlled treatment in Part 1, plus an additional 48 weeks of openlabel  LUM/IVA treatment  in  Part  2,  was  expected  to  provide  an  adequate  assessment  of  efficacy  and safety, including long-term impact on disease progression, in particular, structural damage assessed via MRI.

Almost all subjects enrolled in Part 1 completed (100% in the PBO and 94.3% in the LUM/IVA arm) so that only 2 subjects discontinued early. Same figure is observed for the part 2 (100% in the PBO arm and 97% in the LUM/IVA arm: with only 2 subjects discontinued LUM/IVA treatment (both due to AEs) and 1 (2.0%) subject discontinued the study.

With regard to baseline characteristics, the majority of subjects (64.7%) were male, and the mean age at baseline was 4.2 years.

Study results showed an overall trend of a numerical improvement in LUM/IVA arm as compared to PBO arm across the different endpoints. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in MRI global chest score  at  Week  48.  Based  on  Bayesian  posterior  probability,  the  probability  of  LUM/IVA  was  76.23%. superior to placebo. The mean (95% CI) difference between LUM/IVA and placebo was -1.5 (-5.5, 2.6).

Results from the secondary endpoint (absolute Change in LCI2.5 From Baseline at Week 48 showed a numerical improvement (i.e., a reduction) in LCI2.5 in the LUM/IVA arm with a mean (95% CI) absolute change from baseline of -0.37 (-0.85, 0.10) through Week 48.

Looking  at  the  growth  parameters  i.e.  absolute  Change  in  Weight-for-age  Z-score/  Stature-for-age  Zscore/  Body  Mass  Index-for-Age  Z-score  at  Week  48  the  results  were  consistent  across  the  three different endpoints showing a numerical improvement in the LUM/IVA arm and a (slight) decrease in the PBO arm for weight-for-age and BMI-for-age z-scores.

Regarding  the  safety  profile,  no  new  safety  concerns  have  been  identified  and  the  known  AEs  were reported. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate  in severity.  The  most  common  were nasopharyngitis,  infective  PEx  of  CF,  cough,  and  rhinitis.  There  were  no  deaths.  The  SAEs  were considered  to  be  not  related  or  unlikely  related  to  study  drug  by  study  investigators.  AESIs,  including respiratory events and elevated transaminases, were infrequent, 1 led to treatment discontinuation. Of note, no important impact on laboratory findings has been observed and no subjects had a cataract.

Overall, data coming from Study 121 support the B/R risk on LUM/IVA for the subjects 2 through 5 years of age, homozygous for F508del.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation
