## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Exforge/Dafiro/Copalia/Imprida is an oral antihypertensive product consisting of a fixed dose combination  a  combination  of  valsartan,  an  angiotensin  II  receptor  antagonist,  and  amlodipine,  a calcium channel blocker.

The approved indications are:

'Treatment of essential hypertension.

[Exforge/Dafiro/Copalia/Imprida]  is  indicated  in  patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  not  adequately controlled on amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy.'

The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone.

The amlodipine component inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect  on  vascular  smooth  muscle,  causing  reductions  in  peripheral  vascular  resistance  and  in  blood pressure.

Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively on  the  receptor  subtype  AT 1 ,  which  is  responsible  for  the  known  actions  of  angiotensin  II.  The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 receptor.

The Marketing Authorisation for Exforge in the EU was granted on 17 January 2007, for Dafiro on 18 January 2007, for Copalia on 17 January 2007 and for Imprida on 17 January 2007.

Exforge, Copalia, Dafiro and Imprida have been marketed globally in over 110 countries since 2007. The currently approved doses of the fixed dose combination of valsartan/amlodipine in the EU are 80/5 mg, 160/5 mg, and 160/10 mg.

The purpose of this worksharing application is to update section 5.1 of the SmPC with additional clinical efficacy  data,  collected  from  five  completed  phase  3b/4  studies,  in  patients  likely  to  require  dual therapy including patients with stage 2 hypertension, patients not adequately responding to commonly prescribed  monotherapies,  and  specific  subgroups  including  black  patients,  diabetics  and  obese patients. In support of the proposed wording on consistent efficacy of the valsartan/amlodipine fixed combination in obese and diabetic patients, reference is made not only to the 5 clinical study reports completed  since  marketing  approval,  but  also  to  5  clinical  study  reports  already  presented  in  the original marketing authorisation application.

This application concerns the following medicinal products:

WS-0100-G was submitted for a group of variations consisting of three Type II variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

The scopes applied for by the MAH were as follows:

- Variation 1: Update of section 5.1 of the SPC with information on efficacy in patients with stage 2 hypertension and black patients based on studies VAA 2402 and VAA 2403;
-  Variation  2:  Update  of  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  with  information  on  efficacy  and  safety  of valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg based on study VAA 2404. In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update the SPC in line with the latest QRD template and to update the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet;
-  Variation 3: Update of section 5.1 of the SPC with information on efficacy in patients not adequately responding to any monotherapy and in obese and diabetic patients based on studies VAA 2401, VAA 2402, VAA 2403, VAA 2404 and VAA US02 (as well as original dossier studies VAA 2201, VAA 2305, VAA 2306, VAA 2307 and VAA 2308).

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Clinical efficacy

## Variation 1

The MAH proposed the following statement in section 5.1 of the SmPC as part of variation 1:

'In two additional active-controlled studies of 1,612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and diuretics.

Active controlled trials in stage 2 hypertensive patients

Two active-controlled studies of 1,195 patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and  &lt;200 mmHg  were  conducted.  In  the  first  study  in  639  patients  (baseline  blood  pressure 171/95 mmHg),  an  Exforge  regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg  significantly reduced sitting blood pressure after 4 weeks by 30/13 mmHg compared to 24/9 mmHg with a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg force-titrated to 10 mg. The second active-controlled study, specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of Exforge in 556 black patients, compared an Exforge regimen of 5 mg/160 mg force-titrated to 10 mg/160 mg with an amlodipine regimen of 5 mg force-titrated to 10 mg. In this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study  (baseline  blood  pressure  171/98 mmHg),  Exforge  significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure after 4 weeks by 31/13 mmHg compared to 27/11 mmHg with amlodipine.'

In  support  of  the  proposed  wording,  the  MAH  submitted  studies  VAA  2402  and  VAA2403  which  are summarized below:

## Study VAA 2402

A  12-week  double-blind,  randomized,  multicenter,  parallel  group  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and safety  of  orally  administered  valsartan  /  amlodipine  combination  based  therapy  versus  amlodipine monotherapy in Black patients with stage II hypertension.

The study was conducted in 74 centres in Colombia, Ecuador, South Africa and the USA from June 2006 to April 2007.

The primary objective was to demonstrate the superior efficacy of the combination of valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  and  320/10  mg  treatment  regimen  in  Black  patients  with  stage  II hypertension, by testing the hypothesis that the valsartan/amlodipine combination treatment regimen produces a superior reduction in mean seated systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) from baseline compared to amlodipine monotherapy at Week 8.

## Inclusion criteria :

- Black male or female outpatients ≥ 18 years of age.
- Stage II hypertension, defined as MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and MSSBP &lt; 200 mmHg, measured using a validated automated oscillometric device at Visit 2 at the study site.
- Treatment naïve patients had a MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg at Visit 2.

The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in MSSBP (mmHg) at Week 8 LOCF and was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

Secondary efficacy variables were  change from baseline MSDBP at Week 8 (last observation carried forward; LOCF); change from baseline MSSBP and MSDBP at Weeks 2, 4 and 8 and 12; overall BP control rate after 12 weeks of treatment (MSSBP &lt;140 mmHg and MSDBP &lt;90 mmHg).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment, country, length of washout received were fitted as factors in the model and baseline MSSBP as a covariate. The change from baseline LSM, the difference between LS means, (valsartan/amlodipine vs. amlodipine) and two-sided 95% confidence interval were presented.

The ITT population was used for analysis.

The ITT population was defined as the randomised patients with at least 1 post baseline measurement and consisted of 278 (97.2% of randomised) in the valsartan/amlodipine arm and 278 patients (97.2% of randomised) in the amlodipine  arm.

Protocol deviations : higher in the amlodipine treatment strategy (38.1%) compared to the valsartan/amlodipine  treatment  strategy  (32.5%).  Most  of  these  were  major  protocol  deviations (24.1%  for  valsartan/amlodipine,  and  26.2%  for  amlodipine).  The  most  frequently  reported  major deviations were time of BP measurement &lt; 20 or &gt; 30 hours after the last dose of study medication (12.2% for valsartan/amlodipine; 14.7% for amlodipine), study drug interruption &gt; 3 consecutive days prior to Visit 6 (4.2% for valsartan/amlodipine; 5.2% for amlodipine), and MSSBP &lt; 160mmHg or ≥ 200 at Visit 2 (4.2% for valsartan/amlodipine; 3.5% for amlodipine).

Baseline characteristics : The mean age was 53.2 years (SD 11.01), 96% of patients were &lt;75 years. 60.1% were females. The mean (SD) MSSBP was 170.5 (9.27) mmHg, the mean (SD) MSDBP was 98.3 (9.27) mmHg.

## Study VAA2403

An  8-week  double-blind,  randomized,  multicenter,  parallel  group  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and safety  of  orally  administered  valsartan/amlodipine  combination  based  therapy  versus  amlodipine monotherapy in patients with stage II hypertension.

The study was conducted in 75 centres in the USA and Italy from June 2006 to April 2007.

The primary objective was to demonstrate the superior efficacy of the combination of valsartan/amlodipine 160/10 mg in patients with stage II hypertension, by testing the hypothesis that the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  combination  regimen  produces  a  superior  reduction  in  MSSBP from baseline compared to amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy at week 4.

## Inclusion criteria:

- Male or female outpatients ≥ 18 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Stage II hypertension, defined as MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and MSSBP &lt; 200 mmHg, measured using a validated automated oscillometric device at Visit 2 at the study site.
- Treatment naïve patients had a MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg at Visit 2.

The ITT population was defined as the randomised patients with at least 1 post baseline measurement and  consisted  of  318  (98.8  %  of  randomised)  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  arm  and  321  patients (99.1% of randomised) in the amlodipine arm.

Protocol  deviations  occurred  in  92  patients  (28.6%)  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  treatment  strategy, and  in  87  patients  (26.9%)  in  the  amlodipine  treatment  strategy.  Approximately  half  were  major deviations (46 patients, 14.3 % for valsartan/amlodipine; 47 patients, 14.5% for amlodipine).

Baseline characteristics : The mean age was 58.1 years (SD 10.33), 94% of patients were &lt;75 years. 50.2 % were males. The mean (SD) MSSBP was 170.5 (8.72) mmHg, the mean (SD) MSDBP was 95.2 (10.18) mmHg.

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy - Variation 1

## Study 2402:

Patients  were  included  in  this  study  if  they  had  systolic  hypertension  &gt;160  mmHg  and  &lt;200mmHg corresponding to grade 2/3. There were  no  requirements  regarding the type(s) of previous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antihypertensive  therapy  and  their  dosages,  and  also  treatment  naïve  patients  could  be  included. Patients received either amlodipine 5mg (uptitrated to 10mg at week 2) or valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg (with uptitration  to  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  at  week  2).  This  is  not  in  accordance  with  the authorised indication.

The  discontinuation  rate  was  rather  high  for  a  hypertension  trial,  13.6%  and  12.6%,  in  the valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  arms,  respectively,  and  approximately  25%  of  patients  having major protocol deviations.

Patients were sufficiently balanced at baseline; a preponderance of females included is noted.

The study is only partially relevant for the European Union setting as patients in the valsartan/amlodipine arm were optionally uptitrated at week 4 to 320/10 mg, a strength which is not authorised in the EU.  The applicant has therefore focused the data review largely on week 4 since this was  the  last  visit  that  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  could  be  compared  to  amlodipine  10  mg monotherapy.  However,  at  that  point  in  time  those  patients  had  not  received  the  antihypertensive treatment with valsartan/amlodipie 160/10 mg and amlodipine 10 mg for more than 2 weeks, which is not regarded as sufficient to judge its efficacy.

In  summary,  it  is  acknowledged  that  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  seems  more  effective  than amlodipine  10  mg  in  the  treatment  of  systolic  hypertension  &gt;160mmHg  and  &lt;200mmHg  in  a population  of  Black  patients  that  was  either  treatment  naïve  or  was  treated  with  non-specified antihypertensives (i.e. not according to the authorised indication). However, a final judgement on this cannot  be  made  as  these  analyses  were  made  after  2  weeks  of  treatment  which  is  considered  too short. Furthermore, the conduct of the study was not adequate as indicated by the high number of discontinuations  and  protocol  violations.  This  study  is  therefore  not  considered  supportive  of  the proposed statement regarding Black patients with grade 2 hypertension.

## Study 2403:

Patients were included if they had systolic hypertension &gt;160 mmHg and &lt;200mmHg corresponding to grade 2/3. There were no requirements regarding the type(s) of previous antihypertensive therapy; also treatment naïve patients could be included.

The primary endpoint was evaluated at week 4, i.e.  2 weeks after forced uptitration of the drugs in both treatment arms. This period is considered too short to evaluate the antihypertensive effect. Also according  to  the  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of hypertension (CHMP/EWP/238/95 Rev.2 and EMA//238/1995/rev.3) a tested dose should remain stable for at least 4 weeks.

The  discontinuation  rates  were  comparable  in  both  treatment  arms;  approximately  10%  and  major protocol deviations occurred in around 14% of patients in either treatment arm. LOCF seemed not to be specified to be applied for the primary analysis.

In  summary,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  seems  more  effective  than amlodipine  10  mg  in  the  treatment  of  systolic  hypertension  &gt;160mmHg  and  &lt;200mmHg  in  a population that was either treatment naïve or was treated with non-specified antihypertensives (i.e. not  according  to  the  authorised  indication),  a  final  judgement  on  this  approach  cannot  be  made  as these  analyses  were  made  after  2  weeks  of  treatment  which  is  considered  too  short.  This  study  is therefore  not  considered  supportive  of  the  proposed  statement  regarding  patients  with  grade  2 hypertension.

Thus, the provided studies are not considered sufficiently robust and are not in line with the authorised indication. As a consequence, the wording that was proposed by the MAH:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

\"In two additional active-controlled studies of 1,612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and diuretics.

## Active controlled trials in stage 2 hypertensive patients

Two active-controlled studies of 1,195 patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and  &lt;200 mmHg  were  conducted.  In  the  first  study  in  639  patients  (baseline  blood  pressure 171/95 mmHg),  an  Exforge  regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  30/13 mmHg  compared  to  24/9 mmHg with a similar regimen of amlodipine 5 mg force-titrated to 10 mg. The second active-controlled study, specifically  designed  to  evaluate  the efficacy  of  Exforge  in  556  black  patients,  compared  an  Exforge regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  with  a  similar  regimen  of amlodipine  5 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg.  In  this  study  (baseline  blood  pressure  171/98 mmHg), Exforge  significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  31/13 mmHg  compared  to 27/11 mmHg with amlodipine.\"

can therefore not be accepted.

## Variation 2

The MAH proposed the following wording (underlined) in section 5.1 of the SmPC as part of variation 2:

'In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5 mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema and amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg  produced  numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine 10 mg  with  a  4-fold  lower  incidence  of  peripheral  oedema.  In  patients  adequately  controlled  on amlodipine 10 mg but who experience unacceptable oedema, amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.'

In support of the proposed wording, the MAH submitted study VAA2404, which is summarized below:

## Study VAA 2404

A  12-week  randomized,  double-blind,  multicenter,  parallel  group  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy, tolerability, and safety of treatment with the combination of valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg in patients with essential hypertension not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg alone.

The study was conducted from January to November 2007 in 148 centres in Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Argentina, Sweden, Norway, Ecuador, Finland, and Chile.

The co-primary objectives of this study were:

- To confirm that the combination of valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg is non-inferior to amlodipine 10mg alone when comparing the reduction of MSSBP from baseline to week 8 (LOCF) (Visit 4) between the two treatment groups (primary efficacy objective).

-  To  confirm  that  the  combination  of  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5mg  induces  less  peripheral  edema compared to amlodipine 10mg alone up to Visit 4 (week 8) quantified as adverse event (AE) reported peripheral edema (primary safety objective).

## Inclusion criteria :

- Male or female outpatients ≥ 55 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Patients  with  essential  hypertension  measured using a validated automated oscillometric device at Visit 1 (Non-treated patients had to have a MSSBP ≥ 140 mmHg and ≤ 160 mmHg and patients pretreated on monotherapy prior to Visit 1 had to have MSSBP ≤ 160 mmHg).
- To be eligible for randomization at Visit 2 (Day 1) all patients had to have a MSSBP ≥ 130 mmHg and ≤ 160 mmHg.
- No peripheral edema at Visit 2 (randomization)

* For patients pretreated with antihypertensive medication prior to study start, the single-blind run-in phase was also considered a wash-out period from previous medication. For patients with previous antihypertensive  medication  that  required  a  gradual  downward  titration,  the  tapering  down  was  done according to manufacturer's instructions and the last dose was taken by week -2 prior to randomization.

Primary efficacy variable : Change from baseline in MSSBP (mmHg) at week 8 LOCF.

Secondary  efficacy  variables were  the  change  from  baseline  MSDBP  at  week  8  (LOCF),  the  change from baseline in MSSBP and MSDBP at weeks 4, 8 and 12, systolic control rate (MSSBP &lt;130 mmHg) at  weeks  4,  8  and  12,  systolic  response  rate  (MSSBP  &lt;130  mmHg  or ≥ 20  mmHg  reduction  from baseline in MSSBP) at weeks 4, 8 and 12 and overall BP control rate (MSSBP/MSDBP &lt;140/90 mmHg for non-diabetics and &lt;130/80 mmHg for diabetics) at weeks 4, 8 and 12.

For the primary safety objective, investigators also evaluated patients for the presence of edema at every visit.

## Statistical methods

The  first  primary  hypothesis  for  non-inferiority  in  MSSBP  reduction  from  baseline  to  Week  8  LOCF between  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  and  amlodipine  10  mg  was  analyzed  using  analysis  of covariance  with  treatment,  region  and  diabetic  status  as  fixed  factors  and  baseline  MSSBP  as  a covariate for the ITT population. The non-inferiority margin was 3 mmHg.

The  second  primary  hypothesis  for  a  difference  between  valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  with regards to the proportion of patients who developed peripheral edema up to and including Week 8 was analyzed using logistic regression with treatment, region, and diabetic status as fixed factors in the model for the Safety population.

Protocol deviations occurred in 40.7% of the patients in the valsartan/amlodipine group, and in 47.7 % of  the  patients  in  the  amlodipine  group.  Most  of  these  were  minor  deviations  (35.3  %  for valsartan/amlodipine;  37.2  %  for  amlodipine).  The  most  frequently  reported  major  deviations  (i.e. those that led to exclusion from the Per Protocol population) were no study medication taken for the last  3  days  prior  to  Visit  5  (2.5  %  for  valsartan/amlodipine;  7.4  %  for  amlodipine),  chronic  use  of NSAIDs (3.5 % for valsartan/amlodipine; 4.9 % for amlodipine) and poor compliance ( ≤ 80%) with study medication (1.7 % for valsartan/amlodipine; 6.6 % for amlodipine).

Baseline  characteristics: The  mean  age  was  65.5  years  (SD  10.33),  86.7  %  of  patients  were  &lt;75 years. 51.9 % were males. The mean (SD) MSSBP was 143.9 (8.09) mmHg, the mean (SD) MSDBP was 83.8 (8.60) mmHg. 77.5 % had prior antihypertensive medication.

A patient with multiple occurrences of peripheral edema is counted only once for that treatment group

Peripheral  oedema  resolved  in  more  than  half  of  patients  who  switched  from  amlodipine  to valsartan/amlodipine after week 8.

Furthermore, during the procedure in response to a CHMP request for an alternative analysis to the pre-defined  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  analysis  performed  in  Study  A2404,  the  MAH performed  a  mixed-effect  model  for  repeated  measures  analysis  which  addressed  the  imbalance  in study discontinuations between the two treatment groups.

During the preparation for the mixed-effect model analyses, inconsistencies in the original programming for  deriving  LOCF  values  in  the  ITT  analysis  (but  not  the  Per  Protocol  analysis)  were discovered. As a result, all of the original efficacy analyses related to blood pressure (i.e., change from baseline  in  msSBP  and  msDBP,  overall  BP  control  rate,  systolic  BP  control  rate,  and  systolic  BP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

responder rate) were repeated using corrected efficacy datasets. The results of these revised analyses are  consistent  with  those  presented  in  the  original  CSR  and  type  II  variation  application,  and  are presented below.

In addition, the per-protocol analysis results are in line with the original conclusions, indicating that the disproportionate discontinuation rate in the amlodipine group has not impacted the treatment effect.

## Study A2404 - Revised efficacy analyses

At week 8 (LOCF), the primary analysis time point, a statistically non-inferior least square (LS) mean reduction  from  baseline  in  msSBP,  the  primary  efficacy  variable,  and  msDBP  was  observed  with valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 5 mg.

These results are consistent with the LOCF analysis presented in the original CSR and type II variation application.

At weeks 4 and 8, statistically significant greater overall BP control rates, systolic BP control rates and systolic BP response rates were achieved with valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg. At week 12, rates were numerically superior for valsartan/amlodipine compared to amlodipine, but no longer statistically significant as would be expected since patients in both treatment strategies had been receiving valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg from week 8 onwards. These results are consistent with the analysis presented in the original CSR and type II variation application.

## Study 2404 - A mixed-effect model for repeated measures analyses

Upon request from CHMP during the procedure, alternative analyses were conducted by the MAH using a mixed effect model for repeated measures. These analyses confirmed that the original conclusions are upheld, indicating that the disproportionate discontinuation rate in the amlodipine group has not impacted the treatment effect.

The  new  analyses  use  a  likelihood-based  estimation  method  to  utilize  all  available  data,  including subjects with missing value. It accounts for the repeated measures structure in the data by adding the 'visit'  and  'visit  by  treatment'  interaction  on  top  of  the  original  model  (i.e.,  treatment,  region,  and diabetes  status  as  factors  and  baseline  msSBP  as  covariate).  An  unstructured  covariance  matrix assumption was used. The patient's week 4 and week 8 blood pressure reductions were included as repeated measurements. Repeated measures analyses were performed for the change from baseline in msSBP, the primary efficacy variable, and msDBP, and are presented below.

At weeks 4 and 8, a statistically non-inferior least square (LS) mean reduction from baseline in msSBP was observed with valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (primary efficacy variable). The changes from baseline at weeks 4 and 8 were similar for both the valsartan/amlodipine and the amlodipine treatment groups confirming that the disproportionate discontinuation rate in the amlodipine group did not have an impact on the between treatment effects at week 8.

** Negative difference favors Val/Aml 160/5 mg

*** p value &lt; 0.025 indicates statistical significance of the test for non-inferiority at a margin of 3 mmHg

The mixed-effect model for repeated measures analysis for change from baseline in msDBP is shown in the table below.

At weeks 4 and 8, a statistically non-inferior least square (LS) mean reduction from baseline in msDBP was observed with valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg. The changes from baseline at weeks 4 and 8 were similar for both the valsartan/amlodipine and the amlodipine treatment groups confirming that the disproportionate discontinuation rate in the amlodipine group did not have an impact on the between treatment effects at week 8.

In  addition,  upon  request  by  the  CHMP  during  the  procedure,  the  MAH  clarified  the  fact  that  the already existing SmPC wording in section 5.1:

'In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.'

is  based  on  data  collected  from  the  two  multi-factorial  studies  [Study  A2201]  and  [Study  A2307] submitted as part of the original MAA for the fixed dose combination valsartan/amlodipine.

Study  A2201  and  Study  A2307  were  both  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  multifactorial, placebo-controlled, parallel group trials. After a 2 week washout period, patients entered a 2-4 week single-blind placebo run-in period, followed by randomization to an 8 week double-blind treatment period  with:  placebo,  valsartan  monotherapy  doses,  amlodipine  monotherapy  doses,  and  the respective combinations of valsartan/amlodipine doses. Study A2201 and Study A2307 evaluated the lower and higher ends of the dose response curves, respectively. Patients were randomized with mild to moderate essential diastolic hypertension (grades 1 or 2 WHO classification msDBP ≥ 95 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg). The primary objective was to assess the blood pressure lowering effects of a once daily regimen  of the various combinations  of valsartan and  amlodipine, compared  to  their monotherapy components and placebo. The primary efficacy variable was mean sitting diastolic blood pressure  (msDBP).  Both  trials  enrolled  male  and  female  outpatients  at  least  18  years  of  age. Exclusion criteria were very similar for both trials.

*At the end of the 8 week double-blind treatment phase, the first 400 patients to complete all double-blind visits, with no drug related serious adverse experiences during the trial, were eligible to enroll in a one-year open-label extension.

Baseline demographics and characteristics as presented in the table below were generally comparable between the two studies with the one exception of more Black patients enrolled in Study A2201 and more Oriental patients in Study A2307.

Based on the similarity of designs and study populations, qualitative treatment comparisons can be made  across  the  two  studies  after correcting for differences in placebo  response.  Baseline msSBP/msDBP was 153/99 mmHg in Study A2201 and 157/99 mmHg in Study A2307.

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy - Variation 2

## Study 2404

This  study  had  a  classical  non  responder  design.  Patients  included  were  &gt;55  years,  and  had  mild systolic hypertension (grade 1).

The study was characterised by disproportionate discontinuations and protocol violations. Discontinuations  and  major  protocol  violations  were  considerably  higher  in  the  amlodipine  group; almost  20%  of  patients  discontinued  treatment  in  the  amlodipine  group  and  2.5%  of  patients discontinued treatment in the valsartan/amlodipine group. The majority of patients in the amlodipine group discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

Major protocol violations occurred in 72 out of 592 randomised patients (12%) in the valsartan/amlodipine group and in 155 out of 591 randomised patients (26%) in the amlodipine group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The non-inferiority margin chosen was 3 mmHg for MSSBP. As this is a non-inferiority study also the PP population is relevant for the analysis. This has been provided in the study report for the primary endpoint (see above) and complements the ITT analysis.

The  primary  analysis  used  LOCF  in  order  to  account  for  missing  data.  However,  due  to  the  large difference in the rate of discontinuations between the 2 treatment arms (almost 20% in the amlodipine arm vs. 2.5% in the valsartan/amlodipine arm), this analysis may have favoured the valsartan/amlodipine arm.

Upon  request  by  the  CHMP  during  the  procedure,  the  MAH  provided  revised  primary  LOCF  (ITT) analyses  for  Study  A2404  using  corrected  efficacy  datasets  as  it  was  discovered  that  there  were inconsistencies in the original programming for deriving LOCF values in the ITT analysis (but not the Per Protocol analysis). All of the original efficacy analyses related to blood pressure (i.e., change from baseline  in  msSBP  and  msDBP,  overall  BP  control  rate,  systolic  BP  control  rate,  and  systolic  BP responder rate) were repeated using corrected efficacy datasets.

Furthermore,  a  revised  analysis  for  change  in  BP  at  week  8  (ITT,  without  LOCF)  was  performed  in Study 2404.

An additional mixed-effect model for repeated measures analysis was performed for Study 2404.

The  proposed  wording  in  section  5.1  focuses  on  the  efficacy  of  valsartan/amlodipine  compared  to amlodipine alone in the context of oedema incidence rather than on the oedema incidence itself as described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. According to the MAH, this information provided in section 5.1 is relevant for the prescriber as it presents efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine in the approved doses of 5 mg/80  mg  and  5  mg/160  mg  as  a  benefit  in  relation  to  oedema  incidence  versus  amlodipine  in monotherapy. Thus, the proposed SmPC wording provides additional reassurance to the prescriber on efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine fixed combination in relation to oedema reduction.

Oedema  was  significantly  more  frequent  in  the  amlodipine  monotherapy  group.  In  this  respect,  it should also be kept in mind that only patients 55 years or older were included in the study. Oedema is dose-dependent with amlodipine therapy and the  clearance  of  amlodipine  is  reduced  in  the  elderly, resulting in a higher exposure. It is therefore likely that the incidence of amlodipine in this study may be exaggerated due to the chosen study population.

The  MAH  acknowledged  that  patients  aged  55  years  and  over  were  selected  in  Study  A2404  to demonstrate the effect of valsartan/amlodipine compared to amlodipine monotherapy on the reduction of  oedema  incidence.  According  to  the  MAH,  as  recognised  by  guidelines  for  the  management  of arterial hypertension, the patient population selected in Study A2404 ( ≥ 55 years old) is representative of the hypertensive population at risk. Age (men &gt;55 years; women &gt;65 years) is considered a factor influencing prognosis of cardiovascular risk and should be used to stratify the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Older  patients  may  be  more  prone  to  develop  peripheral  oedema  on  non-dihydropyridine calcium  channel  blockers  due  to  the  effects  of  aging  on  the  peripheral  vasculature.  Therefore, according  to  the  MAH,  this  is  the  population  that  may  have  the  greatest  benefit  with  respect  to attenuation in the development of oedema but does not preclude a benefit in younger patients.

It  is  reassuring  that  all  the  presented  analyses  are  consistent  and  yield  similar  results.  However,  it should be kept in mind that, albeit statistically significant,  the differences  in  BP  reductions  between valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg and amlodipine 10 mg are not exceptionally different and there is no obvious reason to insert a statement on ' numerically greater reductions in blood pressure compared to amlodipine 10 mg' , derived from a not completely recognized subgroup of patients with hypertension (those &gt;55 years), into section 5.1 of the SmPC. In spite of the fact that the age of &gt;55 years is an agreed risk factor for males for CV disease (65 years for females), it is not recognized as a subgroup for hypertension trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SmPC guideline states on section 5.1:

'…It may be appropriate to provide limited information, relevant to the prescriber, such as the main results  (statistically  compelling  and  clinically  relevant)  regarding  pre-specified  end  points  or  clinical outcomes  in  the  major  trials,  and  giving  the  main  characteristics  of  the  patient  population.  Such information on clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should  summarise evidence from relevant studies supporting the indication. The magnitude of effects should be described using  absolute  figures.  (Relative  risks  or  odd  ratio  should  not  be  presented  without  absolute figures)….'

Consequently,  as  mentioned  above  with  reference  to  the  SmPC  guideline,  the  efficacy  part  of  the proposed wording is not considered appropriate. Therefore, the proposed wording (highlighted):

'In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5 mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema and amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg  produced  numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine 10 mg  with  a  4-fold  lower  incidence  of  peripheral  oedema.  In  patients  adequately  controlled  on amlodipine 10 mg but who experience unacceptable oedema, amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.'

is not acceptable to the CHMP and thus the context of the proposed safety information on oedema is not relevant. The existing information on oedema in section 4.8 of the SmPC is regarded sufficient for prescribers.

Furthermore,  during  the  procedure  the  CHMP  questioned  the  validity  of  the  already  existing  SmPC wording in section 5.1:

'In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.'

Upon request by the CHMP, the MAH clarified that this wording was based on data collected from the two multi-factorial studies [Study A2201] and [Study A2307] submitted as part of the original MAA for the fixed dose combination valsartan/amlodipine.

Following the assessment of all data provided, the CHMP did not consider it appropriate to compare two  different  studies  in  order  to  obtain  a  statement  on  BP  results  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  The studies  are  not  considered  completely  comparable  with  respect  to  the  included  patient  population which is demonstrated by the differences in age categories (28.6% patients &gt;65 years in study A2307 compared to 18.2% in study A2201) and ethnic origin (10.4% of Black patients in study A2201 as compared  to  0.4%  in  study  A2307.  Study  A2307  had  in  contrast  a  higher  percentage  of  oriental patients, 13.7%, as compared to study A2201 (1.6%)).

Following  the  CHMP  assessment  of  these  data,  the  MAH  acknowledged  the  CHMP  comments  and revised the current wording in the product information to more accurately reflect the data generated in the multi-factorial Study A2201 and Study A2307. However, according to the MAH, the percentage of patients  in  active  treatment  groups  achieving  BP  control  (msDBP  &lt;90  mmHg)  could  be  considered similar  for  valsartan/amlodipine  80/5  mg  (39.1%)  [Study  2201]  and  amlodipine  10  mg  (37.5  %) [Study 2307] after adjusting for placebo control rates. The CHMP, however, considered the placebo control  rates  very  different:  33.9%  (studyA2201)  and  42.6%  (study  2307)  and  furthermore,  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MSDPB and msSPB reductions for amlodipine 10 mg do not seem comparable to valsartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg but seem to lie in between the results for amlodipine 5 mg and valsartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg. These facts indicate that it is not appropriate to compare the two studies with regard to BP results.

Consequently, the suggested amendment to the existing wording as proposed by the MAH in response to the CHMP Request for supplementary information, to more accurately reflect the data generated in the  multi-factorial  Study  A2201  and  Study  A2307,  and  the  mentioning  of  the  age  range  to  avoid ambiguity regarding the population studied in Study A2404 was rejected by the Committee:

' 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

(...)

Amlodipine/Valsartan

(...)

In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg  Patients  receiving  amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve blood pressure control  similar  to  amlodipine  10 mg  with  less  oedema.  In patients  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema, amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.

In  an  additional  active-controlled  study  of  1183  patients  aged  55  years  or  older  not  adequately controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg, amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/160  mg  produced  numerically  greater reductions in blood pressure compared to amlodipine 10 mg with a 4-fold lower incidence of peripheral oedema.'

Moreover, the CHMP was of the view that the existing paragraph, although previously accepted by the Committee by mistake, should be removed from the SmPC since it was considered that the text might be misleading for prescribers.

In conclusion, the wording suggested by the MAH as part of variation 2 is not acceptable to the CHMP. In addition, the already approved paragraph should for the reasons outlined above be deleted from the SmPC. As part of variation 2, the MAH took the opportunity to update the SmPC in line with the latest QRD template and to update the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet, which is acceptable.

## Variation 3

The MAH proposed the following wording in section 5.1 of the SmPC as part of variation 3:

a) ' In two additional active-controlled trials of 1612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and diuretics.'

and

- b) ' Age, gender, race, body mass index or diabetes status did not influence the response to Exforge .'

The first part of the variation:

a) With reference to efficacy in patients not adequately responding to any monotherapy, the MAH has submitted  studies  VAA  2401  and  VAA  US02  in  support  of  this  statement  and  these  studies  are summarised below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study VAA2401

A  double-blind,  randomized,  multicenter  study  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  combination  of valsartan and amlodipine in hypertensive patients not controlled on monotherapy.

The study was conducted in 118 centres in the USA, France, Spain, Canada, Norway, Belgium, Slovakia and Switzerland from February 2006 to January 2007.

The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of patients reaching blood pressure (BP) control, i.e. MSSBP &lt;140 mmHg and MSDBP &lt;90 mmHg for non-diabetics, or MSSBP &lt;130 and MSDBP &lt;80 for  diabetic  patients,  after  16  weeks  of  treatment  with  a  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10mg  treatment strategy or a valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg treatment strategy in hypertensive patients not controlled with monotherapy.

## Inclusion criteria:

- Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age;
- MSSBP of ≥ 140 mmHg and/or MSDBP ≥ 90 mmHg (Non-diabetic patients) / MSSBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or MSDBP ≥ 80 (Diabetic patients ) at Visits 1 and 2;
-  Patients  treated  with  monotherapy  at  a  dose  considered  as  adequate  by  the  investigator  for  a minimum of two months prior to Visit 1.

## Study design, 2401

<!-- image -->

The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control at endpoint (Week 16), defined as MSSBP/MSDBP &lt;140/90 mmHg for non-diabetic patients or &lt;130/80 mmHg for diabetic patients.

Secondary efficacy  variables were  the  proportion  of  patients  who  reached  blood  pressure  control  at Pre-HCTZ  Endpoint  (Week  8),  the  number  of  BP  controlled  patients  by  study  week;  change  from baseline in MSDBP and MSSBP, and diastolic BP control rate.

## Statistical methods:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT population. The unadjusted control rates (expressed as a percentage) for valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg and valsartan/amlodipine 160/10mg at Endpoint (Week  16,  LOCF)  were  presented  with  the  corresponding  asymptotic  two-sided  95%  confidence intervals. The proportion of controlled patients in each treatment group at endpoint was analyzed using a  logistic  regression  model.  Terms  for  treatment  and  diabetic  status  were  included  in  the  model (supplementary analysis). The point estimate for the odds ratio (valsartan/amlodipine 160/10mg vs. valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg) and two-sided 95% confidence interval were presented.

The null hypothesis was rejected and superiority was established if the p-value &lt;0.05.

The ITT population was defined as the randomised patients with at least 1 post baseline measurement and  consisted  of  440  (99.3%  of  randomised)  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5mg  arm  and  449 patients (99.6% of randomised) in the valsartan/amlodipine 160/10mg arm.

Protocol violations occurred in 24.8% of the patients in the valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg treatment strategy,  and  29.3%  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  treatment  strategy;  however,  few patients  had  major  protocol  violations,  and  they  occurred  at  similar  frequencies  in  both  treatment strategies.

Baseline characteristics: Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment arms. The mean age was 58.5 years (SD 12.17), 89.6 % of patients were &lt;75 years. 49.6 % were males. The mean (SD) MSSBP was 150.1 (10.11) mmHg, the mean (SD) MSDBP was 90.7 (7.65) mmHg.

Prior medication: ARBs 39.4%, ACE-inhibitors 22.1%, beta blockers 14.8%, calcium channel blockers 13.9%, diuretics 8.9%, other 0.9%.

## Results:

## Primary endpoint

The  proportion  of  patients  reaching  BP  control  after  16  weeks  of  treatment  was  slightly  higher  for valsartan/amlodipine 160/10mg (74.8%, 95%CI 70.82, 78.85) than for valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg (72.7%, 95%CI 68.57, 76.89).

Supplementary analysis: The estimated odds of being controlled at Endpoint Week 16 were 1.35 and 1.64 for  the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  and  160/10  mg  treatment  strategies,  respectively.  The estimated  odds  ratio  for  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  versus  160/10  mg  was  0.82,  favouring valsartan/amlodipine 160/10 mg over valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg.

## Study US02

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial to evaluate the blood pressure lowering efficacy comparing moderate versus aggressive treatment regimen of Exforge in patients uncontrolled on angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy.

The study was conducted in 140 centres in the USA from March 2008 to January 2009.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective of the study was to show that the aggressive Exforge treatment regimen was superior to the moderate Exforge treatment regimen with respect to change from baseline in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) at Week 4.

## Inclusion criteria:

- Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age;
-  Diagnosis of uncontrolled systolic hypertension prior to study randomization on ARB monotherapy. Patients must have had a MSSBP ≥ 150 mm Hg and &lt; 200 mm Hg ARB at Visits 1, 2, and 3 while either  naïve  to  antihypertensive  treatment  or  on  any  single  agent  antihypertensive  therapy  or  on monotherapy for a minimum period of 28 days prior to randomization.

## Study design, US02

<!-- image -->

The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in mean MSSBP. The main analysis time point was Week 4; other analysis time points were Weeks 2, 8, and 12.

The key secondary efficacy variable was change from baseline in MSDBP.

## Statistical methods:

To compare the mean change from baseline to Week 4 in MSSBP between the two treatment regimens, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was utilized with baseline MSSBP, treatment, olmesartan dosage in runin phase, and sub-study based stratum (Patients were classified into 3 strata based on which type of center they belonged to. The centers that made up the 3 strata for the primary analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were ABPM sub-study centers, AI sub-study centers, and centers that were neither ABPM (ambulatory BP monitoring)  nor AI (augmentation index) sub-study centers) as explanatory variables and with the change from baseline to Week 4 in MSSBP as the response variable. Based on this fitted model a twosided  95%  CI  for  the  mean  treatment  difference  between  the  two  treatment  regimens  and  the associated  p-value  was  obtained.  The  least-squared  means  of  each  treatment  arm  were  also computed.

[1] From a paired t-test to test if the mean change from baseline differed from zero within each treatment regimen.

[2] 95% CI for the mean change from baseline within each regimen.

[3] From an ANCOVA with baseline MSDBP, treatment, and olmesartan dosage in the Run-in phase and substudy based stratum as explanatory variables.

Note:  LOCF was used.  Baseline was not carried forward.

## Second part of the variation:

## b) With reference to efficacy not influenced by body mass index or diabetes status:

This  proposal  is  based  on  subgroup  analyses  from  the  9  studies  that  support  the  efficacy  of valsartan/amlodipine in hypertensive patients regardless of BMI or diabetes status.

This includes post-hoc analyses of 4 studies in the original submission [Study A2201], [Study A2305], [Study A2306] and [Study A2307], and the 5 studies completed since the marketing approval [Study A2401], [Study A2402], [Study A2403], [Study A2404] and [Study US02]. The continuous variables of change from baseline in MSSBP and MSDBP are displayed.

## Efficacy results by diabetic status:

The definition of diabetes varied across studies.  In [Study A2401], [Study A2402], [Study A2403] and [Study A2404], diabetes status came from a specific question on the Medical History case report form. In [Study A2201], [Study A2307], [Study A2305], and [Study A2306] diabetes status was determined according to concomitant medication use at baseline and medical history, using WHODRL and MedDRA terms in place at the time of the original Exforge submission.  In [Study US02], subgroup analyses based on diabetes status at baseline defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt; 126 mg/dL vs. FPG ≤ 126  mg/dL  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  variables.    Patient  diabetic  status  was determined post-hoc according to concomitant medication use at baseline and medical history, using WHODRL and MedDRA terms at the time of CSR completion.

Efficacy data were only analyzed within each study.  No pooling for efficacy analysis was performed because  of  the  differences  in  study  designs,  patient  populations,  and/or  doses  or  dosing  regimens across the trials.

The table below presents the raw mean changes from baseline at the primary endpoint (Week 8) in MSSBP and MSDBP by treatment and diabetic status in the previously submitted placebo-controlled trials  [Study  A2201]  and  [Study  A2307].    The  total  ITT  population  of  [Study  A2201]  included  198 (10.4%) diabetics.    The  total  ITT  population  of  [Study  A2307]  included  119  (9.6%)  diabetics.    The combinations  of  valsartan/amlodipine  studied  were  effective  in  reducing  MSDBP  and  MSSBP  in comparison with placebo regardless of diabetic status.

The table below presents the raw mean changes from baseline at the primary endpoint in MSSBP and MSDBP by treatment and diabetic status in the two trials completed since the marketing approval in patients with stage 2 hypertension.  The time points of interest are considered to be Weeks 4 and 8 in [Study A2402] (conducted in Black patients) and Week 4 in [Study A2403].  In study A2402, Week 4 was important because it was the last visit that valsartan/amlodipine 160/10 mg was administered and Week 8 was important because it was the last visit before HCTZ could be added.  In Study A2403, Week  8  was  important  because  it  was  the  last  visit  before  HCTZ  could  be  added.    The  total  ITT population of [Study A2402] included 85 (15.3%) diabetics.  The total ITT population of [Study A2403] included 70 (11.0%) diabetics.  Greater reductions in both MSSBP and MSDBP were observed with the combinations  of  valsartan/amlodipine  studied  compared  to  amlodipine  monotherapy  regardless  of diabetic status.

The table below shows the change from baseline in MSSBP and MSDBP at primary endpoint (Week 8) by treatment regimen and diabetic status in [Study A2404].  Diabetics (n=201) comprised 17.2% of the ITT population of this study.  To be eligible for randomization in this study, patients had to have an inadequate response to amlodipine 5 mg with an MSSBP ≥ 130 mmHg and ≤ 160  mmHg, which is lower  than  all  other  studies.    The  reductions  in  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  were  numerically  greater  with valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg than with amlodipine 10 mg regardless of diabetes status

The table below presents the raw mean changes from baseline at the primary endpoint (Week 9, after 8 weeks of treatment) in MSSBP and MSDBP by treatment and diabetic status in the two previously submitted reference therapy-controlled, non-responder trials, [Study A2305] and [Study A2306].  The total ITT population of [Study A2305] included 51 (5.4%) diabetics.  The total ITT population of [Study A2306] included 34 (3.6%) diabetics.  In [Study A2305], greater reductions in blood pressure were observed  with  the  combinations  of  valsartan/amlodipine  compared  to  monotherapy  regardless  of diabetic status. The contrary was observed in [Study A2306] which may have been due to the small numbers of diabetic patients.

## Efficacy results by BMI

The table below presents the raw mean changes from baseline at the primary endpoint (Week 8) in MSSBP  and  MSDBP  by  treatment  and  BMI  category  (obese  =  BMI  30  kg/m 2 )  in  the  previously submitted placebo-controlled trials.  The total ITT population of [Study A2201] included 946 (49.8%) obese patients.  The total ITT population of [Study A2307] included 384 (30.8%) obese patients.  The combinations  of  valsartan/amlodipine  studied  were  effective  in  reducing  MSDBP  and  MSSBP  in comparison with placebo regardless of BMI category.  Further, for the vast majority of combination dose  groups,  each  component  of  the  combination  therapies  appeared  to  contribute  to  the  total antihypertensive effect of the combination regardless of BMI category.

The table below presents the raw mean changes from baseline at the primary endpoint (Week 4 for [Study US02]; Week 8 for [Study A2401]) in MSSBP and MSDBP by treatment and BMI category in the two trials completed since the marketing approval.  The total ITT population of [Study A2401] included 350 (39.6%) obese patients.  The total ITT population of [Study US02] included 401 (55.5%) obese patients.  Clinically relevant reductions in MSDBP and MSSBP from baseline were observed with each of the  dose  combinations  of  valsartan/amlodipine,  regardless  of  BMI  category.    The  reductions  were similar in both studies regardless of BMI category.

The table below presents the raw mean changes from baseline at the primary endpoint in MSSBP and MSDBP in the two trials completed since the marketing approval in patients with stage 2 hypertension. For  this  CO  Addendum,  the  timepoints  of  interest  were  considered  to  be  Weeks  4  and  8  in  [Study A2402] (conducted in Black patients) and Week 4 in [Study A2403].  In Study A2402, Week 4 was important  because  it  was  the  last  visit  that  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  was  administered  and Week 8 was important because it was the last visit before HCTZ could be added.  In Study A2403, Week  8  was  important  because  it  was  the  last  visit  before  HCTZ  could  be  added.      The  total  ITT population of [Study A2402] included 321 (58.2%) obese patients.  The total ITT population of [Study A2403] included 279 (43.7%) obese patients.  The combination of valsartan/amlodipine studied was effective in reducing MSDBP and MSSBP in comparison with the active amlodipine control regardless of BMI  category.    The  mean  reductions  at  Week  4,  which  was  common  to  both  studies,  were  similar regardless of BMI category.

The table below shows the change from baseline in MSSBP and MSDBP at the primary endpoint (Week 8) by treatment regimen and BMI category in [Study A2404].  The total ITT population included 417 (36.1%)  obese  patients.    To  be  eligible  for  randomization  in  this  study,  patients  had  to  have  an inadequate response to amlodipine 5 mg with a MSSBP ≥ 130 mmHg and ≤ 160 mmHg, which is lower than all other studies.  The reductions in MSSBP were numerically greater with valsartan/amlodipine 160/5  mg  than  with  amlodipine  10  mg  in  both  obese  and  non-obese  patients.    Clinically  relevant reductions in MSDBP were observed in both treatment groups in both obese and non-obese patients. The  reductions  in  MSDBP  were  numerically  greater  with  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  than  with amlodipine 10 mg in the non-obese but not the obese subgroup.

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy - Variation 3

## Study 2401:

The  study  was  not  conducted  in  line  with  the  authorised  indication  as  patients  with  any  previous hypertensive monotherapy medication could be included. Patients treated with monotherapy \"at a dose considered  as  adequate  by  the  investigator\"  for  a  minimum  of  two  months  could  be  included.  This inclusion criterion is not meaningful; it is too large and unspecific in order to allow for any conclusions to be drawn on the target population.

At visit 2 (randomization) patients discontinued their previous medication and were randomized to the study medication; either val/aml 160/10 mg or val/aml 160/5 mg. Both treatment arms had the option to add HCTZ stepwise after 8 weeks if BP was uncontrolled.

The difference in discontinuations is striking in both arms, being 17% in the 160/10 mg arm and 8% in the 160/5 mg arm. The main reasons for discontinuations were adverse events.

The primary endpoint is not relevant for this variation as it is influenced by the addition of HCTZ. The applicant has also presented changes in MSSBP and MSDBP from baseline at different time points in order to be consistent in the analyses for this variation application (this was a secondary endpoint). However, this information is hardly relevant as there was no wash-out phase (before initiation of study treatment) and the baseline is an expression of previous varying monotherapy and dosages, i.e. not in accordance with the authorised indication. Furthermore due to the large differences in discontinuations between the treatment groups, LOCF may not be the appropriate way to address missing data.

## Study US02:

Naïve  patients  and  patients  who  remained  uncontrolled  with  regard  to  systolic  hypertension  on  any single antihypertensive medication other than ARBs were eligible for the run-in phase (treatment with olmesartan 20mg and 40mg, respectively, for 28 days). Patients treated with ARB monotherapy (other than  valsartan  [Diovan])  for  28  days  who  remained  uncontrolled  were  eligible  for  the  double-blind phase. This means that the conditions prior to randomisation were different, either there was a run-in therapy with 2 different doses of olmesartan or patients could directly enter the double-blind phase if being  treated  with  another  ARB  than  valsartan  for  28  days.  This  is  not  in  line  with  the  authorised indication.  Apart  from  this  deviation,  only  one  of  the  treatment  arms  in  the  double-blind  phase  is considered relevant from an EU perspective. The \"moderate\" dose of 160/5 mg is authorised, whereas

the comparator arm with the \"aggressive\" dose of 320/5 mg (with forced titration to 320/10 mg after 2 weeks) is not. With reference to the 160/5 mg dose, only the first 4 weeks of the double-blind period are relevant due to the forced titration thereafter with HCTZ.

Discontinuations were almost comparable between treatment groups, but discontinuations due to AEs were  doubled  in  the  160/5  mg  group  as  compared  to  the  320/5  mg  group,  which  appears  rather bizarre.

Both  studies  (2401  and  US02)  that  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  proposed  change  in  5.1 concerning  the  efficacy  in  patients  not  adequately  responding  to  any  monotherapy  including  ACE inhibitors,  ARBs,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and  diuretics  were  not  conducted  in accordance with the authorised indication, i.e. in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy. This is not in accordance with the SmPC guideline which states the following: \"…Such  information  on  clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should summarise  evidence  from  relevant  studies  supporting  the  indication.\" Furthermore,  the  proposed statement may encourage prescribers to off-label prescriptions of Exforge.

Further,  the  submitted  studies  were  not  conducted  in  an  appropriate  way  to  support  the  proposed statement. Deficiencies relate to inclusion criteria, conduct of the study and handling of data.

## The proposed statement:

\"In two additional active-controlled trials of 1612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and diuretics\"

is therefore not acceptable.

## Diabetic patients:

The Applicant has presented subgroup analyses from the 9 studies submitted to support the efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine in hypertensive patients regardless of diabetes status.

Patients with type 1 diabetes as well as patients with type 2 diabetes and poor glucose control were excluded from these studies.

As mentioned by the applicant the definition of diabetes was not universal across the studies:

\"The definition of diabetes varied across studies.  In [Study A2401], [Study A2402], [Study A2403] and [Study A2404], diabetes status came from a specific question on the Medical History case report form.    In  [Study  A2201],  [Study  A2307],  [Study  A2305],  and  [Study  A2306]  diabetes  status  was determined according to concomitant medication use at baseline and medical history, using WHODRL and MedDRA terms in place at the time of the original Exforge submission.  In [Study US02], subgroup analyses based on diabetes status at baseline defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt; 126 mg/dL vs FPG ≤ 126 mg/dL were performed for the primary and secondary variables.  For the purpose of the diabetes  analyses  performed  for  this  Clinical  Overview  Addendum,  patient  diabetic  status  was determined post-hoc according to concomitant medication use at baseline and medical history, using WHODRL and MedDRA terms at the time of CSR completion.\"

Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made by WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria for fasting glucose levels (plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126mg/dL) or plasma glucose levels 2-hours after 75 mg oral glucose load of ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL), or newly diagnosed with mixed meal tolerance test or oral glucose tolerance screening or casual glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL) with symptoms.

As a consequence, diabetic status in the studies referred to is therefore not necessarily confirmed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As mentioned previously, studies 2401, US02, 2402 and 2403 were not conducted in accordance with the authorised indication. It is therefore not considered justified to claim any inclusions in the SmPC based  on  post  hoc  subgroup  analyses  concerning  diabetic  status  based  on  the  results  from  these studies.  Notwithstanding  this  fact,  the  reductions  in  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  in  studies  2401  and  US02 seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients.

In study 2402 the week 8 analyses for the val/aml combination is of limited value, as patients could be uptitrated from 160/10 mg to 320/10 mg at week 4.

Also in study 2404 the presented analyses were not pre-specified. Also in this study the reduction in MSSBP and MSDBP seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients.

In  the  previously  submitted  studies  2201,  2307,  2305  and  2306  the  subgroup  analyses  by  diabetic status are based on very small numbers of patients by treatment group (n=8-18)  which do not allow for strong conclusions.

In summary, the presented post-hoc analyses do not justify the inclusion of a statement regarding the efficacy of Exforge by diabetic status for the following reasons: 1) Different definitions were used to determine diabetic status; 2) The post-hoc analyses were either based on very small patient numbers (studies  2201,  2307,  2305,  2306),  or  were  based  on  studies  not  conducted  in  accordance  with  the authorised indication; 3) The efficacy of Exforge does not seem as good in diabetic patients as in nondiabetic subjects.

These  analyses  do  therefore  not  justify  the  inclusion  of  the  proposed  statement  in  section  5.1 regarding the efficacy of Exforge by diabetic status.

## BMI:

The MAH has presented subgroup analyses for obese patients with BMI &gt;30 and patients with BMI &lt; 30.  Focussing  on  the  studies  that  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  authorised  indication  the proportion  of  obese  patients  with  BMI  &gt;  30  was  in  the  range  of  30  -50%.  Although  no  statistical analyses were presented, the anti-hypertensive effect of Exforge seemed similar in obese- and nonobese subjects. The presented information on reduction in MSSBP and MSDBP are considered sufficient to allow a statement on response to Exforge by BMI to be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC with the following modification:

\"Age, gender, race, or body mass index ( ≥ 30kg/m 2 , &lt;30kg/m 2 ) or diabetes status did not influence the response to Exforge.

## 2.2.2. Clinical safety

The  safety  of  valsartan/amlodipine  was  thoroughly  evaluated  during  the  assessment  of  the  initial marketing authorisation application and re-assessed in each of the PSURs submitted since approval of val/aml  fixed  dose  combination  in  the  EU.    The  double-blind,  active-  or  placebo-controlled  safety population in the original submission [Study A2201], [Study A2307], [Study A2305], [Study A2306], and [Study A2308] included 5175 patients, 2613 of whom received valsartan/amlodipine treatment. The studies completed since the granting of the marketing authorisation included 4014 patients, 2815 of  whom  received  valsartan/amlodipine  treatment.  These  studies  had  a  double-blind  treatment duration ranging from 8-16 weeks.

The  focus  of  the  safety  data  presented  in  the  current  dossier  is  the  additional  safety  information provided for the use of valsartan/amlodipine in diabetics and obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2); this includes safety data from 10 studies (2 placebo-controlled and 3 reference therapy-controlled studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from the original MAA, and the 5 reference therapy-controlled studies completed since the approval of the MAA). The data presented below represent the safety population.

## Subgroup assessment of AEs according to diabetic status (yes/no)

The definition of diabetes varied across studies (please refer to the efficacy section above for variation 3).  The proportion of patients with diabetes in the 5 studies completed since the approval of the MAA and the controlled trials dataset from the original dossier ranged from 7.9-17.2%.

## AEs by diabetic status in patients with stage 2 hypertension and in Black patients

## Study A2402, Black patients:

This study included 88 diabetics (15.4%).  The overall incidence of AEs in patients receiving val/aml was  similar  in  diabetic  (44.7%)  and  non-diabetic  (44.4%)  patients.  The  most  common  AEs  in  the valsartan/amlodipine  diabetic  group  were  bronchitis,  fatigue  and  headache,  each  reported  for  2 patients (4.3%). The only AE reported more frequently in diabetic patients in both the valsartan/amlodipine and amlodipine group was muscle spasms (2.1% and 4.9%, respectively).

## Study A2403, stage II hypertension:

This  study  included  71  diabetics  (11.0%).  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving valsartan/amlodipine was similar in diabetic (34.3%) and non-diabetic (35.3%) patients with the most common AEs in the valsartan/amlodipine diabetic group being peripheral oedema (n=5 (14.3%)) and pain in extremity (n=2 (5.7%)).

## Study A2404, Patients inadequately controlled on Amlodipine 5 mg alone:

This  study  included  204  diabetics  (17.2%).    The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving valsartan/amlodipine was similar in diabetic (41.5%) and non-diabetic (44.4%) patients with the most common AEs in the valsartan/amlodipine diabetic group being peripheral oedema (n=5 (4.7%)) and rhinitis (n= 4 (3.8%)).

## AEs by diabetic status in non-responder trials

## Study A2401, Patients inadequately controlled on monotherapy:

This  study  included  146  diabetics  (16.3%).  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  total  population  of patients  receiving  valsartan/amlodipine  was  slightly  higher  in  diabetics  (53.4%)  vs.  non-diabetics (48.5%). The most frequently reported AEs in the overall valsartan/amlodipine diabetic subgroup were peripheral oedema (n=24 (16.4%)), back pain (n=6 (4.1%), hypotension (n=4 (2.7%)), and muscle spasms (n= 4 (2.7%).

## Study US02, Patients inadequeately controlled on ARB monotherapy:

This  study  included  125  diabetics  (17.2%).    The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving valsartan/amlodipine  was  similar  in  diabetic  (38.4%)  and  non-diabetic  (36.7%)  patients.    The  most frequently reported AEs in the overall valsartan/amlodipine diabetic subgroup were peripheral oedema (n=8 (6.4%)) and dizziness (n=4 (3.2%))

## AEs by diabetic status in reference- and placebo-controlled trials in the original submission

In the original submission diabetic status was available for 5175 patients in the total safety population of  the  pooled  studies  ([Study  A2201],  [Study  A2307],  [Study  A2305],  [Study A2306],  and  [Study A2308]). The overall incidence of AEs in patients receiving valsartan/amlodipine was slightly higher in diabetic (47.1%) vs. non-diabetic (41.7%) patients. Peripheral oedema (5.3%) and headache (5.3%) were  the  most  common  AEs  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  diabetic  subgroup,  both  frequencies  being lower than in the valsartan/amlodipine non-diabetic subgroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subgroup assessment of adverse events according to BMI ( ≥ 30 and &lt; 30 kg/m2)

## AEs by BMI category in patients with stage 2 hypertension and in Black patients

## Study A2402, Black patients:

This study included 333 obese patients (58.6%). The overall incidence of AEs in patients receiving both valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  was  slightly  greater  in  obese  compared  to  non-obese  patients (47.6% vs. 40.2% and 46.1% vs. 44.9%, respectively). The most common AE in obese and non-obese patients  was  peripheral  oedema  (14.9%  vs.  9.4%  (valsartan/amlodipine)  and  10.9%  vs.  7.6% (amlodipine).

## Study A2403, stage II hypertension:

This  study included 280 obese patients (43.5%).  The overall incidence of AEs in patients receiving both  valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  was  slightly  greater  in  obese  patients  compared  to  nonobese patients (41.0% vs. 31.0% and 39.0% vs. 35.0%, respectively). The most common AE in obese and non-obese patients was peripheral oedema (14.9% vs. 11.2% (valsartan/amlodipine) and 16.4% vs.18.2% (amlodipine).

## Study A2404, Patients inadequately controlled on Amlodipine 5 mg alone:

This  study included 425 obese patients (36.3%).  The overall incidence of AEs in patients receiving both valsartan/amlodipine and amlodipine was 49.3% vs. 40.9% and 65.3% vs. 50.6% in obese vs. non-obese,  respectively.  The  most  common  AE  in  obese  and  non-obese  patients  was  peripheral oedema (7.9% vs. 7.0% (valsartan/amlodipine) and 38.8% vs. 27.5% (amlodipine).

## AEs by BMI in non-responder trials

## Study A2401, Patients inadequately controlled on monotherapy:

This study included 352 (39.7%) obese patients. The overall incidence of AEs in the total population of patients  receiving  valsartan/amlodipine  was  53.7%  vs.  46.4%  in  obese  vs.  non-obese  patients.  In obese and non-obese patients, the most common AE in the overall valsartan/amlodipine group was peripheral oedema (18.5% vs. 15.5%).

## Study US02, Patients inadequately controlled on ARB monotherapy:

This  study  included  404  obese  patients  (55.6%)  included  404  obese  patients  (55.6%).    The  overall incidence of AEs in the total valsartan/amlodipine population was slightly higher in obese (39.1%) vs. non-obese (34.1%) patients.  In obese and non-obese patients, the most common AE was peripheral oedema 7.2% vs. 5.9%).

## AEs by BMI category in reference-therapy and placebo-controlled studies in the original submission

In the total safety population of the pooled studies in the original submission ([Study A2201], [Study A2307], [Study A2305], [Study A2306], and [Study A2308]) 2187 patients (42.5%) were obese (BMI data was available for 5149 patients). 42.8% were obese among patients treated with valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine.  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  slightly  greater  in  obese compared to non-obese patients in all treatment groups, including placebo. In both obese and nonobese patients, peripheral oedema and headache were the most common AEs overall. The incidence of peripheral  oedema  was  less  in  both  obese  and  non-obese  patients  receiving  valsartan/amlodipine regimens compared to amlodipine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Deaths and other serious or clinically significant adverse events

No deaths occurred in any of the studies completed since the original submission.

## Discussion on Clinical Safety

The  safety  data  presented  in  the  submitted  dossier  provides  supportive  safety  data  from  five  new valsartan/amlodipine randomized, controlled studies. No new or altered safety signals have emerged from the new trials. Safety data have also been provided for sub-groups with and with-out diabetes as well  as  obese  and  non-obese  patients  ( ≥ 30  and  &lt;  30  kg/m2).  Though  obese  patients  had  higher frequencies of overall AEs than non-obese no clinically relevant differences were observed in the safety profile  of  valsartan/amlodipine  in  diabetics  and  obese  patients  when  compared  to  the  patient populations with-out these clinical entities.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion

## Variation 1:

The scope of this variation was the update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on efficacy in patients with stage 2 hypertension and in black patients based on studies VAA 2402 and VAA 2403.

Studies  2402  and  2403  were  submitted  to  support  efficacy  in  patients  with  grade  2  systolic hypertension  and  study  2402  was  conducted  in  Black  patients.    Several  deficiencies  relating  to  the study designs for both studies have been identified. In both studies valsartan/amlodipine 160/10 mg seems more effective than amlodipine 10 mg in the treatment of systolic hypertension &gt;160mmHg and &lt;200mmHg  in  a  population  that  was  either  treatment  naïve  or  was  treated  with  non-specified antihypertensives. This means that in neither study 2402 nor in study 2403 patients were treated in accordance with the authorised indication, as Exforge is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  or  valsartan  monotherapy.  The  SmPC  is  a  document  that provides  information  on  a  particular  medicinal  product  and  is  not  issued  as  a  general  treatment recommendation.  The  SmPC  guideline  states  in  section  5.1  clinical  efficacy  and  safety: 'It  may  be appropriate  to  provide  limited  information,  relevant  to  the  prescriber,  such  as  the  main  results (statistically compelling and clinically relevant) regarding pre-specified end points or clinical outcomes in the major trials…… supporting the indication.'

Furthermore, final judgement on efficacy cannot be made as the relevant analyses were made after 2 weeks  of  treatment  which  is  considered  too  short.  According  to  the  guideline  on  the  clinical investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  hypertension  (CHMP/EWP/238/95  Rev.2  and EMA//238/1995/rev.3) a tested dose should remain stable for at least 4 weeks.

In summary, the provided studies are not considered sufficiently robust and are not in line with the authorised indication. As a consequence, the wording that was proposed by the MAH:

\"In two additional active-controlled studies of 1,612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and diuretics.

## Active controlled trials in stage 2 hypertensive patients

Two active-controlled studies of 1,195 patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and  &lt;200 mmHg  were  conducted.  In  the  first  study  in  639  patients  (baseline  blood  pressure 171/95 mmHg),  an  Exforge  regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  30/13 mmHg  compared  to  24/9 mmHg with a similar regimen of amlodipine 5 mg force-titrated to 10 mg. The second active-controlled study,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

specifically  designed  to  evaluate  the efficacy  of  Exforge  in  556  black  patients,  compared  an  Exforge regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  with  a  similar  regimen  of amlodipine  5 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg.  In  this  study  (baseline  blood  pressure  171/98 mmHg), Exforge  significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  31/13 mmHg  compared  to 27/11 mmHg with amlodipine.\"

can therefore not be accepted.

In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed not to pursue the proposed wording.

## Variation 2

The scope of this variation was the update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on the efficacy and  safety  of  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  compared  to  amlodipine  10  mg  based  on  study  VAA 2404.

The  proposed  wording  in  section  5.1  focuses  on  the  efficacy  of  valsartan/amlodipine  compared  to amlodipine alone in the context of oedema incidence rather than on the oedema incidence itself as described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. According to the MAH, this information provided in section 5.1 is relevant  for  prescribers  as  it  presents  efficacy  of  valsartan/amlodipine  in  the  approved  doses  of  5 mg/80  mg  and  5  mg/160  mg  as  a  benefit  in  relation  to  oedema  incidence  versus  amlodipine  in monotherapy. Thus, the proposed SmPC wording provides additional reassurance to the prescriber on efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine fixed combination in relation to oedema reduction.

Oedema  was  significantly  more  frequent  in  the  amlodipine  monotherapy  group.  In  this  respect,  it should also be kept in mind that only patients 55 years or older were included in the study. Oedema is dose-dependent with amlodipine therapy and the  clearance  of  amlodipine  is  reduced  in  the  elderly, resulting in a higher exposure. It is therefore likely that the incidence of amlodipine in this study may be exaggerated due to the chosen study population.

The  MAH  acknowledged  that  patients  aged  55  years  and  over  were  selected  in  Study  A2404  to demonstrate the effect of valsartan/amlodipine compared to amlodipine monotherapy on the reduction of  oedema  incidence.  According  to  the  MAH,  as  recognised  by  guidelines  for  the  management  of arterial hypertension, the patient population selected in Study A2404 ( ≥ 55 years old) is representative of the hypertensive population at risk. Age (men &gt;55 years; women &gt;65 years) is considered a factor influencing prognosis of cardiovascular risk and should be used to stratify the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Older  patients  may  be  more  prone  to  develop  peripheral  oedema  on  non-dihydropyridine calcium  channel  blockers  due  to  the  effects  of  aging  on  the  peripheral  vasculature.  Therefore, according  to  the  MAH,  this  is  the  population  that  may  have  the  greatest  benefit  with  respect  to attenuation in the development of oedema but does not preclude a benefit in younger patients.

Albeit statistically significant, the differences in BP reductions between valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg and  amlodipine  10  mg  are  not  exceptionally  different  and  there  is  no  obvious  reason  to  insert  a statement  on  ' numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine  10  mg' , derived from a not completely recognized subgroup of patients with hypertension (those &gt;55 years), into section 5.1 of the SmPC. In spite of the fact that the age of &gt;55 years is an agreed risk factor for males for CV disease (65 years for females), it is not recognized as a subgroup for hypertension trials.

The SmPC guideline states on section 5.1:

'…It may be appropriate to provide limited information, relevant to the prescriber, such as the main results  (statistically  compelling  and  clinically  relevant)  regarding  pre-specified  end  points  or  clinical outcomes  in  the  major  trials,  and  giving  the  main  characteristics  of  the  patient  population.  Such information on clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should  summarise evidence from relevant studies supporting the indication. The magnitude of effects should be described

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

using  absolute  figures.  (Relative  risks  or  odd  ratio  should  not  be  presented  without  absolute figures)….'

Consequently,  as  mentioned  above  with  reference  to  the  SmPC  guideline,  the  efficacy  part  of  the proposed wording is not considered appropriate. Therefore, the proposed wording (highlighted):

'In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5 mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema and amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg  produced  numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine 10 mg  with  a  4-fold  lower  incidence  of  peripheral  oedema.  In  patients  adequately  controlled  on amlodipine 10 mg but who experience unacceptable oedema, amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.'

is not acceptable to the CHMP and thus the context of the proposed safety information on oedema is not relevant. The existing information on oedema in section 4.8 of the SmPC is regarded sufficient for prescribers.

Furthermore,  during  the  procedure  the  CHMP  questioned  the  validity  of  the  already  existing  SmPC wording in section 5.1:

'In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.'

Upon request by the CHMP, the MAH clarified that this wording was based on data collected from the two multi-factorial studies [Study A2201] and [Study A2307] submitted as part of the original MAA for the fixed dose combination valsartan/amlodipine.

Following the assessment of all data provided, the CHMP did not consider it appropriate to compare two  different  studies  in  order  to  obtain  a  statement  on  BP  results  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  The studies  are  not  considered  completely  comparable  with  respect  to  the  included  patient  population which is demonstrated by the differences in age categories (28.6% patients &gt;65 years in study A2307 compared to 18.2% in study A2201) and ethnic origin (10.4% of Black patients in study A2201 as compared  to  0.4%  in  study  A2307.  Study  A2307  had  in  contrast  a  higher  percentage  of  oriental patients, 13.7%, as compared to study A2201 (1.6%)).

Following  the  CHMP  assessment  of  these  data,  the  MAH  acknowledged  the  CHMP  comments  and revised the current product information wording to more accurately reflect the data generated in the multi-factorial  Study  A2201  and  Study  A2307.  However,  according  to  the  MAH,  the  percentage  of patients  in  active  treatment  groups  achieving  BP  control  (msDBP  &lt;90  mmHg)  could  be  considered similar  for  valsartan/amlodipine  80/5  mg  (39.1%)  [Study  2201]  and  amlodipine  10  mg  (37.5  %) [Study 2307] after adjusting for placebo control rates. The CHMP, however, considered the placebo control  rates  very  different:  33.9%  (studyA2201)  and  42.6%  (study  2307)  and  furthermore,  the MSDPB and msSPB reductions for amlodipine 10 mg do not seem comparable to valsartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg but seem to lie in between the results for amlodipine 5 mg and valsartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg. These facts indicate that it is not appropriate to compare the two studies with regard to BP results.

Consequently,  the  amendment  to  the  existing  wording  as  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  response  to  the CHMP Request for supplementary information,  to  more  accurately  reflect  the  data  generated  in  the multi-factorial Study A2201 and Study A2307, and the mentioning of the age range to avoid ambiguity regarding the population studied in Study A2404 was rejected by the Committee:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

```
' 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties (...) Amlodipine/Valsartan (...)
```

In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg  Patients  receiving  amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve blood pressure control  similar  to  amlodipine  10 mg  with  less  oedema.  In patients  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema, amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.

In  an  additional  active-controlled  study  of  1183  patients  aged  55  years  or  older  not  adequately controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg, amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/160  mg  produced  numerically  greater reductions in blood pressure compared to amlodipine 10 mg with a 4-fold lower incidence of peripheral oedema.'

Moreover, the CHMP was of the view that the existing paragraph, although previously accepted by the Committee by mistake, should be removed from the SmPC since it was considered that the text might be misleading for prescribers:

'In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.'

In conclusion, the wording suggested by the MAH as part of variation 2 is not acceptable to the CHMP. In addition, the already approved paragraph should for the reasons outlined above be deleted from the SmPC. As part of variation 2, the MAH also took the opportunity to update the SmPC in line with the latest QRD template, including a revision of the presentation of the ADRs in section 4.8, and to update the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet, which is acceptable.

In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed not to pursue the proposed wording.

## Variation 3

This variation had several scopes:

The update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on efficacy in patients

-  not adequately responding to any monotherapy and in
-  obese and diabetic patients

based on studies VAA 2401, VAA 2402,VAA 2403, VAA 2404 and VAA US02 (as well as original dossier studies VAA 2201, VAA 2305, VAA 2306, VAA 2307 and VAA 2308).

Regarding the first part of the variation:

Both  studies  (2401  and  US02)  that  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  proposed  change  in  5.1 concerning  the  efficacy  in  patients  not  adequately  responding  to  any  monotherapy  including  ACE inhibitors,  ARBs,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and  diuretics  were  not  conducted  in accordance with the authorised indication, i.e. in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine or valsartan  monotherapy.  This  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  SPC  guideline  which  states  the  following \"…Such  information  on  clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should summarise  evidence  from  relevant  studies  supporting  the  indication.\"  Furthermore,  the  proposed statement may encourage prescribers to off-label prescriptions of Exforge.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further,  the  submitted  studies  were  not  conducted  in  an  appropriate  way  to  support  the  proposed statement. Deficiencies relate to inclusion criteria, conduct of the study and handling of data.

## The proposed statement:

\"In two additional active-controlled trials of 1612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and diuretics\"

## is therefore not acceptable.

In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH decided to accept the comments regarding 'efficacy  in  patients  not  adequately  responding  to  any  monotherapy'  and  agreed  not  to  pursue  the proposed wording as part of variation 3.

## Regarding the second part of the variation:

## Diabetic patients:

The Applicant has presented subgroup analyses from the 9 studies submitted to support the efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine in hypertensive patients regardless of diabetes status.

Patients with type 1 diabetes as well as patients with type 2 diabetes and poor glucose control were excluded from these studies.

As mentioned by the applicant the definition of diabetes was not universal across the studies:

\"The definition of diabetes varied across studies.  In [Study A2401], [Study A2402], [Study A2403] and [Study A2404], diabetes status came from a specific question on the Medical History case report form.    In  [Study  A2201],  [Study  A2307],  [Study  A2305],  and  [Study  A2306]  diabetes  status  was determined according to concomitant medication use at baseline and medical history, using WHODRL and MedDRA terms in place at the time of the original Exforge submission.  In [Study US02], subgroup analyses based on diabetes status at baseline defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt; 126 mg/dL vs FPG ≤ 126 mg/dL were performed for the primary and secondary variables.  For the purpose of the diabetes  analyses  performed  for  this  Clinical  Overview  Addendum,  patient  diabetic  status  was determined post-hoc according to concomitant medication use at baseline and medical history, using WHODRL and MedDRA terms at the time of CSR completion.\"

Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made by WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria for fasting glucose levels (plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126mg/dL) or plasma glucose levels 2-hours after 75 mg oral glucose load of ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL), or newly diagnosed with mixed meal tolerance test or oral glucose tolerance screening or casual glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL) with symptoms.

As a consequence, diabetic status in the studies referred to is therefore not necessarily confirmed.

As mentioned previously, studies 2401, US02, 2402 and 2403 were not conducted in accordance with the authorised indication. It is therefore not considered justified to claim any inclusions in the SmPC based  on  post  hoc  subgroup  analyses  concerning  diabetic  status  based  on  the  results  from  these studies.  Notwithstanding  this  fact,  the  reductions  in  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  in  studies  2401  and  US02 seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients.

In study 2402 the week 8 analyses for the val/aml combination is of limited value, as patients could be uptitrated from 160/10 mg to 320/10 mg at week 4.

Also in study 2404 the presented analyses were not pre-specified. Also in this study the reduction in MSSBP and MSDBP seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  previously  submitted  studies  2201,  2307,  2305  and  2306  the  subgroup  analyses  by  diabetic status are based on very small numbers of patients by treatment group (n=8-18)  which do not allow for strong conclusions.

In summary, the presented post-hoc analyses do not justify the inclusion of a statement regarding the efficacy of Exforge by diabetic status for the following reasons: 1) Different definitions were used to determine diabetic status; 2) The post-hoc analyses were either based on very small patient numbers (studies  2201,  2307,  2305,  2306),  or  were  based  on  studies  not  conducted  in  accordance  with  the authorised indication; 3) The efficacy of Exforge does not seem as good in diabetic patients as in nondiabetic subjects.

These  analyses  do  therefore  not  justify  the  inclusion  of  the  proposed  statement  in  section  5.1 regarding the efficacy of Exforge by diabetic status.

In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed not to pursue the proposed wording in diabetic patients.

## BMI:

The MAH has presented subgroup analyses for obese patients with BMI &gt;30 and patients with BMI &lt; 30.  Focussing  on  the  studies  that  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  authorised  indication  the proportion  of  obese  patients  with  BMI  &gt;  30  was  in  the  range  of  30  -50%.  Although  no  statistical analyses were presented, the anti-hypertensive effect of Exforge seemed similar in obese- and nonobese subjects. The presented information on reduction in MSSBP and MSDBP are considered sufficient to allow a statement on response to Exforge by BMI to be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC with the following modification:

\"Age, gender, race, or body mass index ( ≥ 30kg/m 2 , &lt;30kg/m 2 ) or diabetes status did not influence the response to Exforge.

Following the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed to revise the proposed wording as requested by the CHMP.

## 3. Conclusion

WS-0100-G was submitted for a group of variations consisting of three Type II variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

- Update of the current paragraph in section 5.1 of the SmPC that provides information on the relative efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg in relation to the incidence of oedema. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the SmPC in line with the latest QRD template and to update the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

- Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on efficacy in obese patients based on studies VAA 2401, VAA 2402, VAA 2403, VAA 2404 and VAA US02 (as well as original dossier studies VAA 2201, VAA 2305, VAA 2306, VAA 2307 and VAA 2308).

And the following variation for the following medicinal products was considered not to be acceptable by the CHMP on the following grounds:
