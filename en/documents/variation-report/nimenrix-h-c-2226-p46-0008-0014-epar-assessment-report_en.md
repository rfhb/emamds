## Annex Clinical Study Report for Study 107402 (MENACWY-TT-018 EXT: 015 Y3) (Development Phase IIb)

A phase IIb, open, randomised, controlled primary vaccination study to evaluate the non-inferiority and the persistence of the immune response of GSK Biologicals' meningococcal serogroup ACWY conjugate vaccine given intramuscularly versus Mencevax ACWY given subcutaneously to healthy subjects aged 11 to 55 years of age.

Note: This study consists of two phases: the vaccination phase (107386 [MENACWYTT- 015]) and the long-term persistence phase 1 to 5 years after vaccination (studies 107392 [MENACWY-TT-016 EXT: 015 Y1]; 107398 [MENACWY-TT-017 EXT: 015 Y2]; 107402 [MENACWY-TT-018 EXT: 015 Y3]; 107404 [MENACWY-TT-019 EXT: 015 Y4] and 107406 [MENACWY-TT-020 EXT: 015 Y5], respectively). This report presents the persistence results 3 years after vaccination (107402 (MENACWY-TT-018 EXT: 015 Y3)). A full report describing the persistence results for years 1 through 5 after primary vaccination will be written when the results of the Year 5 persistence study are available.

Indication Studied: Primary immunisation of healthy subjects aged 11-55 years against meningococcal disease due

to serogroup A, C, W-135 or Y.

Study initiation date of Year 3 persistence: 13 January 2010

Study completion date of Year 3 persistence: 24 August 2010

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives:

The primary objectives of the study were evaluated in study 107386 (MENACWY-TT-015).

Only the secondary objectives pertaining to this Year 3 persistence study are presented in this annex report.

## Secondary:

## Three years after vaccination:

- To compare the persistence of the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine with that of the licensed Mencevax ACWY,
- To describe serious adverse events (SAEs) related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy from 2 years up to 3 years after vaccination in a retrospective manner.

## Study design:

The study is a Phase IIb, open, randomised (3:1), controlled, multi-centre, multi-country study with two parallel groups based on the vaccination received:

- ACWY-TT group: received one intramuscular (IM) dose of MenACWY-TT in the primary study 107386 (MENACWY-TT-015).
- MenPS group: received one subcutaneous dose of Mencevax ACWY in the primary study 107386 (MENACWY-TT-015).

A blood sample was collected from each subject 3 years after vaccination.

Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion: Healthy male or female subjects between and including 11 and 55 years of age at the time of vaccination, without a history of meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135 or Y disease, who had not received a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine for serogroups A, C, W-135 and/or Y within five years prior to enrolment in the primary study 107386 (MENACWY-TT-015) and who had never received a previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine for serogroup A, C, W-135 and/or Y since birth.

Note : In case of vaccination with a meningococcal polysaccharide or a meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine since the study vaccine dose administered in study 107386 (MENACWY-TT-015), the subject was not to enter study 107402 (MENACWY-TT-018 EXT: 015 Y3) or any of the following years for antibody persistence assessment.

No vaccine was given in this persistence study.

## Criteria for evaluation:

## Immunogenicity :

Three years after vaccination (for evaluation of the persistence), in all evaluable subjects:

- Serum bactericidal assay/activity against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y using rabbit complement:rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8, ≥ 1:128 and GMTs. rSBA testing was done at a GSK laboratory.
- Anti-polysaccharide N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y: anti-PSA, anti-PSC, anti-PSW135 and anti-PSY concentrations ≥ 0.3 μg/mL, ≥ 2.0 μg/mL and GMCs.

## Reactogenicity and Safety:

- Occurrence of SAEs (including cases of invasive meningococcal disease) related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy from the last study contact (Visit 5/Month 24) of the study 107398 (MENACWY-TT-017 EXT: 015 Y2) up to the Year 3 follow-up visit (Visit 6/Month 36)*.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*Note: At Year 3 of the long-term persistence phase the subject/subject's parents/LARs were asked retrospectively if any SAE, as defined hereafter, had occurred since the Month 24 visit of study 107398 (MENACWY-TT-017 EXT: 015 Y2). Only those SAEs that were determined by the investigator to have a causal relationship to the vaccination were described individually in the study report, along with the nature of the SAEs and the outcome. Any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy (i.e. meningococcal disease) during the Year 3 long-term persistence phase or related to study participation were described in detail.

## Results:

## Immunogenicity results:

The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for persistence Year 3. The percentage of subjects with Year 3 serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was higher than 5% in the MenPS group. Therefore a second analysis based on the Total Cohort Year 3 was performed to complement the ATP analysis. Similar results were observed in both cohorts.

The percentages of subjects with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 and rSBA GMTs are summarised in Synopsis Table 1.

- 99.1% (rSBA-MenC) to 100% (rSBA-MenA) of the subjects in the ACWY-TT group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:8. 86.7% (rSBA-MenW-135) to 100% (rSBA-MenA) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:8.
- 92.9% (rSBA-MenC) to 99.4% (rSBA-MenY) of the subjects in the ACWY-TT group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:128. 80.0% (rSBA-MenW-135) to 97.2% (rSBA-MenY) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:128.
- For all the four serogroups, the observed rSBA GMT values at Month 36 (Year 3) exceeded the levels observed at the pre-vaccination time-point in both groups. rSBA GMTs in the ACWY-TT group ranged from 870.3 (rSBA-MenC) to 2567.3 (rSBA-MenY). In the MenPS group rSBA GMTs ranged from 332.8 (rSBA-MenW-135) to 1124.8 (rSBA-MenC).

The exploratory group comparisons suggested:

- A higher percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenW-135 ≥ 1:8 in the ACWY-TT group compared to the MenPS group.
- A higher percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA and rSBA-MenW-135 ≥ 1:128 in the ACWY-TT group compared to the MenPS group.
- Higher rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY GMTs at Year 3 in the ACWY-TT group compared to the MenPS group.

The findings per age stratum were generally similar with those of the entire study population.

The percentages of subjects with antiPS concentrations ≥ 0.3 μg/mL and ≥ 2.0 μg/mL and anti-PS GMCs are summarised in Synopsis Table 2.

- 92.4% (Anti-PSW-135) to 99.4% (Anti-PSA) of the subjects in the ACWY-TT group had an Anti-PS concentration ≥ 0.3 µ g/mL. 97.2% (Anti -PSW-135) to 100% (Anti-PSA and Anti-PSC) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an Anti-PS concentration ≥ 0.3 µ g/mL.
- 60.4% (Anti-PSC) to 90.9% (Anti-PSA) of the subjects in the ACWY-TT group had an Anti-PS concentration ≥ 2 µ g/mL. 80.6% (Anti -PSW-135) to 99.1% (Anti-PSA) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an Anti-PS concentration ≥ 2 µ g/mL.
- The observed GMC values for all anti-PS antibodies at Month 36 (Year 3) exceeded the levels observed at the pre-vaccination time-point in both groups. Anti-PS GMCs in the ACWY-TT group ranged from 2.7 (Anti-PSC) to 12.5 (Anti-PSA). In the MenPS group anti-PS GMCs ranged from 5.5 (Anti-PSW-135) to 19.8 (Anti-PSA).

The exploratory group comparisons suggested:

- A higher percentage of subjects with Anti-PSC and Anti-PSY ≥ 0.3 µ g/mL in the MenPS group compared to the ACWY-TT group.
- A higher percentage of subjects ≥ 2 µ g/mL for all anti -PS antibodies in the MenPS group compared to the ACWY-TT group.
- Higher GMCs for all anti-PS antibodies in the MenPS group compared to the ACWY-TT group.

The findings per age stratum were generally similar with those of the entire study population.

## Robustness analysis &amp; predictive modelling

For rSBA and anti-PS, the exploratory analyses that take into account the effect of drop outs with or without assuming any type of decay are in line with the analyses that ignore drop-out.

The predicted GMTs were similar to the observed values for the Year 3 Total Vaccinated Cohort. The findings per age stratum were generally similar with those of the entire study population. Safety /reactogenicity: No SAEs considered related to vaccination or events related to the lack of vaccine efficacy were reported since the second persistence visit (2 years after vaccination) up to the third persistence visit (3 years after vaccination).

Two complete abortions and one ectopic pregnancy were reported although these events are not vaccine related nor a case of lack of vaccine efficacy.

## MAH Conclusions:

This study evaluated the persistence of the immune response and the occurrence of SAEs related to vaccination and events related to lack of vaccine efficacy up to 3 years after vaccination with the

MenACWY-TT candidate vaccine or the Mencevax ACWY control vaccine in the 107386 (MENACWYTT015) study.

Three years after vaccination for rSBA:

- At least 99.1% of the subjects had rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 for all four serogroups in both study groups

except for rSBA-MenW-135 in the MenPS group (86.7%).

- At least 92.9% and 80.0% of the subjects in the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups respectively, retained

rSBA titres ≥ 1:128 for all four serogroups.

- GMTs ranged between 870.3 (rSBA-MenC) and 2567.3 (rSBA-MenY) in the ACWY-TT group and between 332.8 (rSBA-MenW-135) and 1124.8 (rSBA-MenC) in the MenPS group.
- No SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to vaccination or any events related to lack of

vaccine efficacy were reported from the last visit of the vaccination phase (6 months after vaccination) up to the third persistence visit (3 years after vaccination).

No confirmatory analyses were performed on secondary objectives.

Assessor's comment: Non-inferiority for Nimenrix compared with MenPS holds at year 3 for all the data shown above with the exception of GMT for Men C.  However the GMTs are still well above baseline and the majority of titres are above 1:128.

It is noted that the rSBA at GSK was compared to the rSBA performed at the HPA at year 2 (discussed in D180 report for initial MAA).  It was noted that the GSK results were higher than the results from the HPA, but even so the post-vaccination difference between groups still favoured Nimenrix.

The data was analysed by age stratum and the company conclusion that the results were generally similar is agreed. The results by age stratum are provided in the two supplementary tables below.

Background to clinical dataset

## Clinical Study Report for Study 108663 (MenACWY-TT-030 EXT: 027 Y3) Annex 5 to Clinical Study Report 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) (Development Phase IIb)

Title of the study: A phase IIb, open, randomized, controlled primary vaccination study to evaluate the noninferiority and the persistence of the immune response of GSK Biologicals' meningococcal serogroup ACWY conjugate vaccine given intramuscularly versus Meningitec ™ or Mencevax ™ ACWY to healthy subjects aged 1 through 10 years of age.

Note: This study has two stages: the vaccination stage 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) and the long-term persistence stage (MenACWY-TT-028 EXT: 027 Y1 to MenACWY-TT-032 EXT: 027 Y5) with assessments of long-term protection at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after vaccination. The vaccination stage of the study was reported in the 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) study report. This study report presents the analysis of the antibody persistence at 3 years after vaccination. It is an annex report (Annex 5) to the 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) study report.

Study centres: There were eleven study centres in Finland for this study.

## Study period:

Study initiation date: 08 Feb 2010

Study completion date: 12 May 2010

Data lock point: 4 April 2011

## Objectives:

Primary : The primary objectives of the study were evaluated in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) and only the secondary objectives pertaining to the Year 3 visit are presented in this annex report.

## Secondary:

## Three years after vaccination:

## For subjects of two years and above

- To compare the persistence of the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine with that of the licensed Mencevax ACWY.

## For subjects below two years of age

- To compare the persistence of the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine with that of the licensed Meningitec.

## For all subjects

To describe Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) related to vaccination and any event related to the lack of vaccine efficacy (i.e. meningococcal disease) from 6 months up to 3 years after vaccination in a retrospective manner.

Study design: This was an open, randomised [3:1], controlled, multi-centre study with 2 parallel groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, the enrolment in the vaccination stage of the study, 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027), was performed to ensure the following distribution (2:1:1) of the population across three age strata: subjects aged 1-&lt;2 years, 2-&lt;6 years and 6-&lt;11 years.

In the vaccination stage of the study, 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027), eligible subjects received one dose of the MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine or one dose of the control vaccine ( Meningitec for the 1-&lt;2 year age stratum or Mencevax ACWY for the 2-&lt;6 year and 6-&lt;11 year age strata). The 108663 (MenACWY-TT-030 EXT: 027 Y3) study consisted of one visit for each subject and a blood sample (5 ml) was collected from subjects in both groups 3 years after vaccination (Visit 6 [Month 36]). The analyses presented here were performed for the two age strata: 1 - &lt; 2 years and 2 - &lt; 11 years of age (i.e. pooled 2-&lt;6 years and 6-&lt;11 years). The vaccines administered and the group names used in the analyses presented in this annex report are as follows

Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion: Subjects who satisfied criteria for inclusion in the vaccination stage of the study (see 108658 [MenACWY-TT-027] study report), who were primed with the MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine or the control vaccine (Meningitec for the 1-&lt;2 year age stratum or Mencevax ACWY for the 2-&lt;l1 year age stratum) in the vaccination stage of the study and who were eligible to enter the persistence study were enrolled. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or the legally acceptable representative of the subjects at the time of study entry in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027). Additional exclusion criteria for the long-term persistence stages of the study were: a history of meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, C, W-135 or Y and vaccination with meningococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine or a meningococcal polysaccharide protein conjugate

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or the legally acceptable representative of the subjects at the time of study entry in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027). Additional exclusion criteria for the long-term persistence stages of the study were: a history of meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, C, W-135 or Y and vaccination with meningococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine or a meningococcal polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine other than the study vaccine. These criteria were to be checked at each long-term time point. If one became applicable at a particular time point, the reason was to be documented and the subject could not enter the long term follow-up for that year and for the subsequent years

Study vaccine, dose, mode of administration, lot no.:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No vaccine was administered during this long-term persistence stage of the study. However, the vaccines that were administered during the vaccination stage of the study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) are presented in Table 1. Vaccination schedule /site:

A single vaccine dose of the MenACWY-TT vaccine or control vaccine was administered at Visit 1 (i.e. at age 1-&lt;2 years, 2-&lt;6 years or 6-&lt;11 years according to the age strata) according to the randomised assignment. The MenACWY-TT vaccine was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid or thigh.

Control vaccines/ site :

Age stratum 1-&lt;2 years: Pfizer's commercially available Meningitec ; intramuscular administration in the deltoid or thigh.

Age strata 2-&lt;6 years and 6-&lt;11 years: GSK Biologicals' commercially available Mencevax ACWY; subcutaneous administration in the upper arm.

All vaccines were administered in the non-dominant side or the left side if the dominant side was not known.

## Duration of treatment:

No treatment was administered during study 108663 (MenACWY-TT-030 EXT: 027 Y3).

## Criteria for evaluation:

## Immunogenicity:

Measurement of antibody titres against meningococcal vaccine antigen components in blood samples obtained at approximately 36 months after vaccination in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) in all subjects:

- Determination of bactericidal antibody titres against Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W- 135 and Y (rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY) using serum bactericidal activity (SBA) assay with rabbit complement (assay cut-off was 1:8).

To support the data obtained by rSBA testing, antibody concentrations against meningococcal polysaccharides were planned to be assessed by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) at 36 months after vaccination, but the sponsor decided not to perform the ELISA testing for the following reasons:

- the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers SBA the primary means of assessing immune response to meningococcal conjugate vaccines [WHO, 2006; WHO, 1999].
- circulating bactericidal antibodies are more critical for persistent protection against meningococcal disease than non-functional antibodies against meningococcal polysaccharides [CDC, 2011; WHO, 2006].

•

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety : Recording of SAEs considered related to vaccination by the investigator that occurred from the last study contact (Visit 5/Month 24) up to the Year 3 visit (Visit 6/Month 36).

Note: At the Year 3 visit, subject's parents/guardians were asked, in a retrospective manner, if any SAE had occurred since the Month 24 visit. Only those SAEs that were determined by the investigator to have a causal relationship to the vaccination were recorded. Any event related to the lack of vaccine efficacy during the long-term persistence stage or related to study participation was to be described in detail.

## Subject eligibility and exclusion from ATP analyses:

Of the 613 subjects who were enrolled and vaccinated in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027); 462 subjects returned for the Year 3 visit (386 MenACWY-TT-primed subjects, 38 Meningitec -primed subjects and 38 Mencevax ACWYprimed subjects).

Eighty-one subjects 1-&lt;2 years and 70 subjects 2-&lt;11 years did not participate in the Year 3 visit. About half of these subjects within each age stratum did not participate because they had a suboptimal response to meningococcal serogroup C vaccination in at least one of the previous timepoints and received an extra dose of meningococcal serogroup C vaccine before the Year 3 visit. The percentage of subjects not participating because of this reason was 37.3% in the MenCCRM group, 47.4% in the MenPS group, 5.2% in the ACWY&lt;2 group and 1.7% in the ACWY ³2 group. Because of the imbalance between study groups in the percentage of subjects not participating to this study timepoint, additional analyses were performed to investigate the impact of the subjects who dropped out based on this reason.

1-&lt;2 year stratum : Of the 223 subjects in the Total Cohort Year 3, 9 subjects (8 in the ACWY&lt;2 group, one in the MenCCRM group) were eliminated from the ATP cohort for persistence Year 3. For 4 of these subjects (all in ACWY&lt;2 group), the elimination codes assigned in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) and the Year 1 and Year 2 long term persistence studies 108660 (MenACWY-TT-028 EXT 027 Y1) and 108661 (MenACWY-TT-029 EXT 027 Y2) were still applicable in the current study 108663 (MenACWY-TT-030 EXT 027 Y3). Two subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group were eliminated due to noncompliance with the blood sampling schedule and 2 subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group and 1 subject in the MenCCRM group due to essential serological data missing because no blood sample was taken at the Year 3 visit.

2-&lt;11 year stratum : Of the 239 subjects in the Total Cohort Year 3, 5 subjects (4 in the ACWY ≥ 2 group and 1 in the MenPS group) were eliminated from the ATP cohort for persistence Year 3. For one subject (in MenPS group), the elimination code assigned in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) was still applicable in the current study 108663 (MenACWY-TT-030 EXT 027 Y3). Four subjects in the ACWY ≥ 2 group were eliminated due to essential serological data missing. No blood sample was taken at the Year 3 visit for 3 subjects and for 1 subject a blood sample was taken, was sent to GSK Biologicals for testing, but was not received by GSK Biologicals.

## Demography results

The mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort for persistence Year 3 was 55.0 months (range 48 to 59 months) for the subjects in the 1-&lt;2 years stratum and 109.4 months (range 59 to 167 months) for subjects in the 2-&lt;11 years stratum. There was a similar proportion of males and females in each group and in each of the age strata. The majority of the subjects in each group and in each of the age strata were White/Caucasian/European heritage (98.1% in the 1-&lt;2 years age stratum and 99.1% in the 2-&lt;11 years age stratum).

Immunogenicity results: The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for persistence Year 3. As fewer than 5% of the subjects who came back for the Year 3 visit with serological results were excluded from this ATP cohort for both age strata, no additional analysis based on the Total Cohort Year 3 was performed to complement the ATP analysis.

## Subjects aged 1-&lt; 2 years

36 months (Year 3) after vaccination (Table 2):

- 90.8% (rSBA-MenC) to 98.9% (rSBA-MenW-135) of the subject in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:8 and 97.3% of the subjects in group MenCCRM had an rSBA-MenC antibody titre ≥ 1:8.
- 50.0% (rSBA-MenC) to 94.7% (rSBA-MenA) of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:128 and 59.5% of the subjects of group MenCCRM had an rSBA-MenC antibody titre ≥ 1:128.
- rSBA GMTs in the ACWY&lt;2 group ranged from 125.1 (MenC) to 583.2 (MenY). In the MenCCRM group the rSBAMenC GMT was 185.7

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The exploratory group comparisons suggested:

- no difference between ACWY&lt;2 and MenCCRM groups in terms of subjects with rSBA-MenC antibody titres ≥ 1:8 or ≥ 1:128 since the 95% CI on the group difference included 0.
- no difference between ACWY&lt;2 and MenCCRM groups in terms of rSBA-MenC GMT since the 95% CI on the group ratio included 1.

Refer to Section 'Statistical methods' for the reliability of such analyses.

Assessor's comment: It is noted that the results for the MenCCRM group are higher at year 3 than year 2   These results are likely to be biased as a higher number of subjects in the control arm dropped-out because of meningococcal serogroup C revaccination.

## Subjects aged 2-&lt;11 years

36 months (Year 3) after vaccination (Table 3):

- At least 98.4% (rSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the ACWY ≥ 2 group and 81.1% (rSBA-MenY) to 91.2% (rSBAMenA) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:8.
- 72.9% (rSBA-MenC) to 100% (rSBA-MenY) of the subjects in the ACWY ≥ 2 group and 51.4% (rSBA-MenY) to 79.4% (rSBA-MenA) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:128.
- rSBA GMTs ranged from 244.3 (MenC) to 1737.1 (MenW-135) in the ACWY ≥ 2 group and from 103.8 (MenY) to 218.8 (MenA) in group MenPS.

The exploratory group comparisons suggested:

- a higher percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA antibody titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128, rSBA-MenC antibody titres ≥ 1:8, rSBA-MenW-135 antibody titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 and rSBA-MenY antibody titres ≥ 1:8 and 1:128 in group ACWY ≥ 2 than in group MenPS since the LL of the 95% CI on the group difference was above 0.
- a higher rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY GMT in group ACWY ≥ 2 than in group MenPS since the 95% CI on the GMT ratio was above 1.

Refer to Section 'Statistical methods' for the reliability of such analyses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 3: Percentage of subjects with rSBA titres equal to or above the cut-off values of 1:8 and 1:128 and GMTs - age stratum 2-&lt;11 years (ATP cohort for persistence Year 3).

## Robustness modelling

The robustness analysis models provided estimated GMTs for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY for groups ACWY&lt;2, ACWY ≥ 2 and MenPS and for rSBA-MenC in groups ACWY&lt;2 and ACWY ≥ 2 that were within 2 fold of the observed values. This indicates that the initial analysis performed at each timepoint separately (i.e. in each study) is not unduly affected by subjects who dropped out.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For rSBA-MenC in the MenCCRM and MenPS groups, the models predicted lower GMTs than the values observed at Year 3. This indicates that the observed rSBA-MenC GMTs at Year 3 are biased by the fact that a higher percentage of subjects in these groups were excluded from the analysis at this timepoint because of a suboptimal response to meningococcal serogroup C vaccination at a previous persistence timepoint.

## Safety /reactogenicity:

No SAEs considered related to vaccination or events related to the lack of vaccine efficacy were reported in the period between the Month 6 visit (6 months after vaccination) and the Year 3 visit (36 months after vaccination).

An event of viral meningitis has been reported although this event is not vaccine related nor a case of lack of vaccine efficacy.

## MAH Conclusion(s):

This study evaluated antibody persistence at Year 3 (approximately 36 months) after vaccination with one dose of the MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine or one dose of a control vaccine ( Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY according to age strata in the 108658 [MenACWY-TT-027] study).

Three years 3 after vaccination:

- 90.8% to 98.9% of the subject in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:8 and 97.3% of the subjects in group MenCCRM had an rSBA-MenC antibody titre ≥ 1:8.
- At least 98.4% of the subjects in the ACWY ≥ 2 group and 81.1% to 91.2% of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titre ≥ 1:8.

· No SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to vaccination or any events related to the lack of vaccine efficacy were reported up to 3 years after vaccination.

Note that these results are likely biased. At Year 3 a higher percentage of the subjects receiving a control vaccine than the subjects receiving MenACWY-TT dropped out because of meningococcal serogroup C revaccination. The model showed that the observed rSBA-MenC values may be overestimated. No confirmatory analyses were performed on secondary objectives.

## MenACWY-TT-030. (eCTD 12)

Annex Report 6 (hSBA data)

## Annex report 6 provides hSBA results for 1 to 2 year age group for both Year 2 and Year 3 persistence time points.  The conclusions are provided below.

This study evaluated the antibody persistence using serum bactericidal activity assay with human complement at Year 2 and Year 3 after vaccination with one dose of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine or one dose of a control vaccine ( Meningitec ) in subjects of age strata 1-&lt;2 years.

## Two years after vaccination:

Overall, at least 90.8% of the subjects vaccinated with MenACWY-TT had hSBA titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 against serogroups C, W-135 and Y. 40.6% and 36.1% had hSBA-MenA titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, respectively. In the MenCCRM group, which had only received a MenC conjugate vaccine, 54.9% of subjects had hSBA-MenC titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8.

## Three years after vaccination:

Overall, at least 73.6% of the subjects vaccinated with MenACWY-TT had hSBA titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 against serogroups C, W-135 and Y. 21.8% and 17.6% had hSBA-MenA titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, respectively. In the MenCCRM group which had only received a MenC conjugate vaccine, 75.8% of subjects had hSBA-MenC titres ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8.

Note that these Year 3 results are likely biased due to differential subject drop-out between the two treatment groups. As shown in Annex Report 5 (108663 [MenACWY-TT-030 EXT: 027 Y3]) for rSBAMenC,  at Year 3 a higher percentage of the subjects receiving a control vaccine than the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects receiving MenACWY-TT dropped out because of meningococcal serogroup C revaccination after suboptimal response to meningococcal serogroup C vaccination in at least one of the previous timepoints. The percentage of subjects not participating because of this reason was 37.3% in the MenCCRM group and 5.2% in the ACWY&lt;2 group. The data modeling performed for rSBAMenC indicated that the rSBA GMT value of the control group may be overestimated. No confirmatory analyses were performed on secondary objectives.

No SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to vaccination or any events related to the lack of vaccine efficacy were reported up to 3 years after vaccination.

Assessor's comments: The Company conclude that 3 year persistence data do not require amendment to the SmPC and this is agreed.

## Study design:

This was an open, randomized [3:1], controlled, multi-center study with two parallel groups. In addition, the enrollment in the vaccination stage of the study, 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027), was performed to ensure the following distribution (2:1:1) of the population across three age strata: subjects aged 1-&lt;2 years, 2-&lt;6 years and 6&lt;11 years. In the vaccination stage of the study, eligible subjects received one dose of the MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine or one dose of the control vaccine ( Meningitec for the 1-&lt;2 year age stratum or Mencevax ACWY for the 2&lt;6 year and 6-&lt;11 year age strata). The 108665 (MenACWY-TT-031 EXT: 027 Y4) persistence stage consisted of one visit for each subject and a blood sample (5 mL) was collected from subjects in both groups four years after vaccination (Visit 7 [Year 4]). The vaccines administered and the group names used were as follows:

## Study vaccine, dose, mode of administration, lot no.:

No vaccine was administered during this long-term persistence stage of the study.

## Study population:

Subjects who satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the vaccination stage of the study (see 108658 [MenACWY-TT027] study report), who were primed with the MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine or the control vaccine ( Meningitec for the 1-&lt;2 year age stratum or Mencevax ACWY for the 2-&lt;11 year age stratum) in the vaccination stage of the study and who were eligible to enter the persistence stage were enrolled. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or the legally acceptable representative of the subjects at the time of study entry in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027). Additional exclusion criteria for the long-term persistence stages of the study to be checked at each long-term time point were: a history of meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, C, W-135 or Y and vaccination with meningococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine or a meningococcal polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine other than the study vaccine. If one became applicable at a particular time point, the reason was to be documented and the subject could not enter the long-term follow-up for that year and for the subsequent years.

## Statistical methods:

Statistical analyses were performed as per protocol or reporting and analysis plan (RAP). Only the statistical methods pertaining to this Year 4 persistence stage are presented in this annex report. Analyses were performed for the 1-&lt;2 years and the 2-&lt;11 years age strata.

## Demography:

Demographic characteristics (age in months, gender, race) of each study cohort were tabulated per group. The mean age (in months) (with the range and standard deviation) as a whole and per group was calculated The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study centers was tabulated as a whole and per group.

## Primary Outcome/Efficacy Variable:

The primary outcome of the study was evaluated in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) and only the secondary outcomes pertaining to the Year 4 visit are presented in this annex report.

## Secondary Outcome/Efficacy Variable(s):

Immunogenicity - Persistence:

Measurement of antibody titers against meningococcal vaccine antigen components in blood samples obtained at approximately four years after vaccination in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) in all evaluable subjects:

- Determination of bactericidal antibody titers against Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y (rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY) using serum bactericidal activity assay with rabbit complement (rSBA) (assay cut-off was 1:8). Measurement of antibody titers against meningococcal vaccine antigen components in blood samples obtained at approximately four years after vaccination in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) in subjects below two years of age:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Determination of bactericidal antibody titers against Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y (hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY) using serum bactericidal activity assay with human complement (hSBA) (assay cut-off was 1:4).

## Safety :

- Occurrence of SAEs related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy (i.e. meningococcal disease) that occurred from Month 6 up to the Year 4 visit (Visit 7). Note: At the Year 4 visit, subject's parents/guardians were asked, in a retrospective manner, if any SAE had occurred since the Year 3 visit. Only those SAEs that were determined by the investigator to have a causal relationship to the vaccination were recorded. Any event related to the lack of vaccine efficacy during the long-term persistence stage or related to study participation were to be described in detail.

## Immunogenicity - Persistence:

The analysis of antibody persistence was based on the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for antibody persistence at Year 4. The percentage of subjects who came back for the Year 4 follow-up with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was higher than 5%, therefore a second analysis based on the Total Cohort at Year 4 was performed to complement the ATP analysis.

Serological assays were performed at the GSK Biologicals' central laboratory (for rSBA and hSBA) and at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) (only for rSBA). As these were different tests, the results were presented separately.

## Within-group analysis

Four years after vaccination, for each vaccine group and for all age strata, for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBAMenW-135 and rSBA-MenY, and for subjects below two years of age for hSBAMenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW135 and hSBA-MenY:

- Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) with 95% CIs were calculated.
-  Percentages of subjects with antibody titers above the proposed en dpoint cut-offs with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
- The distribution of antibody titers was tabulated.
- Antibody titers were also presented using reverse cumulative curves (RCCs).

## Between-group analysis

The comparability of the MenACWY-TT vaccine versus the control vaccine in terms of persistence of antibodies to different antigens at Year 4 in all subjects was analyzed through:

- Computation of the asymptotic standardized 95% CI on the difference in the percentage of subjects with rSBA ≥1:8  and ≥  1:8 (only for subjects below 2 years of age) between the study vaccine group and (minus) the study control group for each of the four serogroups.
- Computation of the 95% CIs of the GMT ratios between the study vaccine group and (over) the control vaccine group. This was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model on the logarithm10 transformation of the titers using the pre-vaccination logarithm10 transformation of the titers, the age strata and the vaccine group as covariates.

Exploratory between-group comparisons were examined as follows: the exclusion of 1 from the 95% CI on the GMT ratios or 0% from the 95% CI on the differences in percentage of subjects with titers above proposed cut-offs was used to highlight potential group differences. However, these potential differences should be interpreted with caution considering that there was no adjustment for multiplicity for these comparisons and that the clinical relevance of any differences was not accounted for in the planning of the exploratory analyses.

## Analysis of Safety:

The number of subjects who experienced SAEs related to vaccination from 6 months up to four years after vaccination in a retrospective manner was to be reported in detail.

## MAH Summary:

Subject eligibility and exclusion from ATP analyses:

Of the 613 subjects who were enrolled and vaccinated in study 108658 (MenAXWY-TT-027), 423 subjects returned for the Year 4 visit (357 MenACWY-TT-primed subjects, 34 Meningitec-primed subjects and 32 Mencevax ACWYprimed subjects).

A total of 105 aged subjects 1-&lt;2 years and 85 subjects aged 2-&lt;11 years did not participate in the Year 4 visit. About half of these subjects within each age stratum did not participate because they had a suboptimal response to meningococcal serogroup C vaccination on at least one of the previous time points and/or received an extra dose of meningococcal serogroup C vaccine before the Year 4 visit. The percentage of subjects not participating because of this reason was 38.7% in the MenCCRM group, 51.3% in the MenPS group, 10.5% in the ACWY&lt;2 group and 3.0% in the ACWY≥2 group. Because of the imbalance between study groups in the percentage of subjects not participating to this study time point, the study results are likely biased.

## Subjects aged 1-&lt;2 years

Of the 199 subjects in the Total Cohort Year 4, 16 subjects (13 in the ACWY&lt;2 group and three in the MenCCRM group) were eliminated from the ATP cohort for persistence Year 4. For four of these subjects (all in the ACWY&lt;2 group), the elimination codes assigned in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) and the Year 1, 2 and 3 long-term persistence studies were still applicable in the current study 108665 (MenACWY-TT-031 EXT 027 Y4). Eight subjects (five in the ACWY&lt;2 group and three in the MenCCRM group) were eliminated due to non-compliance with the blood sampling schedule, three subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group due to essential serological data missing (no blood sample was taken at the Year 4 visit) and one subject in the ACWY&lt;2 group due to administration of medication forbidden by the protocol (gamma-globulin).

## Subjects aged 2-&lt;11 years

Of the 224 subjects in the Total Cohort Year 4, seven subjects (four in the ACWY≥2 group and three in the MenPS group) were eliminated from the ATP cohort for persistence Year 4. For one subject (in the MenPS group), the elimination code assigned in study 108658 (MenACWY-TT-027) was still applicable in the current study 108665 (MenACWY-TT-031 EXT 027 Y4). Six subjects (four in the ACW≥2 group and two in the MenPS group) were eliminated due to non-compliance with the blood sampling schedule.

## Demography:

The mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort for persistence Year 4 was 67.0 months (range 59 to 72 months) for the subjects in the 1-&lt;2 years stratum and 121.1 months (range 72 to 180 months) for subjects in the 2-&lt;11 years stratum. There was a comparable proportion of males and females in each group and in each of the age strata. The majority of the subjects in each group and in each of the age strata were of White - Caucasian/European heritage (98.4% in the 1-&lt;2 years age stratum and 99.1% in the 2-&lt;11 years age stratum).

## Immunogenicity - Persistence:

Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for persistence Year 4. As more than 5% of the subjects who came back for the Year 4 visit with serological results were excluded from this ATP cohort for both age strata, a second analysis based on the Total Cohort Year 4 was performed to complement the ATP analysis.

## Measured at GSK

Subjects aged 1-&lt;2 years

- Four years after vaccination:  91.2% (rSBA -MenC) to 97.8% (rSBA-MenA) of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:8 and 90.0% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an rSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:8.
- 51.1% (rSBA-MenC) to 94.1% (rSBA-MenA) of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:128 and 46.7% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an rSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:128
-  rSBA GMTs in the ACWY&lt;2 group ranged from 141.9 (rSBA -MenC) to 623.9 (rSBA-MenA). In the MenCCRM group, the rSBA-MenC GMT was 150.5.
-  40.7% (hSBA -MenA) to 85.7% (hSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an hSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:4 and 77.4% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an hSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:4.
- 39.3% (hSBA-MenA) to 85.7% (hSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an hSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:8 and 77.4% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an hSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:8.
-  hSBA GMTs in the ACWY&lt;2 group ranged from 6.0 (hSBA -MenA) to 51.4 (hSBA-MenC). In the MenCCRM group, the hSBA-MenC GMT was 32.4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The exploratory group comparisons did not support a difference between the ACWY&lt;2 and MenCCRM groups:

- in terms of subjects with rSBA-MenC antibody titers ≥ 1:8 or ≥ 1:128 and hSBA-MenC antibody titers ≥ 1:4 or ≥ 1:8 since the 95% CIs on the group difference included 0.
- in terms of subjects with rSBA-MenC GMTs and hSBA-MenC GMTs since the 95% CI on the group ratio included 1.

## Subjects aged 2-&lt;11 years

Four years after vaccination:

-  At least 96.8% (rSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the ACWY≥2 group and 75.9% (rSBAMenW- 135) to 89.7% (rSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:8.
- 64.4% (rSBA-MenC) to 100% (rSBA-MenY) of the subjects in the ACWY≥2 group and 51.7% (rSBAMenY) to 69.0% (rSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:128.
-  rSBA GMTs ranged from 203.6 (rSBA -MenC) to 1932.3 (rSBA-MenA) in the ACWY≥2 group and from 93.4 (rSBA-MenW-135) to 211.9 (rSBA-MenC) in the MenPS group.

The exploratory group comparisons suggested:

- a higher percentage of subjects with rSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 or ≥ 1:128 for serogroups A, W-135 and Y in the ACWY≥2 group than in the MenPS group since the LL of the 95% CI on the group differences were above 0.
-  higher rSBA GMTs for serogroups A, W -135 and Y in the ACWY≥2 group than in the MenPS group since the 95% CI on the GMT ratios were above 1.

## Measured at HPA

## Subjects aged 1-&lt;2 years

Four years after vaccination:

- 30.3% (rSBA-MenC) to 61.2% (rSBA-MenA) of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:8 and 25.8% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an rSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:8.
- 14.5% (rSBA-MenC) to 39.5% (rSBA-MenW-135) of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:128 and 19.4% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an rSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:128.
-  rSBA GMTs ranged from 11.2 (rSBA -MenC) to 31.3 (rSBA-MenW-135) in the ACWY&lt;2 group. In the MenCCRM group, the rSBA-MenC GMT was 11.4.

The exploratory group comparisons did not support a difference between the ACWY&lt;2 and MenCCRM groups:

- in terms of subjects with rSBA-MenC antibody titers ≥ 1:8 or ≥ 1:128 since the 95% CIs on the group difference included 0.
-  in terms of subjects with rSBA -MenC GMTs since the 95% CI on the group ratio included 1.

## Subjects aged 2-&lt;11 years

Four years after vaccination:

-  50% (rSBA -MenC) to 90.4% (rSBA-MenW-135) of the subjects in the ACWY≥2 group and 6.9% (rSBAMenY) to 41.4% (rSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:8.
-  27.7% (rSBA -MenC) to 89.3% (rSBA-MenW-135) of the subjects in the ACWY≥2 group and 3.4% (rSBA-MenY) to 31.0% (rSBA-MenC) of the subjects in the MenPS group had an rSBA antibody titer ≥ 1:128.
-  rSBA -GMTs ranged from 21.7 (rSBA-MenC) to 671.1 (rSBA-MenW-135) in the AWCY≥2 group and from 4.7 (rSBA-MenY) to 23.5 (rSBA-MenC) in the MenPS group.

The exploratory group comparisons suggested:

- a higher percentage of subjects with rSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 for serogroups A, W-135 and Y in the ACWY≥2 group than in the MenPS group since the LL of the 95% CI on the group differences were above 0.
-  higher rSBA GMTs for serogroups A, W -135 and Y in the ACWY≥2 group than in the MenPS group since the 95% CI on the GMT ratios were above 1.

Assessor's comment: The results for the HPA rSBA are lower than the GSK rSBA data.

## Safety /reactogenicity:

No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered related to study participation nor events related to the lack of vaccine efficacy were reported from six months up to four years after vaccination.

## MAH Conclusion:

This study evaluated antibody persistence at Year 4 (approximately 48 months) after vaccination with one dose of the MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine or one dose of a control vaccine ( Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY according to age strata in the 108658 [MenACWY-TT-027] study).

## Subjects aged 1-&lt;2 years :

- 91.2% to 97.8% of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had rSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 for all 4 serogroups and 90.0% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an rSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:8, when measured at GSK' laboratory.
- 30.3% to 61.2% of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had rSBA antibody titers   1:8 for all 4 serogroups and 25.8% of the subjects in the MenCCRM group had an rSBA-MenC antibody titer ≥ 1:8, when measured at HPA.
- At least 77.5% of subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group had hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8 against serogroups C, W135 and Y. 40.7% and 39.3% of the subjects had hSBA-MenA titers ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, respectively. In the MenCCRM group 77.4% of the subjects had hSBA-MenC titers ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8.

## Subjects aged 2-&lt;11 years :

- At least 96.8% of the subjects in the ACWY≥2 group and 75.9% to 89.7% of subjects in the MenPS group had rSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 for all 4 serogroups, when measured at GSK.
- 50.0% to 90.4% of the subjects in the ACWY&lt;2 group and 6.9% to 41.4% in the MenPS group had rSBA antibody titers ≥ 1:8 for all 4 serogroups, when measured at HPA.

Note that these results are likely biased. At Year 4, a higher percentage of subjects receiving a control vaccine than subjects receiving MenACWY-TT dropped out because of meningococcal serogroup C revaccination.

No unsolicited AEs were collected during the Year 4 persistence phase of the study.

No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered related to study participation nor events related to the lack of vaccine efficacy were reported from six months up to four years after vaccination.

Assessor's comment: The overall conclusions of the MAH are agreed. At present the MAH are collecting persistence data from phase II and phase III studies in adolescents, children and toddlers and these are expected to become available by the end of 2012. The MAH will then submit the more substantial data-set for a type II variation in 2013.

## Study detailed title

A phase III, open, multi-centre, controlled study to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence at 2 years, 3 years and 4 years after a single dose of GSK Biologicals' meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135, Y- tetanus toxoid conjugate (MenACWY-TT) vaccine versus one dose of Meningitec ™ administered in healthy 12 through 23-month old children who were primed in study MenACWY-TT-039 (109670) and to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of the same meningococcal conjugate vaccine as given in the primary study, 4 years after priming.

```
Study Centres: This study was conducted at 14 centres in Finland. Study initiation date (Year 3): 24 February 2010 Study completion date (Year 3): 16 November 2010 Data lock point (Date of database freeze): 16 December 2011 Phase: III
```

Indication: Active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 to 23 months and above against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, W-135 and Y.

## Treatment:

The subjects were enrolled in this long-term follow-up study MenACWY-TT-048 (112036) using the same randomization scheme as in the primary vaccination study MenACWY-TT-039 (109670) and were allocated with a [3:1] ratio in the following groups:

- ACWY-TT group (N=744 at most): consisting of subjects from both groups (MenACWYTT+ MMRV and MenACWY-TT groups) vaccinated with MenACWY-TT in study MenACWYTT- 039 (109670).
- MenCCRM group (N=248 at most): consisting of subjects from both groups (MMRV and Meningitec groups) vaccinated with Meningitec in study MenACWY-TT-039 (109670).

All subjects will be boosted at Month 48 (4 years after primary vaccination) with the same meningococcal vaccine as given in the primary study.

## Objectives:

Only the objectives pertaining to this Year 3 persistence study are presented in this annex report.

## Primary: Immunogenicity - Persistence

At 36 months after primary vaccination of toddlers with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec:

- To evaluate the persistence of meningococcal antibodies in terms of the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity assay with rabbit complement (rSBA) antibody titres ≥ 1:8 for each of the four serogroups.

## Secondary: Immunogenicity - Persistence :

At 36 months after primary vaccination with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine:

- To evaluate the persistence of meningococcal A, C, W-135 and Y antibodies in terms of rSBA, serum bactericidal assay activity with human complement (hSBA) and anti-meningococcal polysaccharide (PS) antibodies for each of the four serogroups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design:

Phase III, open, multi-centre and controlled study with 2 parallel groups. A blood sample was taken 36 months after primary vaccination in study MenACWY-TT-039 (109670).

## Study Population:

Healthy male or female subjects having completed the primary study MenACWY-TT-039 (109670) and who were primed with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec vaccines, free of obvious health problems (including immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition or bleeding disorders) as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study, without a history of meningococcal disease, who had not received a meningococcal polysaccharide or a meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine outside of study MenACWYTT-039 (109670) or who had not received immunoglobulins and/or blood products within three months of study entry or another clinical study drug within 30 days of study entry. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.

## Duration of treatment:

No treatment was administered during this long-term persistence stage of study 112036

(MENACWYTT048 EXT: 039 Y2, 3, 4, 5). There was one study visit at 36 months after vaccination.

## Primary Outcome/Efficacy Variable:

Persistence of immunogenicity with respect to components of the investigational vaccine 36

months post primary dose: · rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8.

## Secondary Outcome/Efficacy Variable(s):

Immunogenicity with respect to components of the investigational vaccine 36 months post primary dose: · rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:128 and titres. · hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:4, ≥ 1:8 and titres.

- anti-PSA, anti-PSC, anti-PSW-135 and anti-PSY concentrations ≥ 0.3 μg/mL, ≥ 2.0 μg/mL an d concentrations (using Enzymelinked Immunosorbent assay or ELISA).

Note: The rSBA and anti-PS have been analysed at a different laboratory (Health Protection Agency or HPA) at Year 3, compared to previous years (GSK). To reflect this difference, which limits direct longitudinal comparison of the results of different timepoints, the rSBA and anti-PS tables have each been divided into two separate tables. One table presents Pre, Post and Month 24 timepoints tested at the GSK laboratory, while the other table presents only the Year 3 timepoint tested at the HPA laboratory. The data on hSBA testing, for which laboratory and method remained constant throughout the different timepoints of this persistence study, are presented in one table for all timepoints.

## Results

## Demography

Across the two vaccine groups, the mean age of the subjects in the According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for persistence Year 3 was 49.1 months (range 46.0 to 57.0 months). 47.2% of the subjects were female, 52.8% of the subjects were male. The majority of the subjects in each group was of White/Caucasian/European heritage (99.4%).

## Immunogenicity:

Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for persistence at Year 3. No confirmatory analyses were performed on primary or secondary objectives.

- At 36 months after primary vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-039, primary exploratory analysis showed HPA rSBA-MenA, HPA rSBA-MenC, HPA rSBA-MenW-135 and HPA rSBAMenY titres ≥ 1:8 were 61.4%, 35.9% , 49.8% and 35.0% in group ACWY-TT and 6.5%, 13.0%, 4.3% and 13.5% in group MenCCRM , respectively.
- At 36 months after primary vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA-MenA, hSBAMenC, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:4 were 37.8%, 80.6%, 82.3% and 73.6% in group ACWY-TT and 16.1%, 41.9%, 6.1% and 18.2% in group MenCCRM, respectively.
- At 36 months after primary vaccination, the percentages of subjects with HPA anti-PSA, HPA anti-PSC, HPA anti-PSW-135 and HPA anti-PSY concentrations ≥ 0.3 µ g/mL were 98.5%, 31.1%, 95.9% and 98.1% in group ACWY-TT and 76.9%, 20.0%, 44.0% and 86.4% in group MenCCRM, respectively.

Safety/reactogenicity: The safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort. No unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected during year 3 persistence phase of the study.

## Serious adverse events:

No serious adverse events (SAEs) considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator, related to study participation, related to GSK concomitant medication or fatal SAEs were reported in the period between the last visit in the primary study and the Year 3 persistence visit.

## Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events:

No subject withdrew because of an AE or SAE.

## MAH Conclusion:

No confirmatory analyses were performed on primary or secondary objectives.

At 36 months after primary vaccination in study MENACWY-TT-039, primary exploratory analysis showed rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 were 61.4%, 35.9% , 49.8% and 35.0% in group ACWY-TT and 6.5%, 13.0%, 4.3% and 13.5% in group MenCCRM , respectively.

No unsolicited AEs were collected during year 3 persistence phase of the study. No SAEs considered to be possibly related to vaccination by the investigator or considered related to study participation were reported during the Year 3 persistence phase of the study.

Assessor's comments: This study report presents data on persistence of antibody 3 years post-vaccination. The change from GSK to HPA determination of rSBA and anti-PS complicates interpretation of the results. However no change in methodology for hSBA testing occurred.

The clinical expert overview states that a full report describing antibody persistence and antibody from years 2 through 4 after vaccination and the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of Nimenrix  will be written when the results of the year 4 persistence study and booster phase are available.  Also the Company plan to update the SmPC with persistence data when results for ongoing studies are available and plan to submit a type II variation at the beginning of 2013.  No SmPC changes are proposed to follow from this procedure (Art P46 010).

The applicant submits to the EMA the final report for MenACWY-TT-071 a paediatric study in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The applicant states that the MenACWY-TT-071 study is a stand alone study.

The applicant states that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product and therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for the above mentioned product.

## MenACWY-TT-071

This was a phase II, observer-blinded, multi-center, controlled study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of one dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' meningococcal serogroup ACWY tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) versus one dose of sanofipasteur's meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y vaccine (Menactra®) in healthy subjects aged 10 through 25 years.

This study was conducted by 33 investigators in two countries: the United States (US) and Canada.

## Study period:

```
Study initiation date: 19 August 2010 Study completion date: 01 March 2011 21 December 2011 (ESFU phase)
```

Data lock point: 10 November 2011 (active phase)

## Objectives:

## Primary:

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of MenACWYTT (Lot A) when compared to Menactra in terms of the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity (using human complement) against

N. meningitidis serogroup A (hSBA-MenA), hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY with respect to vaccine response* one month after vaccination.

*Vaccine response was defined as an hSBA titer of at least 1:8 in subjects initially seronegative (hSBA titer &lt; 1:4) and as a 4-fold increase in titer in subjects initially seropositive (hSBA titer ≥ 1:4).

Criterion for non-inferiority: For each serogroup separately, the lower limit of the twosided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentage of subjects with hSBA vaccine response one month after vaccination (ACWY-A group minus ACWY-DT group) was greater than or equal to the pre-defined clinical limit of -10%.

## Secondary:

Immunogenicity:

At one month after primary vaccination with MenACWYTT Lot A, Lot B or Menactra :

- To evaluate the clinical comparability of the two lots of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine with respect to the hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) for Neisseria meningitidis ( N. meningitidis) serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y.
- To evaluate the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT (both lots) and of Menactra in all three groups in terms of the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY titers ≥ 1:4, ≥ 1:8 and GMTs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To evaluate the immunogenicity of Lot B in terms of the percentage of sub jects with hSBAMenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY vaccine response.

## Safety:

To evaluate the safety of the MenACWYTT Lot A, Lot B, and Menactra vaccines with respect to:

- Local and general solicited symptoms during the 4 -day period (Day 0 - Day 3) following vaccination.
- Unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) during the 31-day period (Day 0 - Day 30) following vaccination.
- Serious adverse events (SAEs) and new onset chronic illness(es) [NOCIs] (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type 1 diabetes and allergies) from administration of study vaccines through 6 months (Day 0 - Day 180) after vaccination

## Study design:

Phase II, observer-blinded, multi-center, controlled study with three parallel groups. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive vaccination with

- MenACWYTT Lot A (ACWY -A group: 68% O-acetylation of MenA polysaccharide [PS]),
- MenACWYTT Lot B (ACWY -B group: 92% O-acetylation of MenA PS) or
- Menactra (ACWY-DT group).

Blood samples were taken prior to and one month after vaccination.

## Number of subjects:

Planned: 1005 healthy subjects 10-25 years of age (335 per treatment group).

Enrolled: 1016 subjects.

Completed: 993 subjects.

Safety : Total vaccinated cohort: 1011 subjects (337 subjects in the ACWY-A group, 336 subjects in the ACWY-B group and 338 subjects in the ACWY-DT group).

Immunogenicity: According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity: 951 subjects (317 subjects in the ACWY-A group, 320 subjects in the ACWY-B group and 314 subjects in the ACWY-DT group).

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

Healthy males or females aged 10 to 25 years of age at the time of the vaccination who the investigator believed that they and/or their parent(s)/legally acceptable representative [LAR(s)] could and would comply with the requirements of the protocol. Subjects needed to have previously completed routine childhood vaccinations to the best of the subject's/L AR's knowledge and could not have a previous history of having been administered a meningococcal congugate or PS vaccine. Females had to be of non-childbearing potential. If they were of childbearing potential, they had to practice and agree on adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination until two months after vaccination, and have a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination. Written informed consent was obtained from the subjects or from the subjects' parents/LARs, as appropriate.

The Menactra vaccine consisted of 4 μg of PSA, 4 μg of PSC, 4 μg of PSW -135 and 4 μg of PSY conjugated to ~48 μg diphtheria toxoid (DT). The vaccine was supplied as a clear to slightly turbid liquid in a monodose vial for delivery of 0.5 mL volume. The lot number for the vaccine was U3361AA.

## Duration of treatment:

The intended duration of the study was approximately six months per subject, one month active phase and an additional five months of extended safety follow-up (ESFU).

## Criteria for evaluation:

## Immunogenicity :

## Primary endpoint:

Immunogenicity in all subjects with respect to components of the investigational vaccine and the control vaccine:

- hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY vaccine response* in the ACWY-A group and the ACWY-DT group.
* Vaccine response was defined as an hSBA titer of at least 1:8 in subjects initially seronegative (hSBA titer &lt; 1:4) and as a 4-fold increase in titer in subjects initially seropositive (hSBA titer ≥ 1:4).

## Secondary endpoints:

Immunogenicity in all subjects with respect to components of the investigational vaccines and the control vaccine (on secondary read-outs):

- hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBAMenY titers ≥ 1:4, ≥ 1:8, and GMTs prior to and one month after vaccination in all groups.
- Vaccine response in the ACWY-B group.

## Safety :

## Secondary endpoints:

Solicited local and general symptoms:

- Occurrence of each solicited local (any and grade 3) and general symptom (any, grade 3, related) within 4 days (Day 0 - Day 3) following vaccination.

Unsolicited symptoms:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Occurrence of unsolicited non-serious AEs within 31 days (Day 0 - Day 30) after vaccination, according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification. · Occurrence of SAEs and NOCIs (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes, and allergies) from the time of vaccination (Month 0) through 6 months after study vaccination.

## Summary of Results:

## Demography:

The demographic profile of the subjects of the three vaccine groups was comparable with respect to mean age, gender and racial distribution. The mean age of the subjects at the time of enrolment across the three vaccine groups was 16.3 years (range from 10 to 25 years). A similar number of males and females was enrolled overall (female/male ratio of 1.05). Around 74% of subjects from all three vaccine groups were from White-Caucasian/European heritage. Most remaining subjects were of African/African American heritage (10.5%), Asian-Central/South Asian heritage (5.3%) and of other origin (mixed races, 5.9%).

## Immunogenicity:

The primary analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. Since the percentage of enrolled subjects with serological results available excluded from this ATP cohort was less than 5%, no supplementary analysis based on the Total vaccinated cohort was performed.

## Primary objective (Synopsis table 1):

The non-inferiority of MenACWYTT (Lot A) when compared to Menactra in terms of the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY vaccine response one month after vaccination was demonstrated since for each serogroup separately, the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between groups (ACWY-A minus ACWY-DT) was greater than the pre-defined clinical limit of -10%.

## Safety:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary analysis of safety was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort. Since less than 5% of the enrolled subjects were eliminated from the ATP cohort for analysis of safety, no supplementary analysis

was performed on the ATP cohort for safety.

## Overall incidence of AEs:

· At least one symptom (solicited or unsolicited) was reported in 70.0%, 66.1% and 70.1% of subjects in the ACWY-A, ACWY-B and ACWY-DT groups, respectively. The incidence of subjects with local symptoms was 58.8%, 56.3% and 59.5%, respectively and the incidence of subjects with general symptoms was 44.8%, 39.3% and 42.3%, respectively.

## Solicited local AEs:

- The predominant solicited local symptom during the 4-day post-vaccination period was pain at the injection site, reported by 51.4%, 50.8%, 55.4% of subjects in the ACWY-A, ACWY-B and ACWY-DT groups, respectively. A much smaller percentage of these subjects reported pain with grade 3 intensity, ranging between 0.6% and 2.4% across all vaccine groups.

## Solicited general AEs:

- Across the three vaccine groups, the most common solicited general symptom was fatigue with an incidence of 27.3% to 29.2%. Headache was reported by 25.5% to 26.4% and gastrointestinal symptoms by 13.1% to 13.5% of subjects across the three vaccine groups. The incidence of fever (defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C [99.5°F] measured by any method) ranged from 4.3% to 5.2% across the three vaccine groups. Only one subject in the ACWY-A group reported fever above 39.5°C.
- A small percentage (2.7% at most) of subjects had solicited general symptoms with grade 3 intensity after vaccination in the three vaccine groups. The majority of the reported solicited general symptoms were attributed a causal relationship to the vaccination by the investigators.

## Unsolicited AEs:

- At least one unsolicited symptom during the 31-day post-vaccination period was reported for 105 (31.2%), 76 (22.6%) and 85 (25.1%) subjects in the ACWY-A, ACWY-B and ACWY-DT groups, respectively.
- At least one unsolicited symptom with grade 3 intensity was reported in 17 (5.0%), 13 (3.9%) and 16 (4.7%) subjects in the ACWY-A, ACWY-B and ACWY-DT groups, respectively. The most common grade 3 symptom was cough (0.9% in the ACWY-A and ACWY-DT groups, and 0% in the ACWY-B group). All other separate symptoms occurred in at most 2 subjects per treatment group (Table 25).
- Unsolicited symptoms related to vaccination were reported in 25 (7.4%), 15 (4.5%) and 27 (8.0%) subjects in the ACWY-A, ACWY-B and ACWY-DT groups, respectively. The most frequently reported unsolicited symptoms with causal relationship to vaccination were injection site reaction in the ACWY-A group (1.2%) and injection site hematoma in the ACWY-B group (0.9%) and in the ACWY-DT group (1.5%)
- Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms causally related to vaccination were reported by five subjects in the ACWY-A group and two subjects each in the ACWY-B and ACWY-DT groups. Only pain and chills were reported by two subjects in the ACWY-A and ACWY-B groups, respectively, while all other separate symptoms were reported by one subject per treatment group

New Onset of Chronic Illness:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- At least one NOCI was reported from Dose 1 up to the study end by three (0.9%) subjects in the ACWY-A group and included hypersensitiviy, insulin resistance, asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity

ACWY-DT=Menactra

## Pregnancies:

During the 31-day follow-up period post-vaccination, two subjects became pregnant. An additional 8 subjects became pregnant after the 31-day post-vaccination period.

## MAH Conclusions:

- The non-inferiority of MenACWYTT (Lot A) when compared to Menactra in terms of the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY vaccine response one month after vaccination was demonstrated (all the lower limits of the two sided 95% CI for the difference between groups were greater than or equal to -10%).
- At least one unsolicited symptom during the 31-day post-vaccination period was reported for 105 (31.2%), 76 (22.6%) and 85 (25.1%) subjects in the ACWY-A, ACWY-B and ACWY-DT groups, respectively. Grade 3 unsolicited events were infrequent (at least one event reported in 5.0% of subjects at most). At least one NOCI was reported from Dose 1 up to the study end for three (0.9%) subjects in the ACWY-A group (hypersensitiviy, insulin resistance, asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity). From Dose 1 up to the study end, SAEs were reported by one subject in the ACWY-A group (asthma), five subjects in the ACWY-B group (tooth infection, appendicitits, asthma, influenza, pneumonia and hypoxia) and two subjects in the ACWY-DT group (jaw fracture and post-procedural haematoma). None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to study vaccination. No fatal SAEs were reported during the study. In this study, the study vaccine was generally well tolerated.

Assessor's comment: The MAH conclusions are agreed.  No SmPC changes result from this study.

- unsolicited adverse events on Days 0-30 after vaccination,
- serious adverse events, new onset chronic illnesses, rash and adverse events resulting in ER visits from Visit 4 through six months after the last Fourth Dose Phase vaccination.

Note: Serious adverse events, new onset chronic illnesses, rash and adverse events resulting in ER visits were reported during the entire Fourth Dose Phase and the Extended Safety Follow-up Phase after the fourth dose vaccination (i.e. from Visit 4 to 6 months after the last vaccination) for subjects in all treatment groups even though the subjects in the Co-ad and Control groups were not vaccinated until Visit 6.

## Study design:

Note: The Control and Co-ad groups were not required to come in for Visits 4 and 5, so the first visit they came in for in the Fourth Dose Phase was Visit 6 (at which they received their first Fourth Dose Phase vaccination). Even though this was their fourth visit, it was called Visit 6 and not Visit 4.

Immunogenicity-Fourth Dose Phase: ATP cohort: 955 healthy subjects (309 in the ACWY-TT group, 168 in the Hib-CY group, 303 in the Co-ad group, and 175 in the Control)

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

Healthy males or females born after 36 weeks of gestation who were between, and including, 6 and 12 weeks of age (+ 6 days) at the time of the first vaccination. Subjects for whom the investigator believed that parents/guardians could and would comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary card, return for followup visits). Parent or guardian of the subject provided written informed consent. For inclusion in the Fourth Dose Phase, subjects had to receive all three doses in the Primary Phase.

## Results Summary:

## Demography:

The demographic profiles of the two groups in the Primary Total Vaccinated Cohort and of the four groups of subjects for the Fourth Dose ATP cohort for immunogenicity were comparable with respect to mean age, gender, ethnicity and racial distribution. The mean age at the start of the Fourth Dose Phase was 15.3 months, the male:female ratio was 1.03 and the population was predominantly of White - Caucasian/European heritage.

## Immunogenicity /efficacy:

Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort (primary analysis) and on the Total vaccinated cohort.

Due to the hierarchy of the hypotheses and the fact that the pre-defined limit for non-inferiority was not reached for 2 out of 3 pertussis antigens in primary objective 4, care must be exercised in concluding that the pre-defined endpoints of primary objectives 5 and 6 were successfully achieved.

The results of the analyses of the co-primary objectives for this study are described below and are based on the analyses of the Fourth Dose ATP Cohort for immunogenicity.

## Objective 1:

- The lower limit of the two-sided standardized asymptotic 95% CI for the group difference (ACWY-TT group Visit 5 blood sample minus Hib-CY group Visit 5 blood sample) in the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenC titers ≥1:8 and hSBA-MenY titers ≥1:8 was -1.33% and -1.31%, respectively, above the prespecified LL of ≥-10%.

## Objective 1

Table 3s: Difference between ACWY-TT (Visit 5) and Hib-CY (Visit 5) groups in percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenC and hSBA-MenY titers equal to or above the cut-off values of 1:8 one month after the fourth dose (Fourth Dose ATP cohort for immunogenicity, Fourth Dose Phase)

## Objective 4:

- The LL of the two-sided standardized asymptotic 95% CI for the group ratios (Co-ad group Visit 7 blood sample minus Control Visit 7 blood sample) in GMCs was 0.71 for anti-FHA, above the prespecified LL of 0.67. The LL of the two-sided standardized asymptotic 95% CI for the group ratios (Co-ad group Visit 7 blood sample minus Control Visit 7 blood sample) in GMCs for anti-PT (0.65) and anti-PRN (0.49) were below the pre-specified LL of 0.67.

· The pre-defined statistical criteria pertaining to the primary objective of non-inferiority of the MenACWY-TT vaccine co-administered with Infanrix as compared to Infanrix alone with respect to anti-PT and anti-PRN GMCs was not reached. The statistical criterion for non-inferiority for FHA was reached. 95% Cl = 95% confidence interval for the GMC ratio (Anova model - pooled variance); LL = lower limit, UL = upper limit

- Since the criterion for anti-PT and for anti-PRN was not reached, the primary objective 4 of non-inferiority is not met.

Assessor's comment: Because of the hierarchical testing, following a failure of 2/3 results for objective 4 to meet non-inferiority, objectives from 5 onwards cannot be considered to have been met.

## Objective 5:

- The LL of the two-sided standardized asymptotic 95% CI for the group ratios (ACWY-TT group Visit 5 blood sample over the Hib-CY group Visit 5 blood sample) in GMTs was 1.11 for hSBA-MenC and 1.71 for hSBA-MenY, above the pre-specified LL of 0.5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety /reactogenicity:

The primary analysis of safety was performed on the Fourth Dose Total vaccinated cohort. Since more than 5% of the enrolled subjects were eliminated from the Fourth Dose ATP cohort for safety, an additional analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for safety to support the analysis of the Fourth Total vaccinated cohort.

## Overall incidence of AEs:

· During the 4-day follow-up period, at least one symptom (solicited or unsolicited) was reported after the fourth dose in 75% of subjects in the ACWY-TT group, 76.0% of subjects in the Hib-CY group, 80.4% of subjects in the Co-ad group and 76.0% of subjects in the Control group and after the fifth dose in 71.0% of subjects in the ACWYTT and 73.0% of subjects in the Hib-CY group

## Solicited local AEs:

Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local symptoms during the 4-day follow-up period after the fourth dose in the ACWY-TT (41.9%), Co-ad (53.4%) and Control (57.1%), and after the fifth dose in the ACWY-TT (45.5%) and Hib-CY (51.8%) groups. Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom during the 4day follow-up period after the fourth dose in the Hib-CY group (47.9%).

## Solicited general AEs:

Irritability was the most frequently reported general adverse event during the 4-day follow-up period after each dose in all groups (≥47.9% of subjects). Fever was reported in 3.8% to 7.8% of subjects during the 4- day follow-up period after the fourth dose in all groups, and in 6.5% and 5.6% of subjects after the fifth dose in the ACWY-TT and Hib-CY groups respectively.

## Unsolicited AEs:

Unsolicited adverse events during the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-dose 4 were reported for 194 (44.9%), 105 (45.9%), 182 (44.5%), and 101 (43.3%) subjects in the ACWY-TT group, Hib-CY group, Co-ad group, and Control group, respectively. Unsolicited adverse events during the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-dose 5 period in the ACWY-TT groups and Hib-CY group were reported for 167 (38.7%) and 79 (34.5%) subjects respectively. Grade 3 symptoms were infrequent, reported in 0.9%-5.7% of subjects following the fourth dose, and in 2.3% - 2.6% of subjects in the ACWY-TT and Hib-CY groups following the fifth dose.

## Specified AEs:

Overall, at least one SAE, NOCI, rash, or emergency room visit from Visit 1 up to 6 months after last vaccination in the Fourth Dose Phase was reported for 56.7%, 61.1%, 55.3% and 45.1% for the ACWY-TT, Hib-CY, Co-ad and Control groups, respectively.

## Serious adverse events:

SAEs were reported for 30 (6.9%), 11 (4.8%), 26 (6.4%), and 10 (4.3%) subjects in the ACWY-TT group, Hib-CY group, Co-ad group, and Control group, respectively from the first dose of Primary Phase up to 6 months after the last vaccination. A total of three of the SAEs, one subject (Floppy Infant) in the Co-ad group, Fourth Dose Phase and one subject with two SAEs [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Convulsion] in the Hib-CY group, Primary Phase, were considered by the investigators as potentially related to vaccination. Four subjects reported a total of seven fatal SAEs, all in the Hib-CY primary group: one subject reported leukaemia and subsequent respiratory failure: two subjects reported SIDS; and one subject reported septic shock, dehydration, and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. No fatal SAEs were reported during the Fourth Dose Phase.

Assessor's comment: The case of floppy infant occurred at the fourth dose phase of the trial in the Co-Ad group was grade 3, lasted 2 days and resolved. Although Study 0-57 was not available at the time of MAA, this case was described in the original MAA.

## Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events:

Adverse events led to premature discontinuation/withdrawal from the Primary Phase in 6 subjects: four, due to a serious adverse event (two reports of SIDS, one subject with dehydration, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and septic shock and one subject with dysphagia and hypotonia, all Hib-MenCY-TT recipients) and two due to non-serious adverse events (one subject with neutropenia and one subject with hypotonia, both Hib-MenCY-TT recipients). Adverse events led to premature discontinuation/withdrawal from the Fourth Dose Phase in 2 subjects: one due to a serious adverse event (febrile convulsion in a Hib-MenCY-TT recipient) and one due to non-serious adverse event (febrile convulsion in a MenACWY-TT recipient).

## MAH Conclusion(s):

1. MenACWY-TT vaccine administered in the ACWY-TT group was non-inferior to the Hib-CY group with regard to percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:8 for MenC and MenY and was immunogenic for MenA and MenW135
2. MenACWY-TT vaccine administered together with Infanrix in the Co-ad group was non-inferior to the Hib-CY group with regard to percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥1:8 for MenC and MenY and was immunogenic for MenA and MenW-135
3. Infanrix administered together with MenACWY-TT in the Co-ad group was non-inferior to the Control with regard to percentage of subjects with anti-D and anti-T concentrations ≥1.0 IU/mL
4. Infanrix administered together with MenACWY-TT in the Co-ad group did not reach non-inferiority criteria as compared to the Control with regard to GMCs for anti-PT and anti-PRN. The pre-defined statistical criterion for noninferiority for FHA was reached. However, since not all the pre-defined statistical criteria were met, objective 4 was not met.
5. The GMT ratio between the ACWY-TT group and (over) the Hib-CY group reached predefined statistical criteria for non-inferiority for MenC and MenY.
6. The GMT ratio between the Co-ad group and (over) the Hib-CY group reached predefined statistical criteria for non-inferiority for MenC and MenY.

As the objectives were assessed in a hierarchical manner, co-primary objectives 1 to 3 were met and objectives 4 to 6 were not met.

Unsolicited adverse events during the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-dose 4 period were reported for 194 (44.9%), 105 (45.9%), 182 (44.5%), and 101 (43.3%) subjects in the ACWY-TT group, Hib-CY group, Co-ad group, and Control group, respectively.

Unsolicited adverse events during the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-dose 5 period in the ACWY-TT groups and Hib-CY group were reported for 167 (38.7%) and 79 (34.5%) subjects administered MenACWY-TT and Hib-Men-CY-TT, respectively.

At least one specific symptom (SAE, new onset chronic illness, rash, and/or emergency room visit) throughout the study from the time of enrollment up to 6 months after the last vaccination (Primary and Fourth Dose Phases) was reported for 245 (56.7%), 140 (61.1%), 226 (55.3%), and 105 (45.1%) subjects in the ACWY-TT group, Hib-CY group, Co-ad group, and Control group, respectively.

SAEs were reported for 30 (6.9%), 11 (4.8%), 26 (6.4%), and 10 (4.3%) subjects in the ACWY-TT group, Hib-CY group, Co-ad group, and Control group, respectively from the first dose of Primary Phase up to 6 months after the last vaccination.

A total of three of the SAEs, one subject (Floppy Infant) in the Co-ad group, Fourth Dose Phase and one subject with SIDS and Convulsion in the Hib-CY group, Primary Phase, were considered by the investigators as potentially related to vaccination.

Seven fatal SAEs, all in the Hib-CY primary group were reported: one subject reported leukaemia and subsequent respiratory failure: two subjects reported SIDS and one subject reported septic shock, dehydration, and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. No fatal SAEs were reported during the Fourth Dose Phase.

In this study, all vaccination regimens were well tolerated.

## Summary from expert report:

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Nimenrix when administered as a fourth vaccination (at 12-15 or 15-18 months of age) against meningococcal serogroups C and Y in the second year of life after priming with Menhibrix at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.  Since in the US a fourth dose of Diptheria-tetanusacellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is recommended at 15-18 months of age, this study also provide data on the coadministration of Infanrix with Nimenrix. Non-inferiority with respect to the immunogenicity of Infanrix coadministered with Nimenrix as compared to Infanrix administered alone was evaluated.  All subjects were primed with Pediarix at 2, 4 and 6 month of age as part of the study.

When Nimenrix was administered at 12-18 months of age the serogroups A and W-135 antigens were administered as the primary dose; therefore this study also evaluated the immunogenicity of Nimenrix administered at 12-18 months of age with respect to serogroups A and W-135 given as a primary dose.

Of interest and relevant to the approved indication of Nimenrix in the EU this study also evaluated the immunogenicity of Nimenrix administered at 12-15 and 15-18 months of age with respect to serogroups C and W135 given as a primary dose.

One month after vaccination with Nimenrix at 12-15 months of age (ACWY-TT group) and one month after coadministration of Nimenrix with Infanrix at 15-18 months of age (Co-ad group) the percentage of subjects with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hSBA titres ≥ 1:8 for MenA were 98.8% and 96.1% respectively. The hSBA MenA GMTs were 94.8 and 92.4 in the ACWY-TT and Co-ad groups respectively, suggesting no impact of age at vaccination on immunogenicity against MenA as measured by hSBA.  The hSBA MenW-135 GMTs were 923.9 and 1582.9 in the ACWY-TT and Co-ad groups respectively which suggested higher immunogenicity in the group that received Nimenrix at 15-18 months of age.  However the clinical relevance of this observation is unclear given the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 1:8 for W-135 were similar (i.e. 98.6% and 98.9% in the ACWY-TTT and Co-ad groups respectively).

.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Nimenrix when administered as a fourth vaccination (at 12-15 or 15-18 months of age) against meningococcal serogroups C and Y in the second year of life after priming with Menhibrix at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.  Since in the US, a fourth diphtheria-tetanusacellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is recommended at 15-18 months of age, this study also provides data on coadministration of Infanrix with Nimenrix.

.  Of interest and relevant to the approved Nimenrix indication in the EU this study also evaluated the immunogenicity of Nimenrix administered at 12-15 and 15-18 months of age with respect to serogroups A and W135 given as  a primary dose.  One month after vaccination with Nimenrix at 12-15 months of age (ACWY-TT group) and one month after co-administration of Nimenrix with Infanrix at 15-18 months of age (Co-ad group) the percentage of subjects with hSBA titres ≥1:8 for MenA were 98.8% and 96.1% respectively.  The hSBA MenA GMTs were 94.8 and 92.4 in the ACWY-TT and Co-ad groups respectively, suggesting no impact of age at vaccination on immunogenicity against MenA as measured by hSBA.

.   In this study non-inferiority of the response induced by Infanrix hexa co-administered with Nimenrix compared to the one induced  by Infanrix hexa alone was demonstrated, given that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI on the adjusted GMC ratios for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN were above the success criterion defined by the protocol &gt;0.67 (0.83; 0.85 and 0.78 respectively).  These observations are not in line with what has been reported in phase III study MenACWY-TT-040 which evaluated non-inferiority of Nimenrix and Infanrix hexa co-administration compared to administration of both vaccines alone and which was included in the original MAA.

In the currently ongoing study MenACWY-TT-083 in infants evaluation of immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa when co-administered with Nimenrix according to 2, 3, 4 and 12 months and 2, 4 and 12 months schedules is planned. This study will provide further data with regards to potential interactions between Nimenrix and Infanrix hexa antigens and the results will be provided when they become available.

Assessor's comment: The relevance of this study to the product information in the EU is limited as all subjects given Nimenrix between 12-18 months of age were previously primed with Menhibrix which is not available in the EU and co-administered vaccines followed the US schedules.  The MAH proposes no change to the SmPC following the data from this study and this is agreed.

Study MenACWY-TT-083 this will provide more information on immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa when coadministered with Nimenrix according to 2, 3, 4 and 12 months and 2, 4 and 12 months schedules
