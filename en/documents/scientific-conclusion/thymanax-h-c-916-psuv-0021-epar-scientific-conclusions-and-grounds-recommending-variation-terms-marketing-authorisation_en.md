## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Thymanax, and further discussions at the CHMP, the scientific conclusions are as follows:

The  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit  risk  balance  for  the  product  remains  positive.  However, hepatotoxicity remains an important safety concern with agomelatine. The severity and incidence of hepatic ADRs reported during this PSUR period are of the same magnitude as in the previous PSUR period and there seems to be a considerable level of non-compliance with the recommended liver transaminases monitoring programme in clinical practice despite the measures already in place. This is supported by the results of a recent analysis based on the observational cohort study evaluating the safety  of  agomelatine  in  medical  practice  (CLE-068),  indicating  that  baseline  monitoring  was documented for only 65% of the patients while a baseline value and at least one post baseline value, was documented for 55%. Still, there are indications of an improvement in transaminases monitoring over time and the effectiveness of the last DHPC (October 2013), in which prescribers were reminded of the importance of transaminase monitoring, cannot be fully evaluated in this PSUR. The  CHMP  recommends  that  the  product  information  is  amended  to  clarify  the  monitoring requirements for the liver function, in particular the necessity for LFTs to be performed before starting treatment,  and  that  the  following  additional  risk  minimization  measures  and  pharmacovigilance activities should be introduced in an updated version of the RMP to increase the compliance of the regime and its monitoring: 1) Physicians guide to prescribing, 2) Patient booklet with recommendations regarding liver adverse reactions, 3) a post-authorisation safety category 3 study to evaluate the adherence to the monitoring regime and the compliance to relevant contraindications (date for submission of interim/final reports should be December 2016). Hepatic  impairment  should  be  considered  deleted  from  the  missing  information  in  the  RMP.  As hepatotoxicity is an important identified risk, hepatic impairment is a contraindication for the product, and detailed recommendations for monitoring of hepatic function is already included in the SmPC and PIL. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Thymanax, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance agomelatine is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
