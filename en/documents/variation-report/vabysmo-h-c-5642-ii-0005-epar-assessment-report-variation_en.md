## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant  to  Article  16  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1234/2008,  Roche  Registration  GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 24 July 2023 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema  secondary  to  retinal  vein  occlusion  (branch  RVO  or  central  RVO)  for  Vabysmo,  based  on results  from  the  two  phase  3  studies:  GR41984  (BALATON)  in  patients  with  branch  retinal  vein occlusion (BRVO) and GR41986 (COMINO) in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or hemi-retinal  vein  occlusion  (HRVO).  These  are  global,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-masked, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group, 2-part studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and PK of faricimab.  As  a  consequence,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  have  been updated.  The  Package  Leaflet  is  updated  in  accordance.  Version  3.0  of  the  RMP  has  also  been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor changes to the PI.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision on the  granting  of  a  product-specific  waiver  for  all  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  with  RVO (P/0333/2020).

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

Not applicable

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Derogation(s) of market exclusivity

Not applicable.

## Scientific advice

During the development of faricimab for the treatment of patients with RVO, the MAH sought Scientific Advice (SA) from the EMA Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP).

In  February  2020  the  MAH  received  SA  on  clinical  aspects (EMEA/H/SA/3552/4/2020/II). The main recommendations were as follows.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In relation to the planned study population , it was supported that patients with ischemic RVO are not excluded.  It  was  recommended  to  include  patients  with  hemi-retinal  vein  occlusion  and  this recommendation  was  followed  by  the  MAH.  External  validity  was  considered  to  be  reduced,  as  the study was planning to enrol patients with less than 3 months history of RVO.

The proposal to exclude patients with visually significant vitreous haemorrhage was questioned. The proposal to exclude patients with diabetic retinopathy was supported. The stratification on BCVA was endorsed but it was considered that the cut-off (i.e. 55 letters for stratification) needed to be justified.

In relation to the treatment dose and regimen for faricimab, it was highlighted that, as there are no phase II data in the treatment of RVO, it is difficult to comment regarding the appropriateness of the proposed dose regimen and therefore it was considered that the dose would need to be justified at the stage of the MAA. In relation to the dose of the comparator it was agreed that the monthly regimen for the comparator could be accepted.

In relation to the non-inferiority margin, the 4-letter proposed by the MAH was considered to be a margin in the range that could be acceptable.

In relation to  the treatment  regimen  beyond  the  primary  endpoint it  was  agreed  that individualised treatment regimen after primary efficacy could be explored. However, it was highlighted that the development programme in RVO does not robustly address the potential to reduce the number of faricimab injections as no comparative data are available after 6 months of treatment. Even if it can be shown that BCVA is maintained with a reduced number of injections compared to the evaluation at month  6,  this  will  be  a  descriptive  analysis  only.  It  was  recommended  to  continue  the  trial  in  a controlled and masked setting where a T&amp;E dosing is evaluated in both treatment arms. However, this aspect of the scientific advice (SA) was not followed by the MAH.

There was no objection that the MAH would provide at the stage of MAA the Real-World Data (RWD) supplementary analysis. However, due to methodological limitations (as highlighted to the MAH) this was  foreseen  to  introduce  a  bias  in  favour  of  faricimab  and  of  concern,  with  regard  to  a  fair comparison.

The EMA endorsed the proposed safety monitoring plan and the overall size of the safety database (&gt; 2800 subjects). The approximate number of 540 patients with RVO exposed to faricimab at the time of filing this application was considered sufficient to draw an initial conclusion on the benefit/risk in the treatment  of  RVO.  However,  the  Agency  expected  that  safety  data,  including  some  long-term  data would  be  available  from  other  indications  (in  particular  DME)  at  the  time  of  submission.  While  the Agency did not object to supplementary analysis with RWD, the downsides associated with these types of  data,  specifically  under-reporting  of  adverse  events  and  handling  of  post-baseline  treatment decisions, were highlighted.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Faricimab (also known as RO6867461 and VABYSMO) is the first humanised bispecific immunoglobulin G1  (IgG1)  antibody  developed  for  intravitreal  use  that  selectively  binds  to  and  neutralizes  both angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A).

Vabysmo is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with:

- neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD),
- visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME).

With  this  application,  the  Sponsor  seeks  an  additional  indication  for  the  use  of  faricimab  to  treat patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to  retinal  vein  occlusion  (RVO).  Clinical  evidence  supporting  the efficacy, safety, and favourable benefit-risk assessment of faricimab is mainly based on the primary analysis results of two pivotal Phase III studies:

- Study GR41984 (hereafter referred to as BALATON) in patients with macular edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)
- Study GR41986 (hereafter referred to as COMINO) in patients with macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion or hemiretinal vein occlusion (C/HRVO).

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

## Disease or condition

RVO is one of the most common retinal vascular disorders and is associated with varying degrees of visual loss (Hayreh et al. 1994). RVO has been reported as the second leading cause of blindness for patients with retinal vascular disease, following diabetic retinopathy (DR) (Cugati et al. 2006; Klein et al. 2008; Rogers et al. 2010; Yasuda et al. 2010). The main types of RVO include BRVO, HRVO, and CRVO. As of 2015, approximately 28.06 million adults worldwide were affected by any type of RVO, of which  4.67  million  are  CRVO  patients  and  23.38  million  are  BRVO  patients.  The  estimated  global prevalence of RVO increased with advanced age but did not show significant differences between sexes (Song et al. 2019).

## State the claimed the therapeutic indication

Vabysmo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with:

- visual  impairment  due  to  macular  oedema  secondary  to  retinal  vein  occlusion  (branch  RVO  or central RVO).

## Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention

The most recognised risk factors for RVO are age and systemic vascular disorders. In over half of the cases, the age of onset is over 65 years. Systemic diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes  mellitus  are  very  strongly  associated  with  the  development  of  RVO  (Kolar  2014).  The most common ocular risk factor associated with RVO is glaucoma.

## Aetiology and pathogenesis

The  pathogenesis  of  macular  oedema  in  patients  with  RVO  starts  with  an  increase  in  intraluminal pressure within the retinal vein caused by vascular obstruction, which leads to areas of reduced retinal perfusion and ischemia. Ischemia leads to up-regulation and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF)  (Boyd  et  al.  2002;  Noma  et  al.  2006)  and  angiopoietin-2  (Ang-2),  both  well-known proangiogenic and vessel hyperpermeability cytokines with Ang-2  contributing additional proinflammatory  and  vessel  destabilization  properties  (Maisonpierre  at  al.  1997;  Hackett  et  al  2000; Fiedler et al 2006).

Patients with RVO were found to have some of the highest vitreous and/or aqueous levels of both Ang2  and  VEGF  among  patients  with  retinal  vascular  diseases  (Aiello  et  al  1994;  Regula  et  al.  2016).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Increased levels of Ang-2 and VEGF in retinal tissue result in pathological changes in the retina, and in many  patients,  also  leads  to  macular  oedema  that  is  accompanied  with  a  decrease  in  vision.  A hallmark of RVO is the characteristic pattern of retinal haemorrhages, tortuous and dilated retinal veins across the affected area of retina (one quadrant in BRVO, two quadrants in HRVO and the entire retina in  CRVO).  In  more  severe  cases,  patients  can  develop  retinal  ischemia  with  subsequent  retinal neovascularisation, haemorrhages, neovascularisation in the anterior segment leading to rubeosis  or neovascular glaucoma, and some patients may develop optic disc oedema.

## Clinical presentation, diagnosis

The most common presenting complaint of RVO is an abrupt, painless decrease of central vision, due to  macular  oedema.  Less  frequently,  patients  may  present  with  a  history  of  transient  vision  loss, lasting a few seconds to minutes, with complete recovery of vision. These symptoms may recur over several days to weeks before being followed by a permanent decrease in vision. Metamorphopsia and visual field defects have also been described (Achiron et al. 2015; Manabe et al. 2017).

## Management

Anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy is the current mainstay of treatment in macular oedema due to RVO and has demonstrated efficacy across several pivotal, randomised clinical studies, although macular laser and intravitreal steroids especially steroid implants are also used in some cases.

## 2.1.2. About the product

Faricimab is a humanised bispecific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that acts through inhibition of two distinct pathways by neutralisation of both angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A).

Ang-2 causes vascular instability by promoting endothelial destabilisation, pericyte loss, and pathological angiogenesis, thus potentiating vascular leakage and inflammation. It also sensitises blood vessels  to  the  activity  of  VEGF-A  resulting  in  further  vascular  destabilisation.  Ang-2  and  VEGF-A synergistically increase vascular permeability and stimulate neovascularisation.

By  dual  inhibition  of  Ang-2  and  VEGF-A,  faricimab  reduces  vascular  permeability  and  inflammation, inhibits pathological angiogenesis and restores vascular stability.

## 2.1.3. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

During the development of faricimab for the treatment of patients with RVO, the MAH sought Scientific Advice (SA) from the EMA Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP). In February 2020 the MAH received SA on clinical aspects (EMEA/H/SA/3552/4/2020/II).

## 2.1.4. General comments on compliance with GCP

The MAH provided confirmation that all clinical trials conducted outside the European Union meet the ethical requirements of the EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC].

For  studies  conducted  in  the  EU/EEA  countries,  the  investigators  ensure  compliance  with  the  EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC]. The pivotal studies were conducted in the following countries:

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new nonclinical data have been submitted in support of this application.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The active substance is a natural substance (protein) the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, faricimab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

No new nonclinical data have been submitted in support of this application, which was acceptable for the CHMP.

Considering the above, faricimab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

In the initial marketing application for use of faricimab for the indications of neovascular age-related macular  degeneration  (nAMD)  and  diabetic  macular  oedema  (DME),  the  clinical  pharmacology  of faricimab was characterised in nine clinical studies. These included one Phase I, two Phase II and two Phase III studies in patients with nAMD, one Phase I in patients with nAMD and DME and one Phase II and two Phase III studies in patients with DME.

For  the  present  extension  of  indication  application,  two  Phase  III  studies  in  patients  with  macular oedema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) were conducted; Study GR41984 (BALATON) in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and Study GR41986  (COMINO)  in patients with central/hemiretinal retinal vein occlusion (C/HRVO). The pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and  anti-drug  antibody  (ADA)  results  from  all  11  faricimab  clinical  studies  were  pooled  for  the population PK analysis. Exposure-response analyses (efficacy and safety) in patients with RVO were also conducted.

The proposed dose of faricimab is 6 mg (0.05 mL) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly)  for  3  or  more  consecutive  doses,  followed  by  a  treat-and-extend  approach  for  macular oedema secondary to RVO.

Table 3 below gives an overview of the studies contributing new data to support the RVO indication through Week 24:

## GCP

The MAH provided a statement of GCP compliance for both the BALATON and COMINO studies. There were two site GCP inspections each for these two studies, conducted in China by the Center for Food and  Drug  Inspection  (CFDI)  under  China's  National  Medical  Products  Administration  (NMPA).  There were no major or critical findings for both BALATON and COMINO site(s) inspections.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Bioanalytical methods

PK was evaluated using the same validated bioanalytical assays for measuring free faricimab aqueous humour (AH) and plasma concentrations  as  described  for  the  previous  Phase  III  trials  in  the  initial MAA. Immunogenicity was evaluated using the same validated faricimab ADA assay as described for the previous Phase III trials in the initial MAA. PD was evaluated using the same validated bioanalytical methods to measure AH Ang-2 and free Ang-2 in plasma, and the same validated methods to measure free VEGF in AH and plasma, as were used for the previous Phase III trials.

A  table  summarising  the  bioanalytical  method  studies  for  the  analysis  of  PK,  PD,  and  anti-drug antibodies for all Phase III clinical studies is noted below. All bioanalytical methods used in this study were previously validated for the initial MAA.

BALATON  (Study GR41984) is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-masked, active comparator-controlled, parallel -group, 2-part study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of faricimab administered by intravitreal injection at 4-week intervals until Week 24, followed by a period of study without active control to evaluate faricimab administered according to a personalized  treatment  interval  (PTI)  dosing  regimen  in  patients  with  macular  edema  due  to  BRVO where investigators and patients are masked to treatment assignment in Part 1 and to both original treatment assignment and faricimab treatment interval in Part 2.

This  study  is  comprised    two  parts:  Part  1  (Day  1  through  Week  24)  compared  faricimab  every  4 weeks  (Q4W)  versus  aflibercept  Q4W;  Part  2  (Week  24  through  Week  72)  evaluated  faricimab administered at masked treatment intervals of Q4W to every 16 weeks (Q16W) based on PTI dosing criteria.

The  Primary  Clinical  Study  Report  (CSR)  submitted  with  this  application  provides  the  results  of  the primary analysis through Week 24.

In  Part  1  (Q4W  dosing),  570  patients  were  planned  to  be  randomized  during  the  global  enrolment phase  of  the  study  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  one  of  two  treatment  arms:  Arm  A  (n  =  285)  received  6  mg faricimab intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20 (6 injections) and Arm B (n = 285) received 2 mg aflibercept intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20 (6 injections).

Mandatory blood samples for plasma concentrations for faricimab PK, PD, and ADA were taken at Day 1, Day 7, Week 4, and Week 24 for the study period in this report. Optional aqueous humour (AH) samples were taken at Day 1, Day 7, and Week 4, and Week 24 for the study period in this report. Optional PK plasma samples if an AH sample was collected were at Day 7, and optional PD plasma Samples were at Day 7 and Week 4.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

## Ocular Pharmacokinetics

Aqueous humour faricimab concentrations from 23 patients consenting  to  optional  aqueous  humour sampling were included in the PK data analysis.

Faricimab was measurable throughout the study. Medium to high inter-patient variability was observed in faricimab aqueous humour concentrations through Week 24 (CV: 57.4% to 113.4%). The maximum observed concentration was observed at the first time point collected (i.e., 1-week post-dose).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The observed mean (±SD) faricimab aqueous humour concentration was 43.2 (±24.8) μ g/mL at Week 1  (1  week  after  the  first  administration).  The  observed  mean  faricimab  4  week-post-dose  aqueous humour concentrations were 5.8 (±5.3) μ g/mL at Week 4 and 5.0 (±5.6) μ g/mL at Week 24. The mean aqueous humour concentration-time profiles are shown in Figure 1 below.

## Study GR41986 (COMINO)

COMINO (Study GR41986) is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-masked, active comparator controlled,  parallel-group,  2-part  study  evaluating  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  pharmacokinetics  of faricimab administered by intravitreal injection at 4-week intervals until Week 24, followed by a period of  study  without  active  control  to  evaluate  faricimab  administered  according  to  a  personalized treatment interval (PTI) dosing regimen in patients with macular edema due to CRVO or HRVO where investigators  and  patients  are  masked  to  treatment  assignment  in  Part  1  and  to  both  original treatment assignment and faricimab treatment interval in Part 2.

This  study  is  comprised    two  parts:  Part  1  (Day  1  through  Week  24)  compared  faricimab  every  4 weeks  (Q4W)  versus  aflibercept  Q4W;  Part  2  (Week  24  through  Week  72)  evaluated  faricimab administered at masked treatment intervals of Q4W to every 16 weeks (Q16W) based on PTI dosing criteria.

The  Primary  Clinical  Study  Report  (CSR)  submitted  with  this  application  provides  the  results  of  the primary analysis through Week 24.

In  Part  1  (Q4W  dosing),  750  patients  were  planned  to  be  randomized  during  the  global  enrolment phase  of  the  study  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  one  of  two  treatment  arms:  Arm  A  (n  =  375)  received  6  mg faricimab intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20 (6 injections) and Arm B (n = 375) received 2 mg aflibercept intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20 (6 injections).

Mandatory blood samples for plasma concentrations for faricimab PK, PD, and ADA were taken at Day 1, Day 7, Week 4, and Week 24 for the study period in this report. Optional aqueous humour (AH) samples were taken at Day 1, Day 7, and Week 4, and Week 24 for the study period in this report. Optional  PK  plasma  samples  if  AH  samples  were  collected  were  at  Day  7  and  optional  PD  plasma samples were at Day 7 and Week 4.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

## Ocular Pharmacokinetics

Aqueous humour faricimab concentrations from 33 patients consenting  to  optional  aqueous  humour sampling were included in the PK data analysis. Faricimab was measurable throughout the study. High inter-patient variability was observed in faricimab aqueous humour concentrations through Week 24 (CV: 78.8% to 1233%). The maximum observed concentration was observed at the first time point collected (i.e., 1-week post-dose). The observed mean (±SD) faricimab aqueous humour concentrations  were  58.1  (±45.8) μ g/mL  at  Week  1  (1  week  after  the  first  administration).  The observed mean faricimab 4 week-post-dose aqueous humour concentrations was 9.2 (±10.1) μ g/mL at Week 4 and 9.3 (±11.5) μ g/mL at Week 24.

The mean aqueous humour concentration-time profiles are shown in the Figure 3 below.

## Plasma Pharmacokinetics

Plasma data from 349 patients were included in the PK data analysis.  High inter-patient variability was observed  in  faricimab  concentrations  through  Week  24  (CV%  of  57.3%  to  83.9%).  The  maximum observed  concentration  was  1-week  post-dose  (first  time  point  collected  after  drug  administration). The observed mean (±SD) faricimab plasma concentration was 0.148 (±0.0846) μ g/mL at Week 1 (1 week  after  the  first  administration).  The  observed  mean  faricimab  4-week  post-dose  plasma concentrations were 0.0219 (±0.0175) μ g/mL at Week 4 and 0.0260 (±0.0218) μ g/mL at Week 24.

The faricimab AH-to-plasma ratio on Day 7 was ~394.

The  mean  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  based  on  the  faricimab  PK-evaluable  population  are shown below.

BLQ=Below Limit of Quantification. BLQ results at nominal time &lt;=0 are set to O and BLQ results at post-dose are set to 0.004 ug/mL (i.e. half of the lower limit of quantification 0.0o08 ug/mL). Data include results from mandatory and optional PK samples.Time pointswith at least 5 samplesare included in the plot.

The overall study design for BALATON and COMINO studies to assess the PK of faricimab following an intravitreal injection are overall acceptable for the CHMP.

The  ocular  and  plasma  PK  are  similar  between  both  the  BALATON  and  COMINO  studies.  The  Q4W interval for injection resulted in the highest concentration being seen at the 7-day sampling time-point and  low  concentrations  shown  pre-dose  at  Week  4  and  Week  24  for  both  the  ocular  and  plasma faricimab concentrations. The faricimab AH-to-plasma ratios were ~266 and ~394 for the BALATON and COMINO studies respectively.

The  low  number  of  patients  that  consented  to  provide  AH  samples  means  the  data  should  be interpreted with caution.

Overall, the PK for the plasma and AH exposure from the BALATON and COMINO studies are in line with the Phase III studies from the initial MAA.

## Immunogenicity

## Study GR41984 (BALATON)

The ADA analyses were based on the immunogenicity-analysis population for patients in the faricimab Q4W arm in Part 1. The following properties of each sample are listed by patient: ADA status (from the confirmatory  assay):  ADA  positive  (yes)  or  ADA  negative  (no)  and  titer  value  for  the  ADA  positive sample. ADAs were assessed in K3EDTA specimens of faricimab-treated patients at baseline and at Weeks 4 and 24.

The  baseline  prevalence  of  ADAs  to  faricimab  in  the  study  was  1.1%  (3/264).  Incidence  of immunogenicity  to  faricimab  is  based  on  patients  with  treatment-emergent  ADAs  (the  sum  of treatment-induced and treatment-boosted ADA-positive patients). Overall, 18/259 patients (6.9%) in BALATON receiving faricimab had treatment-emergent ADAs, of which all were treatment-induced, no patients were treatment-boosted. Persistence was defined as an ADA positive result that was detected

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at the last post-baseline sampling timepoint, or at 2 or more timepoints during treatment where the first and last ADA positive samples are separated by a period of 16 weeks, irrespective of any negative samples  in  between.  The  observed  median  time  to  onset  was  24.0  weeks,  and  ADA  positivity  was persistent in 94.4% of patients with treatment-induced ADA. ADA titer ranged from 10 to 20480.

The MAH was of the view that visual inspection of the faricimab plasma concentration-time profiles grouped  by  ADA  status  did  not  suggest  a  difference  in  plasma  exposure  in  ADA-positive  patients compared with ADA-negative patients, in Figure 5 (GR41984) below.

mandatory and optional PK samples.

## Study GR41986 (COMINO)

The ADA analyses were based on the immunogenicity-analysis population for patients in the faricimab Q4W arm in Part 1. The following properties of each sample are listed by patient: ADA status (from the confirmatory  assay):  ADA  positive  (yes)  or  ADA  negative  (no)  and  titer  value  for  the  ADA  positive sample. ADAs were assessed in K3EDTA specimens of faricimab-treated patients at baseline and at Weeks 4 and 24.

The  baseline  prevalence  of  ADAs  to  faricimab  in  the  study  was  1.1%  (4/343).  The  incidence  of immunogenicity  to  faricimab  is  based  on  patients  with  treatment  emergent-ADAs  (the  sum  of treatment-induced  and  treatment-boosted  ADA-positive  patients  as  described  in  the  SAP,  Section 5.7.5). Overall, 30/338 patients (8.9%) receiving faricimab had treatment-emergent ADAs, of which all were treatment-induced, and no patients were treatment-boosted. Persistence was defined as an ADA positive  result  that  was  detected  at  the  last  post-baseline  sampling  timepoint,  or  at  2  or  more timepoints during treatment where the first and last ADA positive samples are separated by a period of 16 weeks, irrespective of any negative samples in between. The observed median time to onset was 24.0 weeks and ADA positivity was persistent in 96.7% of patients with treatment-induced ADA. ADA titer ranged from 10 to 10240.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH was of the view that visual inspection of the faricimab plasma concentration-time profiles grouped  by  ADA  status  did  not  suggest  a  difference  in  plasma  exposure  in  ADA-positive  patients compared with ADA-negative patients, in Figure 6 (GR41986) below.

BLQ=Below Limit of Quantification. BLQ results at nominal time &lt;= are set to 0 and BLQ results at post-dose are set to O.0004 ug/mL (i.e. half of the lower limit of quantification 0.0008 ug/mL). Data include results from mandatoryandoptionalPKsamples.

The immunogenicity timepoints for BALATON and COMINO studies were acceptable for the CHMP. The Committee noted that there was a low baseline prevalence of ADAs to faricimab of 1.1% in both the BALATON and COMINO studies. The incidence of immunogenicity to faricimab was based on patients with  treatment  emergent-ADAs  in  both  BALATON  (18/259  patients;  6.9%)  and  COMINO  (30/338 patients; 8.9%) was low. The median onset time of ADA response was 24 weeks.

In  both  studies  the  MAH  was  of  the  view  that  a  visual  inspection  of  the  faricimab  plasma concentration-time profiles do not suggest a difference in plasma exposure between ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients. In the BALATON study (GR41984) it appeared to be a trend of lower plasma concentration in the ADA positive patients compared to ADA negative patients. However, as this was not seen in the COMINO study, and as the incidence of ADA positive patients was low in both Phase III studies, the CHMP considered that these results should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, there was a low incidence of ADAs, and low impact of ADA positive status on faricimab PK in RVO. This is in line with the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology from the initial MAA.

## Population PK Analysis

Population PK of faricimab (RO6867461) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration,  diabetic  macular  oedema,  or  macular  oedema  secondary  to  branch  retinal,  central retinal, or hemiretinal vein occlusion.

## Methods

The data from the faricimab treatment arms of the 2 RVO studies (supplemented by the data from 9 studies in patients with nAMD and DME) were used in the population PK analysis. For GR41984 and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GR41986, the PK data available at Clinical Cut-off Date (CCOD) were included in the analysis. Both plasma and AH faricimab concentrations were used for the analysis.

Faricimab concentration values before the first dose were excluded from the PK analysis. Post-dose observations  that  were  below  the  limit  of  quantification  (BQL)  were  used  in  the  analysis  and  the likelihood-based M3 method for handling BQL observations was applied.

The analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with the NONMEM software, Version 7.5.1 (ICON Development Solutions). The first-order conditional estimation method of NONMEM with LAPLACIAN  and  INTERACTION  options  was  used.  Model-based  simulations  were  performed  by  a combination of R and NONMEM software.

A popPK model of intravitreal-administered faricimab was developed previously based on plasma and AH  faricimab  concentration  data  from  patients  with  DME  and  nAMD  (legacy  model  popPK  report, Report 1105763). There are no mechanistic reasons to expect the PK of faricimab to be different in patients with RVO. Therefore, initially, external evaluation of the legacy model (developed for patients with nAMD and DME) was performed using data from patients with RVO. Specifically, goodness-of-fit (GOF) diagnostic plots for plasma and AH were assessed, for all RVO patients as well as stratified by RVO type (BRVO, CRVO, and HRVO). Post-hoc estimates of individual PK parameters were used while all  population parameters were fixed to the parameters of the legacy model. Visual predictive check plots  as  well  as  the  plots  of  individual  random  effects  versus  covariates  were  also  assessed. Investigation of disease-related covariates was performed graphically. Covariates were selected based on scientific interest, mechanistic plausibility and exploratory graphics. Subsequently, the data from all faricimab clinical trials in nAMD, DME and RVO patients were pooled, and the model parameters were re-estimated.

The joint (nAMD, DME, and RVO) dataset included 1379 patients (46.3%) who had DME, 881 patients (29.6%) who had nAMD, and 717 patients (24.1%) who had RVO. A total of 1842 AH observations from 365 patients and 13389 plasma observations from 2973 patients were available for the analysis. Patients with RVO provided 246 AH observations from 79 patients and 1919 plasma observations from 713 patients.

Summaries of baseline continuous and categorical covariates in patients with nAMD, DME and RVO are presented in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. The percentage of patients who were ADA-positive at any time during the trial was comparable between nAMD, DME and RVO populations (approximately 11%).

## Results

The model tested the effect of disease: nAMD, DME, CRVO, HRVO, BRVO and there was no effect of disease on the PK of faricimab. The structural model was a 3-compartment catenary model, Vv, VA, and Vc/F are  the  volumes  of  the  vitreous,  aqueous  and  plasma  compartments  and  kVH  is  the  first order rate constant from the vitreous to the aqueous compartment, kAH the first order rate constant from the aqueous to the plasma compartment, and the first order constant of elimination from the plasma compartment k (k = CL/Vc). VV was set to 4.5 mL, while all other parameters were estimated. The  parameters  for  the  final  model  064  are  shown  in  Table  7.  The  goodness-of-fit  plots  and  the prediction-corrected visual predictive check for the final model 064 for patients with RVO are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.

For  a  reference  patient  (a  65-year-old,  ADA  negative,  80  kg  male  who  received  the  Phase  III formulation) the kV was 0.0901 day-1, corresponding to a VH t1/2 of 7.69 days, kA was faster than for the VH rate constant, i.e. 16.5 day-1, corresponding to a t1/2 of 0.04 days. The systemic CL/F was rapid, with a value of 2.45 L/day, corresponding to a plasma t1/2 of 0.36 days.

Covariates affecting the ocular and plasma disposition were identified. For the ocular disposition, the following  covariates  were  retained:  plasma  ADA  on  VH  rate  constant,  age  on  VH  rate  constant  and formulation on  aqueous rate  constant.  For  plasma  PK,  the  following  covariates  were  retained:  body weight on Vc/F and CL/F, sex on CL/F and formulation on apparent clearance (CL/F). The effects of covariates are presented in the Table below.

In terms of factors affecting VH disposition, faricimab VH t1/2 increased with increasing age; a typical 42 years' old patient had VH elimination t1/2 approximately 39.6% shorter than a typical 88-year-old patient. The presence of plasma ADA, led to shorter VH t1/2 resulting in a modest (19.8%) decrease in VH  exposure.  Due  to  the  small  (i.e.,  nearly  20%)  magnitude  of  the  effect  of  the  covariates,  the influence of the covariates on VH disposition was not considered clinically significant.

In plasma, both CL/F and Vc/F increased with body weight. Plasma volume of distribution increased proportionally with body weight (with the power coefficient of 0.905, (95%CI: 0.814-0.995), consistent with  the  expected  allometric  increase.  In  agreement  with  allometric  scaling,  faricimab  plasma  CL increased with weight with the power coefficient of 0.684 (95%CI: 0.627-0.74). The effect of sex was modest, with 16.7% higher plasma exposure in female patients compared with male patients, while no obvious  difference  was  observed  in  VH  exposure.  Due  to  the  small  magnitude  of  the  effects  of  the covariates (~20%) on plasma exposure, they were not considered clinically significant.

Other covariates such as renal and hepatic function, ethnicity and race, prior medications, the effect of disease  (nAMD  vs  DME  vs  RVO),  the  different  types  of  RVO  (BRVO,  HRVO,  CRVO)  and  use  of  IOP lowering agents had no discernible effect on faricimab disposition.

The  individual  estimates  of  the  steady-state  exposure  parameters  following  6  mg  Q4W  doses (AUCQ4W, Cmax, Tmax, and Ctrough,ss) are summarized by disease in Table 9 below. No faricimab accumulation was observed in the vitreous, aqueous and plasma compartments (Figure 9 below).

The  methods  used  for  model  development  and  evaluation  are  acceptable  for  the  CHMP.  Data exclusions were well documented and are agreeable. Post-dose BLQ observations were appropriately handled using the M3 method.

A 3-compartment linear model, composed of the vitreous humour (VH) compartment, where the drug is  injected,  the  AH  compartment,  and  the  plasma  compartment  adequately  described  faricimab concentration-time profiles in patients with RVO. The VH volume was fixed to the literature value of 4.5 mL, as done previously, which is considered acceptable. The updated parameter estimates, after inclusion of RVO data, were close to the parameters of the prior legacy model based on nAMD and DME data.

All final model parameters were estimated with good precision and High IIV shrinkage (~40-60%) of plasma CL and Vc as well as the AH elimination rate constant (KAH) are noted. Therefore, individual estimates for these parameters and predicted exposures of faricimab in the AH and plasma may not be reliable.  Importantly,  IIV  shrinkage  of  KVH  was  low  (5.3%).  As  such,  predicted  VH  exposure,  which were used as PK metric in the ER analyses, can be considered reliable.

Overall, the goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots indicated that the final model described the observed data adequately.  The  pcVPC  showed  that  the  final  model  captured  both  the  central  tendency  and  the interindividual variability of faricimab PK in AH and plasma adequately.

Consistent with the prior legacy model, the covariates that influenced faricimab ocular PK parameters were age, formulation, and presence of ADAs, while faricimab systemic PK parameters were influenced

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

by sex, body weight, and formulation. The effects of these covariates on ocular and plasma PK were not considered to be clinically meaningful, which is agreed by the CHMP.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

The most common presenting complaint of RVO is an abrupt, painless decrease of central vision due to macular  oedema.  The  pathogenesis  of  macular  oedema  in  these  patients  starts  with  an  increase  in intraluminal  pressure  due  to  vascular  obstruction,  which  causes  areas  of  reduced  perfusion  and ischemia. Ischemia leads to up-regulation and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2  (Ang-2),  both  well-known  proangiogenic  and  vessel  hyperpermeability  cytokines, with  Ang-2  contributing  to  additional  proinflammatory  and  vessel  destabilization.  Patients  with  RVO have the highest vitreous levels of both Ang-2 and VEGF among all retinal vascular diseases.

## Mechanism of action

Faricimab is a humanised bispecific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) that selectively and independently binds VEGF-A and Ang-2. The VEGF binding fragment antigen binding (Fab) of faricimab binds all isoforms of VEGF with high affinity, and the Ang-2 binding Fab binds to Ang-2 also with high affinity. The proposed hypothesis is that simultaneous inhibition of both VEGF-A and Ang-2 has the potential for additional improvements in visual acuity and anatomical outcomes as well as a prolonged duration of treatment effect  as  compared  to  targeting  only  VEGF-A.  Faricimab  combines  the  anti-inflammatory  and  antiangiogenic mechanism of action through Ang-2 neutralization with the well-established effects of antiVEGF targeting.

## Primary pharmacology

## Ocular Pharmacodynamics

AH  concentrations  from  23  patients  treated  with  faricimab  and  consenting  to  optional  AH  sampling were included in the PD data analysis (AH free Ang-2 and free VEGF-A concentrations). Free VEGF-A samples below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ; 1.46 pg/mL) and free Ang-2 samples below the LLOQ (4.04 pg/mL) were imputed with LLOQ/2 and mean values were calculated.

High inter-patient variability was observed in aqueous humour Ang2 (CV: 71.6-268%) and VEGF -A (CV: 56.9-108%) concentrations in the faricimab Q4W arm through Week 24.

Median  (min-max)  baseline  VEGFA  concentrations  were  94.2  (43.3-399)  pg/mL  for  the  faricimab Q4W arm. The faricimab treatment arm showed rapid suppression of VEGF-A (median concentration &lt; 3  pg/mL)  from  Day  7  onwards  and  thereafter  sustained  target  suppression  was  observed.  Median VEGF-A concentration was &lt; 7 pg/mL up to the last visit (Week 24) (Figure 10 below).

The PD sampling timepoints for the BALATON and COMINO studies are acceptable for the Committee.

The CHMP noted that there was high inter-patient variability in VEGF-A and ANG-2 AH concentrations in both the BALATON (VEGF-A, 56.9-108%; ANG -2, 71.6-268%) and COMINO (VEGF -A, 62.2-294%; ANG-2, 76.6-141%) studies.

The faricimab treatment arm in both the BALATON and COMINO studies showed rapid suppression of both the free VEGF-A and free ANG-2 parameters from Day 7 in the AH. Suppression was maintained up to the Week 24 visit.

There  was  no  change  in  plasma  free  VEGF-A  or  free  Ang-2  up  to  Week  24  when  compared  with baseline levels.

Overall, the PD for the plasma and AH free VEGF-A and Ang-2 levels from the BALATON and COMINO studies are in line with the Phase III studies from the initial MAA.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

Exposure-efficacy  analyses  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  secondary  to  branch  retinal, central retinal, or hemiretinal vein occlusion.

## Objectives

- To  assess  the  relationships  between  faricimab  VH  exposure  and  best-corrected  visual  acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CST).
- To  graphically  assess  the  relationships  between  faricimab  exposure  in  VH  and  the  following pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints: free VEGF-A and free Ang-2 in AH.

## Methods

The exposure-efficacy analyses were performed using the Phase III data from RVO studies GR41984 and GR41986. Efficacy information up to the primary end-point (Week 24) were included. The steadystate  trough  concentration  in  VH  (Ctrough,ss)  following  6  mg  Q4W  dosing  regimen  was  used  as  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metric of exposure to assess the effect of faricimab PK on efficacy. The following continuous endpoints were analysed:

- BCVA, CST, change from baseline of BCVA (dBCVA) or CST (dCST), and percent change from baseline of BCVA (pdBCVA) or CST (pdCST) over time;
- Week 24 change from baseline of BCVA (dBCVAend) and CST (dCSTend);
- Week 24 percent change from baseline of BCVA (pdBCVAend) and CST (pdCSTend).

For the graphical analysis, PD endpoints were observed AH values of free VEGF-A (further called VEGFA) and observed AH values of free Ang-2 (further called Ang-2).

## Results

## Exposure Relationship with BCVA in RVO

Linear regression analyses showed a trend suggestive for lower gains in BCVA in patients with higher faricimab VH exposure (Figure 18). This trend is likely explained by the positive correlation between faricimab VH exposure and age (Figure 19).

When both age and exposure were included in the linear regression model, only age was found to be a significant predictor of the BCVA response (lower BCVA gains in older patients, [slope 0.370, p-value &lt;0.001]), while there was no significant effect of faricimab exposure [slope 0.003, p-value 0.583].

In the faricimab arm, BCVA response tends to be similar between high age and high exposure groups, and similar between low age and low exposure groups.

A similar tendency for lower BCVA gain with increasing age has been observed for the aflibercept arm. No differences in efficacy have been observed between the faricimab and aflibercept arms within the age subgroups (see Clinical Efficacy).

In conclusion, age-adjusted change in BCVA was similar across the ranges of faricimab exposure. No age-based dose adjustment is needed.

## Exposure Relationship with CST in RVO

The  relationship  between  CST  and  exposure  was  evaluated  using  1)  linear  regression  between  VH concentrations  vs  CST  variables  at  primary  endpoint  and  2)  plots  of  time-course  of  CST  by  VH exposure groups.

There were no apparent differences in the time courses of CST between patients in the different VH exposure groups. The CST-time profiles showed a rapid and persistent decrease in retinal thickness following faricimab administration.

Linear  regression  analyses  show  flat  relationships  between  changes  in  CST  and  faricimab  exposure (Figure 20 below).

## Exposure Relationship with Ocular Ang-2 and Free VEGF-A in RVO

The relationship between aqueous target suppression (Ang-2 and VEGF-A) and VH faricimab exposure in Phase III patients with RVO was explored graphically by plotting the observed AH VEGF-A and Ang-2 concentrations versus time after most recent dose by VH exposure (Ctrough) categories. Patients were divided by low and high exposure categories (below and above median exposure, respectively).

Median free VEGF-A concentration-time profiles and fraction of samples BLQ are displayed in Figure 21 and Figure 22 below.

Ang-2 and VEGF-A were suppressed during the dosing interval and there were no apparent differences in  the  time  courses of VEGF-A and Ang-2 suppression between patients with different VH exposure. The comparable free Ang-2 and free VEGF-A suppression profiles for both exposure categories can be explained  by  the  dosing  regimen  of  Q4W  which  maintains  the  target  maximally  suppressed  in  all patients during the Q4W dosing interval and therefore no exposure-response is apparent.

As  pointed  out  by  the  assessors,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  linear  regression  analysis  suggested  a trend of lower BCVA response with higher exposure. However, it was determined that this was likely the result of the positive correlation between exposure and age. When both exposure and age were included in the linear regression model, only age was found to be a significant predictor of the BCVA change  from  baseline  (lower  BCVA  gain  in  older  patients),  while  there  was  no  significant  effect  of exposure on BCVA gain (p-value &gt; 0.5). It is agreed that no age-based dose adjustment is needed.

The  linear  regression  analysis  did  not  detect  an  effect  of  faricimab  exposure  on  CST  changes  from baseline.

The observed concentrations of free VEGF-A in AH declined from the median baseline value of about 100 ng/L  to  nearly  undetectable  levels  shortly  after  faricimab  administration,  and  stayed  low  with repeated 6 mg Q4W dosing, slightly increasing by the end of each 4-week dosing interval.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The observed concentrations of free Ang-2 in AH declined from the median baseline value of about 16 ng/L to undetectable levels shortly after faricimab administration and stayed low (below quantification limit of the assay) with repeated 6 mg Q4W dosing.

The  comparable  free  VEGF-A  and  free  Ang-2  suppression  profiles  for  both  the  lower  and  higher exposure categories (halves of VH Ctrough,ss) can be explained by the dosing regimen of Q4W which maintained the target maximally suppressed in most patients during the dosing interval and therefore no exposure-response was apparent.

Exposure-safety  analyses  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  secondary  to  branch  retinal, central retinal, or hemiretinal vein occlusion.

## Objective

To  assess  the  relationships  between  faricimab  VH  exposure  and  the  probability  of  intraocular inflammation (IOI) and any other relevant safety events based on observed data.

## Methods

The exposure-safety analysis was performed using the Phase III data from RVO studies GR41984 and GR41986. Safety information up to the primary end-point (Week 24) were included. The steady-state trough concentration in VH (Ctrough,ss) following the 6 mg Q4W dosing regimen was used as a metric of exposure to assess the effect of faricimab PK on the occurrence of intra-ocular inflammation (IOI). The individual PK parameters from the final population PK model were used to predict the individual Ctrough,ss values.

IOI was defined as a binary (0/1) variable indicating absence (0) or presence (1) of IOI at any time before Week 24 irrespectively of the severity of the event or the number of occurrences. The following analyses were performed:

- Event rates were compared between Ctrough,ss exposure groups, for all patients in each indication as well as for ADA-negative and ADA-positive subgroups;
- Logistic regression models were implemented to assess the correlation between the probability of occurrence of IOI and exposure predictors (Ctrough,ss and log(Ctrough,ss)).

## Results

The table below shows the incidence rates of intra-ocular inflammation in Part 1 among patients from the  faricimab  arm  (Arm  A)  by  tertile  of  Ctrough,ss.  Overall,  IOI  incidence  rate  was  low  and independent  of  exposure  (1.5%,  2.5%,  and  0.5%  in  Low,  Mid,  and  High  exposure  groups, respectively).

The  logistic  regression  models  (Figure  23)  confirmed  that  incidence  of  IOI  did  not  increase  with faricimab exposure (Ctrough,ss and log(Ctrough,ss)).

The results showed that the IOI incidence rate did not increase with faricimab VH exposure.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

## Study GR41984 (BALATON) and Study GR41986 (COMINO)

The overall study design for the BALATON and COMINO studies to assess the PK of faricimab following an intravitreal injection were overall acceptable.

The  ocular  and  plasma  PK  are  similar  between  both  the  BALATON  and  COMINO  studies.  The  Q4W interval for injection resulted in the highest concentration being seen at the 7-day sampling time-point, and  low  concentrations  shown  pre-dose  at  Week  4  and  Week  24  for  both  the  ocular  and  plasma faricimab concentrations. The faricimab AH-to-plasma ratios were ~266 and ~394 for the BALATON and COMINO studies respectively.

The  low  number  of  patients  that  consented  to  provide  AH  samples  means  the  data  should  be interpreted with caution.

Overall, the PK for the plasma and AH exposure from the BALATON and COMINO studies are in line with the Phase III studies from the initial MAA.

## Immunogenicity

The immunogenicity timepoints for the BALATON and COMINO studies were acceptable. There was a low baseline prevalence of ADAs to faricimab of 1.1% in both the BALATON and COMINO studies. The incidence of immunogenicity to faricimab is based on patients with treatment emergent-ADAs in both BALATON (18/259 patients; 6.9%) and COMINO (30/338 patients; 8.9%) was low. The median onset time of ADA response was 24 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In both studies the MAH suggested that a visual inspection of the faricimab plasma concentration-time profiles  do  not  suggest  a  difference  in  plasma  exposure  between  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative patients.  In  the  BALATON  study  (GR41984)  there  does  appear  to  be  a  trend  of  lower  plasma concentration in the ADA positive patients compared to ADA negative patients. However, as this was not seen in the COMINO study, and as the incidence of ADA positive patients was low in both Phase III studies, the CHMP agreed that these results should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, the CHMP noted that there was a low incidence of ADAs, and low impact of ADA positive status on  faricimab  PK  in  RVO,  based  on  the  available  data.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Summary  of  Clinical Pharmacology from Vabysmo initial MAA. However, most of the patients who developed ADAs still had persistent ADAs at Week 24 (in Balaton, 94.4% and in Comino 96.7%) and possibly beyond Week 24. Further,  there  were  limitations  in  the  strategy  for  assessment  of  immunogenicity.  The  neutralising capacity  of  antibodies  was  not  investigated,  which  is  not  in  line  with  the  immunogenicity  testing strategy outlined in the Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins. In addition, immunogenicity  results  were  only  available  for  patients  randomised  to  faricimab  arm,  but  not  to aflibercept arm.

Therefore, the CHMP conveyed that comparative assessment of immunogenicity is not possible.

## Population PK Analysis

The  methods  used  for  model  development  and  evaluation  are  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP. Data  exclusions  were  well  documented  and  are  acceptable.  Post-dose  BLQ  observations  were appropriately handled using the M3 method.

A 3-compartment linear model, composed of the vitreous humour (VH) compartment, where the drug is  injected,  the  AH  compartment,  and  the  plasma  compartment  adequately  described  faricimab concentration-time profiles in patients with RVO. The VH volume was fixed to the literature value of 4.5 mL, as done previously, which is considered acceptable. The updated parameter estimates, after inclusion of RVO data, were close to the parameters of the prior legacy model based on nAMD and DME data.

All final model parameters were estimated with good precision and High IIV shrinkage (~40-60%) of plasma CL and Vc as well as the AH elimination rate constant (KAH) are noted. Therefore, individual estimates for these parameters and predicted exposures of faricimab in the AH and plasma may not be reliable.  Importantly,  IIV  shrinkage  of  KVH  was  low  (5.3%).  As  such,  predicted  VH  exposure,  which were used as PK metric in the ER analyses, can be considered reliable.

Overall, the goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots indicated that the final model described the observed data adequately.

The  pcVPC  showed  that  the  final  model  captured  both  the  central  tendency  and  the  interindividual variability of faricimab PK in AH and plasma adequately.

Consistent with the prior legacy model, the covariates that influenced faricimab ocular PK parameters were age, formulation, and presence of ADAs, while faricimab systemic PK parameters were influenced by sex, body weight, and formulation. The effects of these covariates on ocular and plasma PK were not considered to be clinically meaningful, which is agreed by the CHMP.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Study GR41984 (BALATON) and Study GR41986 (COMINO)

The PD sampling timepoints for the BALATON and COMINO studies were acceptable.

There was high inter-patient variability in VEGF-A and ANG-2 AH concentrations in both the BALATON (VEGFA, 56.9-108%; ANG -2, 71.6-268%) and COMINO (VEGF -A, 62.2-294%; ANG-2, 76.6-141%) studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The faricimab treatment arm in both the BALATON and COMINO studies showed rapid suppression of both the free VEGF-A and free ANG-2 parameters from Day 7 in the AH. Suppression was maintained up to the Week 24 visit. There was no change in plasma free VEGF-A or free Ang-2 up to Week 24 when compared with baseline levels.

Overall, the CHMP noted that the PD for the plasma and AH free VEGF-A and Ang-2 levels from the BALATON and COMINO studies are in line with the Phase III studies from the initial MAA.

## Exposure-efficacy analyses

The  linear  regression  analysis  suggested  a  trend  of  lower  BCVA  response  with  higher  exposure. However, it was determined that this was likely the result of the positive correlation between exposure and age.

When both exposure and age were included in the linear regression model, only age was found to be a significant predictor of the BCVA change from baseline (lower BCVA gain in older patients), while there was no significant effect of exposure on BCVA gain (p-value &gt; 0.5).  The CHMP agreed that no agebased dose adjustment is needed.

The  linear  regression  analysis  did  not  detect  an  effect  of  faricimab  exposure  on  CST  changes  from baseline.

The observed concentrations of free VEGF-A in AH declined from the median baseline value of about 100 ng/L  to  nearly  undetectable  levels  shortly  after  faricimab  administration,  and  stayed  low  with repeated 6 mg Q4W dosing, slightly increasing by the end of each 4-week dosing interval.

The observed concentrations of free Ang-2 in AH declined from the median baseline value of about 16 ng/L to undetectable levels shortly after faricimab administration and stayed low (below quantification limit of the assay) with repeated 6 mg Q4W dosing.

The  comparable  free  VEGF-A  and  free  Ang-2  suppression  profiles  for  both  the  lower  and  higher exposure categories (halves of VH Ctrough,ss) can be explained by the dosing regimen of Q4W which maintained the target maximally suppressed in most patients during the dosing interval and therefore no exposure-response was apparent.

## Exposure-safety analysis

The results showed that the IOI incidence rate did not increase with faricimab VH exposure.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The CHMP agreed that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of faricimab in patients with RVO have been sufficiently characterised.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

This  Type  II  variation  seeks  approval  of  faricimab  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with visual impairment  due  to  macular  oedema  secondary  to  retinal  vein  occlusion  ( branch  RVO  or  central RVO ).

The  recommended  dose  in  RVO  indication  is  6  mg  (0.05  mL  solution)  administered  by  intravitreal injection  every  4  weeks (monthly) for 3 or more consecutive doses, followed by a treat-and-extend approach.

Clinical evidence supporting the efficacy, safety, and favourable benefit-risk assessment of faricimab is mainly based on the primary analysis results of two pivotal Phase III studies (Table 11):

- Study  GR41984  (hereafter  referred  to  as  BALATON)  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)
- Study GR41986 (hereafter referred to as COMINO) in patients with macular oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (C/HRVO).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The data in this application are primarily based on the data up to Week 24 (Part 1 of the RVO studies). Further data (beyond week 24) supporting this application were provided by the MAH with the day 120 responses including final BALATON Clinical Study Report, Update COMINO CSR, Report 1126075 and Week 72 Addendum Clinical Overview.

Of note, for all efficacy descriptions, 95% is a rounding of 95.03%.

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

## No  dose  finding  studies  were  performed  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion.

The  following  dose  was  proposed  for  this  indication: 6  mg  (0.05  mL  solution)  administered  by intravitreal  injection  every  4  weeks  (monthly);  3  or  more  consecutive,  monthly  injections  may  be needed.

Thereafter, treatment is individualised using a treat -and-extend approach. Based on the physician's judgement of the patient's anatomic and/or visual outcomes, the dosing interval may be extended, in increments  of  up  to  4  weeks.  If  anatomic  and/or  visual  outcomes  change,  the  treatment  interval should  be  adjusted  accordingly,  and  interval  reduction  should  be  implemented  if  anatomic  and/or visual  outcomes  deteriorate  (see  section  5.1).  Treatment  intervals  shorter  than  4  weeks  between injections have not been studied. Monitoring between the dosing visits should be scheduled based on the  patient's  status  and  at  the  physician's  discretion  but  there  is  no  requirement  for  monthly monitoring between injections.

No dose finding studies were performed for the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion. Instead, the same dose as already approved for patients with DME were proposed. This was based on the following considerations:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The similar pathophysiology of macular oedema and vision loss in patients with DME and RVO,
- Similar faricimab PK and PD characteristics in DME and RVO patients.

## Further data supporting dosing regimen:

The  combined  evidence  from  the  DME  (YOSEMITE  and  RHINE)  and  RVO  (BALATON  and  COMINO) Phase III studies have shown almost complete suppression of Ang-2 and VEGF-A one week after the first faricimab intravitreal injection and suppression was maintained on average for approximately 12 and 8 weeks, respectively. This was accompanied by robust BCVA gains and CST reductions that were already observed following the first dose.

## Implementation of individualised approach to treatment after 3 consecutive monthly doses

The Phase III RVO studies were exploring less frequent dosing regimens (up to Q16W) by applying a PTI  algorithm  comparable  to  that  successfully  applied  in  the  faricimab  DME  Phase  III  trials  (Q4WQ16W, with an interval extension of 4 weeks) that was approved and is part of Vabysmo SmPC.

This  treat  -and-extend  approach  was  proposed  to  be  implemented  after  3  consecutive  monthly initiation doses. However, this is not in line with the approach used in pivotal studies as in both studies during first 24 weeks of treatment  patients received in total 6 injections given every 4 weeks (Q4W). Treat -and-extend approach was being introduced later (i.e after 24 weeks of treatment).

In order to support this posology (and implantation of treat -and-extend after 3 consecutive monthly initiation),  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  the  data  up  to  Week  24  was  conducted  to  further  explore  what proportion of patients in the faricimab Q4W arm achieved disease stability starting from Week 8.

This analysis indicated that, after 3 consecutive monthly initiation doses, RVO patients on average do not  gain  additional  meaningful  benefit  from  continued  monthly  dosing,  as  shown  by  the  small difference in the change from baseline in BCVA, CST, and proportion of patients gaining ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from  baseline  between  Week  12  and  Week  24.  Further,  it  was  noted  that  79%  and  71%  of patients  in  BALATON  and  COMINO,  respectively,  achieved  disease  stability  at  Week  8.  For  those patients who achieved stability at Week 8, the mean change in BCVA from Week 12 to Week 24 was less than &lt; 2 letters, which is not considered clinically significant.

Real-world evidence (RWE) from anti-VEGF treatment in patients with macular oedema secondary to RVO  also  supports  the  recommended  faricimab  posology  of  3  or  more  consecutive  monthly  doses followed  by  adjustable  dosing  intervals  (i.e.,  treat-and  extend),  which  may  result  in  less  than  6 monthly injections. The RWE shows that the mean (SD) number of injections received in the first 6 months  of  treatment  since  diagnosis  was  4.2  (1.5)  injections  in  patients  with  BRVO  and  4.3  (1.4) injections in patients with CRVO. More injections were received in the first three months of treatment (Months  0-3  mean  [SD]:  2.7  [0.8]  in  BRVO  and  CRVO)  compared  to  the  following  three  months (Months 4-6 mean [SD]: 1.6 [1.0] in BRVO and CRVO.

Finally,  the  MAH  highlighted  that,  the  pivotal  studies  for  aflibercept  and  ranibizumab  had  similar designs (monthly dosing for 6 months, followed by a move to a different dosing regimen), but have posologies  that  allow  an  individualised  approach  to  treatment  after  3  consecutive  monthly  doses. Therefore,  taking  into  consideration  the  totality  of  the  data,  the  proposed  recommendation  i.e.  an individualised approach to treatment after 3 consecutive monthly doses can also be accepted by the CHMP.

As  outlined  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC,  the  recommended  dose  is  6  mg  (0.05  mL  solution) administered  by  intravitreal  injection  every  4  weeks  (monthly);  3  or  more  consecutive,  monthly injections may be needed.

Thereafter, treatment is individualised using a treat -and-extend approach. Based on the physician's judgement of the patient's anatomic and/or visual outcomes, the dosing interval may be extended, in increments of up to 4 weeks .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  data  from  the  second  part  of  both  studies  showed  that  the  BCVA  gains'  and  central  subfield thickness (CST) reductions achieved at Week 24 were maintained through Week 72, during which time all patients were on the 6 mg faricimab personalised treatment interval (PTI) dosing regimen.

The primary analysis of the Phase III studies in RVO (BALATON and COMINO) indicate that the 6 mg faricimab  Q4W  dose  had  a  comparable  safety  profile  to  the  2  mg  aflibercept  Q4W  dose  and  was generally well tolerated and demonstrated non-inferiority to aflibercept on the primary endpoint. Ageadjusted change in BCVA was similar across the ranges of faricimab exposure and  therefore no agebased dose adjustment is needed.

Treatment intervals shorter than 4 weeks and longer than 4 months between injections have not been studied and this is highlighted in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

## 2.4.2. Main study(ies)

Clinical evidence supporting the efficacy, safety, and favourable benefit-risk assessment of faricimab is mainly based on the primary analysis results of two pivotal Phase III studies:

- Study  GR41984  (hereafter  referred  to  as  BALATON)  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)
- Study GR41986 (hereafter referred to as COMINO) in patients with macular oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (C/HRVO).

## Title of the pivotal studies

- Phase  III,  Multicentre,  Randomised,  Double-Masked,  Active  Comparator-Controlled  Study  to Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Faricimab  in  Patients  with  Macular  Oedema  Secondary  to Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BALATON study).
- A  Phase  III,  Multicentre,  Randomised,  Double-Masked,  Active  Comparator-Controlled  Study  to Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Faricimab  in  Patients  with  Macular  Oedema  Secondary  to Central Retinal or Hemi-retinal Vein Occlusion (COMINO study).

## Methods

BALATON  (Study  GR41984) is  a  Phase  III,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-masked,  active comparator-controlled, parallel -group, 2-part study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of faricimab administered by intravitreal injection at 4-week intervals until Week 24, followed by a period of study without active control to evaluate faricimab administered according to a personalised treatment interval (PTI) dosing regimen in patients with macular oedema due to BRVO where investigators and patients are masked to treatment assignment in Part 1 and to both original treatment assignment and faricimab treatment interval in Part 2.

COMINO  (Study  GR41986) is  a  Phase  III,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-masked,  active comparator-controlled, parallel-group, 2-part study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of faricimab administered by intravitreal injection at 4-week intervals until week 24, followed by a period of study without active control to evaluate faricimab administered according to a personalised treatment interval (PTI) dosing regimen in patients with macular oedema due to CRVO or HRVO where investigators and patients  are  masked  to  treatment  assignment  in  Part  1  and  to  both original treatment assignment and faricimab treatment interval in Part 2.

## The  design  of  both  studies  was  similar  and  therefore  they  are  discussed  together.  Any differences are clearly highlighted.

Both studies were comprised of two parts:

- Part 1 (Day 1 through Week 24) compared faricimab every 4 weeks (Q4W) versus aflibercept Q4W.
- Part  2  (Week  24  through  Week  72) evaluated  faricimab  administered  at  masked  treatment intervals of Q4W to every 16 weeks (Q16W) based on PTI dosing criteria.

In Part 1 (Q4W dosing), patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms, with treatment defined as follows:

- Arm  A  (treatment  arm): Patients  randomly  assigned  to  Arm  A  received  6  mg  faricimab intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20 (6 injections).
- Arm  B  (comparator  arm): Patients  randomly  assigned  to  Arm  B  received  2  mg  aflibercept intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20 (6 injections).

Randomization was stratified by the following baseline factors as assessed on Day 1:

| BALATON study                                                                                                  | COMINO study                                                                                                                   |

- Region: United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world

In Part 2 (PTI regimen), patients in both Arms A and B received 6 mg faricimab intravitreal injections according to a PTI dosing regimen from Week 24 through Week 68.

All patients should complete scheduled study visits Q4W for the entire study duration (72 weeks). To preserve  the  masking  of  faricimab  treatment  intervals  for  Week  24  through  Week  68,  a  sham procedure  was  administered  during  study  visits  at  which  (according  to  the  PTI  dosing  regimen)  no faricimab treatment was administered.

Only one eye was assigned as the study eye. If both eyes were considered eligible, the eye with the worse BCVA, as assessed at screening, was selected as the study eye, unless the investigator deemed the other eye to be more appropriate for treatment in the study.

There was a minimum of two investigators per site to fulfil the masking requirements of the study. At least  one  investigator  was  designated  as  the  assessor  physician  who  was  masked  to  each  patient's treatment assignment and who evaluated ocular assessments.

At least one other investigator was unmasked and performed study treatments.

The study consisted of a screening period of up to 28 days (Days -28 to -1) and an approximately 68-week treatment period, followed by the final study visit at Week 72. A unique screening number was assigned to each screened patient through a web-based response system (IxRS).

The CHMP noted that comparative data are available only for the first 24 weeks, as in part 2 of the studies all patients were receiving faricimab in variable intervals. Furthermore, in both studies patients were stratified depending on the baseline BCVA score (with different cuts off depending on the study) and based on the region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ocular Exclusion Criteria for Study Eye

- History of previous episodes of macular edema due to RVO or persistent macular edema due to RVO diagnosed more than 4 months before screening
- History of retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4)
- Any  prior  or  current  treatment  for  macular  edema  due  to  RVO,  including  anti-VEGF intravitreal injections for macular oedema due to RVO
- Macular laser (focal/grid) in the study eye at any time prior to Day 1
- Any intravitreal treatment for any other retinal diseases that can lead to macular oedema complication
- Any prior or current treatment for macular edema; macular neovascularization, including diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration; and vitreomacular-interface abnormalities, including, but not restricted to, intravitreal treatment with anti-VEGF, steroids, tissue plasminogen activator, ocriplasmin, C3F8, air or periocular injection

## Ocular Exclusion Criteria for Fellow (Non-Study) Eye

- Patients who met the following ocular exclusion criterion for the fellow (non-study) eye at both screening and Day 1 were excluded from study entry:
- Non-functioning fellow eye, defined as either one of the following:
- - BCVA 20/320 or worse
- - No physical presence of fellow eye (i.e., monocular)

The CHMP noted that the inclusion criteria (broadly agreed during the SA) were similar between both pivotal studies with an exception:  the BALATON study enrolled patients with macular oedema due to BRVO whereas the COMINO study enrolled patients with macular oedema due to CRVO or HRVO. In both studies patients had to be diagnosed no longer than 4 months prior to the screening visit and the diagnosis had to be confirmed by the central reading centre.

The  MAH  clarified  that  although  BALATON  (GR41984)  and  COMINO  (GR41986)  studies  enrolled patients who were diagnosed within 4 months of the screening visit this is generally reflective of what happens in clinical practice. It was also indicated that in patients with RVO the treatment is usually started shortly after diagnosis.

The key criteria also included the threshold requirement for BCVA 73 letters or less (minimum of 19 letters)  at  screening  to  ensure  that  patients  had  room  to  improve  by  at  least  15  letters,  while  also allowing the inclusion of patients presenting with ischemic RVO (who tend to present baseline BCVA &lt;20/200 and have a more guarded prognosis). Further, as indicated by the MAH, patients with BCVA less than 19 are more likely to have disease-induced irreversible retinal damage and therefore unable to respond to therapy. A similar approach was used in studies investigating other anti-VEGF for the treatment of RVO.

In relation to the exclusion criteria, the study included only patients without prior treatment for macular  oedema due to RVO, including anti-VEGF intravitreal injections, steroids, tissue plasminogen activator, ocriplasmin, C3F8, air or periocular injection and laser therapy. Therefore, the pivotal study data can only provide supporting evidence for faricimab being used as a first line therapy. The efficacy  of  this  product  in  patients  who  failed  other  treatment  options  is  not  available  and  this limitation of the data is highlighted accordingly in the SmPC (e.g. section 4.4).

History of retinal detachment, or macular hole was also an exclusion criterion and blood pressure was required to be controlled at enrolment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

The investigational medicinal product (IMP) for this study was faricimab. Aflibercept was used as an active comparator in study in Part 1; therefore, aflibercept was also considered an IMP for this study when administered to the study eye. The sham is a procedure that mimics an intravitreal injection to preserve the study masking and involved the blunt end of an empty syringe, without a needle, being pressed against an anaesthetised eye.

## Part 1

In  Part  1  of  the  study,  patients  randomly  assigned  to  Arm  A  received  6  mg  faricimab  intravitreal injections  Q4W  from  Day  1  through  Week  20,  for  a  total  of  6  injections;  and  patients  randomly assigned to Arm B received 2 mg aflibercept intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20, for a total of 6 injections.

## Part 2

In  Part  2  of  the  study,  patients  in  both  Arm  A  and  Arm  B  in  Part  1  were  receiving  6  mg  faricimab intravitreal injections administered according to a PTI dosing regimen in intervals between Q4W and Q16W. At faricimab dosing visits, treatment intervals were maintained or adjusted (i.e. increased by 4 weeks or decreased by 4, 8, or 12 weeks), based on CST and BCVA values.

## Faricimab Interval Determination

The algorithm used by the IxRS for interval decision-making, which is based on the relative change of the CST and BCVA at faricimab dosing visits compared with the reference CST and reference BCVA, is outlined as follows and in the Figure below. The faricimab dosing interval can be extended, maintained, or reduced as follows.

## Interval extended by 4 weeks

-  If  the  CST  value  is  increased  or  decreased  by ≤10%  without  an  associated  ≥10 -letter  BCVA decrease.

## Interval maintained if any of the following criteria are met:

- If the CST value is decreased by &gt; 10%
- -If the CST value is decreased ≤10% with an associated ≥ 10 -letter BCVA decrease
- -If  the  CST  value  is  increased  between  &gt;10%  and  &lt;  20%  without  an  associated  ≥5 -letter  BCVA decrease

## Interval reduced by 4 weeks if any of the following criteria are met:

- If  the  CST value is increased between &gt; 10% and ≤ 20% with an associated≥ 5 -to &lt; 10-letter BCVA decrease.
- If the CST value is increased by &gt; 20% without an associated ≥ 10 -letter BCVA decrease.
- If the CST value is increased by ≤ 10% with an associated BCVA decrease of ≥ 10 -letters.

## Interval reduced to Q4W:

If the CST value is increased by &gt; 10% with an associated ≥ 10 -letter BCVA Decrease.

Figure 26. Algorithm for IxRS-Determined Faricimab Personalized Treatment Dosing Intervals

ChangeinCSTcomparedwithreferenceCSTa

<!-- image -->

BCVA= best-corrected visual acuity; CST = central subfield thickness; IxRS =interactive web-based response system; Q4W =every 4 weeks.

- a  Initial reference CST =CST value when the initial CST threshold criteria are met, but no earlier than Week 20. Reference CST is adjusted if CST decreases by&gt;10% from the previous reference CST for two consecutive faricimab dosing visits and the values obtained are within 30 μm. The CST value obtained at the latter visit will serve as the new reference CST, starting immediately at that visit.
- b Reference BCVA= mean of the three best BCVA scores obtained at any prior dosing visit.

Patients will therefore receive between 3 and 12 injections during the period from Week 24 through Week 68.

Both  treatment  Arms  A  and  B  maintained  Q4W  study  visits  for  the  72-week  study  duration.  To preserve  the  masking  of  faricimab  treatment  intervals  for  Week  24  through  Week  68,  the  sham procedure  was  administered  during  study  visits  at  which  (according  to  the  PTI  dosing  regimen)  no faricimab treatment was administered.

All faricimab and aflibercept administrations were performed at the site.

## Prior and Concomitant Therapy

## Permitted Therapy

Patients who use maintenance therapies should continue their use. Of note, the following are common therapies that are permitted:

- Treatment for onset of ocular  hypertension  or  glaucoma in  the  study  eye  during  a  patient's study participation, as clinically indicated.
- Treatment  of  onset  of cataract  or  posterior  capsular  opacification in  either  eye  during  a patient's study participation, as clinically indicated.

Short-term  use  of  topical  ocular  corticosteroids after  cataract  surgery,  yttrium-aluminum garnet capsulotomy, peripheral iridotomy, argon/selective laser trabeculoplasty, or ocular allergic conditions in study eye or fellow eye.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Complete, sector, or local panretinal photocoagulation in the study eye or fellow eye could be allowed if needed for the treatment of ischemic RVO or new peripheral neovascularization.

Vitrectomy could be performed at the discretion of the masked investigator in the event that study eye develops sight-threatening vitreous haemorrhage or retinal detachment.

- Fellow  (non-study)  eye  could  be  treated  with  anti-VEGF  therapy  licensed  for  ocular  use,  if diagnosed with an ocular condition for which the selected anti-VEGF therapy is approved by the country regulatory agency and at the discretion of the masked investigator.
- At the discretion of the investigator, patients could continue to receive medications and standard treatments administered for other conditions.

## Prohibited Therapy

The following medications and treatments are prohibited from use during a patient's study treatment participation.  Patients  may  be  discontinued  from  study  treatment  and/or  the  study  to  receive  these therapies:

- Systemic anti-VEGF therapy
- Systemic drugs known to cause macular edema (fingolimod, tamoxifen) IVT anti-VEGF agents (other than study-assigned aflibercept or faricimab) in study eye
- IVT, periocular (subtenon), steroid implants (i.e., Ozurdex, Iluvien), or chronic topical ocular corticosteroids in study eye
- Treatment with verteporfin (Visudyne) in study eye.

The CHMP noted that, in both pivotal studies, patients were randomly assigned to 6 mg of faricimab intravitreal  injections  in  Arm  A  or  2  mg  aflibercept  intravitreal  injections  in  Arm  B.  During  first  24 weeks  of  treatment  (in  Part  1  of  the  study)  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  received  in  total  6 injections  given  every  4  weeks  (Q4W).  Furthermore,  in  Part  2  all  patients  were  receiving  6  mg  of faricimab intravitreal injections therefore no comparative data are available beyond week 24. This is a limitation of this study.

In Part 2 the treatment intervals could be maintained or adjusted (increased by 4 weeks or decreased by 4, 8, or 12 weeks), based on CST and BCVA values.

In the SmPC (in section 4.2 and 5.1) only limited information is included in this regard. The SmPC only states that the treatment intervals are to be adjusted based on anatomic and/or visual outcomes but CST and BCVA value which should be used for adjustment were not specified. The MAH was requested to  justify  why  more  detailed  recommendations  are  not  included  in  the  SmPC . It  was  clarified  that, regarding physician judgement of visual and/or anatomical changes to determine the best treatment interval, the SmPC language is consistent with the treatment guidance in the posology of the currently approved Vabysmo indications as well as for anti-VEGF products across retina disease indications. This justification was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## Comparator

Both  pivotal  studies  were  active-controlled.  The  lack  of  a  placebo  arm  is  agreed  given  the  existing therapeutic  alternatives.  The  MAH  selected  aflibercept  as  a  comparator  in  the  studies,  which  was acceptable. Aflibercept, given at the dose of 2 mg, is approved for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO). The monthly regimen for the comparator in Part 1 of the study was discussed and agreed during the SA.

## Prior and Concomitant Therapy

In relation to the exclusion criteria the study included only patients without prior treatment for macular oedema due to RVO, including anti-VEGF intravitreal injections, steroids, tissue plasminogen activator, ocriplasmin, C3F8, air or periocular injection and laser therapy. In this context, the data generated in the pivotal studies can support the use of the product as first line therapy in patients' macular oedema due to RVO. On the other hand, it is not clear if the results could be extrapolated to patients relapsing after  other  therapies.  Information  highlighting  that  there  no  data  in  patients  who  failed  previous therapy has therefore been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. This lack of data should be considered accordingly  by  the  physician  when  treating  such  patients  In  both  studies,  in  the  study  eye  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment with other therapies for macular oedema due to RVO were not allowed as well as systemic anti-VEGF therapy and systemic drugs known to cause macular oedema. Of note, fellow (non-study) eye could be treated with anti-VEGF therapy licensed for ocular use.

- Proportion of patients with absence of subretinal fluid over time through Week 72
- Proportion of patients with absence of both intraretinal fluid and subretinal fluid over time through Week 72

The CHMP noted that the primary endpoint in the study was the change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 24. The timing of the primary endpoint was agreed during the SA and was  the  same  as  used  in  pivotal  studies  supporting  the  authorisation  of  other  anti-VEGFs  (i.e. aflibercept and ranibizumab) and is considered acceptable. In relation to the selected primary outcome measure (i.e. change from baseline in BCVA) this is also considered acceptable.

Both studies had a non-inferiority design. For the primary analysis, if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in adjusted means of the two treatments is greater than - 4 letters (the non-inferiority margin), then faricimab is considered non-inferior to aflibercept.

There were a number of secondary endpoints again investigating the effect on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) including the proportion of patients gaining or avoiding a loss of ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 letters in BCVA from baseline, patients achieving ≥ 84, 69 letters or ≤ 38 letters, all assessed through and at  week  24.  Other  aspects  investigated  in  the  study  included  changes  from  baseline  in  central subfield  thickness  (CST),  proportion  of  patients  with  absence  of  macular  oedema,  with  absence  of intraretinal fluid or with absence of subretinal fluid.

The  secondary  endpoints  were  assessed    through  week  24  (Part  1  of  the  study)  or  through  Week 64/68/72 (averaged) or over time through Week 72 (Part 2 of the study).

## Definitions

## Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)

Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart, at a starting test distance of 4 meters.

The refraction BCVA assessment had to be conducted before pupil dilation. The refraction and BCVA were measured by trained and certified personnel at the study sites. Both refraction and BCVA were assessed at every study visit, however, only study eye refraction on Day 1, Week 24, and Week 68 visits was entered on the refraction-specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).

## Sample Size

## BALATON study

Determination of sample size was based on patients enrolled in the global enrolment phase. Global enrolment phase of approximately 570 patients was planned. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to  receive  treatment  with  faricimab  (Arm  A)  or  aflibercept  (Arm  B).  The  primary  comparison  is between the active comparator (aflibercept Q4W) and the faricimab Q4W arm at Week 24.

A  sample  size  of  approximately  285  patients  in  each  arm  provided  &gt;  90%  power  to  show  NI  of faricimab to aflibercept in the change in BCVA at Week 24 in ITT population, using a NI margin of 4 letters, and under the following assumptions:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- No difference in the mean change from baseline in BCVA between the two treatment arms
- Standard deviation (SD) of 13 letters for the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24
- Two-sample t-tests
- 2.5% one-sided type I error rate
- 10% dropout rate

Furthermore, a sample size of approximately 285 patients per arm provided greater than 80% power to show a 3.5-letter superiority of faricimab over aflibercept, under the same SD, test, and dropout assumptions above, and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%.

## COMINO study

Determination of sample size was based on patients enrolled in the global enrolment phase. Global enrollment phase of approximately 750 patients was planned. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to  receive  treatment  with  faricimab  (Arm  A)  or  aflibercept  (Arm  B).  The  primary  comparison  is between the active comparator (aflibercept Q4W) and the faricimab Q4W arm at Week 24.

A  sample  size  of  approximately  375  patients  in  each  arm  provided  &gt;  90%  power  to  show  NI  of faricimab to aflibercept in the change in BCVA at Week 24 in ITT population, using a NI margin of 4 letters, and under the following assumptions:

- No difference in the mean change from baseline in BCVA between the two treatment arms
- Standard deviation (SD) of 15 letters for the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24
- Two-sample t-tests
- 2.5% one-sided type I error rate
- 10% dropout rate

Furthermore, a sample size of approximately 375 patients per arm provided greater than 80% power to show a 3.5-letter superiority of faricimab over aflibercept, under the same SD, test, and dropout assumptions above, and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%.

The CHMP considered the sample size justification for each study as acceptable.

## Randomisation

All  patients  received  a  screening  number  assigned  through  the  IxRS  and  were  randomised  in  a  1:1 ratio  to  one  of  two  study  treatment  arms  (faricimab  Q4W  or  aflibercept  Q4W).  A  stratified  block randomisation scheme was used and was stratified by the following baseline factors as assessed on Day 1:

## Blinding (masking)

This  was  a  double-masked  study  (up  to  Week  24).  A  minimum  of  two  investigators  per  site  were needed to fulfil the masking requirements of this study, and both investigators were required to be present at each scheduled study visit.

## BALATON

There had to be a minimum of two investigators per site to fulfil the masking requirements of this study and both investigators are required to be present at each scheduled study visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Masked Roles

## Principal Investigator

The Principal Investigator was a retina specialist (or the equivalent in ex-U.S. countries) and had to  be in a masked role to oversee conduct of the whole trial. The Principal Investigator had to  be masked to patients' treatment assignment and could assume any other masked role for which he or she qualifies, except for BCVA examiner tasks.

## Assessor Physician/Masked Investigator

At  least  one  investigator  who  was  a  retina  specialist  (or  the  equivalent  in  ex-U.S.  countries)  was designated as the assessor physician/masked investigator. The investigator(s) was masked to patient treatment assignments and evaluated all pre-dose assessments, as well as all assessments performed at  screening,  Day  7,  and  at  the  final  or  early  termination  visit.  The  assessor  physician/masked investigator also evaluated the causality of all adverse events reported by the treatment administrator/unmasked investigator. If qualified, this role could take on any other masked role tasks except tasks performed by the BCVA examiner.

## Photographer(s) and OCT Technician(s)

If  qualified,  the  photographers  and  OCT  technicians  can  share  any  other  masked  role  tasks  except tasks performed by the BCVA examiner.

## Study Coordinator(s)

If qualified, the study coordinator(s) can share any other masked role tasks except tasks performed by the BCVA examiner.

## BCVA Examiner

The BCVA examiner will be masked to both the assigned treatment arm and designation of the study eye. The BCVA examiner may have access only to a patient's refraction data from previous visits .  Patients'  medical  charts  and  visual  acuity  scores  from  patients'  previous  visits  are  not accessible  to  the  BCVA  examiner.  The  BCVA  examiner  is  not  allowed  to  perform  any  other  task involving direct patient care.

## Unmasked Roles

## Treatment Administrator/Unmasked Investigator

At least one investigator will be designated as the treatment administrator and will be unmasked to the patients'  treatment  assignment.  The  treatment  administrator/unmasked  investigator  will  be  a  retina specialist (or the equivalent in ex- U.S. countries). In addition, ophthalmologists who have completed a minimum  of  2  full  years  of  ophthalmology  residency  (or  equivalent  in  ex-U.S.  countries)  may  be permitted to perform the role of the treatment administrator/unmasked investigator following Sponsor approval.

The treatment administrator/unmasked investigator(s) performing the study treatment administration (faricimab,  aflibercept,  or sham )  will  also  perform  the  post-dose  administration  safety  assessments (finger-counting, hand-motion and/or light-perception tests [if applicable] and post-dose IOP measurement) and will treat  adverse  events  that  occur  during  or  shortly  after  the  study  treatment administration.  The  person  in  this  role,  however,  will  not  evaluate  the  causality  of  adverse  events, which is the responsibility of the assessor physician/masked investigator(s). The treatment administrator/unmasked  investigator  will  also  perform  post-dose  IOP  measurements,  as  well  as optional aqueous humour and vitreous humour sample collection. In addition, the qualifying treatment administrator/unmasked  investigator  can  assist  with  and  perform  the  screening  and  Day  1  visit assessments. The treatment administrator/unmasked investigator must not be involved in any other aspect of the study and must preserve masking of treatment assignment.

## Unmasked Assistants and Pharmacist

If desired, sites may have designated qualified unmasked assistants who can, for example, assemble study treatment supplies, prepare sterile field, prepare the patient's study eye for treatment, discard all  injection  materials  (i.e.,  syringes  and  needles)  immediately  following  study  treatment,  and  place

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vials in the kit box. The qualified unmasked assistants can be assigned to measure post-dose IOP. If the  site  uses  a  pharmacy,  the  unmasked  role  is  also  assigned  to  the  pharmacist  who  can  take  on IMP/NIMP-related  tasks  as  applicable  per  the  site  delegation  log.  In  addition,  qualifying  unmasked assistants can assist with and perform the screening and Day 1 visit assessments.

## Number of Unmasked Personnel per Site

Every effort must be made to limit the number of unmasked study personnel to ensure the integrity of this  masked  study.  There  should  be  no  more  than six  unmasked  personnel (e.g.,  treatment administering physician[s] and assisting technician[s] if applicable) at an investigative site at one time. In certain circumstances, the total number of unmasked personnel might be increased after discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor. If the site is using a pharmacist, this person may be in an unmasked role in addition to the unmasked staff at the site.

Any other study assisting personnel not listed above will be in the masked roles.

## Role Switching

Once  personnel  assigned  to  the  designated  unmasked  role  start  performing  that  role,  they  cannot switch to a masked role during the study. Switching from a masked role to an unmasked role may be possible and must be documented in the site delegation log.

Masking of Vendors, Sponsor's Agents, a CRC personnel, study vendors, the Sponsor, and its agents will also be masked to treatment assignment , with the exception of individuals who require access to patient treatment assignments to fulfil their job roles during a clinical trial. These roles include the clinical supply chain managers, sample handling staff, operational assay group personnel, IxRS service provider,  drug  accountability  clinical  research  associates,  the  images  coordinator,  iDCC  and  iDMC members, and an internal unmasking statistician (this person is from the Sponsor's unmasking group and  will  follow  the  Sponsor's  standard  operation  procedures  to  audit  the  implementation  of  the randomization scheme and the dosing interval assignment by the IxRS vendor periodically during the conduct of the study; this person will not be involved in other study-related activities).

To maintain the masked design of the study, blood samples, optional aqueous humor samples, and optional vitreous humor samples obtained at the timepoints specified in the schedule of activities (see Appendix  1)  will  be  obtained  from  consenting  patients  in  any  treatment  arm.  The  laboratories responsible  for  performing  sample  analyses  will  be  unmasked  to  patients'  treatment  assignment  to identify appropriate samples to be analyzed. Unmasking for analysis of the relevant biosamples during the conduct of the study will be performed by personnel outside of the study team and according to the Sponsor's internal standard procedures to ensure the integrity of the data. The number of Roche representative(s) and delegates who are unmasked will be kept to the minimum required to address the objective of the biosample analysis.

While  PK  and  immunogenicity  samples  must  be  collected  from  patients  assigned  to  the  comparator arm to maintain the masking of treatment assignment, PK and ADA assay results for these patients are generally  not  needed  for  the  safe  conduct  or  proper  interpretation  of  the  study  data.  Laboratories responsible  for  performing  study  drug  PK  and  ADA  assays  will  be  unmasked  to  patient  treatment assignments to identify appropriate samples for analysis. PK samples from patients assigned to the comparator  arm  will  not  be  analysed  for  faricimab  PK  concentration  except  by  request  (e.g.,  to evaluate a possible error in dosing). Baseline immunogenicity samples will be analysed.

for all patients. Post-baseline immunogenicity samples from patients assigned to the comparator arm will not be analysed for ADAs except by request.

## Patient Masking

Patients will be masked to treatment assignment during the study and until study closeout, or until the Sponsor indicates that the study can be unmasked.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Single-Patient Emergency Unmasking

If unmasking is necessary for a medical emergency (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse event for which  patient  management  might  be  affected  by  knowledge  of  treatment  assignment),  the  masked investigator will be able to break the treatment code by contacting the IxRS.

## Single-Patient Non-Emergency Unmasking

If the masked investigator wishes to know the identity of the study drug for any reason other than a medical emergency, he or she should contact the Medical Monitor directly.

The  masked  investigator  should  document  and  provide  an  explanation  for  any  nonemergency unmasking.

If the Medical Monitor agrees to patient unmasking, the masked investigator will be able to break the treatment code by contacting the IxRS.

The  CHMP  noted  that  the  MAH    described  accordingly  in  the  study  protocols  roles  (masked  and unmasked) at the study site. In summary, as indicated:

- A minimum of two investigators (one masked and one unmasked) per site were needed to fulfil the masking requirements of this study and both investigators are required to be present at each scheduled study visit.
- The role of unmasked investigator was to administer the study treatment (faricimab, aflibercept, or sham) to perform the post-dose administration safety assessments and to treat adverse events that occur during or shortly after the study treatment administration.
- The  masked  investigator  was  to  evaluate  all  pre-dose  assessments,  as  well  as  all  assessments performed  at  screening,  Day  7  and  at  the  final  or  early  termination  visit.  Further  the  masked investigator was to perform the causality assessment of AEs reported during the study.
- In the study at each trial site there was a BCVA Examiner who was masked to both the assigned treatment arm and designation of the study eye.

The roles of additional personnel were also described. As stated in the protocol, there should be no more than six unmasked personnel at each trial site.

## Statistical methods

The statistical methods were similar in both studies. They are briefly described as follows; differences are highlighted.

## Statistical Hypothesis

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  24.  The  following hypotheses were tested:

- Non-inferiority (NI) of faricimab Q4W compared with aflibercept Q4W at Week 24 in the intent to treat (ITT population) population (at a one-sided 0.02485 significance level).
- Superiority of faricimab Q4W compared with aflibercept Q4W at Week 24 in the ITT population (at a two-sided 0.0497 significance level)

The CHMP noted that the hypotheses on the primary endpoint were tested in the order shown above, proceeding  sequentially  starting  from  the  non-inferiority  test  and  only  testing  the  superiority  after achieving statistical significance on the non-inferiority test. It was also pointed out by the MAH that there was no impact on the type I error rate for the superiority test following the NI test; therefore,  in  the  MAH's  view,  a  claim  of  superiority  after  NI  could  be  made  without multiplicity adjustment.

Of note, in the SAP for each study the MAH mentioned: ' a nominal type I error penalty of 0.0001 (twosided) will be taken for each time the iDMC reviews unmasked data prior to the formal analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. At the time of the primary analysis, it is estimated that three safety interim

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data reviews will have been conducted by the iDMC; therefore, efficacy analyses would be performed with  a  family-wise  significance  level  of  0.0497.  The  actual  adjustment  will  depend  on  the  actual number of IDMC interim safety reviews. This type I error adjustment is not expected to impact sample size or power'.

The CHMP noted that, although the MAH would use the same confidence interval that concluded noninferiority, for a switch to superiority (and therefore no type I error penalty incurred), the MAHs prespecified analyses imposed a type I error, but its basis was not fully understood. However, this matter was not further pursued.

## Analysis Populations

The following populations are defined:

For analyses based on this patient population, patients were grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization. Note: Patients who were wrongly randomized to one study (BALATON or COMINO), discontinued without treatment, and were then randomized to the other study (BALATON or COMINO, respectively) are included in the latter study only.                                                                                                                                                                |

## Efficacy Analysis

The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  the  ITT  population,  unless  otherwise specified,  with  patients  grouped  according  to  the  treatment  assigned  at  randomisation.  Additional analysis based on the PP population was also conducted for the primary endpoint.

Unless  otherwise  noted,  analyses  of  efficacy  outcome  measures  were  stratified  by  baseline  BCVA ETDRS letter score, as assessed on Day 1, and region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world).

The stratification factor as recorded in IxRS was used.

Continuous outcomes were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). Binary secondary endpoints were analysed using stratified estimation for binomial proportions.

The  CHMP  noted  that  the  primary  analysis  was  based  on  using  all  time  points  through  an  MMRM analysis. The results of the sensitivity analysis (which used multiple imputation assuming MNAR, and were justified accordingly) supports the primary analysis results.

## Invalid BCVA (BCVA values that are confirmed to be inaccurate, due to the BCVA test being performed incorrectly) were excluded from the analyses.

Non-standard BCVA data (such as assessed by ETDRS BCVA testing with prior visit refraction, BCVA test  performed  by  unmasked  certified  ETDRS  BCVA  assessor,  or  by  uncertified  experienced  ETDRS BCVA assessor) were included in the analyses (1 patient in each treatment arm).

Supplementary per protocol analysis was performed with non-standard BCVA data excluded.

## Primary Efficacy Analysis

The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24. BCVA is assessed on the ETDRS visual acuity chart at a starting test distance of 4 meters. The primary estimand is defined as follows:

## Population

- Variable: Change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24
- Treatments (as randomized):
- -Experimental: 6 mg faricimab intravitreal injection Q4W
- -Control: 2 mg aflibercept intravitreal injection Q4W

Intercurrent events prior to Week 24:

- -Discontinuation of study treatment due to AEs or lack of efficacy
- -Use of any prohibited systemic treatment or prohibited therapy in the study eye

## Handling of intercurrent events

A treatment policy strategy was applied to all intercurrent events.

The primary comparison was between the active comparator (aflibercept Q4W) and faricimab Q4W at Week 24. The primary analysis was performed using a MMRM. The model included the change from baseline at Weeks 4-24 as the response variable and included the categorical covariates of treatment group, visit, visit-by-treatment group interaction, baseline BCVA (continuous), as well as randomization stratification factors as fixed effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All observed measurements were included in the analysis regardless of whether or not a patient had an intercurrent event.

## Missing data were implicitly imputed by the MMRM model, assuming a missing at random mechanism.

The  CHMP  noted  that  the  MAH  proposed  an  MMRM  analysis  (see  above)  and  a  treatment  policy estimand.  The  preferred  estimand  is  one  that  is  more  akin  to  a  PP  analysis  for  a  non-inferiority objective, in addition to other estimand approaches as sensitivity analyses. The CHMP had highlighted that the treatment policy estimand may not be of sufficiently sensitivity to departures in non-inferiority in  this  regard  (this  can  be  noted  in  the  results  where  the  95%  CI  for  the  PP  are  wider).  The  MAH justified using a treatment policy strategy as the primary estimand.

## Secondary Efficacy Analysis

Continuous  outcomes  were  analysed  using  a  MMRM  unless  otherwise  specified.  Binary  secondary endpoints  were  analysed  using  stratified  estimation  for  binomial  proportions  using  Cochran  MantelHaenszel (CMH) weights. The estimates and CIs are provided for the mean (for continuous variables) or  proportion  (for  binary  variables)  for  each  treatment  arm  and  for  the  difference  in  means  or proportions between the aflibercept Q4W arm and the faricimab Q4W arm. All CIs are two-sided and at the 95.03% level.

PRO data were also collected through the use of the NEI VFQ-25 to assess the treatment benefit of faricimab.

## Results

## BALATON study

This Primary CSR provides results up to the primary analysis (Week 24) for the global enrolment phase with a clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 6 July 2022.

A total of 553 patients with BRVO were randomized 1:1 into the study using a stratified permutedblock randomization scheme: 276 to the faricimab Q4W arm and 277 to the aflibercept Q4W arm  in 149 sites in 22 countries.

As specified in the protocol, two randomization stratification factors were used (baseline BCVA ETDRS letter score and region) to balance these characteristics across the treatment arms.

**Percentages are based on number of patients randomized.

Includes discontinuation occurring prior to day 154 (first day of week 24 analysis visit window) .

At Week 24, overall, in the ITT population, 12 patients (2.2%) discontinued study treatment with a comparable proportion between treatment arms (3.3% of patients in the faricimab Q4W arm and 1.1% of patients in the aflibercept Q4W arm). The reasons for study treatment discontinuation were lost to follow-up  (1.8%  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  0.7%  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm),  withdrawal  by subject (0.7% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 0.4% in the aflibercept Q4W arm), adverse event (0.4% in the faricimab Q4W arm) and death (0.4% in the faricimab Q4W arm).

Seven patients (1.3%) withdrew from the study with a comparable proportion between treatment arms (1.4% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 1.1% in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

One patient in the faricimab Q4W arm died on Day 162. The patient's treatment discontinuation date was derived as the last treatment day (Day 132), which was before the start of the Week 24 window (Day 154).

## COMINO study

This Primary CSR provides results up to the primary analysis (Week 24) for the global enrolment phase with a clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 9 August 2022.

A total of 729 patients with C/HRVO were randomized 1:1 into the study using a stratified permutedblock randomization scheme: 366 to the faricimab Q4W arm and 363 to the aflibercept Q4W arm in 192  sites  in  22  countries.  One  patient  was  wrongly  randomized  to  the  COMINO  study  (GR41986), immediately discontinued and was then subsequently randomized to the BALATON study (GR41984). This subject's data are only included in the BALATON CSR, resulting in a total of 553 and 729 patients included in BALATON and COMINO, respectively.

As specified in the protocol, two randomization stratification factors were used (baseline BCVA ETDRS letter score and region) to balance these characteristics across the treatment arms. Overall, 6 patients were mis-stratified by the incorrect BCVA letter score category (34 letters or worse, 35-54 letters, or 55  letters  or  better).  Since  the  number  of  patients  mis-stratified  was  low  and  balanced  across treatment arms, no specific measures were needed to be considered in the statistical analysis.

Three patients (1 patient in the faricimab Q4W arm and 2 patients in the aflibercept Q4W arm) were randomized but did not receive any treatment. The reasons for these patients not receiving treatment were: 'other' (BCVA score of 85 letters on repeat testing at Day 1) for the patient in the faricimab Q4W arm, and physician decision (subject randomized by error) and protocol deviation (study eye: increase of &gt; 10 letters in BCVA ETDRS score between screening and Day 1) for the 2 patients in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

## Patients Who Discontinued from Study Treatment or Study

Overall,  in  the  ITT  population,  26  patients  (3.6%)  discontinued  study  treatment  with  a  comparable proportion between treatment arms (3.0% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 4.2% in the aflibercept Q4W arm). The most common reason for study treatment discontinuation was withdrawal by subject;). One

patient withdrew from study treatment for a reason categorized as 'Other', which was non-compliance with study drug.

Sixteen  patients  (2.2%)  withdrew  from  the  study  with  a  comparable  proportion  between  treatment arms (1.6% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 2.8% in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

Includes discontinuation occurring through the end of study.

The CHMP noted that in the Balaton study a total of 553 patients with BRVO were randomised 1:1 into the study: 276 to the faricimab Q4W arm and 277 to the aflibercept Q4W. The majority of patients completed 24 weeks treatment period i.e. 543 out of 553 subjects. 12 patients in total discontinued the study treatment prior to 24 and the main reason for discontinuation was lost for follow up and due to an adverse event. One patient in the faricimab arm died prior to week 24. It was also pointed out that the population of patients enrolled in the Comino study was slightly bigger as compared to the Balaton study. The Comino study enrolled 729 patients with C/HRVO who were randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms: 366 to the faricimab Q4W arm and 363 to the aflibercept Q4W arm. Again, most patients  (713  out  of  729)  completed  24  weeks  treatment  period.  26  patients  (3.6%)  discontinued study treatment prior to week 24. The main reason for discontinuation was withdrawal by subject. 3 patients died while on study. Discontinuation rate was also small in Part 2 of the study (after week 24 through week 72). 60 (10.9%) and 78 (10.7%) patients discontinued study treatment in study eye prior to Week 72 in the Balaton and Comino study, respectively.

## Recruitment

## Balaton study

The first patient was enrolled on 2 March 2021 and the last patient was randomized on 20 January 2022. Patients were recruited from 149 sites in 22 countries.

With day 120 responses the MAH provided the Final CSR which included results from analyses through Week 72, corresponding to the end of the enrollment phase with a last patient last visit (LPLV) of 12 June 2023.

## COMINO study

The first patient was enrolled on 2 March 2021 and the last patient was randomized on 17 February 2022. Patients were recruited from 192 sites in 22 countries.

With  day  120  responses  the  MAH  provided  the  updated  CSR  which  included  results  from  analyses through Week 72, corresponding to the end of the global enrollment phase with an LPLV of 12 July 2023.

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol Deviations

## BALATON study

In  the  ITT  population,  532  major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  in  287  patients  (51.9%):  146 patients  (52.9%)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  141  patients  (50.9%)  in  the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  Q4W  arm.  Approximately  16.7%  (89/532)  of  the  major  protocol deviations in the ITT population through Week 72 were related to COVID-19.

The majority of the major protocol deviations were procedural, with 'missed visits' (missed any of the Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 60, 64, 68 or 72 visits; 26.6% overall) and 'study eye: major issues with images'  (defined  as  any  major  issue  that  can  prevent  the  assessment  of  any  of  optical  coherence tomography [OCT], color fundus photographs [CFP] or fluorescein angiography [FA] images per the schedule of assessments; 12.7% overall) being the most common major protocol deviations.

The incidence of 'missed visits' was 24.6% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 28.5% in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The incidence of 'study eye: major issues with images' was 14.5% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 10.8% in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The incidence of 'other significant procedural deviation issues' was 6.9% and 5.4% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively. This subcategory covers a variety of protocol deviations that were considered major, for safety or efficacy reasons, but were not covered by the pre-defined subcategories.

Some examples of the nature of the protocol deviations included in this subcategory are: treatment administration performed by a role in the delegation log, but not by a retina specialist as per protocol that occurred at one site; last visit (Week 72) performed out of window; images not taken at the last visit (Week 72); split visits where key assessments were not repeated, among others.

During the study through Week 72, 9 patients (1.6%) had optional samples (plasma, aqueous humor samples,  and/or  Research  Biosample  Repository)  collected  without  a  signed  optional  ICF  samples. These unconsented samples were destroyed and not analyzed or reported in any analysis.

## COMINO study

In  the  ITT  population,  814  major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  in  385  patients  (52.8%):  186 patients  (50.8%)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  199  patients  (54.8%)  in  the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  Q4W  arm.  Approximately  13.7%  (112/814)  of  the  major  protocol deviations in the ITT population through Week 72 were related to COVID-19.

The majority of the major protocol deviations were procedural, with 'missed visits' (missed any of the Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 60, 64, 68 or 72 visits; 28.4% overall) and 'study eye: major issues with images  (defined  as  any  major  issue  that  can  prevent  the  assessment  of  any  of  optical  coherence tomography [OCT], color fundus photographs [CFP] or fluorescein angiography [FA] images per the schedule of assessments; 13.6% overall,) being the most common major protocol deviations.

The incidence of 'missed visits' was 25.7% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 31.1% in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The  incidence  of  'study  eye:  major  issues  with  images'  was  13.7%  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and 13.5% in the aflibercept Q4W arm (Table below).

The incidence of 'other significant procedural deviation issues' was 7.4% and 8.3% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively. This subcategory covers a variety of protocol deviations that were considered major, for safety or efficacy reasons, but were not covered by the pre-defined subcategories. Some examples of the nature of the protocol deviations included in this subcategory are: treatment administration performed by a role in the delegation log, but not by a retina specialist as per protocol that occurred at one site; last visit (Week 72) performed out of window; images not taken at the last visit (Week 72); split visits where key assessments were not repeated, among others.

During the study through Week 72, 30 patients (4.1%) had optional samples (plasma, aqueous humor, and/or  Research  Biosample  Repository)  collected  without  a  signed  optional  ICF  samples.  These unconsented samples were destroyed and not analyzed or reported in any analysis.

Regular clinic staff refers to thosewho are not listed on the delegationlog for this study.Missed injections refer to the cases when patients attended the visit but did not receive the injections due to reasons other than dose hold,such as unmasked physician was notavailabletocompletetreatment. Major issues with images include:images not acquired according to study protocol,images not acquired at an attended study visit, images not submitted to/rejected by reading center,imaging performed by non-study certified personnel. Percentages are based on N in the column headings. For frequency counts by deviation,multiple occurrences of the samedeviation in an individualarecountedonlyonce. For the totalnumber of deviations，multiple occurrences of the same deviation in an individualarecountedseparately.

The MAH was subsequently requested to clarify the criteria used to decide the impact of major protocol deviations on the efficacy results (for determination of the per protocol population) in both BALATON and COMINO studies.

The  list of major protocol deviations which could have an impact on the efficacy results is summarised in the Table 17 below.

In  summary,  major  protocol  deviations  (that  potentially  introduced  bias  to  BCVA  assessments) pertained to specific inclusion/exclusion criteria that could impact the treatment effect, major protocol deviations for the receipt of prohibited therapy, or missed study treatment at specific timepoints. They were all considered as having the potential to impact the primary endpoint (change from baseline in BCVA) and therefore excluded from the per protocol analysis.

## Baseline data

## BALATON study

In  the  ITT  population,  baseline  demographics  were  comparable  between  the  treatment  arms  (Table 18). The overall mean age at randomization was 64.1 years ( 64.3 years in the faricimab Q4W arm and 63.8 years in the aflibercept Q4W arm) with half of patients (50.1%) in the &lt; 65 years of age category. Half the patients (50.6%) were female. The majority of patients were white (62.2%), and of Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity  (81.0%). Patients  were  from  the  following  regions:  'Rest  of  World', mostly consisting of European and South American countries (46.5%), Asia (30.7%), and US/Canada (22.8%).

## COMINO study

In the ITT population, baseline demographics were comparable between treatment arms (Table 19). The overall mean age at randomization was 65.1 years (65.6 years in the faricimab Q4W arm and 64.7 years  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm)  with  the  majority  of  patients  (56.1%)  in  the ≥ 65  years  of  age category. The majority (53.9%) of patients were male, white (68.0%), and of Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity  (78.1%).  Patients  were  from  the  following  regions:  'Rest  of  World',  mostly  consisting  of European and South American countries (51.3%), Asia (22.9%), and US/Canada (25.8%).

Ethnicity= not reported if it cannot collected due to local regulations.

The CHMP noted that slightly older patients were enrolled to the Comino study: the overall mean age at  randomisation  was  65.1  years  (65.6  years  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  64.7  years  in  the aflibercept  Q4W  arm)  whereas  in  the Balaton  study ,  the  mean  age  of  enrolled  patients  was  64.1 years (64.3 years in the faricimab Q4W arm and 63.8 years in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

The youngest age at enrolment across studies was 22, the oldest 100. Similar percentage of patients in both studies were male or female. The majority of patients were white and of Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

In  relation  to  age  and  gender,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  study  populations  can  be  considered  as representative of the general population of patients with RVO. The majority of patients in both studies were  in  the  &gt;  65  years  of  age  category,  which  is  expected  as  the  prevalence  of  RVO  is  strongly associated with increasing age. RVO is rarely seen in individuals younger than 50, but it is occurring more frequently in the older age group.

The  prevalence  did  not  differ  significantly  between  sexes.  In  relation  to  ethnicity,  white  and  of  not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity is overrepresented in the studies. However, as clarified by the MAH, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis has shown no effect of race on the pharmacokinetics (PK, ocular  and  systemic)  of  faricimab;  therefore  the  CHMP  concluded  that  no  differences  in  efficacy  are excepted.

## Baseline Disease Characteristics

## BALATON study

## Ocular

In the ITT population, baseline ocular characteristics were comparable between treatment arms (Table 20). Mean baseline BCVA in all patients was 57.6 letters: 57.5 and 57.6 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively . Mean baseline CST in all patients was 558.2 microns: 558.3 and 558.1 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively.

Mean baseline BCVA in all patients was 50.5 letters: 50.3 and 50.7 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept  Q4W  arm,  respectively . Mean baseline  CST  was  711.6  microns:  702.2  and  721.1  in  the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively. Overall, 82.5% of patients had CRVO and 17.5%  had  HRVO,  with  the  proportion  of  patients  with  CRVO  or  HRVO  being  comparable  between treatment arms.

Baseline  ocular  characteristics  in  the  study  eye  in  the  PP  population  were  comparable  with  the  ITT population and comparable between treatment arms.

## Non-Ocular

In the ITT population, baseline non-ocular characteristics were comparable between treatment arms except for body mass index (BMI) categories. The proportion of patients in the BMI category of≥ 30 kg/m2 was lower in the faricimab Q4W arm (24.0% [88/366]) compared to the aflibercept Q4W arm (32.8% [119/363]).

## Prior Disease

## Ocular Medical History

In  the  ITT  population,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  one  targeted  prior  ocular  medical condition in the study eye was comparable between treatment arms (42.6% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 39.9% in the aflibercept Q4W arm)

## General Medical History

In  the  ITT  population,  the  majority  of  patients  had  at  least  one  targeted  prior  non-ocular  condition (65.0%), and the proportions were comparable between treatment arms (64.5% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 65.6% in the aflibercept Q4W arm; the most common conditions were systemic hypertension (54.6%% and 56.2%), type 2 Diabetes (20.2% and 21.8%%) and diabetes mellitus uncomplicated (9.3% and 11.3%) in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively.

In summary, the CHMP noted that both studies enrolled patients with a relatively short history from RVO diagnosis (i.e. less than 4 months as per the inclusion criteria). The mean time since diagnosis was 1.46 months in the Balaton study and 1.34 months in the Comino study). Single patients had a longer history, which represents the protocol deviation.

Both studies were aimed to enrol patients with BCVA of 73 to 19 letters at screening and with objective sign of macular oedema with central subfield thickness (CST) ≥325 μ m, as measured on Spectralis SDOCT. As indicated by the MAH patients with BCVA less than 19 are more likely to have disease-induced irreversible retinal damage and therefore unable to respond to the therapy. The MAH also clarified that a similar range was used in trials supporting the authorization of other anti-VGFs.

In the BALATON study the mean baseline BCVA in all patients was 57.6 letters (range 19 to 76): 57.5 and 57.6 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively. Mean baseline CST in all patients  was  558.2  microns:  558.3  and  558.1  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arm, respectively.

In  the  COMINO  study  more  severe  populations,  with  respect  to  the  lower  BCVA  at  enrolment  and higher mean baseline CST, were enrolled. In this study mean baseline BCVA in all patients was 50.5 letters  (range  19  to  87):  50.3  and  50.7  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arm, respectively. Mean baseline CST was 711.6 microns: 702.2 and 721.1 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively.

Some patients (around 17% in the BALATON study and 10% in the COMINO study) had confirmed macular ischemic non-perfusion. The mean intraocular pressure was similar across studies (14 mmHg) but the maximum values reported were higher in the Comino study (up to 26 mmHg). Patients with macular  ischemic  non-perfusion  is  an  important  subgroup  for  which  the  efficacy  result  needs  to  be discussed.

The COMINO study enrolled patients with central retinal or hemi-retinal vein occlusion. The majority of patients (82%) enrolled had central retinal vein occlusion.

## PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY

## BALATON study

## Prior Medication

## Prior Targeted Ocular Therapies/Treatments

In the ITT population, the proportion of patients that had received at least one targeted prior ocular therapy or treatment in the study eye was lower in the faricimab Q4W arm (2.9%) compared to the aflibercept Q4W arm (5.8%).

The reported treatments were 'other' prior ocular therapy (2.2% and 4.7%), other laser photocoagulation  (0.7%  and  0.4%),  dietary  supplement  (0  and  0.4%),  panretinal  photocoagulation laser (PRP; 0 and 0.4%), and topical steroids (0 and 0.4%) in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The 'other' category comprised  therapy used to treat prior concomitant anterior segment ocular conditions, which included dry eye syndrome, glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

## Prior Surgeries and Procedures

## Ocular

The  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  one  prior  ocular  surgery/procedure  in  the  study  eye  was comparable between treatment arms (17.4% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 16.6% in the aflibercept Q4W arm). Cataract surgery was the most common previous surgery/procedure in the ITT population (14.5% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 11.9% in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

## Concomitant Medications

## Concomitant Therapies and Treatments

## Ocular

In  the  safety-evaluable  population,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  at  least  one  concomitant treatment in the study eye was lower in the faricimab Q4W arm (13.8%) compared to the aflibercept Q4W arm (20.1%).

Overall, the most commonly reported concomitant treatments were in the category ophthalmologicals (13.0% in the faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  20.1%  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm),  in  which  topical  ocular hypotensive medications such as latanoprost (1.8% and 1.8%), and dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate (1.8% and 1.8%) and ocular surface lubricants such as sodium hyaluronate (1.1% and 2.9%) were the most common treatments in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

## Concomitant Ocular Surgeries and Procedures

In the ITT population, 3 patients (1.1% in) the faricimab Q4W arm and no patients in the aflibercept Q4W arm and concurrent ocular surgery/procedure in the study eye. The concurrent ocular surgeries and  procedures  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  were  panretinal  photocoagulation  (0.7%)  and  cataract surgery (0.4%).

## COMINO study

## Prior Medication

## Prior Targeted Ocular Therapies/Treatments

In the ITT population, the proportion of patients that had received at least one targeted prior ocular therapy or treatment in the study eye was comparable between treatment arms (5.7% in the faricimab and  5.0%  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arms;  The  reported  treatments  were  'other'  prior  ocular  therapy (4.9% and 4.1%), other laser photocoagulation (0.5% and 0), dietary supplement (0.3% and 0.3%), panretinal  photocoagulation  laser  (PRP;  0  and  0.3%),  and  topical  steroids  (0  and  0.3%)  in  the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

The  'other'  category  comprised    therapy  used  to  treat  prior  concomitant  anterior  segment  ocular conditions, which included dry eye syndrome, glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

## Prior Surgeries and Procedures

## Ocular

The  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  one  prior  ocular  surgery/procedure  in  the  study  eye  was comparable between treatment arms (17.5% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 15.2% in aflibercept Q4W arm. Cataract surgery was the most common previous surgery/procedure in the ITT population (15.0% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 11.6% in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

## Concomitant Medications

## Concomitant Therapies and Treatments

## Ocular

In  the  safety-evaluable  population,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  at  least  one  concomitant treatment in the study eye was comparable between treatment arms (24.7% in the faricimab Q4W arm  and  25.2%  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm).  Overall,  the  most  commonly  reported  concomitant treatments were in the category ophthalmologicals (24.4% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 24.7% in the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm),  in  which  topical  ophthalmic  ocular  hypotensive  medications  latanoprost (4.1% and 5.0%) and dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate combination (4.9% and 2.8%) eye drops  were  the  most  common  treatments  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively.

## Concomitant Ocular Surgeries and Procedures

In  the  ITT  population,  5  patients  (1.4%)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  12  patients  (3.3%)  in  the aflibercept Q4W arm had a concurrent ocular surgery/procedure in the study eye.

The  most  common  concurrent  ocular  surgery  and  procedure  was  laser  retinopexy  (0.5%  in  the faricimab Q4W arm and 0.6% in the aflibercept Q4W arm)

The  CHMP  noted  that,  as  per  the  exclusion  criteria,  any  prior  or  current  treatment/procedures  for macular oedema due to RVO, and other types of macular oedema, were prohibited. Other therapies with no significant impact were allowed; however, the proportion of patients that had received at least one prior ocular therapy or treatment in the study eye was low in both studies (less than 6% in any treatment arm).

In  addition,  while  in  the  study  treatment  for  ocular  hypertension  or  glaucoma,  cataract  or  posterior capsular opacification and short-term use of topical ocular corticosteroids was allowed. The percentage of patients receiving concomitant therapies varied between studies and was most frequently reported in the Comino study (up to 25%) as compared to up to 17 % in the Balaton study. Ophthalmic ocular hypotensive medications were the most frequently used.

## Outcomes and estimation

## BALATON study

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  24,  with  a  positive number of letters indicating an improvement. BCVA is assessed on the ETDRS visual acuity chart at a starting test distance of 4 meters.

At Week 24, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.5 letters in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively (Table 24); the difference was -0.6 letters (95% CI: -2.2, 1.1).

In the ITT population, patients treated with faricimab Q4W had a non-inferior change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W, as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the adjusted mean difference between the faricimab and aflibercept arms was greater  than  -  4  letters.  Superiority  for  the  primary  endpoint  was  not  met;  patients  treated  with faricimab  Q4W  did  not  have  a  superior  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  24  compared  with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W.

Units: letters. BCVA=Best Corrected Visual Acuity: MMRM = Mixed-Model Repeated-Measures; For the MMRM analysis, the model adjusted for treatment group, visit, visit-by-treatment group interaction, baseline BCVA (continuous), baseline BCVA (&lt;=54 letters vs. &gt;=55 letters) and region (U.S. and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world). An unstructured covariance structure is used. observed BcvA assessments were used regardless of the occurrence of intercurrent events. Missing data were implicitly imputed by MMRM. Invalid BCVA values are excluded from analysis. 95t CI is a rounding of 95.03t CI.

## Sensitivity  and  Supplementary  Analysis  of  Primary  Endpoint-Balaton  study  and  Comino study

The primary analysis used a treatment policy strategy for all intercurrent events and was performed based on all observed data, with missing data imputed implicitly by the MMRM under the missing at random (MAR) assumption.

The following sensitivity/supplemental analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the main analysis,  applying  different  handling  strategies  for  analysis  populations,  intercurrent  events,  and missing data:

- Multiple  imputation: the  analysis  was  conducted  following  the  same  intercurrent  events  and handling of intercurrent events as the primary analysis. Missing BCVA assessments at Week 24 due to any reason were imputed via multiple imputation assuming MNAR and imputed using the worse outcomes.  The  analyses  were  performed  using  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  with adjustment for the following covariates: treatment group, baseline BCVA (continuous), as well as randomization stratification factors.

The use of MI imputing worse outcomes was considered reasonable by the CHMP. The MAH also explained  that    the  form  of  the  multiple  imputation  (MI)  model  was  non-parametric  using approximate Bayesian bootstrap method to impute missing change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24. From all the non-missing change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24, the 20th percentile was used  to  identify  the  worst  (lowest)  20%  values.  The  missing  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at Week 24 was imputed by randomly drawing samples without replacement from the worst 20% non-missing change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24.

- Analysis  based  on  the  PP  population: the  analysis  was  conducted  following  the  same intercurrent events, handling of intercurrent events, handling of missing data and analysis method as the primary analysis, with the exception that the analysis will be based on the PP population.

Analysis  distinguishing  COVID  and  non-COVID  intercurrent  events: the  analysis  was conducted  following  the  same  handling  of  missing  data  and  analysis  method  as  the  primary analysis, with the exception that COVID-19 related intercurrent events and non-COVID-19 related intercurrent  events  were  handled  using  a hypothetical  strategy  and  treatment  policy strategy , respectively.

The rationale for applying the hypothetical strategy for COVID-19 related intercurrent events was to discard potentially confounding impacts of the pandemic and estimate the treatment effect in the  absence  of  COVID-19,  assuming  COVID-19  will  not  be  present  or  will  not  have  the  same

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

impact in the future. The rate of non-COVID-19 related intercurrent events was low and generally balanced across the treatment arms.

- Hypothetical  strategy  for  all  intercurrent  events :  the  analysis was conducted following the same intercurrent events, handling of missing data and analysis method as the primary analysis, with the exception that all intercurrent events were handled using a hypothetical strategy, where all values were censored after the occurrence of the intercurrent events.

The CHMP noted that, for COVID related intercurrent events, a hypothetical approach was considered: data were censored at the time the IE occurred. A supplemental analysis applying a treatment policy strategy  for  non-COVID  related  intercurrent  events  and  a  hypothetical  strategy  for  COVID  related intercurrent events was also performed, and the results were consistent with the main analysis for the primary endpoint. This approach is agreeable.

## Intercurrent Events for the Primary Estimand

Through  Week  24,  2  patients  (0.7%)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  2  patients  (0.7%)  in  the aflibercept Q4W arm experienced at least one intercurrent event (Table 26). Of these, one patient in the faricimab Q4W arm experienced 'discontinuation of study treatment due to adverse events or lack of  efficacy'.  Of  note,  this  patient  did  not  discontinue  study  treatment  due  to  lack  of  efficacy.  One patient  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  two  patients  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm  received  prohibited systemic treatment or prohibited therapy in the study eye.

## COMINO study

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint-Comino study

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  is  the  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  24  (Table  27),  with  a positive  number  of  letters  indicating  an  improvement.  Faricimab  demonstrated  non-inferiority  to aflibercept  on  the  primary  endpoint,  defined  as  the  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  at  Week  24  as measured on the ETDRS letter chart in patients with C/HRVO.

At Week 24, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.3  letters  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively;  the  difference  was  -0.4 letters (95% CI: -2.5, 1.6). In this population, patients treated with faricimab Q4W had a non-inferior change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W, as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the adjusted mean difference between the faricimab and aflibercept arms was greater than -4 letters. Superiority for the primary endpoint was not met; patients treated with faricimab Q4W did not have a superior change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W.

## Sensitivity  and  Supplementary  Analysis  of  Primary  Endpoint  (the  same  approach  as  in Balaton study, discussed above).

The  CHMP  noted  that  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  (using  multiple  imputation)  support  the results of the primary analysis.

For the primary analysis, an MMRM analysis was perfomed; the model was adjusted for treatment group, visit, visit-by-treatment group interaction, baseline BCVA (continuous), baseline BCVA (≤ 34 letters, 35-54 letters, and ≥ 55 letters) and region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world) An unstructured covariance structure was used. Observed BcvA assessments were used regardless of the occurrence of intercurrent events. Missing data were implicitly imputed by MMRM. Invalid BCVA values were excluded from analysis. 95% Cl is a rounding of 95.03% Cl.

For the sensitivity analysis using Ml, an ANcovA analysis was performed; the model used the non-missing change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 as the response variable adjusted for the treatment group, baseline BCVA (continuous), baseline BCVA score (≤34 letters, 35-54 letters, and ≥55 letters), and region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world). Observed BCvA assessments were used regardless of the occurrence of intercurrent events. Missing primary endpoint BCVA assessments were imputed using Ml assuming MNAR and imputed using the worse outcomes. Invalid BCVA values were excluded from analysis. 95% Cl is a rounding of 95.03% Cl.

For the analysis distinguishing COvID and non-CovID intercurrent events, the analysis was conducted following the same analysis method as the primary analysis except a treatment policy strategy and hypothetical strategy were applied to non-CovID-19 related and CovID-19 related intercurrent events, respectively.

## Intercurrent Events for the Primary Estimand

Through  Week  24,  3  patients  (0.8%)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  7  patients  (1.9%)  in  the aflibercept Q4W arm experienced at least one intercurrent event (Table 28). Of these, three patients in the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  4  patients  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm  experienced  'discontinuation  of study treatment due to adverse events or lack of efficacy'. Of note, none of these patients discontinued study treatment due to lack of efficacy. The remaining 3 patients in the aflibercept Q4W arm received prohibited systemic treatment or prohibited therapy in the study eye.

## Proportion of Patients Gaining ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 Letters in BCVA from Baseline at Week 24

A similar proportion of patients treated with faricimab Q4W gained ≥ 15 letters from baseline at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W. At Week 24, 56.1% and 60.4% of patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in the adjusted proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters from baseline between the faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -4.3% (95% CI: -12.3%, 3.8%).

Similar results were also seen across the two treatment arms for patients gaining ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 24.

BCVA = best-corrected visual acuity; BL = baseline; CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; LOCF = last observation carried forward; Q4W = every four weeks.

Notes: The weighted estimate was based on CMH weights stratified by baseline BCVA score (≤ 54 letters vs. ≥ 55 letters) and region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world). 95% Cl is a rounding of 95.03% Cl and estimates below 0% or above 100% were imputed as 0% or 100% respectively. Baseline is defined as the last available measurement obtained on or prior to randomization. Invalid BCVA were excluded.

For the main analysis, all observed values were used regardless of the occurrence of the intercurrent event. header is the number of patients randomized (used as the denominator when calculating proportion).

For the supplementary analysis, a composite variable strategy was applied where patients with any intercurrent event were assumed to be failures. Missing assessments at Week 24 were imputed using LOCF with the exception that for patients missing all three assessments at Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, who were imputed as failures.

## Proportion of Patients Gaining ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 Letters in BCVA from Baseline over Time

A similar proportion of patients treated with faricimab Q4W gained ≥ 15 letters from baseline through Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W. Similar results were also seen across the two treatment arms for patients gaining ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt;0 letters in BCVA from baseline over time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Proportion of Patients Avoiding a Loss of ≥ 15, ≥ 10, or ≥ 5 Letters in BCVA from Baseline at Week 24

A similar proportion of patients treated with faricimab Q4W avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters from baseline at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W. At Week 24, 99.6% and 98.6% of patients  avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters  in  BCVA  from  baseline  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in the adjusted proportion of patients who avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters from baseline between the faricimab Q4W arm, when compared to the aflibercept Q4W arm at  Week  24,  was  1.0%  (95%  CI: -0.5%,  2.6%).  Similar  results  were  also  seen  across  the  two treatment arms for patients avoiding a loss of ≥ 10 or ≥ 5 letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 24.

BCVA = best-corected visual acuity: BL = baseline; CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; LOCF = last observation camied forward; Q4W = every four weeks.

Notes: The weighted estimate was based on CMH weights stratified by baseline BCVA score (&lt; 34 letters, 35-54 letters, and ≥ 55 letters) and region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world). 95% Cl is a rounding of 95.03% Cl and estimates below 0% or above 100% are imputed as 0% or 100% respectively. Baseline is defined as the last available measurement obtained on or prior to randomization. Invalid BCVA were excluded.

For the main analysis, all observed values were used regardless of the occurrence of the intercurrent event.

For the supplementary analysis, a composite variable strategy was applied where patients with any intercurrent event were assumed to be failures. Missing assessments at Week 24 were imputed using LocF with the exception that for patients missing all three assessments at Weeks 16, 20, and 24, who were be imputed as failures.

## Proportion of Patients Avoiding a Loss of ≥ 15, ≥ 10, or ≥ 5 Letters in BCVA from Baseline over Time

- For the main analysis,an MMRM analysis was performed; the model was adjusted for treatment group, visit,visit-by-treatment group interaction,baseline BCVA(continuous),baseline BCVA(≤54letters and ≥55 letters)and region(United States and Canada,Asia,and the rest of the world).An unstructured intercurrentevents.MissingdatawereimplicitlyimputedbyMMRM.InvalidBCVAvalueswereexcluded from analysis. 95% Cl is a rounding of 95.03% Cl.
- For the sensitivity analysis using Ml, an ANCOVA analysis was performed; the model used the non-missing changefrombaselineinBCVAaveragedoverWeeks64,68and72as theresponsevariableadjusted and region(United States and Canada,Asia,and the restof the world).Observed BCVA assessments were used regardless of the occurrence of intercurrent events.Missing post-baseline BCVA assessments were imputed using multiple imputation (Ml) assuming missing not at random (MNAR) and imputed using the worse outcomes. Invalid BCVA values were excluded from analysis.95% Cl is a rounding of 95.03% CI.

- For the main analysis, an MMRM analysis was performed; the model was adjusted for treatment group. visit,visit-by-treatmentgroupinteraction,baselineBCVA(continuous),baselineBCVA(≤54lettersand ≥55 letters) and region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world). An unstructured covariance structure was used.Observed BCVA assessments were used regardless of the occurrence of intercurrent events. Missing data were implicitly imputed by MMRM. Invalid BCVA values were excluded from analysis.95% Cl is a rounding of 95.03% Cl.

- For the analysis distinguishing COVID and non-COVID intercurrent events, the analysis was conducted following the same analysis method as the main analysis except a treatment policy strategy and hypothetical strategy were applied to non-COVID-19 related and COVID-19 related intercurrent events, respectively.
- For the analysis using a hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events,the analysis was conducted following the same analysis method as the main analysis except a hypothetical strategy was applied to theintercurrentevents.

Between Week 24 and Week 68, 81.5% and 74.0% of patients achieved a faricimab Q12W or Q16W dosing interval in BALATON and COMINO, respectively. Of these patients, 72.1% and 61.6% completed at  least  one  cycle  of  Q12W  and  maintained  Q16W  or  Q12W  dosing  interval  without  an  interval reduction  below  Q12W  through  Week  68  in  BALATON  and  COMINO,  respectively.  The  proportion  of patients who only received Q4W dosing through Week 68 in BALATON and COMINO was low (1.2% and 2.5%, respectively.

## Anatomic Outcome Measures using SD-OCT

## Change from Baseline in CST over Time

In  both  BALATON  and  COMINO,  patients  in  the  faricimab  and  aflibercept  arms  had  comparable reductions  in  CST  from  baseline  at  Week  24.  Greater  reductions  in  CST  were  observed  in  COMINO compared with BALATON, which is as expected due to the higher mean CST baseline value for COMINO compared with BALATON (baseline CST for BALATON: 559.3 µm and 559.1 µm vs COMINO: 701.1 µm

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  721.6  µm  in  the  faricimab  and  aflibercept  arms,  respectively.  The  reductions  in  CST  were maintained through Week 72.

In the BALATON study, at Week 24, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in CST were -311.4 μ m and  -  304.4 μ m  in  the  faricimab  and  aflibercept  arms,  respectively;  at  Week  64/68/72,  those reductions  were  maintained  (-310.9  µm  and  -307.0  µm  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

In the COMINO study, at Week 24, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in CST were - 461.6 μ m and  -  448.8 μ m  in  the  faricimab  and  aflibercept  arms,  respectively;  at  Week  64/68/72,  those reductions were maintained (- 465.9 µm and - 460.6 µm in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

## Proportion of Patients with Absence of both Intraretinal Fluid and Subretinal Fluid over Time through Week 72

In the BALATON study, at baseline, 2 patients (0.7%) in the faricimab arm and 1 patient (0.4%) in the aflibercept  arm  had  an  absence  of  both  intraretinal  fluid  and  subretinal  fluid  in  the  central  1  mm subfield.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  an  absence  of  both  intraretinal  fluid  and  subretinal  fluid  at Week  24  was  comparable  between  the  faricimab and aflibercept  arms  (67.4%  and  64.3%, respectively). The proportion of patients with an absence of both intraretinal fluid and subretinal fluid was generally maintained from Week 24 through Week 72 (70.7% and 71.1% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively).

In the COMINO study, at baseline, 7 patients (1.9%) in the faricimab arm and 3 patients (0.8%) in the aflibercept  arm  had  an  absence  of  both  intraretinal  fluid  and  subretinal  fluid  in  the  central  1  mm subfield.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  an  absence  of  both  intraretinal  fluid  and  subretinal  fluid  at Week  24  was  comparable  between  the  faricimab and aflibercept  arms  (76.0%  and  68.6%, respectively). The proportion of patients with an absence of both intraretinal fluid and subretinal fluid was generally maintained from Week 24 through Week 72 (77.0% and 71.6% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively).

## Patient-Reported Vision-Related Functioning and Quality of Life using NEI VFQ-25 Change from Baseline in NEI VFQ-25 Composite Score over Time through Week 72

In both BALATON and COMINO studies, patients in the faricimab arm had comparable adjusted mean changes  from  baseline  at  Week  24  in  the  National  Eye  Institute  25-Item  Visual  Functioning Questionnaire  (NEI  VFQ-25)  composite  score  compared  with  patients  in  the  aflibercept  arm,  which were maintained in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively, through Week 72.

In  the  BALATON  study,  at  Week  24,  the  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  NEI  VFQ-25 composite score were 5.6 and 5.9 points in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively; at Week 72, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 composite score were 6.0 and 7.8 points in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively. In  the  COMINO  study,  at  Week  24,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  NEI  VFQ-25 composite score were 7.0 and 8.2 points in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively; at Week 72, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 composite score were 7.8 and 8.5 points in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively. In summary, in both pivotal studies the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 as  assessed  on  the  ETDRS  visual  acuity  chart  at  a  starting  test  distance  of  4  meters.  In addition,  in  both  pivotal  studies  investigating  patients  with  branch  retinal  vein  occlusion  (Balaton study)  and  patients  with  central    or  hemi-retinal  vein  occlusion  (Comino  study), the  primary endpoint  was  met  as  the  patients  treated  with  faricimab  Q4W  had  a  non-inferior  change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W , as the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  adjusted  mean  difference  between  the faricimab and aflibercept arms was greater than - 4 letters.

In the BALATON study , at Week 24, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.5 letters in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; the difference was -0.6 letters (95% CI: -2.2, 1.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the COMINO study , at Week 24, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.3 letters in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; the difference was -0.4 letters (95% CI: -2.5, 1.6).

Of note, in the primary analysis a treatment policy strategy was applied to all intercurrent events and missing data were implicitly imputed by the MMRM model, assuming a missing at random mechanism. The results of the sensitivity analysis (which used multiple imputation assuming MNAR) supports the primary analysis results.

In  both  pivotal  studies,  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis  were  also  supported  by  supplementary analyses  performed  by  the  MAH  such  as  the  analysis  based  on  the  PP  population,  analysis distinguishing COVID and non-COVID intercurrent events and analysis using hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events.

In  both  studies  there  were  a  number  of  secondary  endpoints  which  could  be  grouped  into  three categories.  In  first  category  the  effect  on  best  corrected  visual  acuity  (BCVA)  was  investigated  in second category the MAH investigation anatomic outcome measures SD-OCT whereas in third category patient-reported  outcome.  Of  note,  secondary  endpoints  were  not  included  in  the  multiplicity adjustment strategy.

In relation to effect on additional  BCVA  outcomes including the proportion of patients gaining or avoiding a loss of ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 letters in BCVA from baseline, patients achieving ≥ 84, 69 letters or ≤ 38 letters, all assessed at week 24, in both pivotal studies the results were comparable between the treatment groups.

The graph of change from baseline in visual acuity vs. time shows that, in both group, visual acuity sharply improves by Month 4, and gradually continues to improve thereafter.

In the BALATON study ,  at  Week 24, 56.1% and 60.4% of  patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in  the  adjusted  proportion  of  patients  who  gained  at  least  15  letters  from  baseline  between  the faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -4.3% (95% CI: -12.3%, 3.8%).

In the COMINO study , at week 24, 56.6% and 58.1% of patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in the adjusted  proportion  of  patients  who  gained  at  least  15  letters  from  baseline  between  the  faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -1.5% (95% CI: -8.4%, 5.3%).

Also, a similar proportion of patients treated with faricimab Q4W avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters from baseline at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W. In the Balaton study , at Week 24, 99.6% and 98.6% of patients avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. In the Comino study ,  at  Week 24, 96.2% and 96.7% of patients avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

In relation the effect on anatomic outcome measures macular oedema was reduced significantly in both  treatment  groups,  which  was  also  reflected  by  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with absence of macular oedema or absence of intraretinal subretinal fluid . Of note, at baseline macular oedema was more significant in patients with central or hemi-retinal vein occlusion, or in those with branch  retinal  vein  occlusion  and  improvements  seen  in  patients  with  central  or  hemi-retinal  vein occlusion was higher.

In the BALATON study At Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -311.4 μm and -304.4 μ m in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  CST  between  the  faricimab  Q4W  when  compared  to  the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -7.0 μm (95% CI: -14.1, 0).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the COMINO study , at Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -461.6 μm and -448.8  μm in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  The  difference  in adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  CST  between  the  faricimab  Q4W  when  compared  to  the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -12.8 μm (95% CI: -26.7, 1.0).

In relation to the patients reported outcomes , in both studies patients treated with faricimab Q4W had comparable adjusted mean changes from baseline in the NEI VFQ-25 composite score at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W.

The comparative data are available for 24 weeks. In Part 2 of the study, patients in both Arm A and Arm B in Part 1 were receiving 6 mg faricimab intravitreal injections administered according to a PTI dosing regimen in intervals between Q4W and Q16W. Based on the visual and/or anatomical changes the best treatment interval was determined.

As indicated  by  the  MAH,  the  majority  of  patients  in  Part  2  of  studies  were  treated  using  Q12W  or Q16W dosing  interval.  Between  Week  24  and  Week  68,  81.5%  and  74.0%  of  patients  achieved  a faricimab  Q12W or Q16W dosing interval in BALATON and COMINO, respectively. The proportion of patients who only received Q4W dosing through Week 68 in BALATON and COMINO was low (1.2% and 2.5%, respectively.

Of note, despite the lower frequency of the treatment, the efficacy was maintained.

In the BALATON study ,  at  Week 64/68/72, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 18.1 and 18.8 letters in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

In the  COMINO  study ,  at  Week  64/68/72, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.1 letters in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

The proportion of patients who gained ≥15 letters in BCVA score from baseline at Week 64/68/72 was 61.5% and 65.8% in BALATON and 57.6% and 59.5% in COMINO in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

The proportion  of  patients  who  avoided  a  loss  of  ≥15  letters  in  BCVA  score  from  baseline  at  Week 64/68/72 was 98.9% and 98.2% in BALATON and 93.7% and 95.6% in COMINO in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

Taking into consideration the efficacy data reported in Part 2 of the studies, the personalized treatment interval  (PTI)  treatment  regimen  is  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.    The  maximum  treatment interval  has  been  specified  accordingly  in  the  SmPC,  in  line  with  the  approach  taken  for  other indications .

## Ancillary analyses

In both pivotal studies, the primary endpoint of the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 was analysed across subgroups including (&lt;65 years and ≥ 65 years) Region (United States and  Canada,  Asia,  and  the  rest  of  the  world),  Gender  (female  and  male),  Race  (White,  Asian,  and other).

In addition, the primary endpoint was analysed depending on baseline BCVA in the BALATON study in the subgroups of ≤ 54 letters and ≥ 55 letters and low vision of ≤ 23 letters and ≥ 24 letters, whereas in the COMINO study in the subgroups ≤ 34 letters, 35-54 letters, and ≥ 55 letters and low vision of ≤ 23 letters and ≥ 24 letters. Furthermore, in the COMINO study the results were analysed  depending on the RVO Subtype (CRVO and HRVO. The results of these analyses are presented below.

In  the  BALATON  study  there  were  no  major  differences  in  treatment  effects  in  the  subgroups investigated,  although  wider  confidence  intervals  were  seen  in  subgroups  with  smaller  number  of participants.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  number  of  patients  included  in  'Other'  race  category  was particularly small.

The lower treatment effect was seen in patients with HRVO as compared to those with CRVO. The MAH discussed this matter further, as requested. Patients with HRVO comprised 18% of the total patient population in the COMINO study, with 62 patients randomized to the faricimab arm and 65 patients randomized to aflibercept arm, respectively. The MAH considered that although the efficacy results in this  group  of  patients  were  slightly  less  favourable  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  as  compared  the aflibercept  Q4W  arm,  in  both  groups  clinically  relevant  improvement  was  reported.  In  the  HRVO subgroup, BCVA gains at Week 24 were 18.5 (95% CI: 16.0, 20.9) ETDRS letters in the faricimab Q4W arm  and  22.3  (95%  CI:  19.9,  24.7)  ETDRS  letters  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm,  respectively. Furthermore,  having  presented  the  treatment  by  subgroup  interaction,  the  MAH  concluded  that  no physiological plausibility for a different response to faricimab treatment between patients with CRVO and HRVO could be identified. Therefore, the CHMP agreed this could be a chance finding.

The MAH also analysed the efficacy results in patients with ischemic non-perfusion and compared the results  between  the  treatment  groups.  It  was  subsequently  clarified  that  only  approximately  3/4  of patients across the two studies had standard FFA imaging used to evaluate peripheral nonperfusion. Secondary, only 48% of the acquired standard FFA images were gradable for the presence of ischemic disease by the reading center in the BALATON and COMINO studies. Therefore, the conclusion on the efficacy in patients with ischemic non-perfusion RVO as determined by FFA imaging could not be made. Instead, the MAH presented the efficacy results in the group of patients with the most severe visual impairment (i.e.   20/200; 38 letters or worse) as these patients are more likely to have ischemic RVO. The CHMP noted that the additional analysis conducted in this group of patients showed comparable BCVA gains in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms at Week 24.

## Summary of main study(ies)

The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present RVO application  for  EoI.  These  summaries  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  discussion  on  clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment in the later sections of this assessment report.

## Real World Data Results Supplementing the Recommended RVO Dosing Regimen

Large observational studies of treatment patterns and outcomes of macular oedema secondary to RVO in routine clinical practice are scarce. A non-interventional retrospective observational study is being conducted to  assess  real-world  anti-VEGF  treatment  patterns  and  visual  acuity  (VA)  outcomes  over time  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  secondary  to  BRVO  or  CRVO.  The  analysis  uses  data  from Vestrum  Health,  a  database  of  electronic  health  records  from  private  retina  specialist  clinics  in  the United  States.  We  report  findings  from  the  treatment  pattern  analysis  that  describe  the  average number  of  anti-VEGF  injections  received  in  the  first  6  months  of  treatment  for  macular  oedema secondary to BRVO or CRVO separately.

Data from 2014-2021 were extracted from the Vestrum Health database, which include de-identified electronic  health  record data  from  private  retina  specialist  clinics  in  the  United  States .  The Vestrum  Health  database  is  a  collection  of  data  from  multiple  different  electronic  health  record systems, totalling up to &gt; 360 physicians and &gt; 65 practices across all regions in the United States. Data from some physicians begin in 2013 with complete coverage for all specialists beginning by 2015. The electronic health record represents the entire patient's file as maintained by the treating physician and  practice  with  the  exception  of  diagnostic  images.  Records  are  continuous  regardless  of  the physician in the practice treating the patient, but only to the extent the patient is treated in the same practice.  Data  recorded  within  the  electronic  health  record  include  diagnoses,  procedures,  drugs administered, payer, and outcomes such as visual acuity.

Eyes  with  a  diagnosis  of  macular  oedema  secondary  to  BRVO  or  CRVO  from  January  1,  2014  to November 30, 2021, were identified. The analytic cohort included eyes that received ≥ 1 anti-VEGF injection after the index diagnosis, and patients were required to be aged ≥ 18 years at the index antiVEGF  treatment  date.  Eyes  were  required  to  have  a  VA  reading  at  baseline  (index  anti-VEGF treatment); be treatment-naive to anti-VEGF, intravitreal steroids, and grid/focal laser therapy at the index  treatment  date;  and  have  a  minimum  of  3  months  of  follow-up  from  the  index  anti-VEGF treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eyes diagnosed with the following conditions on or before index diagnosis were excluded: moderate non-proliferative  diabetic  retinopathy  or  worse,  proliferative  diabetic  retinopathy,  diabetic  macular oedema,  neovascular  age-related macular degeneration, geographic atrophy, myopic  choroidal neovascularization, cystoid macular oedema, and retinal neovascularisation.

RVO is defined in the Vestrum database using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision,  Clinical  Modification  (ICD-9,  ICD-10).  ICD-9  codes  are  used  for  eyes  with  initial  diagnosis between January 01, 2014 - September 30, 2015 (BRVO: 362.36, CRVO: 362.35). ICD-10 codes are used for eyes with initial diagnosis from October 1, 2015 onwards (BRVO: H34.83xx, CRVO: H34.81xx, where x denotes a wildcard used in the query of ICD-10 codes).  BRVO with macular edema or CRVO with  macular  edema  can  be  identified  using  ICD-10  codes  H34.83x0  or  H34.81x0,  respectively. Macular edema is defined using a combination of ICD codes (362.83, and H35.81), along with free text searches of Vestrum's 'Exam Findings' field. An eye would be considered to have macular edema if either of these were present at a visit. Some examples of exam findings are: 'Macular Edema OD', 'Findings  consistent  with  macular  edema',  'Retinal  thickening  consistent  with  macular  edema'. Macular edema secondary to  RVO  is  defined  as  the  first  instance  of  macular  edema  (defined  above)  on  or  after  the  initial diagnosis  of  RVO.  The  eye  must  also  still  have  an  associated  RVO  ICD  code  at  this  time.  The  first instance of this occurring is identified as the index diagnosis of macular edema secondary to RVO in a patient's eye.

Anti-VEGF  treatments  (e.g.,  ranibizumab,  aflibercept)  were  identified  using  Healthcare  Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes (J2778, C9233, J0178, Q2046, C9291, J9035, C9257, J0179, Q9977, and J3590) along with the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for intravitreal injection (67028). Intravitreal injections of anti- VEGFs with an unclassified drug HCPCS code J3490 are also included when the entries identify the anti-VEGF drug administered.

Demographic and baseline  clinical  characteristics  were  descriptively  analyzed  (Table  38).  The  mean (SD) of anti-VEGF injections received in the first six months of treatment were described (Table 39). The  number  of  injections  during  a  time  interval  were  reported  as  the  sum  of  all  eligible  anti-VEGF injections, regardless of the drug type, during that period.

## Results

The analytic sample included 22,365 eyes with macular oedema secondary to BRVO and 18,064 eyes with macular edema secondary to CRVO. For BRVO with macular oedema, mean age was 70.6 years and 55.1% were female. For CRVO with macular oedema, mean age was 71.9 years and 49.6% were female. The mean (SD) time from index diagnosis to index treatment was 31.6 (141.1) days for BRVO and 19.5 (98.4) days for CRVO with macular oedema.

Within the first 6 months of treatment, eyes with BRVO and CRVO with macular oedema received a mean (SD) of 4.2 (1.5) and 4.3 (1.4) injections, respectively. More injections were received in the first three months of treatment compared to months 4-6. Both BRVO and CRVO with macular oedema eyes received a mean (SD) of 2.7 (0.8) injections in months 0-3, and 1.6 (1.0) injections in months 4-6.

The average number of anti-VEGF injections were summarized for previously treatment naive BRVO and CRVO with macular oedema eyes that received treatment in routine clinical practice. The number of  injections  received  by  eyes  with  macular  oedema  secondary  to  BRVO  or  CRVO  were  similar.  On

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

average, eyes received approximately 4 injections in the first 6 months of treatment, which are fewer than  the  6  initial  monthly  injections  studied  in  all  of  the  pivotal  RVO  anti-VEGF  trials.  The  lower number  of  anti-  VEGF  treatments  received  in  real-world  practice  compared  to  pivotal  trials  may potentially be due to the burden of frequent injections, as suggested by prior studies (Ang et al. 2020; Callizo et al. 2019), or differences in treatment regimens due to treatment response or disease control. Results also show that injection frequency was highest in the first three months of treatment, where eyes received almost monthly injections. However, the number of injections declined in months 4-6, where  eyes  for  BRVO  or  CRVO  with  macular  oedema  received  an  average  of  1.6  injections  over  a three-month period. These results suggest that 6 initial monthly doses of intravitreal injections may not  be  possible  or  necessary  for  some  patients  and  that  a  more  flexible  and  personalized  dosing regimen in the first six months of treatment may be needed.

The CHMP acknowledged the MAH's effort to collect real world data results supporting the proposed dose regimen and noted the main outcome of the analysis: on average, eyes received approximately 4 injections  in  the  first  6  months  of  treatment,  which  are  fewer  than  the  6  initial  monthly  injections studied in all of the pivotal RVO anti-VEGF trials. However, importantly, the CHMP highlighted that the type of anti-VEGF treatments considered is not specified and no efficacy results associated with this less frequently dosing was provided.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Dose finding studies

No dose finding studies were performed for the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to  macular  oedema  secondary  to  retinal  vein  occlusion  (RVO).  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  proposed posology is similar to that used in patients with diabetic macular oedema (DME). As indicated by the MAH,  the  dose  of  6  mg  was  selected  for  RVO  patients  based  on  similarities  in  pathophysiology  of macular  oedema  and  vision  loss  in  patients  with  DME  and  RVO  and  similar  faricimab  PK  and  PD characteristics in DME and RVO.

As  detailed  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC,  the  recommended  dose  is  6  mg  (0.05  mL  solution) administered  by  intravitreal  injection  every  4  weeks  (monthly);  3  or  more  consecutive,  monthly injections may be needed. Thereafter, treatment is individualised using a treat -and-extend approach. Based  on  the  physician's  judgement  of  the  patient's  anatomic  and/or  visual  outcomes,  the  dosing interval may be extended in increments of up to 4  weeks. If anatomic and/or visual outcomes change, the treatment interval should be adjusted accordingly, and interval reduction should be implemented if anatomic and/or visual outcomes deteriorate.

The  treat  -and-extend  approach  was  proposed  to  be  implemented  after  3  consecutive  monthly initiation  doses.  However,  this  is  not  in  line  with  the  approach  implemented  in  pivotal  studies  as  in both studies during the first 24 weeks of treatment patients received a total 6 injections given every 4 weeks (Q4W). Treat -and-extend approach was introduced later (i.e. after 6 injections/24 weeks of treatment). Therefore, it was requested to justify the proposed dose regimen.

In order to support the proposed posology  (i.e. implantation of treat -and-extend after 3 consecutive monthly initiation), a post-hoc analysis of the data up to Week 24 was conducted.

This analysis indicated that, after 3 consecutive monthly initiation doses, RVO patients on average do not  gain  additional  meaningful  benefit  from  continued  monthly  dosing,  as  shown  by  the  small difference in the change from baseline in BCVA, CST, and proportion of patients gaining ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from  baseline  between  Week  12  and  Week  24.  Further,  it  was  noted  that  79%  and  71%  of patients  in  BALATON  and  COMINO,  respectively,  achieved  disease  stability  at  Week  8.  For  those patients who achieved stability at Week 8, the mean change in BCVA from Week 12 to Week 24 was less than &lt; 2 letters, which is not considered clinically significant.

Finally,  the  MAH  highlighted  that,  the  pivotal  studies  for  aflibercept  and  ranibizumab  had  similar designs (monthly dosing for 6 months, followed by a move to a different dosing regimen), but have

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

posologies  that  allow  an  individualised  approach  to  treatment  after  3  consecutive  monthly  doses. Therefore,  taking  into  consideration  the  totality  of  the  data,  the  proposed  recommendation  for  an individualised approach to treatment after 3 consecutive monthly doses was accepted by the CHMP.

The  data  from  the  second  part  of  both  studies  showed  that  the  BCVA  gains  and  central  subfield thickness (CST) reductions achieved at Week 24 were maintained through Week 72, during which time all patients were on the 6 mg faricimab personalised treatment interval (PTI) dosing regimen.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Clinical evidence supporting the efficacy, safety, and favourable benefit-risk assessment of faricimab is mainly based on the primary analysis results of two pivotal Phase III studies:

- Study  GR41984  (hereafter  referred  to  as BALATON )  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)
- Study  GR41986  (hereafter  referred  to  as COMINO )  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to central retinal vein occlusion or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (C/HRVO).

The design of both pivotal studies was similar. Both studies consisted of two treatment periods. Part 1 (Day 1 through week 24) which compared faricimab every 4 weeks (Q4W) Arm A) versus aflibercept Q4W (Arm B) and Part 2 (week 24 through week 72) which was evaluating faricimab administered at masked treatment intervals of Q4W to every 16 weeks (Q16W) based on PTI dosing criteria. Of note the  comparative  data  are  available  only  for  the  first  24  weeks  only  as  in  part  2  all  patients  were receiving faricimab.

In the studies patients were stratified depending on the baseline BCVA score (with different cuts off depending on the study) and based on the region (United States and Canada, Asia, and the rest of the world).

## Study population

The inclusion criteria (broadly agreed during the SA) were similar between both pivotal studies with an exception that the BALATON study enrolled patients with macular oedema due to BRVO whereas the COMINO study enrolled patients with macular oedema due to CRVO or HRVO. In both studies patients had to be diagnosed no longer than 4 months prior to the screening visit and the diagnosis had to be confirmed  by  the  central  reading  centre.  The  MAH  clarified  that  although  BALATON  (GR41984)  and COMINO (GR41986) studies enrolled patients who were diagnosed within 4 months of the screening visit, this is generally reflective of what happens in clinical practice. It was also indicated by the MAH that in patients with RVO the treatment is usually started shortly after diagnosis.

The key criteria also include the threshold requirement for BCVA 73 letters or less (minimum of 19 letters)  at  screening  to  ensure  that  patients  had  room  to  improve  by  at  least  15  letters,  while  also allowing the inclusion of patients presenting with ischemic RVO (who tend to present baseline BCVA &lt;20/200 and have a more guarded prognosis). Further, as indicated by the MAH patients with BCVA less  than  19  are  more  likely  to  have  disease-induced  irreversible  retinal  damage  and  are  therefore unable to respond to therapy. A similar approach was used in studies investigating other anti-VEGF investigated for the treatment of RVO.

In relation to the exclusion criteria the study included only patients without prior treatment for macular  oedema due to RVO, including anti-VEGF intravitreal injections, steroids, tissue plasminogen activator, ocriplasmin, C3F8, air or periocular injection and laser therapy. Therefore, the pivotal  study  data  could  only  provide  supporting  evidence  for  faricimab  being  used  as  a  first  line therapy. The efficacy of this product in patients who failed other treatment options is not available and this limitation of the data set is highlighted in section 4.4 of the SmPC .

In both pivotal studies, patients were randomly assigned to 6 mg of faricimab intravitreal injections in Arm A or 2 mg aflibercept intravitreal injections in Arm B. During the first 24 weeks of treatment (in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Part 1 of the study) patients in both treatment arms received in total 6 injections given every 4 weeks (Q4W).

In Part 2 all patients received 6 mg of faricimab intravitreal injections; therefore, no comparative data are available beyond week 24.

In part 2 the treatment intervals could be maintained or adjusted (increased by 4 weeks or decreased by  4,  8,  or  12  weeks),  based  on  CST  and  BCVA  values.  The  study  protocols  provided  a  detailed instruction on how the dose should be adjusted. On the other hand, in the SmPC (in section 4.2 and 5.1)  only  limited  information  was  included  in  this  regard.  The  SmPC  only  states  that  the  treatment intervals  are  to  be  adjusted  based  on  anatomic  and/or  visual  outcomes  change  but  CST  and  BCVA value which should be used for this adjustment is not specified. However, as the same approach was used for other approved indication this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Furthermore, also in SmPC section 4.2 it is highlighted that treatment intervals shorter than 4 weeks and longer than 4 months between injections have not been studied. Monitoring between the dosing visits should be scheduled based on the patient's status and at the physician's discretion but there is no requirement for monthly monitoring between injections.

## Comparator

Both pivotal studies were-active controlled up to Week 24. The lack of a placebo arm is agreed given the  existing  therapeutic  alternatives.  The  MAH  selected  aflibercept  as  a  comparator  in  the  studies, which  is  acceptable.  Aflibercept  given  at  the  dose  of  2  mg  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO). The monthly regimen for the comparator in Part 1 of the study was discussed and agreed during the SA.

## Prior and Concomitant Therapy

In relation to the exclusion criteria only patients without prior treatment for macular oedema due to RVO were included. In this context, as discussed, the data generated in the pivotal studies can support the use of the product as first line therapy in patients' macular oedema due to RVO.

## Study endpoints

The primary endpoint in the study was the change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 24. The timing of the primary endpoint was agreed during the SA and was the same as used in the pivotal studies supporting the authorisation of other anti-VEGFs (i.e. aflibercept and ranibizumab)  and  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.    In  relation  to  the  selected  primary outcome measure (i.e. change from baseline in BCVA) this is also considered acceptable.

Both studies had a non-inferiority design. For the primary analysis, if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in adjusted means of the two treatments is greater than - 4 letters (the non-inferiority margin), then faricimab is considered non-inferior to aflibercept.

There were a number of secondary endpoints again investigating the effect on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) including the proportion of patients gaining or avoiding a loss of ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 letters  in  BCVA  from  baseline,  patients  achieving  ≥  84,  69  letters  or  ≤ 38  letters.  Other  aspects investigated in the study included changes from baseline in central subfield thickness (CST), proportion of  patients  with  absence  of  macular  oedema,  with  absence  of  intraretinal  fluid  or  with  absence  of subretinal  fluid.Both  studies  were  double-masked.  The  MAH  described  accordingly  in  the  study protocols procedures and roles (masked and unmasked) at the study site.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the Balaton study a total of 553 patients with BRVO were randomised 1:1 into the study: 276 to the faricimab Q4W arm and 277 to the aflibercept Q4W. The majority of patients completed the 24 weeks treatment period (i.e. 543 out of 553 subjects). 12 patients in total discontinued the study treatment prior to week 24 and the main reason for discontinuation was lost for follow up and due to an adverse event. One patient in the faricimab arm died prior to week 24.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The population of patients enrolled to in  Comino study was slightly bigger as compared to the Balaton study. The Comino study enrolled 729 patients with C/HRVO who were randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms: 366 to the faricimab Q4W arm and 363 to the aflibercept Q4W arm. Again, most patients (713 out of 729) completed the 24 weeks treatment period. 26 patients (3.6%) discontinued the study treatment prior to week 24. The main reason for discontinuation was withdrawal by the subject. 3 patients died while on the study.

The CHMP noted that the discontinuation rate was also small in Part 2 of the study (after week 24 through week 72). 60 (10.9%) and 78 (10.7%) patients discontinued the study treatment prior to Week 72 in the BALATON and COMINO study, respectively.

## Baseline characteristics

In  the BALATON  study ,  the  mean  age  of  enrolled  patients  was  64.1  years  (64.3  years  in  the faricimab Q4W arm and 63.8 years in the aflibercept Q4W arm). Slightly older patients were enrolled to the COMINO study , where the overall mean age at randomisation was 65.1 years (65.6 years in the faricimab Q4W arm and 64.7 years in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

The youngest age at enrolment across studies was 22, the oldest 100. Similar percentages of patients in both studies were male or female. The majority of patients were white and of Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

In  relation  to  age  and  gender,  the  study  populations  can  be  considered  as  representative  of  the general population of patients with RVO. The majority of patients in both studies were in the &gt; 65 years  of  age  category,  which  is  expected  as  the  prevalence  of  RVO  is  strongly  associated  with increasing age. RVO is rarely seen in individuals younger than 50, but it is occurring more frequently in the older age group.

The prevalence of this disease is known to not differ significantly between sexes, which is reflected in the study population. In relation to ethnicity, the CHMP noted that white and Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity  is  overrepresented  in  the  studies.  However,  as  clarified  by  the  MAH,  the  population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis has shown no effect of race on the pharmacokinetics (PK, ocular and systemic) of faricimab, and therefore no differences in the efficacy isexpected.

Both  studies  enrolled  patients  with  a  relatively  short  history  from  RVO  diagnosis  (i.e.  less  than  4 months as per the inclusion criteria). The mean time since diagnosis was 1.46 months in the BALATON study and 1.34 months in the COMINO study.

Both studies were aimed to enrol patients with BCVA of 73 to 19 letters at screening and with objective sign of macular oedema with central subfield thickness (CST) ≥325 μ m, as measured on Spectralis SDOCT.

In the BALATON study the mean baseline BCVA in all patients was 57.6 letters (range 19 to 76): 57.5 and 57.6 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively. Mean baseline CST in all patients  was  558.2  microns:  558.3  and  558.1  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arm, respectively.

The COMINO study,  enrolled a more severe populations with respect to the lower BCVA at enrolment, higher mean baseline CST. In this study the mean baseline BCVA in all patients was 50.5 letters (range 19 to 87): 50.3 and 50.7 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively. The mean baseline CST was 711.6 microns: 702.2 and 721.1 in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively.

Some patients (around 17% in the BALATON study and 10% in the COMINO study, respectively) had confirmed macular ischemic non-perfusion. The mean intraocular pressure was similar across studies (14 mmHg) but the maximum values reported were higher in the COMINO study (up to 26 mmHg).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The COMINO study enrolled patients with Central Retinal or Hemi-retinal Vein Occlusion. The majority of patients (82%) enrolled had CRVO.

## Primary endpoint results

In both pivotal studies the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24, as assessed on the ETDRS visual acuity chart at a starting test distance of 4 meters.

In  both  pivotal  studies  investigating  patients  with  branch  retinal  vein  occlusion  (Balaton  study)  and patients with central or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (COMINO study), the primary endpoint was met as the patients treated with faricimab Q4W had a non-inferior change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 compared  with  patients  treated  with  aflibercept  Q4W,  as  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  confidence interval for the adjusted mean difference between the faricimab and aflibercept arms was greater than -4 letters.

In the BALATON study, at Week 24, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.5 letters in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; the difference  was  -0.6  letters  (95%  CI:  -2.2,  1.1).  In  the  COMINO  study,  at  Week  24,  in  the  ITT population,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  BCVA  was  16.9  and  17.3  letters  in  the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; the difference was -0.4 letters (95% CI: -2.5, 1.6).

The  CHMP  noted  that,  in  the  primary  analysis  a  treatment  policy  strategy  was  applied  to  all intercurrent events and missing data were implicitly imputed by the MMRM model, assuming a missing at  random  mechanism.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  (which  used  multiple  imputation assuming MNAR, and were justified accordingly) supported the primary analysis results.

In  both  pivotal  studies,  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis  were  also  supported  by  supplementary analyses  performed  by  the  MAH,  such  as  the  analysis  based  on  the  PP  population,  analysis distinguishing COVID and non-COVID intercurrent events and analysis using hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events.

## Secondary endpoints

## Part 1

In  both  studies  there  were  a  number  of  secondary  endpoints  which  could  be  grouped  into  three categories. In the first category the effect on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was investigated; in the second category the MAH investigated anatomic outcome measures SD-OCT whereas in the third category patient-reported outcomes were looked at. Of note for the CHMP, secondary endpoints were not included in the multiplicity adjustment strategy.

In  relation  to  effect  on  additional  BCVA  outcomes  including  the  proportion  of  patients  gaining  or avoiding a loss of ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 letters in BCVA from baseline, patients achieving ≥ 84, 69 letters or ≤ 38 letters, all assessed at week 24, in both pivotal studies the results were comparable between the treatment groups.

The graph of change from baseline in visual acuity vs. time shows that, in both groups, visual acuity sharply improves by Month 4, and gradually continues to improve thereafter.

In the BALATON study, at Week 24, 56.1% and 60.4% of patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in the adjusted  proportion  of  patients  who  gained  at  least  15  letters  from  baseline  between  the  faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -4.3% (95% CI: -12.3%, 3.8%). In the COMINO study, at week 24, 56.6% and 58.1% of patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from  baseline  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  The  difference  in  the adjusted  proportion  of  patients  who  gained  at  least  15  letters  from  baseline  between  the  faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -1.5% (95% CI: -8.4%, 5.3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also, a similar proportion of patients treated with faricimab Q4W avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters from baseline at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W. In the BALATON study, at Week 24, 99.6% and 98.6% of patients avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. In the COMINO study, at Week 24, 96.2% and 96.7% of patients  avoided  a  loss  of  ≥  15  letters  in  BCVA  from  baseline  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

In relation to the effect on anatomic outcome measures macular oedema was reduced significantly in both  treatment  groups,  which  was  also  reflected  by  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with absence of macular oedema or absence of intraretinal subretinal fluid. Of note, at baseline macular oedema was more significant in patients with central or hemi-retinal vein occlusion, or in those with branch  retinal  vein  occlusion  and  improvements  seen  in  patients  with  central  or  hemi-retinal  vein occlusion were higher.

In the BALATON study At Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -311.4 μ m and  -304.4  μ m  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  The  difference  in adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  CST  between  the  faricimab  Q4W  when  compared  to  the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -7.0 μm (95% CI: -14.1, 0).

In the COMINO study, at Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -461.6 μ m and -448.8 μ m in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in the adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  CST  between  the  faricimab  Q4W  when  compared  to  the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -12.8 μm (95% CI: -26.7, 1.0).

In relation to the patients' reported outcomes, in both studies patients treated with faricimab Q4W had comparable  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  NEI  VFQ-25  composite  score  at  Week  24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W.

## Part 2

The comparative data are available for 24 weeks. In Part 2 of the study, patients in both Arm A and Arm B in Part 1 were receiving 6 mg faricimab intravitreal injections administered according to a PTI dosing regimen in intervals between Q4W and Q16W. Based on the visual and/or anatomical changes the best treatment interval was determined.

As indicated by the MAH, the majority of patients in Part 2 of the studies were treated using Q12W or Q16W dosing  interval.  Between  Week  24  and  Week  68,  81.5%  and  74.0%  of  patients  achieved  a faricimab  Q12W  or  Q16W  dosing  interval  in  BALATON  and  COMINO  studies,  respectively.  The proportion of patients who only received Q4W dosing through Week 68 in BALATON and COMINO was low (1.2% and 2.5%, respectively;

## The CHMP noted that, despite the lower frequency of the treatment in Part 2 of the study, the efficacy was maintained.

In  the  BALATON  study,  at  Week  64/68/72,  in  the  ITT  population,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from baseline in BCVA was 18.1 and 18.8 letters in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively. In the COMINO study, at Week 64/68/72, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.1 letters in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

The proportion of patients who gained ≥15 letters in BCVA score from baseline at Week 64/68/72 was 61.5% and 65.8% in the BALATON study and 57.6% and 59.5% in the COMINO study in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

The proportion  of  patients  who  avoided  a  loss  of  ≥15  letters  in  BCVA  score  from  baseline  at  Week 64/68/72 was 98.9% and 98.2% in the BALATON study and 93.7% and 95.6% in the COMINO study in the faricimab Q4W  to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Taking into consideration the efficacy data reported in Part 2 of the studies, the PTI treatment regimen is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## Subgroup analysis

In  the  BALATON  study  there  was  no  major  differences  in  treatment  effects  according  to  subgroups investigated,  although  wider  confidence  intervals  were  seen  in  subgroups  with  smaller  number  of participants.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  number  of  patients  included  in  'Other'  race  category  was particularly small.

The lower treatment effect was seen in patients with HRVO as compared to those with CRVO. However, there is no physiological plausibility for a different response to faricimab treatment between patients with CRVO and HRVO and therefore the CHMP agreed this could be a chance finding.

The  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  the  efficacy  results  in  patients  with  ischemic  non-perfusion  and compare the results  between  the  treatment  groups.  It  was  clarified  that  only  approximately  3/4  of patients across the two studies had standard fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) imaging used to evaluate  peripheral  nonperfusion.  Secondary,  only  48%  of  the  acquired  standard  FFA  images  were gradable  for  the  presence  of  ischemic  disease  by  the  reading  center  in  the  BALATON  and  COMINO studies.  Therefore,  a  conclusion  on  the  efficacy  in  patients  with  ischemic  non-perfusion  RVO  as determined by FFA imaging can't be made.

Instead, the MAH presented the efficacy results in the group of patients with the most severe visual impairment i.e.  20/200 (38 letters or worse) as these patients are more likely to have ischemic RVO. The additional analysis conducted in this group showed comparable BCVA gains in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms at Week 24.

## Immunogenicity

The incidence of immunogenicity to faricimab is based on patients with treatment emergent-ADAs in both BALATON (18/259 patients; 6.9%) and COMINO (30/338 patients; 8.9%) was low. The median onset time of ADA response was 24 weeks. Based on all available data to date, no meaningful impact of ADA was observed on efficacy.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In summary, from an efficacy perspective, the CHMP concluded that this EoI is approvable.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Vabysmo was first authorised in the US on 28 January 2022 and in the EU on 15 September 2022. At the time of filing submission Vabysmo had been  approved in a total of 53 countries for the treatment of patients with DME and nAMD. In Europe, Vabysmo was authorised for the treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular oedema (DME) on 15 September 2022, based  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  results  of  four  Phase  III  pivotal  trials  -  TENAYA  (GR40306)  and LUCERNE  (GR40844)  for nAMD  and  YOSEMITE  (GR40349)  and  RHINE  (GR40398)  for  DME, respectively.

## Summary of known safety profile

The  most frequently reported  adverse  reactions  were  cataract  (13%),  conjunctival  haemorrhage (8%),  vitreous  detachment  (5%),  IOP  increased  (4%),  vitreous  floaters  (4%),  eye  pain  (3%)  and retinal pigment epithelial tear (nAMD only) (3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most serious  adverse  reactions were uveitis (0.6%), endophthalmitis (0.5%), vitritis (0.3%), retinal tear (0.2%), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (0.1%) and traumatic cataract (&lt; 0.1%) (see section 4.4).

From  the  known  safety  profile  from  the  currently  approved  faricimab  indications,  the  important identified  risks  in  faricimab  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  include infectious  endophthalmitis and intraocular  inflammation. Important  potential  risks  are arterial  thromboembolic  events and Central Nervous System haemorrhagic events . In the Periodic Safety Update Single Assessments (PSUSA)  for  faricimab  (solution  for  intravitreal  injection)  PSURs  covering  the  period  from  28 th   July 2022  to  27 th   January  2023  the  most  common  adverse  events  reported  were  from  the  Soc  Eye disorders, which is already known and adequately addressed in the SmPC. A safety signal of Retinal Arterial  Occlusive  Event  was  closed  during  the  reporting  period  without  CDS  change,  which  is endorsed.

Also in the PSUSA covering the period from 28 th  January 2023 to 27 th  July 2023 the most common adverse events reported were from the SOC Eye disorders. During the late-breaking interval of this PSUR, the MAH validated a signal for retinal vasculitis and was requested to discuss it in the next PSUR (covering  the  period  from  28 th   July  2023  to  27 th   January  2024),  under  assessment  at  the  time  of authoring this CHMP AR (PRAC recommendation: 5 September 2024).As of 27 th  July 2023, the total estimated cumulative patient exposure to faricimab from clinical trials (5,150 patients) and marketing experience (249,956 patients) is 255,106 patients.

## RVO indication

RVO is one of the most common retinal vascular disorders and its prevalence is strongly associated with increasing age. Additional risk factors are hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, high BMI, cardiovascular disease and cigarette smoking. RVO is associated with varying degrees of visual loss, depending on the location of the obstruction, which determines the three main subtypes of BRVO (branch retinal vein occlusion), HRVO (hemiretinal vein occlusion) and CRVO (central retinal vein occlusion).

RVO  has  been  reported  as  the  second  leading  cause  of  blindness  in  patients  with  retinal  vascular disease,  following  diabetic  retinopathy.  Macular  oedema  is  a  frequent  cause  of  visual  acuity  loss  in RVO,  but  vision  loss  can  also  occur  from  macular  ischemia  and/or  complications  of  retinal  or  iris neovascularisation.  If  left  untreated,  RVO-induced  chronic  macular  oedema  can  lead  to  permanent vision loss .

Safety in  this  application  was  assessed  through  descriptive  summaries  of  ocular  and  non-ocular adverse events, including SAEs and adverse events of special interest, deaths, and ocular assessments (IOP, slit lamp examination, and indirect ophthalmoscopy). Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and clinically significant vital sign abnormalities were reported as AEs and evaluated as part of the AE assessments.

The following Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQs) are used to present unadjudicated non-ocular ATEs and cerebrovascular haemorrhagic AEs:

· Unadjudicated ATEs include non-ocular events from the following narrow SMQ: Myocardial infarction; Ischaemic  central  nervous  system  vascular  conditions;  Other  ischaemic  heart  disease;  Embolic  and thrombotic events, arterial.

·  Cerebrovascular  haemorrhagic  events  include  non-ocular  events  from  the  following  narrow  SMQs: Conditions  associated  with  central  nervous  system  haemorrhages  and  cerebrovascular  accidents; Haemorrhagic central nervous system vascular conditions.

The  safety  analyses  are  based  on  the  safety-evaluable  population.  The  AE  data  in  this  initial submission are presented before the Week 24 visit whereas the summaries by visit including labs, vital signs,  and  other  ocular  assessments  (IOP,  slitlamp  examination,  and  indirect  ophthalmoscopy)  are presented through Week 24.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  safety  profile  of  faricimab  in  patients  with  RVO,  is  based  on  data  from  the  two  pivotal,  nearly identically  designed  Phase  III  studies,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-masked,  2-part  studies  in patients with RVO, as also detailed in the efficacy section of this AR:

- Study  GR41984  (BALATON) in  patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to branch retinal  vein occlusion (BRVO).
- Study  GR41986  (COMINO) in  patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to central retinal  vein occlusion or hemiretinal vein occlusion (C/HRVO).

As  summarised  in  Table  40  below,  this  safety  analysis  from  the  two  individual  studies  and  pooled Phase III safety data (BALATON and COMINO), is presented  by:

- Data through the day before the Week 24 visit,
- Data from Week 24 through the clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 6 July 2022 for BALATON and 9 August 2022 for COMINO. These data are from Part 2 of the RVO studies, which are evaluating a 6 mg faricimab PTI dosing regimen for all patients in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms from Part 1.

In Part 1 (Q4W dosing) of the studies, 570 and 750 patients (in BALATON and COMINO, respectively) were  planned  to  be  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  one  of  two  treatment  arms  ( faricimab  6mg or aflibercept 2mg) as follows:

- Faricimab Q4W arm (n = 285 [BALATON]; n=375 [COMINO]): Patients randomly assigned to Arm A received faricimab 6 mg intravitreal injections Q4W from Day 1 through Week 20 (6 injections).
- Aflibercep t  Q4W  arm  (comparator  arm,  n=  285  [BALATON];  n=375  [COMINO]):  patients randomly  assigned  to  Arm  B  received  aflibercept  2  mg  intravitreal  injections  Q4W  from  Day  1 through Week 20 (6 injections).

In Part 2 , patients received faricimab 6mg according to a personalised treatment interval (PTI) dosing schedule from Week 24 and had scheduled study visits Q4W through the end of the study (Week 72).

All patients should complete scheduled study visits Q4W for the entire study duration (72 weeks). To preserve  the  masking  of  faricimab  treatment  intervals  for  Week  24  through  Week  68,  a  sham procedure is administered during study visits when (according to the PTI dosing regimen) no faricimab treatment is administered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary analysis for BALATON and COMINO at Week 24 had been completed at the time of the initial submission for this EoI, and all safety data up to the clinical cutoff date (CCOD) based on the last  patient  last  visit  (LPLV)  date  for  Week  24  for  each  study  were  reported  herein.  Patients randomized during the global enrolment phase of the studies are included.

At the time of the primary analysis, the Phase III RVO trials were ongoing. Safety data available from Week 24 to the CCOD was also assessed (i.e. the subset of patients with follow-up data beyond Week 24  up  to  the  CCOD  for  the  primary  analysis  (6  July  2022  for  BALATON  and  9  August  2022  for COMINO).

Updated safety data were also submitted to include the full safety data set with the MAH's responses to  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  (RSI)  and  are  discussed  under  the  relevant  sections below.

In  summary,  the  safety  of  faricimab  was  assessed  in  the  two  randomised,  multi-centre,  doublemasked,  72-week  long  studies  in  patients  with  macular  oedema  secondary  to  BRVO  (BALATON)  or CRVO/HRVO (COMINO). Active comparator-controlled data are available through month 6, then as per the study design, in Part 2, all patients at Week 24 received either intravitreal faricimab 6 mg or sham treatment based on the T&amp;E type regimen.

After 6 initial monthly doses, patients initially randomized to the aflibercept 2 mg arm were switched to the faricimab Q16W adjustable dosing arm, and could have received faricimab 6 mg according to a standardized  treat-and-extend  approach,  where  the  dosing  interval  could  be  increased  in  4-week increments or decreased by 4, 8 or 12-weeks based on anatomic and/or visual outcomes, using data obtained only at study drug dosing visits.

## Study Populations

BALATON enrolled  patients  with  macular  oedema  due  to  BRVO,  whereas  COMINO  enrolled  patients with  macular  oedema due to CRVO or HRVO. In both BALATON and COMINO studies, patients with BRVO or C/HRVO, respectively, had to be diagnosed no longer than 4 months prior to the screening visit  and  confirmed  by  the  central  reading  centre  based  on  spectral-domain  optical  coherence tomography (SD-OCT) or swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) images.

## Pooling and Safety Data Presentation

Safety  data  from  BALATON  and  COMINO  were  pooled  for  the  assessment  of  safety  as  both  studies have a nearly identical study design, the same treatment regimens, same collection of safety data and no  substantial  difference  in  the  overall  safety  profile  of  faricimab  was  expected  in  the  BRVO  and C/HRVO populations.

The  analysis  of  pooled  data  up  to  Week  24  was  based  on  the  pooled  safety-evaluable  population (defined as all patients in either of the Phase III studies who received at least one injection of active study  drug  [faricimab  or  aflibercept],  grouped  according  to  the  actual  treatment  received  through Week  20)  using  the  same  analysis  methodology  as  described  in  the  individual  studies  SAP.  The analysis  of  pooled  data  from  Week  24  to  CCOD  was  based  on  the  pooled  Part  2  safety-evaluable population, defined as all patients from either of the Phase III studies who have follow-up on or after the day of the Week 24 treatment (faricimab or sham) or Week 24 dose hold (or day 168 if neither treatment  nor  dose  hold  date  are  available),  for  patients  who  received  faricimab  in  Part  1  of  the studies receive at least one dose of faricimab, for patients who received aflibercept in Part 1 of the studies. For these analyses, patients are grouped according to the actual treatment received in Part 1 of the studies.

The safety data submitted with the responses to the RSI are presented by 3 groups:

- The 'pooled Part 2 dataset' (from Week 24 through the end of the studies, when all patients were on faricimab; BALATON and COMINO pooled),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The 'Entire Study' group by treatment arms (from baseline through the end of the studies; BALATON and COMINO pooled), and
- The 'All Faricimab' group (from receiving the first administration of faricimab through the end of the studies; BALATON and COMINO pooled).

## Overall extent of exposure

Overall,  treatment  exposure  in  all  treatment  arms  was  balanced  between  the  individual  Phase  III studies. The majority of the randomised patients received at least one dose of study treatment in each treatment arm of the pooled dataset before the Week 24 visit. The median duration of exposure was the  same  between  both  treatment  arms  (20.1  weeks)  in  the  individual  studies  and  pooled  dataset (Table 41 below). In the pooled dataset the mean and median number of study drug administrations was the same in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms (mean= 5.8, median= 6.0).

Percentages are based on N in the column headings. Includes treatment received on or prior to Week 24 treatment or dose hold or if none prior to Day 168. Patients with muitiple acministrations of the same drug are counted once.Patients with multiple acministrations of different drugs are counted once for each drug. *Anti-VEGF treatments prior to baseline are excludled.

VEGF =Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor.

At the time of the primary analysis, the Phase III trials were ongoing. Therefore, cumulative exposure data  available  as  of  the  CCOD  was  also  assessed  (i.e.,  the  subset  of  patients  with  follow-up  data beyond Week 24). From Week 24, an additional 16.1 weeks (median) of treatment duration for 615 patients (out of 629 patients) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 12.3 weeks (median) of treatment duration for 586 patients (out of 586 patients) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm were observed up to the CCOD.

From Week 24 to the CCOD, the additional mean number of study drug administrations were 2.6 in the faricimab Q4W faricimab PTI arm and 2.5 in the aflibercept Q4W faricimab PTI arm, and the median number of study drug administrations was 2.0 in both arms. From Week 24 to the CCOD, 1.9% and 1.0% of patients received at least one anti-VEGF administration in the fellow eye in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively, with the most common anti-VEGFs being aflibercept and ranibizumab.

The updated safety discussion in  this  AR  is  mainly  focused  on  the  pooled  Part  2  dataset  (Week  24 through Week 72).

## Extent of Exposure

The majority of randomized patients received at least one dose of study treatment (i.e., faricimab or aflibercept)  during  the  entire  study  and  most  patients  continued  the  study  to  receive  faricimab adjustable T&amp;E type regimen in Part 2.

## Pooled Part 2 Dataset

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the median duration of exposure to faricimab was longer in the faricimab Q4W to  faricimab  PTI  arm  than  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  ( 44.1 weeks and 40.1 weeks in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms, respectively;) because the exposure is counted from Week 24 for the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in contrast to the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm where the exposure is counted from the first faricimab dose on or after Week 24. While the faricimab PTI dosing regimen started at Week 24, most  patients  received  sham  injections  and  not  faricimab  at  Week  24  with  7%  [19/270]  and  11% [39/359] of patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arms and 9% [24/267] and 12% [40/342] of patients in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms receiving a faricimab dose in the BALATON and COMINO studies, respectively.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the mean (median) number of faricimab administrations was similar in the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  (5.3  [4.0]  and  5.2 [4.0],  respectively).  In  the  separate  studies,  the  mean  (median)  number  of  faricimab  injections administered in Part 2 was generally comparable: BALATON: 4.8 (4.0) and 4.9 (4.0) vs. COMINO: 5.6 (5.0) and 5.5 (4.0) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI

arm, respectively. In the pooled Part 2 dataset, 1,238 patients received at least one dose of faricimab (629 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 609 patients in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

## Entire Study

In the entire study dataset, the median duration of exposure was 68.1 weeks in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms (and the same duration in each study); the mean (median) number of study treatment administrations (i.e., faricimab or aflibercept) in the pooled dataset was the same in each treatment arm (10.8 [10.0]; the mean (median) number of study treatment administrations was comparable between the BALATON and COMINO studies: 10.3 (9.0) and 11.2 (10.0) vs. 10.6 (10.0) and 10.9 (10.0) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively .

## All Faricimab

In  the  All  Faricimab  dataset,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  faricimab  was  44.1 weeks  (same duration in each study); the mean (median) number of faricimab administrations in the pooled dataset was 8.1 (9.0) and was comparable between the studies (7.7 [9.0] in BALATON and 8.4 [9.0] in COMINO.

The CHMP noted an integrated safety analysis based on pooling of the week 24 data from the two phase III,  clinical  studies  BALATON  and  COMINO  and  considered  this  approach  as  acceptable:  both studies are very similar with almost identical study design and  include the same treatment regimens and collection of safety data.

Further  limited  data  beyond  week  24  until  the  CCOD  in  Part  2  of  both  studies  was  also  initially provided.

The overall extent of exposure to faricimab and the comparator aflibercept to week 24 was balanced across both phase III studies.

As previously highlighted, both clinical studies were ongoing at the time of initial submission of this application, therefore the full safety data set was subsequently submitted during the procedure with the responses to the RSI.  Throughout the study period, exposure across treatment arms was similar in both BALATON and COMINO studies.

A total of 1,282 patients (553 in BALATON and 729 in COMINO) were enrolled in the two studies, with 1,276 patients treated with at least one dose through week 24 (641 with faricimab). Patient ages ranged from 28 to 93 with a mean [SD] of 64 [10.7] years, and 22 to 100 with a mean [SD] of 65 [13.2] years in BALATON and COMINO, respectively.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, 1,238 patients received at least one dose of faricimab (629 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 609 patients in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the mean (median) number of faricimab administrations was similar in the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  (5.3  [4.0]  and  5.2 [4.0],  respectively).  In  the  separate  studies,  the  mean  (median)  number  of  faricimab  injections administered in Part 2 was generally comparable: BALATON: 4.8 (4.0) and 4.9 (4.0) vs. COMINO: 5.6 (5.0) and 5.5 (4.0) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively.

While focus is on the pooled Part 2 dataset (Week 24 through Week 72), of note the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in the Entire Study group has the longest, continuous faricimab treatment duration of  any  of  the  safety  groups  and  therefore  it  is  reasonable  that  this  data  be  used  to  support  the consistency of safety profile in RVO with that in the DME (100 Weeks) and nAMD (112 Weeks), using exposure-adjusted AE rates from the faricimab arms in the other Phase III trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Entire Study dataset, the median duration of exposure was 68.1 weeks in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms (and the same duration in each study).

In the All  Faricimab dataset, the median duration of exposure to faricimab was 44.1 weeks (same duration in each study).

## Demographics

In the pooled dataset, the overall mean age at randomization was 64.7 years with approximately half of  the  patients  (53.4%)  in  the ≥ 65-year  age  category,  and  3.6%  in  the ≥ 85-year  age  category. Approximately half of patients were female (48.0%) and from the 'Rest of the world countries' (49.2%; mostly consisting of European and South American countries). The majority of the patients were White (65.5%), and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (79.3%).

The CHMP also noted that, for both phase III studies, the baseline demographic characteristics were broadly similar across both treatment arms in the pooled populations. However, limited numbers of patients &gt; 85 years were included in both RVO studies. Safety in this population, particularly, in the RVO indication, is of interest due to limitations of (safety) data, reflected accordingly in SmPC (section 4.2, under 'Special populations', Section 4.4 under 'Systemic effects' and 'Populations with limited data'', and PL section 2 - 'What you need to know before you receive Vabysmo') also in relation to nAMD, as also outlined below.

## Populations with limited data

The  MAH  highlighed  that  there  is  only  limited  experience  in  the  treatment  of  nAMD  patients  ≥  85 years,  DME  patients  with  type  I  diabetes,  patients  with  HbA1c  over  10%,  patients  with  high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR), high blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mmHg) and vascular disease, sustained dosing intervals shorter than every 8 weeks (Q8W), or nAMD, DME, and RVO patients with active  systemic  infections.  Furthermore,  there  is  limited  safety  information  on  sustained  dosing intervals  of  8  weeks  or  less  and  these  may  be  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  ocular  and  systemic adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions. There is also no experience of treatment with faricimab  in  diabetic  or  RVO  patients  with  uncontrolled  hypertension.  As  mentioned  in  the  SmPC (section 4.4), this lack of information should be considered accordingly by the physician when treating such patients.

## Baseline Ocular Characteristics

In the ITT population, mean baseline BCVA and mean baseline CST in the study eye were comparable between faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms in both BALATON and COMINO studies. As expected from the RVO phenotype, patients in the BALATON study had a higher baseline BCVA and lower CST values compared to patients in the COMINO study. Mean (SD) time since diagnosis RVO in the study eye was 1.39 (4.92) months, while the median (min-max) was 0.84 months (0.1-120.6).

## Baseline Non-ocular Characteristics

In  the  pooled  ITT  population,  non-ocular  baseline  characteristics  were  comparable  across  the  two treatment arms, with no significant differences observed between the individual study populations.

The safety data in Part  1 indicates  that  faricimab  has  a  comparable  safety  profile  to  aflibercept  at Week 24. The safety data in Part 2 indicate that faricimab continues to be generally well tolerated.

As noted in the RVO initial clinical overview (CO), a slightly higher incidence of ocular AEs (including ocular  SAEs)  in  both  treatment  arms  continued  to  be  reported  in  Part  2  in  COMINO  (C/HRVO) compared with BALATON (BRVO) which is consistent with historical RVO pivotal trials.

Key pooled safety results (BALATON and COMINO, n = 1,238 patients) from Part  2 are  presented in the table below.

## Adverse events-pooled phase III RVO studies

## Before the Week 24 Visit

In the pooled RVO safety data, the incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye was comparable across the treatment arms (20.1% and 24.6% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively).

The  most  common  ocular  AEs  in  the  study  eye  ( ≥ 2%  incidence  in  either  pooled  treatment  arm: faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arm,  respectively)  by  PT  were  conjunctival  haemorrhage (2.8% and 3.8%), intraocular pressure increased (1.4% and 3.1%), vitreous detachment (2.3% and 1.7%), and dry eye (1.6% and 2.4%).

Ocular  AEs in  the  study  eye  occurring  in ≥ 1% in any treatment arm are summarized in Table  45 below.

There were no clinically meaningful differences in incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye across the treatment arms. Where minor numerical differences in the incidence of ocular AEs were noted in the faricimab  Q4W  arm  between  the  BALATON  and  COMINO,  the  type  and  nature  of  the  events  were similar (for example, vitreous detachment, IOP increased, ocular hypertension).

The per 1000 injection rate of ocular AEs in the study eye was 51.23 and 61.24 events per 1000 injections in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

The overall exposure-adjusted incidence rates for ocular AEs per 100 patient years (PY) in the study eye were 63.60 and 76.31, in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms respectively.

In the BALATON study through Week 24 the incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye was comparable between  the  treatment  arms  (16.3%  and  20.4%  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively)  The  most  common  ocular  AEs  ( ≥ 2%  in  any  treatment  arm)  were  conjunctival haemorrhage, dry eye, vitreous floaters and IOP increased. The incidence of ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to the study treatment was low (1 patient [0.4%] and 2 patients [0.7%] in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The per 1000 injection rate of ocular AEs in  the  study  eye  was  37.08  and  50.66  events  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively. The rate of ocular AEs per 100 patient years was 46.15 and 63.92 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The majority of ocular events in the study eye were mild 4 patients (1.4%) and 8 patients (2.9%) experienced events of moderate severity in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.  No patients experienced severe events in the faricimab Q4W arm, and 1 patient experienced a severe event of vitreous haemorrhage in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

In  the COMINO study,  the  incidence  of  ocular  AEs  in  the  study  eye  was  comparable  between  the treatment arms (23.0% and 27.7% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively). The  most  common  ocular  AEs  (&gt;  2%  in  any  treatment  arm)  were  conjunctival  haemorrhage,  IOP increased and vitreous detachment.

The incidence of ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to the study treatment was low and numerically higher in the faricimab Q4W arm compared with the aflibercept Q4W arm (14 patients [3.8%]  and  8  patients  [2.2%]  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively).  The overall most common ocular AE related to study treatment was IOP increased (1 patient [0.3%] and 4 patients [1.1%] in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively). In the faricimab Q4W arm, the most frequent related AE was vitritis (3 patients [0.8%], all events were non-serious and mild in severity), which were linked to a small number of IOI events).

The  per  1000  injection  rate  of  ocular  AEs  in  the  study  eye  was  comparable  across  treatment  arms (61.96 and 69.45 events in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively).

The rate of ocular AEs per 100 patient years was comparable between the treatment arms (76.78 and 85.72 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

## Ocular Adverse Events Related to Treatment:  before the week 24 visit Ocular AEs Suspected by the Investigator to be Related to Faricimab

The incidence of ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to faricimab was low (2.3% in the faricimab Q4W arm). There were more ocular AEs that were suspected by the investigator to be related to faricimab occurring in COMINO (1 patient in BALATON vs. 14 patients in COMINO).

In the faricimab Q4W arm, the most common (&gt;2 patients) ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be  related  to  study  treatment  in  the  study  eye  were vitritis (3  patients  [0.5%])  and intraocular pressure increased, cataract, uveitis, and vitreous floaters (2 patients [0.3%] each).

## Ocular AEs Suspected by the Investigator to be Related to Aflibercept

The incidence of ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to aflibercept was low (1.6% in the aflibercept Q4W arm). There were more ocular AEs that were suspected by the investigator to be related to aflibercept occurring in COMINO (2 patients in BALATON vs. 8 patients in COMINO. In the aflibercept Q4W arm, the most common (&gt;2 patients) ocular AE suspected by the investigator to be related  to  study  treatment  in  the  study  eye  was intraocular  pressure  increased (4  patients [0.6%]).

## Part 2: Week 24 through CCOD

At the time of the primary analysis, the Phase III RVO trials were ongoing. Safety data available from Week 24 to  the  CCOD  were  also  assessed  (i.e.,  the  subset  of  patients  with  follow-up  data  beyond Week 24 up to the CCOD for the primary analysis).

As per the RVO study designs, all patients at Week 24 received either intravitreal faricimab 6 mg or sham treatment based on the PTI dosing regimen. Therefore, safety data from Week 24 through CCOD are discussed for patients in the faricimab Q4W arm, and patients in the aflibercept Q4W arm in Part 1 of the studies who switched to faricimab PTI in Part 2.

For  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  (i.e.,  patients  switching  from  aflibercept  to  faricimab after Week 20), AEs are listed from the first faricimab dose on or after Week 24 to CCOD.

For the patients who received aflibercept 2 mg Q4W in Part 1, any ocular events occurring after Week 24 and prior to receiving the first faricimab injection are listed. Most ocular AEs that occurred in this period were non-serious and mild to moderate.

In Part 2, 20.7% of patients and 17.1% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively. In  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm,  the  types  of  ocular  adverse  events  were  generally consistent with the events seen in the aflibercept Q4W arm before the Week 24 visit.

Similarly, the types of events observed in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm from Week 24 to the CCOD were consistent with those in the faricimab Q4W arm before the Week 24 visit.

The most common ocular AEs in  the  study  eye  (&gt; 2% incidence in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively,) by PT were macular oedema (2.2% and 2.6%) and intraocular pressure increased (2.1% and 1.9%).

The incidence of ocular AEs in both arms from Week 24 to CCOD was consistent with the incidence of ocular AEs before Week 24. The incidence of ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to faricimab in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm remained low (9 patients [1.4%] ) . The most common (2 patients) ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment in the study eye were intraocular  pressure  increased and epiretinal  membrane (2 patients each).The incidence of  ocular  AEs  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  faricimab  in the  aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm remained low (9 patients [1.5%] ).The most common (2 patients) ocular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment in the study eye were intraocular pressure increased (3 patients) and vitreous floaters (2 patients).

The number of ocular AEs per 1000 injections in the study eye was 120.61 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 108.00 in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. However, the number of injections from Week 24 is lower as patients are receiving sham in Part 2, resulting in a higher rate per 1000 injections from Week 24 to CCOD. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of ocular AEs per 100 PY were  comparable  between  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to faricimab PTI arm ( 75.49 and 82.85, respectively).

## Ocular AEs Pooled Part 2 dataset

The most common ocular AEs by PT occurring in the study eye ( ≥ 2% in any treatment arm of the pooled Part 2 dataset: faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively)  were intraocular  pressure (IOP)  increased  (4.8%  and  3.8%), cataract (3.7%  and 4.1%), macular  oedema (MO;  3.2%  and  3.1%;  majority  reported  as  verbatim  worsening), conjunctival haemorrhage (3.3% and 2.8%), RVO (3.2% and 2.6%; majority reported as verbatim worsening of RVO), vitreous detachment (2.1% and 3.8%), cystoid macular oedema (CMO; 3.3% and  2%;  majority  reported  as  verbatim  worsening), epiretinal  membrane (1%  and  3%),  and vitreous floaters (0.2% and 2.6%). The majority of the events of MO, CMO, and RVO were reported as verbatim worsening of disease. These were mostly reported as non-serious and resolved by the end of  the  study.  The  total  incidence  of worsening  of  disease in  the pooled  Part  2 dataset  was approximately 10% (approximately 3% for MO, CMO and RVO each.

The majority of the reported epiretinal membrane (ERM) events were reported as non-serious and mild in severity. The presence of RVO is a risk factor for the formation of epiretinal membrane. The overall rates of epiretinal membrane events were low, with the majority reported as non -serious and mild  in  severity.  Epiretinal  membrane  prevalence  increases  in  the  presence  of  RVO,  with  the  Blue Mountains Eye Study finding a prevalence rate of 16.1% in those with RVO, compared with 6.2% in idiopathic cases (Mitchell et al. 1997). The MAH was therefore requested to discuss this topic further and consider the need to reflect information relating to this issue in the PI.

In it's response, the MAH acknowledged that the incidence of ERM events was higher in the Phase III RVO  studies  than  what  previously  reported  from  DME  and  nAMD  Phase  III  trials.  However,  in  the absence of any evidence of a causal association between faricimab and ERM events, updates to SmPC (i.e. section 4.4 and 4.8) for the RVO indication were not considered warranted. Evidence supporting this view is summarised below.

Of note, unlike the Phase III DME trials, the presence of ERM at baseline was not an exclusion criteria for the RVO trials.

ERMs are commonly found in older people and can be associated with ocular pathology, although most cases  occur  in  the  absence  of  ocular  disease  and  are  considered  idiopathic  (Kanukollu  and  Agarwal 2023). However, ERMs can also be associated with diabetic eye disease and RVO, where there is an upregulation  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  resulting  in  a  proliferation  of  fibrocellular  tissue  on  the retinal surface leading to ERM formation (Romano et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2020).

The  Blue  Mountains  Eye  Study  showed  that  a  higher  prevalence  of  ERM  was  observed  among individuals  with  RVO  (16.1%)  compared  to  those  with  no  ocular  disease  (6.2%  idiopathic  cases; Mitchell et al. 1997). Furthermore, ERM prevalence was also higher in those who had cataract surgery (16.8%) followed by diabetic retinopathy (11%). Overall, the prevalence  of  ERMs  vary  widely,  with reports ranging from 2.2% to 18.5% (Ng et al. 2011).

Individuals with ERM  are  generally asymptomatic, and treatment (which involves a surgical intervention of peeling the ERM away from the overlying retina) is only required if there is progression

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resulting  in  a  significant  distortion  of  vision.  In  the  Blue  Mountains  Eye  Study,  progression  of  ERM occurred in ~29% of individuals (Fraser-Bell et al. 2003).

As above stated, and also summarised in the Week 72 Addendum to the CO, the overall rates of ERM events reported from the RVO Phase III studies were low with the majority reported as non-serious, mild in severity, and all having confounding factors related to underlying disease, concurrent events, or ocular procedures.

There was one event in the faricimab arm in the COMINO study reported as severe and that required surgical intervention. However, this case was confounded by the fact that the patient had a prior event of intraocular inflammation (uveitis) and worsening of macular oedema, which would have increased the risk of ERM development.

In summary, in the MAH's view, ERM formation and progression is known to be associated with the underlying RVO disease. On review of all applicable data, the MAH considered that an update to the EU SmPC to include information on epiretinal membrane events in patients treated with faricimab in the RVO indication was not warranted.

The  MAH  considers  that  an  update  to  the  EU  SmPC  to  include  information  on  epiretinal  membrane events  in  patients  treated  with  faricimab  in  the  RVO  indication  is  not  warranted  given  the  lack  of evidence of any causal association with the occurrence of ERM events and treatment with faricimab. The CHMP accepted the MAH's conclusion. However, ERM events  should  continue  to  be  closely monitored and presented in future PSURs.

All  the vitreous  floaters events  were  reported  as  non-serious,  and  most  were  considered  mild  in severity. The rate of vitreous floaters per 100 patient years (PY) in the pooled Part 2 dataset of the faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms,  respectively,  was consistent with that in Part 1.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of ocular  AEs  per  100  PY  was  consistent  with  Part 1  for  both arms  ( 65.23 and 71.53 in  the  pooled  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to faricimab  PTI  arms  in  Part  2,  respectively,  63.60  and  76.31  in  the  pooled  faricimab  and  aflibercept arms in Part 1, respectively.

In the Entire Study dataset, the incidence of ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm representing  the  longer-term  safety  data  for  faricimab  was  43.2%.  The  majority  of  RVO  disease worsening  events  (i.e.,  worsening  of  RVO,  MO  and  CMO)  were  reported  as  non-serious,  mild,  and resolved by the end of the study.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of ocular AEs per 100 PY in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 65.96. This rate was consistent with the other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 56.88 and nAMD: 68.90; DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS, nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS).

The rates of ocular AEs per 1000 injections in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 82.18. This rate was consistent with the other pooled faricimab treatment arms in the Phase III studies (DME: 81.68 and  nAMD: 131.73; DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS). The ADRs that were reported with a frequency of ≥ 1%  in  the  BRVO  and  C/HRVO  in  the  All  Faricimab  group  at Week 72 were conjunctival hemorrhage, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, eye pain, and IOP increased .

MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Investigator text for AEs encoded using MedDRA version 24.1 for nAMD, MedDRA version 24.0 for DME and MedDRA version 26.0 for RVO(BRVO and C/HRVO). Percentages are based on N in the column headings.

For frequency counts by preferred term, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted only once. For frequency counts of \"Total number of events\" rows, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted separately.

Includes AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first faricimab dose through end of study. nAMD pools GR40306 and GR40844; DME pools GR40349 and GR40398; BRVO GR41984; C/HRVO GR41986; POOLED(nAMD, DME, BRVO, C/HRVO) pools all six studies.

The most common pooled serious ADRs in the RVO indications ( ≥ 2 patients) by PT were uveitis (3 patients  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  for  C/HRVO), cataract (1  patient  each  in  the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm for BRVO and C/HRVO, respectively), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1 patient  each  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  for  BRVO  and  C/HRVO, respectively), and vitreous haemorrhage (2 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm for C/HRVO). The majority  of  the  serious  ADRs  resolved,  resolved  with  sequelae,  or  were  resolving  by Week 72 for BRVO and C/HRVO events, with the exception of cataract and vitritis ).

Cataract was a sight-threatening ADR that caused a decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score lasting more than  1  hour  in ≥ 2  patients  in  the  All  Faricimab  group;  no  sight-threatening  ADRs  that  required surgical  or  medical  intervention  to  prevent  permanent  loss  of  sight  occurred  in ≥ 2  patients  in  the faricimab Q4W arm.

There was one pooled sight-threatening  ADR  (endophthalmitis),  which  was  associated  with severe IOI.

Having considered available data, the CHMP agreed that, in relation to ocular AEs, the overall rates observed  across  the  pooled  phase  III  studies  were  generally  balanced  between  faricimab  and aflibercept to week 24.The CHMP also noted that the most commonly reported ocular AEs, overall in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

any  treatment  arm  were  conjunctival  haemorrhage,  IOP  increased  and  vitreous  detachment.  The ocular safety profile observed to week 24 was generally in line with the established safety profile. In addition it was likewise noted that most of these AEs were mild to moderate in severity.

## Ocular AEs from the pooled part 2 dataset

The most common ocular AEs by PT occurring in the study eye ( ≥ 2% in any treatment arm of the pooled Part 2 dataset: faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively)  were intraocular  pressure (IOP)  increased  (4.8%  and  3.8%), cataract (3.7%  and 4.1%), macular  oedema (MO;  3.2%  and  3.1%;  majority  reported  as  verbatim  worsening), conjunctival haemorrhage (3.3% and 2.8%), RVO (3.2% and 2.6%; majority reported as verbatim worsening of RVO), vitreous detachment (2.1% and 3.8%), cystoid macular oedema (CMO; 3.3% and  2%;  majority  reported  as  verbatim  worsening), epiretinal  membrane (1%  and  3%),  and vitreous floaters (0.2% and 2.6%).

The CHMP agreed that the most common ocular AEs in the study eye reported above are consistent with the disease under study, the RVO Week 24 data, and the known faricimab safety profile in other indications (DME and nAMD).

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of ocular AEs per 100 PY was generally consistent with Part 1 for both arms ( 65.23 and 71.53 in the pooled faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms in Part 2, respectively and 63.60 and 76.31 in the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms in Part 1, respectively.

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm representing  the  longer-term  safety  data  for  faricimab  was 43.2%. The  majority  of  RVO  disease worsening  events  (i.e.,  worsening  of  RVO,  MO  and  CMO)  were  reported  as  non-serious,  mild,  and resolved by the end of the study.

In the entire study dataset, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of ocular AEs per 100 PY in the faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  was 65.96. This  rate  was  consistent  with  the  other  faricimab Phase III studies(DME: 56.88 and nAMD: 68.90 ; DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS, nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS).

The rates of ocular AEs per 1000 injections in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 82.18. This rate  was  consistent  with  the  other  pooled  faricimab  treatment  arms  in  the  Phase  III  studies  (DME: 81.68 and nAMD: 131.73).

## Serious Ocular AEs in the Study Eye from the Pooled Phase III RVO Studies

## Before the Week 24 Visit

The incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms was comparable (1.9% and 2.2%, respectively). The overall incidence was low, and there were no differences observed at the individual PT level between the treatment arms.

The most  common  serious  ocular  AE in  the  study  eye  (2  patients  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  or aflibercept Q4W arm) by PT were:

- retinal ischaemia (3 patients [0.5%] and 2 patients [0.3%]),
- CMO (verbatim: worsening of CMO, 2 patients [0.3%] and 2 patients [0.3%]),
- RVO (verbatim: worsening of CRVO, 2 patients [0.3%] and 2 patients [0.3%]),
- RAO (2 patients [0.3%] and 1 patient [0.2%]),
- uveitis (2 patients [0.3%] and 0 patients).

Most of these serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in the COMINO study.

By Week 24, the majority of serious ocular AEs had resolved or were resolving in both treatment arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The serious ocular AEs in the study eye that were not resolved, were macular ischaemia, RAO and RVO  (verbatim:  progression  of  CRVO)  in  1  patient  each  in  the faricimab Q4W  arm  and  RVO (verbatim: progression of CRVO and progression of BRVO to CRVO) and retinal ischaemia in 2 patients each and RAO and vitreous haemorrhage in 1 patient each in the aflibercept Q4W arm (Table 47).

By Week 24, 3 patients (0.5%) and 2 patients (0.3%) in the faricimab Q4W arm and aflibercept Q4W arm,  respectively,  experienced  at  least  one  serious  ocular  AE  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be related to faricimab. The serious ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to faricimab were uveitis (2 patients [0.3%]), and CMO, RAO , and retinal ischaemia (1 patient [0.2%] each). All  of  these  serious  ocular  AEs  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  faricimab  were  either resolved or resolving by Week 24.

The serious  ocular  AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to aflibercept were intraocular pressure increased and retinal tear (1 patient 0.2%] each); both were resolved by Week 24.

The rates of serious ocular AEs per 1000 injections were comparable between the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms ( 4.34 and 3.83 , respectively).

The exposure-adjusted incidence rates for serious ocular AEs per 100 PY in the study eye were similar between the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms ( 5.38 and 4.77 , respectively)

## BALATON study

The per 1000 injection rate of serious ocular AEs in the study eye was low and comparable across the treatment arms (1.89 and 1.25 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively).

The rate of serious ocular AEs per 100 patient years was also low and comparable in both treatment arms (2.35 and 1.58 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms).

The incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye was low, with 3 patients (1.1%) in the faricimab Q4W arm (RVO [verbatim: worsening  of  RVO;  1  patient]  and  retinal  ischemia  [2  patients]),  and  2 patients (0.7%) in the aflibercept Q4W arms (RVO [1 patient] and vitreous haemorrhage [1 patient] (Table 49). By Week 24, the 3 serious ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W arm had resolved, while the 2 serious  ocular  AEs  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm  (vitreous  haemorrhage  and  RVO)  had  not  resolved. There were no serious ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment in either arm and no serious ocular AEs that resulted in study treatment interruption or withdrawal.

## Serious Ocular AEs week 24 through CCOD

Serious  Ocular  AEs  occurred  in  20  patients  [3.2%]  and  7  patients  [1.2%]  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab  PTI  arm  and  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm,  respectively.  The  most common serious ocular AEs in the study eye (2 patients in any treatment arm; faricimab Q4W to faricimab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PTI  arm  and  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm,  respectively)  by  PT  were RVO (5  patients [0.8%] and 1 patient [0.2%]), CMO (4 patients [0.6%] and 1 patient [0.2%]), retinal ischaemia (1 patient [0.2%] and 2 patients [0.3%]) and macular oedema (2 patients [0.3%] and 0 patients).

All of these events, except 1 event of RVO (verbatim: new onset BRVO in patient with CRVO) and 1 event of retinal ischaemia, were reported verbatim as worsening. All of the serious ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm occurred in the COMINO Study.

The serious ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment in the study eye were  epiretinal  membrane,  vitritis,  uveitis,  and  iritis  all  in  1  patient  each  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab PTI arm. The events of epiretinal membrane and vitritis were not resolved by the CCOD, while  the  other  events  were  either  resolved  or  resolving.  The  number  of serious  ocular  AEs  per 1000 injections in the study eye was 13.25 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 4.78 in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The incidence of  serious  ocular  AEs  in  both  arms  from  Week  24  to  CCOD  was  consistent  with  the incidence of serious ocular AEs before Week 24. However, the number of injections from Week 24 is lower as patients are receiving sham in Part 2, resulting in a higher rate per 1000 injections from Week 24 to CCOD.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious ocular AEs per 100 PY in the study eye was 8.30 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 3.67 in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

## Serious Ocular AEs Pooled Part 2 Dataset

In  the  pooled  Part  2  dataset,  the  rates  of serious  ocular  AEs were  mainly  driven  by  disease worsening of CMO, RVO, and MO events. Most of these serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in the COMINO study. All were assessed as not suspected to be related to study treatment. The majority were resolved or resolving by the end of the study (Week 72) with no additional treatment and no lasting impact on the patient's long-term vision.

The most common serious ocular AEs by PT occurring in the study eye ( ≥ 2 patients in any of the treatment arm of the pooled Part 2 dataset: the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab  PTI  arms,  respectively)  were RVO (5  patients  [0.8%]  and  3  patients  [0.5%];  majority reported as verbatim worsening), CMO (5 patients [0.8%] and 1 patient [0.2%]; majority reported as verbatim worsening), MO (4 patients [0.6%] and 0; majority reported as verbatim worsening), retinal ischaemia (1 patient [0.2%] and 2 patients [0.3%]); retinal neovascularization (2 patients [0.3%] and 1 patient [0.2%]), cataract (0 patients and 2 patients [0.3%]), macular ischaemia (2 patients [0.3%] and 0 patients), and retinal artery occlusion (RAO, 0 patients and 2 patients [0.3%]).

The incidence of serious ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment was low (4 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in the COMINO study: epiretinal membrane, iridocyclitis, uveitis, and vitritis each in single patients.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious ocular AEs per 100 PY in Part 2 was consistent with Part 1 for both arms ( 5.82 and 2.96 in the pooled faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms in Part 2, respectively and 5.38 and 4.77 in the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms in Part 1, respectively.

## Entire Study

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of serious ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 6.4%. The rates of ocular SAEs were mainly driven by the disease worsening of RVO (1.2%), CMO (1.1%), and MO (0.6%). The majority were resolved or resolving by the end of the study (Week 72) and had no lasting impact on the patient's long-term vision.

Having  considered  the  number  of  patients  by  treatment  interval  at  Week  68  in  both  BALATON  and COMINO studies,  the CHMP noted that the low number of patients treated at the Q8W and Q12W (and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Q4W for BALATON) dosing intervals means that data should be interpreted with caution, as the relative incidences of events will be accentuated due to the comparatively low sample size.

## Ocular AEs

There was a higher incidence of ocular events in patients treated at the Q4W dosing interval compared to the Q16W dosing interval within each treatment arm. The higher incidence could be explained by a worse RVO disease status requiring more injections compared to the other dosing intervals throughout the study. The CHMP agreed that the incidence of events in patients treated at the Q8W and Q12W dosing intervals should be interpreted with caution due to the comparatively low sample size.

In the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, 35.7% of patients and 26.2% of patients experienced at least  one  ocular  AE  in  the  Q4W  and  Q16W  dosing intervals, respectively. In the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, 34.4% of patients and 22.4% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the Q4W and Q16W dosing intervals, respectively.

Ocular AEs in the study eye which contributed to the higher incidence of AEs in patients treated at the faricimab  PTI  Q4W  dosing  interval  compared  to  faricimab  Q16W  in  either  treatment  arm  (2% difference  between  Q4W  and  Q16W  interval  in  either  treatment  arms)  were:  intraocular  pressure increased, conjunctival  haemorrhage,  cataract,  macular  oedema,  retinal  vein  occlusion,  retinal haemorrhage,  cystoid  macular  oedema,  retinal  ischaemia,  visual  acuity  reduced,  and  glaucoma.  As expected, the rates of ocular AEs in the Q4W dosing regimen were mainly driven by disease worsening of  cystoid  macular  oedema,  retinal  vein  occlusion  and  disease  complication  (e.g.,  glaucoma,  retinal haemorrhage, retinal ischaemia).

Ocular AEs in the study eye in Q8W and Q12W varied across treatment arms (30.3% of patients and 47.7% of patients for Q8W and 27.6% of patients and 43.5% of patients for Q12W in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively) which was likely due to the small sample size.

In the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, 48.2% of patients and 27.9% of patients experienced at least  one  ocular  AE  in  the  Q4W  and  Q16W  dosing  interval,  respectively.  In  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to faricimab PTI arm, 39.6% of patients and 29.3% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the Q4W and Q16W dosing interval, respectively.

Ocular AEs in the study eye which contributed to the higher incidence of AEs in patients treated at the faricimab  PTI  Q4W  dosing  interval  compared  to  faricimab  Q16W  in  either  treatment  arm  (2% difference between Q4W and Q16W interval in either treatment arms)were: cataract, cystoid macular oedema, macular oedema, retinal  vein  occlusion,  epiretinal  membrane,  glaucoma,  vitreous  floaters, retinal neovascularization, and iritis. As expected, the rates of ocular AEs in the Q4W dosing regimen were  mainly  driven  by  disease  worsening  of  cystoid  macular  oedema,  retinal  vein  occlusion,  and macular oedema events and study disease complication (e.g., glaucoma, epiretinal membrane).

Three  cases  of  iritis  were  reported  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  in  the  Q4W  dosing subgroup;  however,  no  clear  relationship  could  be  established  between  time  of  injection  and  event onset. Notably, one case of iritis was reported in the Q16W dosing regimen subgroup.

Ocular AEs in the study eye in Q12W varied across treatment arms (21.4% of patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 51.4% of patients in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm) which was likely due to the small sample size.

## Non-ocular AEs

In  the  BALATON  and  COMINO  studies,  the  incidence  of  non-ocular  AEs  in  Part  2  were  generally comparable  across  treatment  intervals  within  each  treatment  arm.  In  the  BALATON  study,  the observed numerically higher incidence of non-ocular AEs in the Q4W interval of the faricimab Q4W to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

faricimab PTI arm compared to the other dosing intervals was not observed in the COMINO study and did not reveal any particular trend.

Having considered available data, the CHMP noted that, with regard to Serious Ocular AEs :

Part 1: from the pooled Phase III RVO Studies, the incidence of serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms  was  comparable  (1.9%  and  2.2%, respectively)

The rates of serious ocular AEs per 1000 injections were generally comparable between the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms (4.34 and 3.83, respectively).

The exposure-adjusted incidence rates for serious ocular AEs per 100 PY in the study eye were similar between the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms (5.38 and 4.77, respectively).

The  serious  ocular  AEs  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  faricimab  were uveitis (2 patients  [0.3%]),  and CMO,  RAO ,  and retinal  ischaemia (1  patient  [0.2%]  each).  All  of  these serious  ocular  AEs  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  faricimab  were  either  resolved  or resolving by Week 24.

Part 1 ( Before the Week 24 Visit): in the Balaton study there were no serious ocular AEs suspected by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  in  either  arm  and  no  serious  ocular  AEs  that resulted in study treatment interruption or withdrawal.

Part 1 ( Before the Week 24 Visit): study most of the serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in the COMINO study. The MAH was therefore requested to further discuss the numerically higher rate of exposure adjusted serious related ocular AEs in faricimab treatment group to week 24.

A summary of the MAH's response is presented below.

In Part 1 (before Week 24 visit) of COMINO study, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates (events per 100 patient years [PY]) of serious ocular AEs in COMINO were comparable between treatment arms (7.68 in the faricimab Q4W arm and 7.19 in the aflibercept Q4W arm. Similarly, the exposure-adjusted rates  (events  per  1000  injection)  of  serious  ocular  AEs  were  comparable  between  treatment  arms (6.20 in the faricimab Q4W arm and 5.83 in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

The  numerical  difference  between  the  rates  is  due  to  one  more  event  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm compared to the aflibercept Q4W arm in COMINO (13 events vs. 12 events); also, no patterns were observed for any of the serious ocular AEs.

In Part 1 of the COMINO study, the incidence of related serious ocular AEs was low and comparable (3 patients [0.8%] in the faricimab Q4W arm and 2 patients [0.6%] in the aflibercept Q4W arm).

As acknowledged by the MAH, in the initial RVO Clinical Overview a numerically higher incidence of serious ocular AEs in both the faricimab and aflibercept treatment arms were reported in the COMINO study (C/HRVO) compared with the BALATON study (BRVO) in Part 1 (before the Week 24 visit).

CRVO is the most severe form of RVO and affects the entire retina (Bandello et al. 2010; Buehl et al. 2010). There are substantial differences between CRVO and BRVO concerning visual prognosis and risk of complications, with patients with CRVO at greater risk of secondary ocular complications.

As expected from the RVO phenotype:

- Patients  with  BRVO  had  a  higher  baseline  BCVA  and  lower  CST  values  compared  to  patients  in COMINO.
- A lower rate of patients with BRVO compared with CRVO had prior targeted ocular medical history in the study eye (targeted means a patient had a pre-specified medical history.

condition/term in the eCRF):

- -85 patients (30.8%) in the faricimab Q4W arm and 82 patients (29.6%) in the aflibercept Q4W arm in the BALATON study.
- -156 patients (42.6%) in the faricimab Q4W arm and 145 patients (39.9%) in the aflibercept Q4W arm in the COMINO study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Similar findings were observed in the historical pivotal RVO trials from baseline to Week 24, where a trend  for  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  serious  ocular  AEs  in  CRVO  versus  BRVO  populations  was generally observed across the ranibizumab and aflibercept RVO trials, as presented in Table 50 below.

Considering the more severe clinical picture of CRVO compared with BRVO and the precedent findings of  RVO  pivotal  trials  with  other  anti-VEGFs,  in  the  MAH's  view,  it  is  not  unexpected  to  observe  a slightly higher rate of serious ocular AEs in patients with CRVO.

Having  considered  the  MAH's  clarification, the  CHMP  acknowledged  that,  bearing  in  mind  the  more severe clinical picture of CRVO compared with BRVO and the precedent findings of RVO pivotal trials with other anti-VEGFs, it is not unexpected to observe a slightly higher rate of serious ocular AEs in patients with CRVO. Therefore, the MAH was requested to reflect the available safety data in relation to this aspect in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

In  its  response  to  the  above  request,  the  MAH  rather  proposed  to  not  adjust  SmPC  Section  4.8  in relation to the slightly higher rate of serious ocular adverse events (AEs) in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), as it is well known by physicians that CRVO is the most severe form of RVO and affects the entire retina (Bandello et al. 2010; Buehl et al. 2010).

There are substantial differences between CRVO and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) concerning visual prognosis and risk of complications, with patients with CRVO at greater risk of secondary ocular complications. Furthermore, reassuringly, the overall rate of serious ocular AEs and the rate of adverse drug reactions for RVO were still within the expected range for faricimab (Table 51 below).

In addition, general information about known risks related to the disease rather than the drug was not included in the Eylea or Lucentis label, nor are required per the EU SmPC guideline (2009). Ultimately, the CHMP considered the MAH's justification as acceptable.

Part 2 Week 24 through CCOD Serious Ocular AEs : The number of serious ocular AEs per 1000 injections  in  the  study  eye  was 13.25 in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and 4.78 in  the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. The number of injections from Week 24 was lower as patients received sham in  Part 2, resulting in a higher rate per 1000 injections from Week 24 to CCOD. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious ocular AEs per 100 PY in the study eye was 8.30 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 3.67 in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was a notable difference in the number of serious ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm without the full data set these data were difficult to interpret.

As  requested,  the  MAH  clearly  presented  the  full  safety  data  set  with  the  responses  to  the  list  of outstanding  issues  (LoOI),  with  a  focus  on  the  exposure  adjusted  data  including  a  side-to-side comparison  of  those  patients  treated  with  faricimab  in  both  parts  versus  those  who  had  previously been treated with aflibercept in Part 1 of the studies. In addition, a breakdown was provided which clearly outlined the numbers of subjects who received 4 weekly vs 8 weekly vs 12 weekly vs 16 weekly injections in both arms and the corresponding serious ocular AEs for each group.

Overall,  considering  the  limitations  of  the  by  treatment  interval  analysis,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the safety profile of faricimab remained similar across all treatment interval subgroups, and the nature and type of non-ocular AEs and ocular AEs in the study eye reported in patients assigned to Q8W, Q12W, and Q16W dosing was also broadly similar. The higher incidence of certain adverse events observed with Q4W dosing could be explained by worse RVO disease status requiring more injections over the study, and higher number of injections compared to other faricimab dosing intervals.

Moderate IOI events included  1  serious  uveitis,  1  serious  vitritis,  and  1  serious  iritis  by  CCOD,  the events of uveitis and iritis were recovered or recovering, respectively while the event of vitritis was noted as ongoing and, as requested, the MAH provided an update on this latter event.

In  the pooled  Part  2  dataset ,  the  rates  of serious  ocular  AEs were  mainly  driven  by  disease worsening of CMO, RVO, and MO events. The type of serious ocular AEs in Part 2 was consistent with Part 1. Most of these serious ocular AEs in the study eye occurred in the COMINO study. All were assessed as not suspected to be related to study treatment. The most common serious ocular AEs by PT occurring in the study eye ( ≥ 2 patients in any of the treatment arm of the pooled Part 2 dataset: the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively) were RVO (5  patients  [0.8%]  and  3  patients  [0.5%]; CMO (5  patients  [0.8%]  and  1  patient  [0.2%]; MO (4 patients [0.6%] and 0. The incidence of serious ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to  study  treatment  was  low  (4  patients  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  in  the  COMINO study: epiretinal membrane, iridocyclitis, uveitis, and vitritis each in single patients.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious ocular AEs per 100 PY in Part 2 was consistent with Part 1 for both arms ( 5.82 and 2.96 in the pooled faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms in Part 2, respectively and 5.38 and 4.77 in the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms in Part 1, respectively.

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of serious ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 6.4%. The rates of ocular SAEs were mainly driven by the disease worsening of RVO (1.2%), CMO (1.1%),  and MO (0.6%).  The  majority  were  resolved  or  resolving  by  the  end  of  the study (Week 72) and had no lasting impact on the patient's long-term vision.

## Ocular Adverse Events of Special Interest Sight-Threatening AEs in the Study Eye

## Before the Week 24 Visit

A  comparable  and  low  incidence  of  AESIs  in  the  study  eye  occurred  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and aflibercept  Q4W  arms  (9  patients  [1.4%]  and  14  patients  [2.2%],  respectively  (Table  52).  The majority  of  the  ocular  AESIs  in  the  study  eye  occurred  in  the COMINO study,  and  most  of  these events resolved or were resolving by the CCOD.

The most common sight-threatening AEs in the study eye that caused a decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour ( ≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arm, respectively) by PT were CMO (verbatim: worsening of CMO) and RVO (verbatim: worsening of RVO) (2 patients [0.3%] and 2 patients [0.3%] each. The sight-threatening AEs in the study eye that caused a decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour that were not resolved by Week 24 were macular ischaemia, RAO and RVO in 1 patient each in the faricimab Q4W arm, and RVO in 2 patients and vitreous haemorrhage and RAO in 1 patient each in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

The most common sight-threatening AEs in the study eye that required surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight ( ≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W  arm,  respectively)  was retinal  tear (0  patients  vs.  2  patients  [0.3%].  There  was  1  sight threatening AE in the study eye that required surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight that was not resolved by Week 24: retinal ischaemia in 1 patient in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

There were no patients who experienced sight-threatening AEs in the AESI category  associated with 'severe intraocular inflammation' in either treatment arm. The per 1000 injection rate of ocular AESIs in the study eye was 2.44 and 3.83 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of ocular AESIs per 100 PY were 3.03 and 4.77, in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms respectively.

## Ocular selected AEs: Intraocular Inflammation Events Before the Week 24 Visit

Intraocular  inflammation  was  defined  by  the  following  PTs:  anterior  chamber  cell,  anterior  chamber flare, anterior chamber inflammation, chorioretinitis, choroiditis, cyclitis, eye inflammation, iridocyclitis, iritis,  keratic  precipitates,  keratouveitis,  noninfective  chorioretinitis,  non-infectious  endophthalmitis, ocular vasculitis, post procedural inflammation, retinal occlusive vasculitis, retinal vasculitis, haemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis, uveitis, vitritis, and vitreal cells.

The incidence of IOI events in the study eye was low and comparable across all treatment arms (9 patients [1.4%] and  4  patients [0.6%] in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively).

All the reported IOI events were in the COMINO study.

In the BALATON study, 1 patient in the faricimab Q4W arm had 1 event of 'vitreal cells' reported but the verbatim term was 'non-inflammatory vitreous cells' and thus, not considered an IOI event. There

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were no IOI events associated with retinal vasculitis or retinal occlusive disease in any treatment arms based on the reported preferred terms (PTs).

The most common IOI events in the study eye ( ≥ 2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W and aflibercept  Q4W  arm,  respectively)  by  PT  were  vitritis  (3  patients  [0.5%]  and  0  patients),  iritis  (2 patients [0.3%] and 2 patients [0.3%]), and uveitis (2 patients [0.3%] and 1 patient [0.2%].

The majority of IOI events in the study eye were mild in severity in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively (7 patients [1.1%] and 3 patients [0.5%]).

Moderate IOI events included 2  serious  uveitis  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm and  1  serious  noninfectious endophthalmitis in the faricimab Q4W and in the aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively (Table 53). By Week 24, 1 event of uveitis was recovering while the other events had recovered. There were no severe IOI events.

The IOI event rate per 1000 injections in the study eye was low and comparable (2.44 and 1.09 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively).

The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of IOI events per 100 PY were low and comparable between the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arm (3.03 and 1.36, respectively).

There was 1 patient with a moderate IOI event of uveitis in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W arm associated with vision loss ≥ 15 letters which was recovering by Week 24. Sustained vision loss of ≥ 15 letters  and ≥ 30 letters associated with an AE by Week 24 was measured as the change in BCVA at Week 24 minus the BCVA closest to and strictly before the first event onset.

For the serious IOI events , there was no clear relationship between injection day of study treatment and the timing of the events. However, the majority of the non-serious IOI events occurred after the first dose and no recurrence was observed by Week 24. The incidence of IOI events occurring in the fellow eye was low (1 patient [0.2%] each] in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms) The IOI events in the fellow eye by PT were iridocyclitis in the faricimab Q4W arm and iritis in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

## AESIs week 24 through CCOD

The incidence of AESIs in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab  PTI  arms  was  16  patients [2.5%] and  4  patients [0.7%], respectively.  All  of  the  ocular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AESIs  in  the  study  eye  occurred  in COMINO, and  the  majority  of  these  events  resolved  or  were resolving by the CCOD.

## IOI events week 24 through CCOD

IOI events in the study eye by PT were iritis (2 patients [0.3%]) and keratic precipitates, uveitis, and vitritis (1 patient [0.2%] each) all in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

There were no IOI events reported in aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. There was 1 event of IOI associated with sustained vision loss (15 letters). There were no IOI events associated retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease in any treatment arms. All the IOI events in the study eye were mild or moderate in  severity  across  the  treatment  arms.  Moderate  IOI  events  included  1  serious  uveitis,  1  serious vitritis,  and  1  serious  iritis  by  CCOD,  the  events  of  uveitis  and  iritis  were  recovered  or  recovering, respectively while the event of vitritis was ongoing. There were no additional IOI events  reported in the fellow eye.

## AESIs Pooled Part 2 Dataset

The majority of the ocular AESIs in the study eye occurred in the COMINO study, and the majority of these events were associated with study disease worsening and were resolved or resolving by the end of study:

- 16  patients (2.5%) and  8  patients (1.3%) in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms,  respectively,  experienced  an  ocular  AESI  causing  a decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour. The majority were resolved or resolving by the end of the study.
- 6 patients (1.0%) and 1 patient (0.2%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively, experienced an ocular AESI that required surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight. Four  out  of  seven  events  were resolved by the end of the studies.
- One patient  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  experienced  an  event  in  the  AESI category of 'associated with severe IOI' (endophthalmitis). This event was resolved by the end of the study.

In  the pooled  Part  2 dataset,  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence rate  of  AESIs  per  100  PY was consistent with Part 1 for both arms ( 4.06 and 1.98 in the pooled faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  in  Part  2,  respectively  and 3.03 and 4.77 in  the  pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms in Part 1, respectively.

## Entire Study

In  the  entire  study  dataset,  the  incidence  of  AESIs  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  was 4.7%. The  exposure-adjusted  incidence rates  of  AESIs  per  100  PY in  the  Faricimab  Q4W  to Faricimab PTI arm was 3.71 ). This rate was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 3.05 and nAMD: 2.09; DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS, nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS. The rates of ocular  AEs  per 1000 injections in the Faricimab Q4W to Faricimab PTI arm was 4.62 This rate was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 4.38 and nAMD: 3.99; DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS, nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS.

## IOI Events Pooled Part 2 Dataset

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of IOI events occurring in the study eye was low in both the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  ( 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively).

A higher incidence of IOI was reported in the COMINO study ( 2.8% and 1.5% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively), which is in line with what has been observed in historical RVO pivotal trials. The MAH outlined that this is likely related to the greater severity of underlying CRVO disease compared with BRVO (Brown et al. 2010, Campochiaro et al.  2010).  The  majority  were  non-serious and mild and moderate in severity and had no impact on visual outcomes.

There was no clear relationship between injection day of study treatment and the timing of the events observed with the caveat that the number of IOI events reported was small. Additionally, IOI events associated with significant  vision  loss  ( ≥ 15  letters  or ≥ 30 letters)  were  infrequent  (1  patient  had  a vision loss of ≥ 15 letters associated with a serious event of vitritis in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI  arm  and  1 patient  had  a  vision  loss  of ≥ 15  letters  associated  with  a  non-serious  event  of iridocyclitis  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm).  By Week 72, the  majority of IOI events were resolved or resolving. Four events (vitritis, non-infectious endophthalmitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis [1 event each]) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 1 event of iridocyclitis in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm were not resolved by Week 72. Two of these events occurred at the end of the study and therefore were still ongoing at the last study visit. One event of vitritis resulted in study discontinuation.

## Entire Study

In the Entire Study dataset, the incidence of IOI in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 3.0%. The IOI incidence was higher in CRVO, but it is important to note that:

- The majority of the IOI events reported in COMINO were non-serious, mild or moderate in severity, and had no impact on visual outcomes.
- There was no clear relationship between injection day of study treatment and the timing of the events observed with the caveat that the number of IOI reported were small.
- In historical RVO pivotal trials IOI rates were also greater in the CRVO cohort. (Brown et al. 2011, Campochiaro et al. 2011).

Finally, one  site reported IOIs in 7  patients (2  and  1 patients  in  Part  1  on  faricimab  Q4W  and aflibercept Q4W, respectively; and 1 and 3 patients in Part 2 on faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI, respectively). However, upon discussion with the medical monitor, the site could not confirm whether the cells were inflammatory in nature, and all events resolved.

The exposure-adjusted incidence  rate  of  IOIs  per  100  PY in  the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 2.67. This rate was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 1.13 and nAMD: 1.94; DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS, nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS)

The  CHMP  noted  that,  based  on  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  of  ocular  AESIs  per  100  PY which were 3.03 and 4.77, in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms respectively, there were no major  imbalances  in  ocular  AESIs  to week  24 .  There  were  no  patients  who  experienced  sightthreatening  AEs  in  the  AESI  category    associated  with  'severe  intraocular  inflammation'  in  either treatment arm.

The per 1000 injection rate of ocular AESIs in the study eye was 2.44 and 3.83 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The IOI event rate per 1000 injections in the study eye was low and comparable (2.44 and 1.09 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively). It  was  also  critically  noted  that  the  incidence  of  IOI  events  was  higher  for  the  group  treated  with faricimab  compared  to  aflibercept  in  the  Comino  study  (8  patients  [ 2.2% ]  and  4  patients  [ 1.1% ], respectively). It is further noted that in 6 patients the IOI event occurred shortly (i.e. ≤10 days) after the first injection of faricimab, whereas in only one patient the IOI occurred soon (i.e. ≤10 days) after the first injection of aflibercept. Notable differences across the rate of IOI in the COMINO study were observed. On this matter, the MAH further clarified that, considering the overall low incidence of IOI, the comparability with previous registrational studies, and the mild clinical presentation of the events in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm,  the  current  data  does  not  support  a  significant  difference  between treatment arms in Part 1 of COMINO (the treatment difference was 1.1%; 95% CI: -0.93%, 3.26%).

## Part 2 Week 24 through CCOD

Moderate IOI events included 1 serious uveitis, 1 serious vitritis, and 1 serious iritis by CCOD; the events of uveitis and iritis were recovered or recovering, respectively while the event of vitritis was ongoing. As requested, the MAH provided an update on this latter event. The MAH also discussed the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reasons for the noted imbalance in patients treated with faricimab Q4W (3.03) compared to aflibercept Q4W arm (1.36).

As highlighted in the Immunogenicity section, no conclusion concerning the potential impact of ADAs on clinical efficacy and safety from Week 24 could be made at the time of the initial report as postWeek  ADA  status  for  all  patients  was  not  available.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  present  a  complete discussion of the full safety data set with the responses to the LoOI, including a detailed discussion of possible differences in long-term immunogenicity and relevant AEs (including IOI events) reported for faricimab, relative to ADA status.

In  its  response,  the  MAH  acknowledged  that  some  uncertainty  remains  in  relation  to  the  long  term safety and immunogenicity profile associated with faricimab in the RVO indication. Overall, a higher incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) events was observed in the ADA-positive subgroup in the COMINO study although IOI events were also reported in the ADA-negative subgroup.  As outlined in the PI, cases of IOI events are known to be associated with faricimab treatment, warnings have been included (i.e. in section 4.4) and IOI events are also listed in SmPC section 4.8. Nevertheless, some uncertainty  remains  in  relation  to  the  long  term  immunogenicity  data  in  the  RVO  indication: information currently available is considered limited by the CHMP and (as acknowledged in the SmPC) the clinical significance of anti-faricimab antibodies, with regard to safety, is unclear. In this context, as mentioned thereafter, the MAH should keep these issues as topics of special interest in the PSURs, especially IOI events and immunogenicity in the RVO population.

In the BALATON study, 1 patient in the faricimab Q4W arm had 1 event of 'vitreal cells' reported but the verbatim term was 'non-inflammatory vitreous cells' and thus, not considered an IOI event.

All  the  reported  IOI  events  were  in  the COMINO study.  Moderate  IOI  events  included 2  serious uveitis  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm and  1  serious  non-infectious  endophthalmitis  in  the  faricimab Q4W and in the aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. By Week 24, 1 event of uveitis was recovering while the other events had recovered. The MAH provided an update on the serious uveitis case which was documented as not recovered.

## Pooled Part 2 Dataset

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of IOI events occurring in the study eye was low in both the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  ( 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively).

A  higher  incidence  of IOI was  reported  in COMINO ( 2.8% and 1.5% in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively), which is in line with what has been observed in historical RVO pivotal trials. The majority were non-serious and mild and moderate in severity and had no impact on visual outcomes.

By Week  72, the  majority  of IOI events  were  resolved  or  resolving. Four  events (vitritis,  noninfectious endophthalmitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis [1 event each]) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 1 event of iridocyclitis in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm were not  resolved by Week 72. Two of these events occurred at the end of the study; therefore, they were still ongoing at the last study visit. One event of vitritis resulted in study discontinuation.

## Entire Study

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of IOI in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 3.0%. The IOI incidence was higher in CRVO, but it is important to note that:

- the  majority  of  the  IOI  events  reported  in  COMINO  were  non-serious,  mild  or  moderate  in severity, and had no impact on visual outcomes.
- There was no clear relationship between injection day of study treatment and the timing of the events observed with the caveat that the number of IOI reported were small.

There  were  no  reported  IOI  events  associated  with  retinal  vasculitis  or  occlusive  disease.  The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of IOIs per 100 PY in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 2.67. The rates in the other faricimab Phase III studies were DME: 1.13 and nAMD: 1.94.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  the  specific  long  term  monitoring  of  immunogenicity,  in  the  RVO indication specifically. A comprehensive response was provided by the MAH, highlighting that the 72week RVO data presented in the BALATON and COMINO CSRs in combination with the DME and nAMD LTE studies, and existing routine pharmacovigilance activities (i.e. adverse reaction reporting, Guided Questionnaires,  signal  detection  and  management  activities),  with  all  relevant  safety  data  being reported in the PBRER, would be sufficient to provide long-term safety and immunogenicity data for faricimab to cover the RVO indication for the following reasons:

- The commonality between the pathophysiology and risk factors in DME and RVO supports that data from LTE studies in DME is relevant to the RVO population.
- Long-term RWD studies from anti-VEGF products have not identified a difference in safety profile between the DME and RVO population.
- Data obtained to date from the ongoing faricimab LTE studies in the DME and nAMD.

The CHMP considered acceptable both MAH's response and proposal : the MAH should keep this issue as  a  topic  of  special  interest  in  future  PSURs  and  continuously  review  the  need  to  strengthen  the current information on IOI events and immunogenicity in the RVO population, if necessary.

## Non-Ocular Adverse Events from the Pooled Phase III RVO Studies Before the Week 24 Visit

The incidence of non-ocular AEs was comparable across the two treatment arms (32.9% and 36.4% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively). The only event with a numerical ≥ 2% difference (in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively) by PT was hypertension (4.7% and 2.7%) however, this is not considered clinically meaningful by the CHMP.

The most common ( ≥ 5% of patients) MedDRA system organ classes (SOCs) in which non-ocular AEs were  reported  in  the  faricimab  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms  were  the  following:  Infections  and infestations (12.9% and 14.5%, respectively), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (4.4% and 5.2%, respectively), Nervous system disorders (5.5% and 4.1%, respectively) Vascular disorders (5.1% and 3.9%, respectively).

The  most common  non-ocular  AEs ( ≥ 2%  incidence  in  any  treatment  arm:  faricimab  Q4W  and aflibercept  Q4W  arm,  respectively)  by  PT  were  COVID-19  (4.1%  and  4.4%), hypertension  (4.7% and  2.7%), back  pain  (7  patients  [1.1%]  and  18  patients  [2.8%]),  nasopharyngitis  (1.7%  and 2.0%),  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (7  patients  [1.1%]  and  13  patients  [2.0%]),  with  no appreciable difference between faricimab and aflibercept (Table 21). The small numerical difference in the hypertension AEs was mainly driven by patients in the BALATON study (17 patients [6.2%] and 7 patients  2.6%]  patients  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively),  whose hypertension events were either reported as worsening of existing hypertension or had confounders. These  events  were  all  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  non-serious,  and  were  not  suspected  by  the investigator to be related to study treatment; most had resolved or were resolving by Week 24.

The majority of non-ocular AEs were mild or moderate in severity in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms. Overall, 3.3% and 5.2% of patients experienced at least one severe non-ocular AE in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arm, respectively. The incidence of non-ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to faricimab was low (4 patients [0.6%] in the faricimab Q4W arm). These AEs were cerebral infarction (2 patients [0.3%]), coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular accident (1 patient [0.2%] each). The incidence of non-ocular AEs suspected by the investigator to be related to aflibercept was low (5 patients [0.8%] in the aflibercept Q4W arm). These AEs were coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction (2 patients [0.3%] each) and arteriosclerosis coronary artery, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischaemia (1 patient [0.2%] each.

## Any non-ocular events: week 24 through CCOD

The incidence of non-ocular AEs was 31.3% and 21.0% in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms,  respectively).  The  most  common  non  ocular  AEs  (  &gt;2% incidence in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively) by PT were COVID-19 (7.3% and 4.4%) and hypertension (2.5% and 1.5%). The event with a numerical &gt;2% difference (in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively) by PT was COVID-19 (7.3% and 4.4%), however this  was  considered  clinically  meaningful.  The  majority  of  non-ocular  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in severity in both the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms.

The incidence of serious non-ocular AEs was comparable across the two treatment arms (4.8% and 6.1% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. There were no serious non-ocular AEs with &gt;1% incidence in any treatment arm.

## Non-Ocular AEs Pooled Part 2 Dataset

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of non-ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  was 52% and 49.3%, respectively.  The  majority  of non-ocular AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Consistent with Part 1, the most common non-ocular AEs in Part 2 ( ≥ 2% incidence in any treatment arm of the pooled Part 2 dataset: faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively) by PT were COVID-19 (12.4% and 11.7%), nasopharyngitis (2.9% and 4.3%),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertension (4.3% and 2.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.2% and 2.8%), back pain (2.4% and 1.3%), and influenza (1.9% and 2.6%).

## Update on hypertension

Hypertension is  a  major  risk  factor  for RVO with  a  meta-odds  ratio  of  2.82  (95%  CI:  2.12 -3.75; Song et al. 2019). The overall rate of hypertension reported in the BALATON and COMINO studies was in line or lower than published data in this patient population.

All hypertension events  were  reported  as  non-serious  and  the  majority  were  mild  or  moderate  in severity (with the exception of one severe event) and either reported as worsening of hypertension or with  risk  factors  (e.g.,  high  blood  pressure  at  screening  and/or  baseline,  associated  cardiovascular disorders, pre-existing systemic hypertension).

The  MAH,  requested  to  further  discuss  the  issue  of  hypertension,  confirmed  that  the  number  of patients  with  hypertension  AEs  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  in  Part  1  slightly  increased  in  the  final analysis versus the primary analysis, due to continuous data cleaning and query resolution since the primary analysis (3 additional patients in the BALATON study and 2 additional patients in the COMINO study later reported in Part 1 using the final database).

## BALATON Study: hypertension events in Part 1 (before Week 24 visit) and Part 2 (Week 24 to Week 72)

In Part 1 , the incidence of hypertension events was higher in the faricimab Q4W arm (20 patients [7.2%]) compared to the aflibercept Q4W arm (7 patients [2.6%]) All events were reported as nonserious and none were assessed as related to the study treatment by the investigators or required a change in study treatment. In Part 2 , the incidence of hypertension events were 14 patients (5.2%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 8 patients (3.0%) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

Overall, in the All Faricimab group 43 hypertension events were reported in 40 patients receiving faricimab through Week 72. All of the events were reported as non-serious with the majority being of mild (n=25/43) or moderate (n=17/43) severity. None of the 43 events were assessed as related to the study treatment by the investigators or required a change in the study treatment.

In  the  absence  of  an  imbalance  of  hypertension  events  in  other  population  treated  with  faricimab (nAMD and DME), and considering that (1) majority of the cases reported in the faricimab RVO studies had risk factors associated with the events of hypertension, (2) the baseline medical history of patients with RVO, and (3) the rates of hypertension in published data for this population, the MAH considered the numerically higher rate of hypertension events in the faricimab Q4W arm as isolated findings in the BALATON study.

In the pooled  Part  2 dataset, the exposure-adjusted incidence  rate  of  non-ocular  AEs per  100 patient  years  was  consistent  with  Part  1. ( 145.10 and 141.68 in  the  pooled  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab PTI and the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms in Part 2, respectively; and 126.19 and 156.02 in the pooled faricimab and the aflibercept arms in Part 1 , respectively.

In  the  pooled  Part  2  dataset,  the  incidence  of serious  non-ocular  AEs was  low  in  both  treatment arms.  There  were no  serious  non-ocular  AEs with ≥ 1%  incidence  in  any  treatment  arm  of  the pooled Part 2 dataset.

## Entire Study

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of non-ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 63.2%. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of non-ocular AEs per 100 PY was 140.50 which was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 172.42 and nAMD: 139.29; DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS,  nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the entire  study dataset,  the  incidence  of serious  non-ocular  AEs in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab PTI arm was 12.6%. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of serious non-ocular AEs per 100  PY  was 14.26 which  was  consistent  with  other  faricimab  Phase  III  studies  (nAMD:  17.06  and DME: 27.83).

## Adjudicated APTC-Defined Events

## Before the Week 24 Visit

The  incidence  of  externally  adjudicated  APTC-defined  ATEs  (adjudicated  by  an  independent  clinical coding  committee  at  Cleveland  Clinic,  United  States)  was  low  and  comparable  across  the  two treatment arms (1.1% and 1.4% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively).

Death adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 1 patient (0.2%) in the aflibercept Q4W arm. The death adjudicated  APTC  ATE  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm  was  myocardial  infarction,  not  suspected  by  the investigator to be related to the study treatment (please see Table 57, below).

Non-fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 2 patients (0.3%) and 4 patients (0.6%) in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

The most common non-fatal myocardial infarction adjudicated APTC ATEs (2 patients in any treatment arm)  by  PT  was  acute  myocardial  infarction  (3  patients  [0.5%]  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm;  Table below). Three of the non-fatal myocardial infarctions adjudicated APTC ATEs were suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment: acute myocardial infarction (2 patients) and myocardial infarction (1 patient) in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

Non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs were reported in 5 patients (0.8%) and 4 patients (0.6%) in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  The  most  common  non-fatal  stroke adjudicated APTC ATEs (2 patients in any treatment arm: faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively) by PT were cerebral infarction (2 patients [0.3%] and 1 patient [0.2%]), cerebrovascular  accident (1  patient  [0.2%] and 2 patients [0.3%]) and RAO (2  patients  [0.3%] and 1 patient [0.2 %])

Two  of  the  non-fatal  strokes adjudicated  APTC  ATEs  were  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be related  to  study  treatment:  cerebral  infarction  and  cerebrovascular  accident  (1  patient  each)  in  the faricimab Q4W arm.

The per 1000 injection rate of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs in the study eye was 1.90 and 2.46 events per 1000 injections in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept QW4 arms respectively.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of externally adjudicated APTC defined ATEs per 100 PY Week 24 were 2.36 and 3.07 , in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

AE = Adverse Event; APTC = anti-Platelet Trialist's Collaboration; MI = myocardial infarctions; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities;

For frequency counts of \"Total number of events\"rows,multiple occurrences of the sameAE in an individual are counted separately. Includes AEs with onset prior to Week 24 treatment or dose hold or if none prior to Day l68.

APTC events are defined as non-fatal strokes or non-fatal myocardial infarctions or vascular deaths (including deaths of unkmown cause).If no events Percentages are based on N in the column headings. For frequency counts by preferred term, mltiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted only once.

## Adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs: Week 24 through CCOD

There  were  2  patients  (0.3%)  with  a  death  adjudicated  APTC-defined  ATEs  which  occurred  in  the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm.  These  events  were  coronary  artery  disease  and  death (verbatim: unexplained death), both of which not suspected by the investigator to be related to the study treatment.

One patient (0.2%) experienced a non-fatal MI adjudicated APTC-defined ATE in the faricimab Q4W to Faricimab PTI arm (myocardial infarction, not suspected by the investigator to be related to the study treatment).

One patient (0.2%) experienced a non-fatal stroke adjudicated APTC-defined ATE in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm (RAO, not suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment), and 2 patients  (0.3%)  patients  with  a  non-fatal  stroke  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm (cerebrovascular accident and RAO, both not suspected by the investigator to be related to the study treatment.

The per 1000 injection rate of externally adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs in the study eye from Week 24 to the CCOD was comparable between the two treatment arms (1.33 and 2.73 events per 1000 injections  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm, respectively.

In the pooled  Part  2 dataset, the incidence of externally adjudicated  anti-platelet Trialists' Collaboration  (APTC)-defined  arterial  thromboembolic  events  (ATEs)  was  low  across  both  treatment arms and remained as expected in this patient population. No clear pattern was identified between the injection  day  of  study  treatment  and  the  timing  of  the  APTC  event,  including  for  previously  treated aflibercept Q4W patients who switched to faricimab PTI.

Three patients (0.5%) in each arm had fatal adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs . All these events were  single  events  (aortic  dissection,  cardiac  failure,  coronary  artery  disease,  death  [verbatim: unexplained death], and myocardial infarction;). None were suspected by the investigator to be related to the study treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Four  patients (0.6%)  in  each  arm had  non-fatal  myocardial  infarctions  adjudicated  APTCdefined ATEs. These events were myocardial infarction (3 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI  arm  and  1  patient  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm),  acute  myocardial  infarction  (3 patients  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm),  and  stress  cardiomyopathy  (1  patient  in  the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm); none were suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment.  There  were 3  patients (0.5%)  and 8  patients (1.3%)  that  reported  non-fatal  stroke adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively. These will be discussed separately, below.

In  the Entire  Study dataset,  the  incidence  of  externally  adjudicated  APTC-defined  ATEs  in  the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 2.8%.

The exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  APTC-defined  ATEs per  100  PY  was 2.20 which was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 2.79 and nAMD: 1.71 ;  DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS, nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS). The rate of APTC-defined ATEs per 1000 injections  was 2.74 which  was consistent  with  other  faricimab  Phase  III  studies  (DME: 6.66 and nAMD: 5.5 ;  DME Yr2 2.7.4 SCS, nAMD Wk112 2.7.4 SCS).

## Arterial Thromboembolic Events and Cerebrovascular Haemorrhage Adverse Events by SMQ (Un-Adjudicated) Before the Week 24 Visit

The incidence of un-adjudicated ATE and cerebrovascular haemorrhage AEs was low and comparable across  the  two  treatment  arms  (2.5%  and  2.5%  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively).

The most common events ( 2 patients in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively) were cerebrovascular accident,  (3  [0.5%]  and  2  [0.3%]),  coronary  artery  disease  (1  [0.2%]  and  4 [0.6%]), acute myocardial infarction (1 [0.2%] and 3 [0.5%]), cerebral infarction (3 [0.5%] and 1 [0.2%]),  myocardial  infarction  (1  [0.2%]  and  3  [0.5%]),  carotid  arteriosclerosis  (3  [0.5%]  and  0), carotid artery stenosis (0 and 3 [0.5%]).

The per 1000 injection rate of AEs of ATE and Cerebrovascular Haemorrhage AEs were 5.69 and 6.83 in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

In  the  pooled  Part  2 dataset, the incidence of non-ocular ATEs and cerebrovascular haemorrhagic AEs  (non-adjudicated)  was  low  in  both  treatment  arms  ( 2.9% and 3.0% in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively) and remained as expected in this  patient  population.  In  the  entire  study,  the  incidence  of  non-ocular  ATEs  and  cerebrovascular haemorrhagic AEs (non-adjudicated) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 5.1%.

## Discussion on Cerebral Vascular Events

In Part  1 (before  Week  24  visit)  of  the  BALATON  study,  there  were 3  patients (1.1%)  in  the faricimab  Q4W  arm  and 1  patient (0.4%)  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm  who  experienced  cerebral infarction events. The 3 cerebral infarction events in the faricimab Q4W arm were considered serious with  2  of  these  events  suspected  by  the  investigators  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  (1  event resolved and 1 was unresolved by Week 72).

## Part 1 Balaton Study: Narratives of cerebral infarction cases

Patient  1  was  a  69-years-old  Asian  male  who  received Faricimab  (6  mg  IVT  Q4W  up  to  Week  20 followed by Faricimab PTI dosing of 6 mg IVT up to Week 68) experienced the event of Cerebral infarction . Prior to this event, the most recent dose of faricimab was administered on Study Day 85 (Week 12). The patient had received a total of 4 injections of study treatment as of this Study Day. On Study Day  97, the  patient  suddenly  fell  and  lost  consciousness.  He  was  diagnosed  with  severe cerebral  infarction  (diagnostic  details  reported  as  unknown),  leading  to  hospitalisation.  He  received unspecified medications and underwent unspecified surgery. It was reported that it was impossible for the patient to continue the study due to hospitalisation in another hospital. The investigator was also unable to collect further information about concomitant medication or surgery/procedures due to his

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consent withdrawal. The event of cerebral infarction remained unresolved at the time of clinical cut-off day.  No  information  regarding  the  patient's  discharge  was  provided.  Due  to  this  event,  the  study treatment was permanently discontinued with the last dose administered on Study Day 85 (Week 12). The patient had received a total of 4 injections of study treatment. No other AE was experienced by the patient during the study. The investigator considered cerebral infarction, to be related to study treatment.

A further update on this serious event was provided by the MAH, stating that, for the above described patient, after the cerebral infarction event in Part 1, the study treatment was interrupted after Study Day 86 (Week 12). The study treatment was not administered between Weeks 16 and 24 and the next dose was administered on Study Day 198 (Week  28). This  patient  experienced another  cerebral infarction event in Part 2 on Study Day 410 (Week 58), which was non-serious and considered by the investigator unrelated to the study treatment, and unresolved at the time of study completion.

Patient  2 was a 63-years-old Asian male in treatment arm A (Faricimab) received dosage regimen Faricimab (6 mg IVT Q4W up to Week 20 followed by Faricimab PTI dosing of 6 mg IVT up to Week 68).  The  study  eye  was  the  right  eye.  The  Non-ocular  concurrent  conditions  included  hypertension, gout and renal failure. Prior to the event of cerebral infarction , the most recent dose of faricimab was administered on Study Day 141 (Week 20).

The patient had received a total of 6 injections of study treatment as of this Study Day. On Study Day 159, the patient experienced numbness and weakness of the left limb which was completely relieved within ten minutes and did not affect his ability of holding and walking. On Study Day 160, the patient again experienced numbness and weakness of the left limb which got worsened gradually. The patient experienced difficulty in walking and lifting of the upper limb was laborious. A cranial CT-scan did not show bleeding  or  infarction.  On  Study  Day  162,  the  patient  presented  with  ongoing  numbness  and weakness of the left limb. He was also noted with aggravation of hypertension (pre-existing condition) to  moderate  intensity  (blood  pressure  168/79  mmHg,  unrelated).  A  MRI  showed pontine  acute cerebral  infarction ,  multiple  intracranial  lacunar  cerebral  infarction  with  softening  foci  in  few  and leukoencephalopathy. Also, a brain atrophy, left maxillary sinus submucosal cyst, and bilateral otitis media.

The event of cerebral infarction was reported as resolving at the time of clinical cut-off. There was no change  in  study  treatment  due  to  the  event  of  cerebral  infarction. The  Investigator  considered cerebral infarction, to be related to study treatment and concurrent illness (hypertension and deep venous thrombosis). At the time of clinical cut-off, the patient continued to receive study treatment. Further  updates  on  this  serious  event  were  received  thereafter.  Specifically,  as  this patient discontinued the study prior to Week 24 and withdrew consent, further information could not be  collected.  Thus,  the  cerebral  infarction  event  remained  unresolved  at  the  time  of  treatment discontinuation.

Patient 3 was a  61-years-old Asian male in treatment arm A (who received dosage regimen faricimab of 6 mg IVT Q4W up to Week 20 followed by Faricimab PTI dosing of 6 mg IVT up to Week 68. The study  eye  was  the  right  eye.  Non-ocular  concurrent  conditions  included  hypertension  and  type  2 diabetes mellitus. At screening, the patient's BMI was 27.1 kg/m2.

On Study Day 1, the patient received his first study treatment with faricimab in the study eye. Concomitant  medication  ongoing  at  Study  Day  1  included  herbal  (unspecified)  and  herbal  and traditional medicine (unspecified). The patient experienced ( Event 1 ) Cerebral infarction, (Event 2) Carotid arteriosclerosis and ( Event 3 ) Carotid arteriosclerosis (Carotid plaque) .

Prior to the events of cerebral infarction and carotid arteriosclerosis, the most recent dose of faricimab was administered on Study Day 86 (Week 12). The patient had received a total of 4 injections of study treatment as of this Study Day.

On Study Day 100, the patient developed right-side numbness and slurred speech for 15 hours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An MRI showed a few bilateral acute and subacute cerebral  infarction and  lacunar  infarction  with white matter degeneration. On Study Day 110, the event of cerebral infarction was resolved, and the patient  was  discharged  from  the  hospital.  The  events  of  hyperlipidemia,  and  carotid  arteriosclerosis (both events) remained unresolved at the time of clinical cut-off. There was no change in the study treatment due to the events of cerebral infarction and carotid arteriosclerosis (both events).

The Investigator considered cerebral infarction and carotid arteriosclerosis both events unrelated to the  study  treatment and  related  to  other  causes  (unspecified).  At  the  time  of  clinical  cut-off,  the patient  continued  to  receive  study  treatment.  Further  updates  on  this  serious  event  were  received thereafter. Specifically, at the time of the primary analysis, the cerebral infarction event was reported as resolving. There was no change in study treatment and on Study Day 511, the cerebral infarction event was considered resolved.

There was also one 49-year-old Asian female patient with a cerebral infarction event in the aflibercept Q4W arm occurring on Study Day 95, unresolved by the primary analysis. At the end of the study the event was considered severe, non-serious and not suspected by the investigator to be related to the study treatment.

Further  updates  on  the  serious  events  occurring  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  through  Week  72  are provided below.

In Part 2 (Week 24 through Week 72), there was 1 patient (0.4%) in each treatment arm (faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively) who experienced a cerebral infarction event. The one event in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm occurred on Study Day 417 (Week 59) and was considered serious, suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment, and resolved by Week 72; the dose remained unchanged from the event.

For a 55-years-old Asian female in treatment arm B (Aflibercept) with dosage regimen of Aflibercept (2 mg IVT Q4W up to Week 20 followed by Faricimab PTI dosing of 6 mg IVT up to Week 68) (Study eye Right  eye  Event  [PT]),  following  randomisation  on  Study  Day  1.The  patient  was  diagnosed  with macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion(BRVO) of right eye on Study Day - 11.

No  non-ocular  medical/surgical  history  was  reported.  The  patients  non-ocular  concurrent  condition included  systemic  hypertension.  At  screening,  the  patients  BMI  was  23.7  kg/m2.  At  screening,  the vitals  showed  blood  pressure124/74  mmHg.  On  Study  Day  1,  the  patient  received  her  first  study treatment with aflibercept in the study eye. Concomitant medication, ongoing at Study Day 1, included captopril.

On  Study  Day  138  (Week  20),  the  patient  completed  treatment  with  aflibercept.  The  patient  had received a total of 6 injections of aflibercept. On Study Day 201 (Week 28), the patient received first study treatment with faricimab. The patient experienced the event of cerebral infarction.

Prior to the event of cerebral ischemia, the most recent and last dose of faricimab was administered on Study Day 394 (Week 56). The patient had received a total of 3 injections of faricimab as of this study Day.

On Study Day 417, a brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed left basal ganglia and coronary artery  radiation  infarction  and  she  was  diagnosed  with  severe  cerebral  infarction  (initial  intensity moderate, serious).

On Study Day 418, the patient was noted with worsening of hypertension (concurrent condition) to severe  intensity  (blood  pressure  not  reported  for  this  day;  non-serious,  unrelated).  She  also complained of right limb weakness for 18 hours. Subsequently, she was hospitalized due to cerebral infarction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On  Study  Day  420,  CT  angiography  of  the  head  and  neck  showed  cerebral  arteriosclerosis,  rough upper wall of left middle cerebral artery, carotid arteriosclerosis and tortuosity, embryonal posterior cerebral artery with vertebrobasilar dysplasia, and variation. It was reported that during hospitalization, she did not complain of obvious discomfort and her blood pressure was well controlled. On Study Day 426, she was discharged from the hospital (blood pressure upon discharge: 145/103 mmHg).

On Study Day 510, her blood pressure was 126/77 mmHg. On the same day (Study Day 510), the event  of  cerebral  infarction  was  considered  as  resolved.  The  event  of  hypertension  remained unresolved at the time of study completion.

On Study Day 510, the patient completed the study with the last dose of faricimab given on Study Day 394 (Week 56). The patient had received a total of 3 injections of faricimab.

The other cerebral infarction event in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in Part 2 is described above for another patient.

In the COMINO study, there was 1 patient (0.3%) who experienced a cerebral infarction event which occurred in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in Part 2. The event was considered non-serious, not suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment, and unresolved by Week 72.

There were no cerebral infarction events in Part 1 of the COMINO study.

The  CHMP  noted  that  all  cerebral  infarction  events  across  treatment  arms  in  the  BALATON  and COMINO studies above summarised were reported in Asian patients with a majority from China (5 out of 6 patients). However, other non-ocular non-fatal stroke adjudicated Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC)-defined arterial thromboembolic event (ATEs) (ischemic stroke, cerebrovascular accident, and haematoma) were reported in the other racial subgroups (i.e., white, unknown and black or African American). Furthermore, the APTC rates reported in the entire study were consistent with the previous faricimab Phase III studies in nAMD and DME, and the rate of non-fatal strokes observed in Part 2 was consistent with Part 1. RVO is associated with cardiovascular risk factors which are also well-known risks for strokes (refer to Question 20 for further details). Additionally, the overall rate is in line with event rates for cerebrovascular accidents in patients with RVO reported in the literature.

The MAH also highlighted that stroke remains the leading cause of death in China, with an estimated 2.5 million incident strokes and 1.6 million deaths related to stroke occurring each year (Kim et al. 2015).  A  study  estimated  that  the  incidence  rate  of  first-ever  stroke  in  China  (505.2  per  100  000 person-years for ages 40 years and older in 2020) was higher than that in Japan (317.0 per 100 000 person-years for ages 45 years and older in 2011), Singapore (229.6 per 100 000 population in 2017), and the European Union (Tu et al. 2023).

The  non-ocular  non-fatal  stroke  adjudicated  APTC-defined  ATEs  in  the  entire  pooled  BALATON  and COMINO studies were low across all racial subgroups (Table below).

The MAH provided  further details about the patient who suffered a second stroke. Based on available data, including Pop PK analysis, the CHMP concluded that no difference in safety profile across ethnic groups is anticipated. Nevertheless, the MAH should continue to closely monitor this topic, presenting focused  updates  in  future  PSURs,  discuss  /  propose  options  to  provide  (further)  longer-term  safety data for the RVO indication. In addition, the MAH was recommended to strengthen current warnings in the  PI  related  to  the  numbers  of  cases  of  APTC  events  (including  cases  of  cerebral  infarction considered causally related) reported in patients treated with faricimab (RVO indication). However, the MAH  was  rather  of  the  view  that  information  e.g.  in  SmPC  section  4.4  and  4.8  (under  'Systemic effects'  and  'Product-class-related  adverse  reactions,'  respectively)  about  Anti-Platelet  Trialists' Collaboration  (APTC)  events  reported  in  patients  treated  with  faricimab  was  sufficient:  APTC  rates reported  in  RVO  studies  were  low,  the  majority  considered  unrelated  to  faricimab  and  with  other plausible (causal) explanations for the related events.

The CHMP also noted that overall rates were consistent with those from the previous faricimab Phase III  studies  in  diabetic  macular  edema  (DME)  and  neovascular  age-related  macular degeneration (nAMD) and the incidence of APTC events reported from the Phase III RVO trials  with  aflibercept (VIBRANT and COPERNICUS; Brown et al. 2013, Campochiaro et al. 2015) and ranibizumab (BRAVO and CRUISE; FDA RVO Medical Review 2010). In summary, strengthening information in the PI for the RVO indication was not warranted for this potential risk in the RMP.

Through Week 72 of the pooled BALATON and COMINO studies, a total of 41 (3.2%) patients had an adjudicated  APTC  event  (18  patients  [2.8%]  in  the  faricimab  every  4  weeks  [Q4W]  to  faricimab personalized treatment interval [PTI] arm and 23 patients [3.6%] in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI  arm)  of  which  8  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment.  Of  the  8  patients  who  had  an adjudicated  APTC  event  considered  related  to  study  treatment,  3  patients  had  events  related  to faricimab and 3 patients had events related to aflibercept in Part 1. The remaining two patients were in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and had events related to faricimab in Part 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Over the entire RVO Phase III studies, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of APTC-defined arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) per 100 patient year (PY) was 2.20 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, which was consistent with the pooled faricimab arms in the other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 2.79 and nAMD: 1.71).

Since the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in the Entire Study group has the longest, continuous faricimab treatment duration of any of the groups, the pooled data from this group were used for the best comparison to faricimab treatment in the other indications (DME and nAMD).

The table below is a summary of all the adjudicated APTC events considered related to study treatment by the investigator, along with the other risk factors associated with these events for each patient.

It is also well described that a long-term impairment of retinal microvasculature could lead directly to cerebral small-vessel disease and is characterized by lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions (Lindley et al. 2009; Li et al. 2016).

A retrospective cohort study in Taiwan analyzed data for patients with RVO and their risk of ischemic stroke,  haemorrhagic  stroke,  and  all-cause  mortality  from  the  National  Health  Insurance  Research Database between January 2001 and December 2013 (Chen et al. 2018). Patients with RVO (22,919 patients)  were  compared  with  simple  randomly  sampled  non-RVO  group  without  matching  the characteristics of the RVO group (114,595 patients) and propensity score (PS)- matched non-RVO comparison group (114,595 patients). The mean follow-up period for patients with RVO was 4.8 ± 3.5 years. The incidence of ischemic stroke (per 100 PY) was 4.31 in the RVO group and 3.17 in the non-RVO group (PS-matched).

Furthermore, considering  the  rapid  plasma  clearance  (due  to  the  specifically  engineered  Fc  portion) which results in systemic plasma exposure approximately 6000-fold lower than in the vitreous humour, there is  no  evidence  suggesting  that  faricimab  increases  the  risk  of  systemic  APTC  events  including ischemic stroke beyond what has been described above.

As incidence of APTC events is in line with the other faricimab Phase III studies and RVO trials with aflibercept and ranibizumab, in addition to evidence that the risk of APTC events increases with age, other  comorbidities,  and  in  the  RVO  population,  the  MAH,  still,  did  not  believe  a  label  update  was required.  However,  it  proposed  to  continuously  monitor  APTC  events  (as  part  of  routine  signal detection) and include summary data in future PSURs.

The CHMP duly considered the MAH's position and information summarised below.

Through Week 72 of the pooled BALATON and COMINO studies, a total of 41 (3.2%) patients had an adjudicated  APTC  event  (18  patients  [2.8%]  in  the  faricimab  every  4  weeks  [Q4W]  to  faricimab personalized treatment interval [PTI] arm and 23 patients [3.6%] in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI  arm)  of  which  8  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment.  Of  the 8  patients who  had  an adjudicated  APTC  event  considered related  to  study  treatment ,  3  patients  had  events  related  to faricimab and 3 patients had events related to aflibercept in Part 1. The remaining two patients were in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and had events related to faricimab in Part 2.

Over the entire RVO Phase III studies, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of APTC-defined arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) per 100 patient year (PY) was 2.20 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm which was consistent with the pooled faricimab arms in the other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 2.79 and nAMD: 1.71).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additionally, it is known that in the general population, the incidence of APTC events increases with age and that patients with RVO are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events including stroke and myocardial infarction, as well as all-cause mortality compared to those without RVO.

The MAH outlined that the overall rates were consistent with those from the previous faricimab Phase III  studies  in  diabetic  macular  edema  (DME)  and  neovascular  age-related  macular  degeneration (nAMD) and the incidence of APTC events reported from the Phase III RVO trials with aflibercept.

Ultimately, on this basis, the CHMP reiterated the request to add RVO to the current warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC and any corresponding section of the PL. The MAH agreed.

## Systemic effects

The  CHMP  also  considered  (and  requested  to  reflect  accordingly  in  the  SmPC,  and  corresponding section  of  the  PL)  that  systemic  adverse  events  including  arterial  thromboembolic  events  were reported  following  intravitreal  injection  of  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  inhibitors  and there is a theoretical risk that these may be related to VEGF inhibition. A low incidence rate of arterial thromboembolic events was observed in the faricimab clinical trials in patients with nAMD, and DME, and  RVO.  Given  limited  data  on  the  safety  of  faricimab  treatment  in  DME  patients  with  high  blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mmHg) and vascular disease, and in nAMD and RVO patients ≥ 85 years of age, the MAH should maintain APTC events under focused review in future PSUR. The MAH agreed.

## Part 2

There  were 3  patients (0.5%)  and 8  patients (1.3%)  that  reported  non-fatal  stroke  adjudicated APTC-defined ATEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively. These events were RAO (2 patients in both arms), ischaemic stroke (1 patient each in both  arms), cerebrovascular  accident (2  patients  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm), cerebral  hematoma , cerebral  infarction, and cerebral  thrombosis (1  patient  each  in  the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm).  The  majority  (81.8%,  9/11)  were  not  suspected  by  the investigator to be related to study treatment and patients had risk factors for developing these events.

With regards to non-ocular events, the CHMP noted that, up to week 24, these AEs were generally reported  at  a  similar  rate  across  both  treatment  arms  in  the  phase  III  clinical  studies,  except  for 'hypertension' ,  with  a  higher  numerical  frequency  in  the  faricimab  treatment  arm  of BALATON study. The MAH further clarified that, in the absence of an imbalance of hypertension events in other population treated with faricimab (nAMD and DME) and as majority of the cases reported in faricimab RVO studies had risk factors associated with hypertension, the baseline medical history of patients with RVO, and the rates of hypertension in published data for this population, the numerically higher rate of hypertension events in the faricimab Q4W arm was considered as isolated findings in the BALATON study. The CHMP agreed. Nevertheless, this topic should continue to be (routinely) monitored.

The  Committee  also  noted  that  cases  reporting serious  non-ocular  events were  similar  across faricimab and aflibercept treatment arms in Part I of both COMINO and BALATON phase III studies.

Overall, to week 24 , the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of externally adjudicated APTC defined ATEs per 100 PY were 2.36 and 3.07, in faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. No major imbalances were observed in Part I of the clinical studies. The incidence of un-adjudicated ATE and cerebrovascular haemorrhage AEs was low and comparable across the two treatment arms (2.5% and 2.5% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms.

The per 1000 injection rate of AEs of ATE and cerebrovascular haemorrhage AEs were 5.69 and 6.83 in the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  The  MAH  provided  an  overview  and causality  assessment  of all  serious  non  ocular  events and  satisfactory  clarified  the  rationale  for categorising them as adjudicated APTC ATEs versus un-adjudicated ATE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Arterial  thromboembolic  events  and  central  nervous  system  haemorrhagic  events  are  known, important potential risks of faricimab. The MAH acknowledged that all  cerebral infarction events across treatment  arms  in  BALATON  and  COMINO  studies  of  interest  for  this  EoI  were  reported  in  Asian patients, with a majority from China (5 out of 6 patients). However, other non-ocular non-fatal stroke adjudicated Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC)-defined arterial thromboembolic event (ATEs) (ischemic  stroke,  cerebrovascular  accident,  and  haematoma)  were  reported  in  the  other  racial subgroups  (i.e.,  White,  unknown  and  black  or  African  American).  In  addition,  no  differences  in  the faricimab  safety  profile  across  ethnicity  are  anticipated  based  on  the  conclusions  from  the  PoP  PK analysis.

The  APTC  rates  reported  in  the  entire  study  were  consistent  with  the  previous  faricimab  Phase  III studies in nAMD and DME, and the rate of non-fatal strokes observed in Part 2 was consistent with Part 1. RVO is associated with cardiovascular risk factors which are also well-known risks for. Additionally, the overall rate is in line with event rates for cerebrovascular accidents in patients with RVO reported in the literature.

In  summary, in  Part 1 per the primary analysis, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates (events per 100 patient years) of externally adjudicated APTC events in the pooled BALATON and COMINO studies were comparable between treatment arms (2.36 in the faricimab Q4W arm and 3.07 in the aflibercept Q4W arm). In Part 2 from Week 24 to clinical cutoff  date  (CCOD)  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence rates (events per 100 patient years) of externally adjudicated APTC ATEs in the pooled BALATON and COMINO studies were 0.83 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 2.10 in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The  MAH  highlighted  that  although  a  numerical  difference  was  observed  in  the  exposure  adjusted incidence rates of externally adjudicated APTC defined ATEs per 100 PY, the incidence of patient with these events was low (2 patients [0.3%] in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 4 patients [0.7%] in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm).

In Part 2, from Week 24 to Week 72, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates (events per 100 patient years)  of  externally  adjudicated  APTC  events  in  the  pooled  BALATON  and  COMINO  studies  were consistent with Part 1 (and reported as 1.76 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 2.96 in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm).

Over  the  entire  study,  the  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  (events  per  100  patient  years)  of externally  adjudicated  APTC  ATEs  was  2.20  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  which  was consistent in the pooled faricimab arms in the other Phase III studies (nAMD: 1.71 and DME: 2.79). No new ADRs were identified using the criteria above for BRVO and C/HRVO, over and above those already identified during the nAMD and DME pivotal studies.

Whilst there are no specific new safety signals identified, this topic remains an area of special interest for the CHMP. Thus, the MAH should continue to closely monitor this issue and provide specific updates in future PSURs.

In addition, the MAH discussed the feasibility to obtain longer term data on non-ocular safety and APTC events.  The  MAH 72-week RVO data presented in the BALATON and COMINO CSRs, in combination with the DME and nAMD LTE studies, and existing routine pharmacovigilance activities (i.e., adverse reaction  reporting,  Guided  Questionnaires,  signal  detection  and  management  activities)  with  all relevant  safety  data,  reported  in  the  PBRER    have  been  considered  sufficient  to  provide    long-term safety and immunogenicity data for faricimab to cover the RVO indication for the following reasons:

· The commonality between the pathophysiology and risk factors in DME and RVO supports that data from LTE studies in DME is relevant to the RVO population.

·  Long-term  RWD studies  from  anti-VEGF  products  have  not  identified  a  difference  in  safety  profile between the DME and RVO population.

- Data obtained to date from the ongoing faricimab LTE studies in the DME and nAMD.

## Deaths

## Before week 24

In Part 1 (before Week 24 visit) of the pooled BALATON and COMINO studies, a total of 4 patients had fatal events (2 patients [0.3%] in the faricimab Q4W arm and 2 patients [0.3%] in the aflibercept Q4W arm). The number of deaths was low and balanced across both treatment arms and none of the deaths were suspected by the investigators to be related to study treatment. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates (events per 100 patient years) of deaths were 0.68 in the faricimab Q4W arm and 0.68 in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

## Week 24 through CCOD

Death was reported in 3 patients, 1 (0.2%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 2 (0.3%) in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm.  The  primary  causes  of  death  were  COVID-19  in  the faricimab  Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and coronary artery disease and death (verbatim: unexplained death) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm (please see the Table below). None of the deaths were  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  and  all  the  fatal  events  were confounded by either the underlying medical history of the patient or concurrent medical conditions.

## Pooled Dataset Part 2

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, 5 patients (0.8%) died in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm (death [verbatim: unexplained death; 2 patients], aortic dissection, COVID-19, and myocardial infarction [1 patient  each]),  and 3 patients (0.5%)  died  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  (death [verbatim: unexplained death], cardiac failure, and coronary artery disease [1 patient each].

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of deaths per 100 PY deaths was 0.88 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab  PTI  arm  and 0.59 in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm.  The  exposure-adjusted incidence rate of deaths per 100 PY in Part 2 was in line with the rate reported in Part 1 ( 0.68 in both the faricimab and the aflibercept arms).

With regards to fatal cases, the CHMP noted 3 additional cases reported from Part II of both clinical studies. Two of these cases occurred in the subgroup of patients who had received aflibercept in Part I of  the  study  and  had  been  switched  to  faricimab  PTI  in  part  I,I  and  one  case  was  reported  in  the faricimab 6mg Q4W group who had continued with faricimab 6mg PTI. The primary causes of death were  COVID-19  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  coronary  artery  disease  and  death (verbatim: unexplained death) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The MAH presented the total overall number of fatal cases in all patients exposed to faricimab (both part I exposure and part II exposure). A comparison was also provided highlighting those exposed to faricimab  only  in  Part  II.  Given  the  inherent  limitations  in  drawing  meaningful  conclusions  from  the non-comparator data from Part II of both studies, data were also provided as exposure-adjusted data.

A detailed update from the complete safety data set was subsequently presented by the MAH.

In the entire study dataset, 7 patients (1.1%) died in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 5 patients (0.8%) died in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of deaths per 100 PY was lower ( 0.81 ) compared with other faricimab Phase III studies ( DME: 2.53 and nAMD: 1.7) .

None of the deaths were suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment.

Therefore, it was agreed that no specific new safety issues arose from the cases presented. However, this matter should remain as a topic of special interest, closely monitored, and with regular updates presented in future PSURs.

## Immunogenicity

## Impact of Anti-Drug Antibody on Safety:

Through  Week  24, there  was  no  apparent  impact  of  ADAs  against  faricimab  observed  on  overall safety,  including IOI. However,  the  clinical  impact  of  ADA  status  on  safety  remained  unclear. Therefore, the potential risk of immunogenicity in the context of IOI should continue to be monitored through routine signal detection in all ongoing Phase III faricimab studies.

Through Week 24, 54 patients across BALATON and COMINO studies were ADA-positive , of which 6 (1.0%)  patients  were  treatment-unaffected  ADA-positive  and  48  (8.0%)  patients  were  treatmentemergent ADA-positive. The median time to onset of ADA was 24 weeks.

In the BALATON study the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs against faricimab was low (6.9%). No apparent influence of ADA on overall safety was observed based on the available data. Overall, the incidence of ocular and non-ocular AEs, SAEs, AESIs, and deaths were comparable between the pooled ADA-positive and ADA-negative subgroups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Through Week 24, the incidence of ocular AEs in the pooled ADA-positive subgroup was 22.2%, vs 20.1% in the pooled ADA-negative subgroup.

Of the patients who were ADA-positive and experienced ocular AEs, they were mainly non-serious, not suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment, did not result in study withdrawal, and were not associated with severe IOI events. The incidence of patients with ocular SAEs and AESIs in the pooled ADA-positive subgroup was 3.7% and 1.9% vs 1.7% and 1.3% in the pooled ADA-negative subgroup. The serious AEs in the ADA positive subgroup were RAO and uveitis, both in the COMINO study. The event of uveitis was diagnosed on Day 97 and was confirmed as ADA positive at Week 24, with a titer of 10240. The RAO was reported at the Week 4 visit, at which point the patient tested ADA negative, and therefore the event is unlikely to be related to ADA status. The patient subsequently tested ADA-positive at Week 24 with a titer of 20 All IOI cases were in the COMINO study.

Overall, the incidence of IOI was comparable between the ADA-positive subgroup (1 event of serious uveitis, moderate intensity; 1/54; 1.9% and in the ADA-negative subgroup (8/543; 1.5%).

From Week 24 to CCOD, 2 events of IOI were reported in ADA positive patients. One non-serious event of Iritis reported on Day 337 which was confirmed as ADA positive at Week 24 with a titer of 1280, and one serious event of Iritis reported on Day 220 which was confirmed as ADA positive at Week 24 with a titer of 1280. The remaining 3 IOI events reported were all ADA negative, but the ADA status post-Week 24 was not yet available at the time of authoring this AR. Thus, conclusions about the impact of ADAs on safety from Week 24 could not be made.

Overall, the CHMP noted that:

- the  incidence  of  IOI  events  was  higher  for  the  group  treated  with  faricimab  compared  to aflibercept in the Comino study (8 patients [2.2%] and 4 patients [1.1%], respectively).
- In  6  patients  the  IOI  event  occurred  shortly  (i.e. ≤ 10  days)  after  the  first  injection  of faricimab,  whereas  in  only  one  patient  the  IOI  occurred  soon  (i.e. ≤ 10  days)  after  first injection of aflibercept.

It was unclear why notable differences across the rate of IOI in the COMINO study to week 24 have been  observed  by  the  CHMP.  The  MAH    discussed  accordingly  this  observation,  clarifying  that, considering the overall low incidence of IOI, the comparability with previous registrational studies, and the  mild  clinical  presentation  of  the  events  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm,  the  current  data  does  not support a significant difference between treatment arms in Part 1 of COMINO (the treatment difference was 1.1%; 95% CI: -0.93%, 3.26%).

Limitations in the strategy for assessment of immunogenicity were noted by the CHMP. The incidence of ADAs through Week 24 was low and no apparent influence of ADA on overall safety or efficacy was observed,  based  on  available  data.  However,  most  of  the  patients  who  developed  ADAs  still  had persistent  ADAs  at  Week  24  (94.4%  in  the  BALATON  study,  and  96.7%  in  the  COMINO  study, respectively )and possibly beyond Week 24.

In Part 2 a higher incidence of IOI events in the study eye was again reported, consistently with Part 1, with 10 patients (2.8%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 5 patients (1.5%) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

The  MAH outlined  the  above  was  likely  related  to  the  greater  severity  of  underlying CRVO disease compared with BRVO and in line with what observed in historical RVO pivotal trials. Majority of cases were non-serious, mild and moderate in severity and with  no impact on visual outcomes. There was no clear relationship between injection day of study treatment and timing of the events observed, with the caveat that the number of IOI reported was small. There were no reported IOI events associated with retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease.

Additionally,  IOI  events  associated  with  significant  vision  loss  ( ≥ 15  letters  or ≥ 30 letters)  were infrequent (1 patient had a vision loss of ≥ 15 letters associated with a serious event of vitritis in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 1 patient had a vision loss of ≥ 15 letters associated with a non-serious event of iridocyclitis in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm).

By Week 72, majority of IOI events were resolved or resolving. Four events (vitritis, non-infectious endophthalmitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis [1 event each]) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 1 event of iridocyclitis in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm were not resolved by Week 72. Two of  these events occurred at the end of the study; and therefore, they were still ongoing at the last study visit. One event of vitritis resulted in study discontinuation.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of IOI events occurring in the study eye was low in both the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  ( 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively)

## Immunogenicity results

In the Balaton study the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs against faricimab from baseline to Week 72 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was low (11.7%). No apparent influence of ADA on systemic exposure or efficacy was observed based on the available data. The clinical significance of anti-faricimab antibodies on overall safety is unclear at this time. The uncertainty is related to the low incidence  of  immunogenicity  and  the  low  incidence  of  IOI,  for  which  all  the  events  were  of  mild severity and had a reversible character.

In  the Comino study the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs against faricimab from baseline to Week 72 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was low (16.5%). No apparent influence of ADA on  systemic  exposure  or  efficacy  was  observed  based  on  the  available  data.  Although a  higher incidence of IOI was observed in ADA-positive patients compared with ADA-negative patients, the clinical  significance  of  anti-faricimab  antibodies  on  overall  safety  is  unclear  at  this  time.  The uncertainty was  related to the low incidence of immunogenicity and the low incidence of IOI, for which majority of the events were of mild to moderate severity and had a reversible character.

An overall higher incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was noted in the COMINO study compared to the  BALATON study. This correlated  with  a  higher  incidence  of  IOI  events  reported  in  ADA  positive patients.  This  issue,  discussed  accordingly  by  the  MAH,  should  be  kept  under  monitoring  over  the longer term.

## Other Ocular Assessments from the Pooled Phase III RVO Studies

Overall, 9 patients (1.4%) and 20 patients (3.1%) experienced an intraocular pressure increase AE in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. One of the intraocular pressure increased AEs (in the aflibercept Q4W arm) was considered serious. This event was suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment and resolved by Week 24.

Overall, 7 patients (1.1%) and 3 patients (0.5%) developed ocular hypertension in the study eye in the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  None  of  ocular  hypertension  AEs  were considered serious, all events were mild or moderate in severity; all events in the faricimab Q4W arm had either recovered or were recovering by Week 24, and all events in the aflibercept Q4W arm had not recovered by Week 24. No patient and 4 patients (0.6%) developed glaucoma in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

One AE of open angle glaucoma in the faricimab Q4W arm and 1 AE of open angle glaucoma and 1 AE of borderline glaucoma in the aflibercept Q4W arm were also reported (all in the COMINO study). None of glaucoma AEs were considered serious.

## Week 24 through CCOD

Mean pre-dose IOP and mean IOP change from baseline over time from Week 24 through CCOD in the study eye were comparable across treatment arms. There was no observable increase in pre-dose IOP over time. Overall, mean IOP changes from pre-dose to post-dose by visit in both treatment arms,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  similar.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  mean  change  from  pre-dose  to post-dose  IOP  across  the  treatment  arms.  Overall,  13  patients  (2.1%)  and  11  patients  (1.9%) experienced an intraocular pressure increased AE in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm,  respectively.  None  of  the  events  were  serious. Overall, 4 patients (0.6%) and 4 patients (0.7%) developed ocular hypertension in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively. None of ocular hypertension AEs were considered serious. Overall, 5 patients (0.8%) and 5 patients (0.9%) developed glaucoma in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively. One AE of open angle glaucoma and 1 AE of borderline glaucoma in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm were also reported. None of glaucoma AEs were considered serious.

## Intraocular Pressure

Intraocular pressure (IOP) was comparable between treatment arms at baseline. Mean pre-dose IOP were comparable across  study  visits through  Week  72 with  mean  pre-dose  IOP  change  generally below 1 across visits for both arms. Overall, differences in pre-dose and post-dose IOP were within the limits  of  IOP  measurement  variability  and  consistent  with  expectations  of  IOP  change  following  an intravitreal injection, and no trend or pattern was observed.

In Part 2, AEs of IOP increased in the study eye were reported in 13 patients (4.8%) and 8 patients (3.0%)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  arm, respectively. All events were non-serious, and mild or moderate in severity.

Additionally, there were 2 AEs of ocular hypertension in the study eye reported in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. Both events were reported as non-serious.

There were 3 AEs of glaucoma in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. All were reported as non serious, and were also reported in the fellow eye.

## Slit Lamp Examination Through Week 24

The  proportion  of  patients  by  grade  for  the  worst  post-baseline  outcome  in  the  study  eye  through Week 24 on slit lamp examination including intraocular inflammation (anterior chamber cell, anterior chamber flare, and vitreous flare), cataract and vitreous haemorrhage were comparable across the two treatment arms.

## Week 24 through CCOD

There were 3 Grade 2 events of vitreous haemorrhage and 1 grade 3 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 1 grade 4 in aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. There were no post-baseline Grade 4 findings of anterior chamber cell, anterior chamber flare and vitreous cell in either arm.

Worst post-Week 24 findings in the study eye were cataract (1 patient and 3 patients with Grade 4 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively) and Grade 4+ vitreous haemorrhage (1 patient in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm).

## Indirect Ophthalmoscopy Through Week 24

The proportion of patients having any post-baseline retinal break or retinal detachment through Week 24  in  the  study  eye  were  low  and  comparable  across  the  treatment  arms.  At  baseline,  2  patients (0.3%) and 1 patient (0.2%) were reported to have a retinal break in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. At baseline, 8 patients (1.2%) and 8 patients (1.3%) were reported to have a retinal detachment in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. Five patients (0.8%) each in both the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms developed  any  post-baseline  retinal  break.  Six  (0.9%)  and  8  patients  (1.3%)  developed  any  postbaseline  retinal  detachment  in  the  study  eye  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively. The vast majority of cases were identified by the investigator as having a serous macular detachment or break secondary to macular edema due to RVO.

## Week 24 through CCOD

Overall, 1 patient (0.2%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm experienced any new or worsened retinal break or detachment in the study eye.

In Part  2 ,  one  patient  (0.4%)  experienced  a  post-Week  24  retinal  break  in  the  study  eye  in  the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm which was also reported as a mild and non-serious AE (retinal tear). One patient (0.4%) experienced a post-Week 24 rhegmatogenous detachment in the study eye in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm.  The  AE  of  rhegmatogenous  retinal  detachment  was reported  in  a  patient  with  worsening  of  cataract  who  underwent  cataract  surgery  after  which  he developed  rhegmatogenous  retinal  detachment.  Surgery  and  vitrectomy  were  performed.  At  the following  visit,  the  investigator  noticed  a  retinal  tractional  detachment.  This  was  not  assessed  as treatment  related.  The  study  treatment  was  interrupted,  the  patient  underwent  vitrectomy  and recovered.  One  patient  (0.4%)  experienced  a  post-Week  24  retinal  break  in  the  fellow  eye  in  the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

In  relation  to  the  available  safety  data,  from  ocular  assessments,  to  week  24,  the  CHMP  noted  a relatively small number of patients who had developed AEs relating to increases in IOP, which were generally similar if not slightly higher in the aflibercept treatment group (faricimab Q4W n=9 patients (1.4%) and aflibercept Q4W n=20 patients (3.1%).

7  patients  (1.1%)  and  3  patients  (0.5%)  developed  ocular  hypertension  in  the  study  eye  in  the faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  These  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in severity.

Non-serious  cases  of  glaucoma  were  reported  in  n=0  patients  (faricimab  Q4W)  and  N=4  patients (aflibercept Q4W arms 0.6%).

Based on the currently available data to CCOD, overall, 13 patients (2.1%) and 11 patients (1.9%) experienced an intraocular pressure increased AE in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm,  respectively.  None  of  the  events  were  serious. Overall,  4  patients  (0.6%)  and  4  patients  (0.7%)  developed  non-serious  ocular  hypertension  in  the study  eye  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm, respectively.

Cases reporting non-serious glaucoma were noted in equal numbers n= 5 patients (0.8%) and n=5 patients (0.9%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively.

Overall, no major imbalances were observed.

## Laboratory findings

There were no clinically relevant imbalances across treatment arms for laboratory parameters.

## Safety in special populations

No patient became pregnant during the study.

## Subgroup Analyses

Analyses were performed to examine key safety across the subgroups defined by the following intrinsic factors, before the Week 24 visit:

- Age  ( &lt; 65 and ≥ 65)Age ( &lt; 75 and ≥ 75)
- Age ( &lt; 85 and ≥ 85);
- Gender (female and male).
- Race (White, Asian and other); and
- Medical history (renal disease, cardiac disease, and vascular disease)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  in  the  pooled  data,  differences  in  incidences  of  ocular  AEs,  incidences  of  non-ocular  AEs, incidences of SAEs, and incidences of ocular AESI between the faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W  arm  were  consistent  across  subgroups  and  with  incidences  in  the  overall  safety-evaluable population.

Overall, the MAH highlighted that there were no clinically meaningful differences in ocular and nonocular  safety  between  the  Hispanic  and  non-Hispanic  subgroups.  While  there  appears  to  be  some numerical differences in the proportions of ocular AEs and non-ocular AEs between the ethnic groups, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions due to the small number of events within the Hispanic subgroup  and  the  limitation  that  baseline  characteristics  may  not  be  well  balanced  between  the Hispanic and non Hispanic subgroups. Additionally, popPK analysis has shown no effect of race on the pharmacokinetics (ocular and systemic) of faricimab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP noted the analyses across various subgroups for age, gender, race and relevant medical history up to week 24. Although no major differences between faricimab and aflibercept were noted across  most of  the  various  subgroups,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  further  discuss  any  potential  adverse effect of ethnicity, particularly on the ocular safety of faricimab, based on their available safety data.

The  non-ocular  non-fatal  stroke  adjudicated  APTC-defined  ATEs  in  the  entire  pooled  BALATON  and COMINO studies were low across all racial subgroups. Additionally, the Pop PK analysis did not show any effect  of  race  on  the  pharmacokinetics  (ocular  and  systemic)  of  faricimab.  Therefore,  based  on faricimab PK, no differences are expected.

In conclusion, the CHMP agreed that the MAH's available safety data did not suggest an association between faricimab safety profile and ethnicity.

The MAH was also requested to provide a subgroup analysis of the data from Part 2 of the clinical studies where pointed out that subgroups are generally consistent with the overall rates and across subgroups. While there appear to be some numerical differences in the proportions of ocular AEs, nonocular  AEs,  and  serious  AEs  by  subgroup,  the  CHMP  agreed  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any  meaningful conclusions  due  to  the  small  number  of  events  within  each  subgroup.  However,  this  topic  should continue to be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No interaction studies have been conducted with this application.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the Balaton study in the ITT population, 12 patients (2.2%) discontinued study treatment with a comparable proportion between treatment arms (3.3% of patients in the faricimab Q4W arm and 1.1% of patients in the aflibercept Q4W arm). The reasons for study treatment discontinuation were lost to follow-up  (1.8%  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  0.7%  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  arm),  withdrawal  by subject (0.7% in the faricimab Q4W arm and 0.4% in the aflibercept Q4W arm), adverse event (0.4% in the faricimab Q4W arm) and death (0.4% in the faricimab Q4W arm).

The incidence of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was low (1 patient in each arm). There were no ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation. The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation  was  low  (2  patients  and  1  patient  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively).

There were no ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation. One patient in the faricimab Q4W arm died on Day 162. The patient's treatment discontinuation date was derived as the last treatment day (Day 132),  which  was  before  the  start  of  the  Week  24  window  (Day  154);  therefore,  the  patient  was counted as discontinued study treatment. The patient's study discontinuation date was Day 162, which was beyond the analysis date of Day 154.

Overall, in Balaton study in the ITT population, 10.9% of patients discontinued study treatment prior to Week 72: 11.6% of patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 10.2% of patients in the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm;  as  reported  in  the  Primary  CSR,  3.3%  and  1.1%  of  patients discontinued  study  treatment  prior  to  Week  24  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively.  Overall,  11.6%  of  patients  withdrew  from  the  study  prior  to  Week  72:  11.2%  in  the faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  11.9%  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm;  as previously  reported  1.3%  and  1.4%  discontinued  from  the  study  prior  to  Week  24  in  the  faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. In the Comino study, the incidence of all AEs (ocular and  non-ocular  AEs)  leading  to  study  treatment  discontinuation  was  low  across  treatment  arms  (3 patients in each arm).

The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was low across treatment arms (3  patients  [0.8%]  and  2  patients  [0.6%]  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms, respectively).  Ocular  AEs  leading  to  study  treatment  discontinuation  were  uveitis  (2  patients)  and rhegmatogenous  retinal  detachment  (1  patient)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  and  endophthalmitis  (1 patient) and RVO (1 patient) in the aflibercept Q4W arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of non-ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation was low across treatment arms (1 patient [0.3%] and 3 patients [0.8%] in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

## AEs  and  Ocular  AEs  Leading  to  Study  Treatment  or  Study  Discontinuation  Pooled  Part  2 Dataset

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was low in both treatment arms. All these events were single events that occurred in 1 patient each, with the exception of vitritis that occurred in 2 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation was also low in both treatment arms (3 patients [0.5%] in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 2 patients [0.3%] in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively; All these events were single events that occurred in 1 patient each.

## Entire Study

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was low with 1.2%. The most common ocular AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation ( ≥ 2 patients in any arm of pooled Entire Study dataset) were uveitis (3 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm) and vitritis (2 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The incidence of ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was low with 0.6%. All these events were single events that occurred in 1 patient each.

In summary, the CHMP noted that the overall incidence of ocular and non-ocular AEs leading to study discontinuation  was  low  across  treatment  arms.  The  most  common  ocular  AEs  leading  to  study treatment  discontinuation  ( ≥ 2  patients  in  any  arm  of  pooled  entire  study  dataset)  were uveitis (3 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm) and vitritis (2 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

## Post marketing experience

Faricimab has been approved in more than 50 countries worldwide to date. As of 27 January 2023, the total  estimated  cumulative  patient  exposure  to  faricimab  from  clinical  trials  (5,043  patients)  and marketing experience (90,859 patients) is 95,902 patients.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

At the time of the initial submission of this application to extend the indication for use of faricimab in patients with RVO, the full safety data set from the pivotal clinical studies in patients with RVO was not yet available. The overall safety profiles of faricimab and aflibercept were generally comparable in Part 1 of the RVO pivotal studies to week 24. Based on the data to week 24, the overall incidence of ocular AEs in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W arm was comparable to the aflibercept Q4W arm (20.1% and 24.6% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively).

There was some uncertainty in relation to the conclusions on clinical safety of faricimab beyond 24 weeks treatment in this indication as there was no comparator arm beyond this timepoint and patients in  part  2  of  both  phase  III  studies  were  treated  with  faricimab  PTI  so  some  ADR  reports  are confounded by some patients having received aflibercept in the 1st part of the RVO studies and then patients  were  subsequently  exposed  to  faricimab  in  Part  2  of  the  studies.  In  this  context,  the  MAH presented thereafter, as requested, the complete safety data set to facilitate the safety evaluation of the longer-term safety profile of faricimab in this indication.

In addition, at the time of the initial assessment, it was unclear how many patients were treated under each different dosing regimen as part of Faricimab PTI dosing and how many AEs were reported within the individual treatment schedules. This was further clarified by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the Balaton study  the  potential  to  extend  treatment  intervals  with  faricimab  up  to  Q16W  was demonstrated, with approximately 60% of patients on an extended dosing interval of Q12W or Q16W at Week 68, resulting in approximately 5 mean injections in study Part 2. In the Comino study, the potential to extend  treatment  intervals  with  faricimab  up  to  Q16W  was  demonstrated,  with approximately 48% of patients on an extended dosing interval of Q12W or Q16W at Week 68, resulting in approximately 5.5 mean injections in study Part 2.

Broadly speaking, the safety data provided in Part  2 of  the  pivotal  studies  indicates  that  faricimab continues to be generally well tolerated. However, a number of uncertainties and points for clarification remained outstanding. As noted in the RVO initial clinical overview (CO), a slightly higher incidence of ocular  AEs  (including  ocular  SAEs)  in  both  treatment  arms  continued  to  be  reported  in  Part  2  in COMINO (C/HRVO) compared with BALATON (BRVO) which is consistent with historical  RVO  pivotal trials.  Some  uncertainties  relating  to  longer  term  ocular  and  non-ocular  safety,  in  addition  to immunogenicity, also remain.

## Extent of exposure

In  the Balaton study the  majority  of  randomized  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study treatment (550 patients; 3 randomized patients did not receive any treatment and were excluded from the safety evaluable population).

As  expected,  due  to  study  design,  in  study  Part  1,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  (20.1  weeks), mean (5.8) and median (6.0) number of study drug administrations through Week 24 was the same for both treatment arms. In study Part 2, the median duration of exposure was 42.3 weeks and 37.8 weeks in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

The treatment exposure is longer in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm than the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm because the exposure is counted from Week 24 for the faricimab arm, and from the first faricimab dose on or after Week 24 for the aflibercept arm. While the faricimab PTI dosing regimen started at Week 24, most patients did not receive faricimab at Week 24 (7% [19/270] and 9%  [24/267]  received  a  faricimab  dose  at  Week  24  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively; the other patients received sham at Week 24).

The  mean  (median)  number  of  study  drug  administrations  were  4.8  (4.0)  and  4.9  (4.0)  in  the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively.

In the COMINO study the majority of randomized patients received at least one dose of study drug (726  patients;  3  randomized  patients  did  not  receive  any  treatment  and  were  excluded  from  the safety-evaluable population). As expected due to study design, the median duration of exposure (20.1 weeks), mean (5.7) and median (6.0) number of study drug administrations through Week 24 was the same for both treatment arms.

In study Part  2 ,  the median duration of exposure was 42.3 weeks and 38.6 weeks in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, respectively. The treatment exposure is  longer  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  than  the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm because the exposure is counted from Week 24 for the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, and from the first faricimab dose on or after Week 24 for the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. While the faricimab PTI dosing regimen started at Week 24, most patients did not receive faricimab at Week 24 (11% [39/359]  and  12%  [40/342]  received  a  faricimab  dose  at  Week  24  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms,  respectively;  the  other  patients  received sham at Week 24). The mean (median) number of study drug administrations were 5.6 (5.0) and 5.5 (4.0)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm, respectively.

In the entire study dataset, the median duration of exposure was 68.1 weeks in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms (and the same duration in each study); the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mean (median) number of study treatment administrations (i.e., faricimab or aflibercept) in the pooled dataset  was  the  same  in  each  treatment  arm  (10.8  [10.0];  the  mean  (median)  number  of  study treatment administrations was comparable between the BALATON and COMINO studies: 10.3 (9.0) and 11.2 (10.0) vs. 10.6 (10.0) and 10.9 (10.0) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

In the All  Faricimab dataset, the median duration of exposure to faricimab was 44.1 weeks (same duration in each study); the mean (median) number of faricimab administrations in the pooled dataset was 8.1 (9.0) and was comparable between the studies (7.7 [9.0] in the BALATON  study and 8.4 [9.0] in the COMINO study.

A total of 1,282 patients (553 in the  BALATON study and 729 in the COMINO study) were enrolled in the  two  studies,  with  1,276  patients  treated  with  at  least  one  dose  through  week  24  (641  with faricimab). Patient ages ranged from 28 to 93 with a mean [SD] of 64 [10.7] years, and 22 to 100 with a mean [SD] of 65 [13.2] years in the BALATON and COMINO studies, respectively.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, 1,238 patients received at least one dose of faricimab (629 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 609 patients in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and the mean (median) number of faricimab administrations was similar in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms (5.3 [4.0] and 5.2 [4.0], respectively).

In the separate studies, the mean (median) number of faricimab injections administered in Part 2 was generally comparable: in the BALATON study it was  4.8 (4.0) and 4.9 (4.0) vs. COMINO 5.6 (5.0) and 5.5  (4.0)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm, respectively.

While focus is on the pooled Part 2 dataset (Week 24 through Week 72), of note, the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in the entire study group has the longest, continuous faricimab treatment duration of any of the safety groups and it is therefore reasonable that these data can be used to support the consistency of safety profile in RVO with that in the DME (100 Weeks) and nAMD (112 Weeks), using exposure-adjusted AE rates from the faricimab arms in the other Phase III trials.

## Ocular AEs

In  relation  to ocular  AEs ,  the  overall  rates  observed  across  the  pooled  phase  III  studies  were generally balanced between faricimab and aflibercept to week 24.The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of ocular AEs per 100 PY was generally consistent with Part 1 for both arms (65.23 and 71.53 in the pooled  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  in  Part  2, respectively and 63.60 and 76.31 in the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms in Part 1, respectively.

There was a higher incidence of ocular events in patients treated at the Q4W dosing interval compared to the Q16W dosing interval within each treatment arm. The higher incidence could be explained by a worse RVO disease status requiring more injections compared to the other dosing intervals throughout the study. The incidence of events in patients treated at the Q8W and Q12W dosing intervals should be interpreted with caution due to the comparatively low sample size.

Overall,  considering  the  limitations  of  the  by treatment  interval  analysis ,  the  safety  profile  of faricimab remained similar across all treatment interval subgroups, and the nature and type of nonocular AEs and ocular AEs in the study eye reported in patients assigned to Q8W, Q12W, and Q16W dosing  was  similar.  By  comparison,  limited  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  the  data  provided  in patients treated with the Q8W and Q12W dosing intervals due to the low sample size.

In this context the limitations of the safety data in the RVO population should be reflected/strengthened in the PI, particularly for specific dosing regimens where safety data is currently limited.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the BALATON, study there was an increased incidence of AEs and SAEs is observed in Part 2 (Week 24 through Week 72) compared to Part 1 (baseline through Week 24) as expected with the increased follow-up time, the safety results after treatment with a faricimab PTI dosing regimen were consistent with the safety results observed in Part 1, with faricimab continuing to be generally well tolerated with a low incidence of AEs leading to study treatment withdrawal.

In Part 2 , the most common ocular AEs in the study eye (2% incidence in any treatment arm) by PT were: conjunctival haemorrhage, IOP increased, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, RVO  [verbatim:  worsening  of  CRVO,  worsening  of  BRVO,  exacerbation  of  BRVO,  superior  BRVO, accelerated worsening of BRVO, RVO aggravated], macular oedema [verbatim: worsening of MO], and epiretinal membrane. Information relating to these ocular ADRs is reflected accordingly in the PI.

In the BALATON study, in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, 35.7% of patients and 26.2% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the Q4W and Q16W dosing intervals, respectively. In the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, 34.4% of patients and 22.4% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the Q4W and Q16W dosing intervals, respectively.

Ocular AEs in the study eye which contributed to the higher incidence of AEs in patients treated at the faricimab  PTI  Q4W  dosing  interval  compared  to  faricimab  Q16W  in  either  treatment  arm  (2% difference  between  Q4W  and  Q16W  interval  in  either  treatment  arms)  were:  intraocular  pressure increased, conjunctival  haemorrhage,  cataract,  macular  oedema,  retinal  vein  occlusion,  retinal haemorrhage,  cystoid  macular  oedema,  retinal  ischaemia,  visual  acuity  reduced,  and  glaucoma.  As expected, the rates of ocular AEs in the Q4W dosing regimen were mainly driven by disease worsening of  cystoid  macular  oedema,  retinal  vein  occlusion  and  disease  complication  (e.g.,  glaucoma,  retinal haemorrhage, retinal ischaemia).

Ocular AEs in the study eye in Q8W and Q12W varied across treatment arms (30.3% of patients and 47.7% of patients for Q8W and 27.6% of patients and 43.5% of patients for Q12W in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively) which was likely due to the small sample size.

In the COMINO study an increased incidence of AEs and SAEs is observed in Part 2 (Week 24 through Week 72) compared to Part 1 (baseline through Week 24) as expected with the increased follow-up time, the safety results after treatment with a faricimab PTI dosing regimen were consistent with the safety results observed in Part 1, with faricimab continuing to be generally well tolerated with a low incidence of AEs leading to study treatment withdrawal.

In Part 2 the most common ocular AEs in the study eye (2% incidence in any treatment arm) by PT were:  IOP  increased,  cataract,  cystoid  macular  oedema  [verbatim:  worsening  of  CMO],  macular oedema  [verbatim:  worsening  of  MO],  RVO  [verbatim:  worsening  of  CRVO,  worsening  of  BRVO, exacerbation of BRVO, superior BRVO, accelerated worsening of BRVO, RVO aggravated], conjunctival haemorrhage, dry eye, epiretinal membrane, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and glaucoma.

In the COMINO study, in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, 48.2% of patients and 27.9% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the Q4W and Q16W dosing interval, respectively. In the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm, 39.6% of patients and 29.3% of patients experienced at least one ocular AE in the Q4W and Q16W dosing interval, respectively.

Ocular AEs in the study eye which contributed to the higher incidence of AEs in patients treated at the faricimab  PTI  Q4W  dosing  interval  compared  to  faricimab  Q16W  in  either  treatment  arm  (2% difference between Q4W and Q16W interval in either treatment arms) were: cataract, cystoid macular oedema, macular oedema, retinal  vein  occlusion,  epiretinal  membrane,  glaucoma,  vitreous  floaters, retinal neovascularization, and iritis. As expected, the rates of ocular AEs in the Q4W dosing regimen were  mainly  driven  by  disease  worsening  of  cystoid  macular  oedema,  retinal  vein  occlusion,  and macular oedema events and study disease complication (e.g., glaucoma, epiretinal membrane).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three  cases  of  iritis were reported in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm in the Q4W dosing subgroup;  however,  no  clear  relationship  could  be  established  between  time  of  injection  and  event onset. Notably, one case of iritis was reported in the Q16W dosing regimen subgroup.

Ocular  AEs in  the  study  eye  in  Q12W  varied  across  treatment  arms  (21.4%  of  patients  in  the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 51.4% of patients in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm) which was likely due to the small sample size.

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm representing  the  longer-term  safety  data  for  faricimab  was 43.2% . The  majority  of  RVO  disease worsening  events  (i.e.  worsening  of  RVO,  MO  and  CMO)  were  reported  as  non-serious,  mild,  and resolved by the end of the study. In the entire study dataset, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of  ocular  AEs per  100  PY  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  was 65.96. This  rate  was consistent with the other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 56.88 and nAMD: 68.90 ).  The rates of ocular AEs per 1000 injections in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 82.18. This rate was consistent with the other pooled faricimab treatment arms in the Phase III studies (DME: 81.68 and nAMD: 131.73).

The ADRs that were reported with a frequency of ≥ 1% in the BRVO and C/HRVO in the All faricimab group at Week 72 were conjunctival haemorrhage, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, eye pain, and IOP increased.

The most common pooled serious ADRs in the RVO indications ( ≥ 2 patients) by PT were uveitis (3 patients  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  for  C/HRVO), cataract (1  patient  each  in  the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm for BRVO and C/HRVO, respectively), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1 patient  each  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  for  BRVO  and  C/HRVO, respectively), and vitreous haemorrhage (2 patients in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm for C/HRVO). The majority  of  the  serious  ADRs  resolved,  resolved  with  sequelae,  or  were  resolving  by Week 72 for BRVO and C/HRVO events, with the exception of cataract and vitritis ).

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious ocular AEs per 100 PY in Part 2 was consistent with Part 1 for both arms ( 5.82 and 2.96 in the pooled faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms in Part 2, respectively and 5.38 and 4.77 in the pooled faricimab and aflibercept arms in Part 1, respectively. In the entire study dataset, the incidence of serious ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 6.4%. The rates of ocular SAEs were mainly driven by the disease  worsening  of RVO (1.2%), CMO (1.1%),  and MO (0.6%).  The  majority  were  resolved  or resolving  by  the  end  of  the  study  (Week  72)  and  had  no  lasting  impact  on  the  patient's  long-term vision.

## AESIs

In part 1 the incidence of AESIs in the study eye in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms was 16 patients [2.5%] and 4 patients [0.7%], respectively.

In the BALATON study the incidence of ocular AESIs in the study eye was low across both arms (1 patient  [0.4%]  each).  One  patient  in  each  treatment  arm  experienced  an  ocular  AESI  (macular oedema in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and cataract in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI  arm)  causing  a  decrease  of  30  letters  in  VA  score  lasting  more  than  1  hour.  No  patients experienced an event in the other AESI categories of 'associated with severe intraocular inflammation' or 'required surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight'.

In the COMINO study ocular AESIs in the study eye occurred in 21 patients [5.8%] in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 9 patients [2.6%] in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fifteen  patients  (4.2%)  and  7  patients  (2.0%)  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm,  respectively,  experienced  an  ocular  AESI  in  the  study  eye causing a decrease of ³30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour.

The most common sight-threatening AEs in the study eye that caused a decrease of ³30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour were almost all associated with disease worsening.

In  the pooled  Part  2 dataset  the  majority  of  the  ocular  AESIs  in  the  study  eye  occurred  in  the COMINO study; the majority of these events were associated with study disease worsening and were resolved or resolving by the end of study.

Sixteen patients (2.5%) and 8 patients (1.3%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively, experienced an ocular AESI causing a decrease of ≥ 30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour. The majority were resolved or resolving by the end of the study.

Six patients (1.0%) and 1 patient (0.2%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab  PTI  arms,  respectively,  experienced  an  ocular  AESI  that  required  surgical  or  medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight. Four out of seven events were resolved by the end of the studies.  One patient in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm experienced an event in the AESI category of 'associated with severe IOI' (endophthalmitis). This event was resolved by the end of the study.

In  the  entire  study  dataset,  the  incidence  of  AESIs  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  was 4.7%. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AESIs per 100 PY in the Faricimab Q4W to Faricimab PTI arm was 3.71). This rate was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 3.05 and nAMD: 2.09) The rates of ocular AEs per 1000 injections in the Faricimab Q4W to Faricimab PTI arm was 4.62 This rate was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 4.38 and nAMD: 3.99).

## IOI events

In the BALATON study the incidence of IOI events occurring in the study eye was low (2 patients [0.7%]  and  3  patients  [1.1%]  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to faricimab PTI arms, respectively). All the IOI events in the study eye were reported as non-serious and mild. There were no IOI events associated with retinal occlusive disease, and no reported events of retinal vasculitis or retinal occlusive vasculitis based on reported PTs in Part 1 or in Part 2. None of the IOI  events  was  associated  with  a  sustained  vision  loss  of  15  letters  or  30  letters.  No  events  of endophthalmitis in the study eye were reported in either arm.

In the COMINO study it was critically noted that in part 1 the incidence of IOI events was higher for the group treated with faricimab compared to aflibercept in the Comino study (8 patients [2.2%] and 4 patients [1.1%], respectively). It is further noted that in 6 patients the IOI event occurred shortly (i.e. ≤10 days) after the first injection of faricimab, whereas in only one patient the IOI occurred soon (i.e. ≤10 days) after first injection of aflibercept.

In Part  2 a higher incidence of IOI events in the study eye was again reported which is consistent with Part 1 with 10 patients (2.8%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 5 patients (1.5%) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms.

The  MAH  outlined  that  this  is  likely  related  to  the  greater  severity  of  underlying CRVO disease compared with BRVO and that this is in line with what has been observed in historical RVO pivotal trials. The majority of cases were non-serious and mild and moderate in severity and had no impact on visual  outcomes.  There  was  no  clear  relationship  between  injection  day  of  study  treatment  and  the timing of the events observed with the caveat that the number of IOI events reported was small. There were no reported IOI events associated with retinal vasculitis or occlusive disease.

Additionally,  IOI  events  associated  with  significant  vision  loss  ( ≥ 15  letters  or ≥ 30 letters)  were infrequent (1 patient had a vision loss of ≥ 15 letters associated with a serious event of vitritis in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 1 patient had a vision loss of ≥ 15 letters associated with a non-serious event of iridocyclitis in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm).

By Week  72, the  majority  of IOI events  were  resolved  or  resolving. Four  events (vitritis,  noninfectious endophthalmitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis [1 event each]) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 1 event of iridocyclitis in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm were not resolved by Week 72. Two of these events occurred at the end of the study and therefore were still ongoing at the last study visit. One event of vitritis resulted in study discontinuation.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of IOI events occurring in the study eye was low in both the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  ( 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively)

In the Entire Study dataset, the incidence of IOI in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 3.0%. The IOI incidence was higher in CRVO, but it is important to note that the majority of the IOI events reported in the  COMINO study were non-serious, mild or moderate in severity, and had no impact on visual  outcomes.  There  was  no  clear  relationship  between  injection  day  of  study  treatment  and  the timing  of  the  events  observed  with  the  caveat  that  the  number  of  IOI  reported  were  small. Nevertheless,  this  is  a  topic  which  requires  ongoing  monitoring  and  further  characterization  of  the longer term safety profile specific to the proposed new indication.

The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of IOIs per 100 PY in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 2.67. This rate was somewhat consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies but it is notable that  the  overall  exposure  adjusted  incidence  rate  of  IOIs  in  the  RVO  indication  is  noted  to  be numerically  higher  than  the  rates  in  other  approved  indications  (DME:  1.13  and  nAMD:  1.94).  This topic requires continuous monitoring.

## Immunogenicity

In the Balaton study the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs against faricimab from baseline to Week 72 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was low (11.7%). No apparent influence of ADA on systemic exposure or efficacy was observed based on the available data. The clinical significance of anti-faricimab antibodies on overall safety is unclear at this time. The uncertainty is related to the low incidence  of  immunogenicity  and  the  low  incidence  of  IOI,  for  which  all  the  events  were  of  mild severity and had a reversible character.

In  the Comino study the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs against faricimab from baseline to Week 72 in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was also low (16.5%). No apparent influence of ADA on systemic exposure or efficacy was observed based on the available data. Although a  higher incidence of IOI was observed in ADA-positive patients compared with ADA-negative patients, the clinical  significance  of  anti-faricimab  antibodies  on  overall  safety  is  unclear  at  this  time.  The uncertainty is related to the low incidence of immunogenicity and the low incidence of IOI, for which the majority of the events were of mild to moderate severity and had a reversible character.

An overall higher incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was noted in the COMINO study compared to the  BALATON study. This correlated  with  a  higher  incidence  of  IOI  events  reported  in  ADA  positive patients. This issue requires ongoing monitoring over the longer term.

## Non-ocular safety

## BALATON

The incidence of non-ocular AEs was comparable between treatment arms (32.6% and 35.4% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively). A higher incidence of events occurred in the faricimab Q4W arm compared with the aflibercept Q4W arm in the Vascular Disorders system organ class (SOC; 6.5% vs. 3.6% in  the  faricimab  Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively), mainly driven by patients with hypertension events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Part 1 (before Week 24 visit) the incidence of hypertension events was higher in the faricimab Q4W arm (20 patients [7.2%]) compared to the aflibercept Q4W arm (7 patients [2.6%]) All events were reported as non-serious and none were assessed as related to the study treatment by the investigators or  required  a  change  in  study  treatment.  In Part  2 ,  (Week  24  to  Week  72):  the  incidence  of hypertension events were 14 patients (5.2%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 8 patients (3.0%) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

In  the COMINO study,  the  incidence  of  non-ocular  AEs  was  comparable  between  treatment  arms (33.2% and 37.1% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively). A higher incidence of  events  occurred  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  arm  in  the  Nervous  System  Disorder  system  organ  class (SOC; 5.8% vs. 3.0% in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; with no single PT driving the difference).

Across both phase III studies, non-ocular AEs were generally reported at a similar rate across both treatment arms up to week 24. The exception is reports of ' hypertension' which were reported with a higher numerical frequency in the faricimab treatment arm in the BALATON study. Although some of the relevant cases had confounding factors, as requested the MAH discussed and clarified further why this imbalance might have occurred and has provided an update on cases reporting 'hypertension' from the full data set.

Overall,  in  the  All  faricimab  group  43 hypertension events  were  reported  in  40  patients  receiving faricimab through Week 72. All of the events were reported as non-serious with the majority being of mild (n=25/43) or moderate (n=17/43) severity. None of the 43 events were assessed as related to the study treatment by the investigators or required a change in study treatment.

In  the  absence  of  an  imbalance  of  hypertension  events  in  other  population  treated  with  faricimab (nAMD and DME) and considering that (1) majority of the cases reported in the faricimab RVO studies had risk factors associated with the events of hypertension, and that (2) the baseline medical history of  patients  with  RVO,  and  (3)  the  rates  of  hypertension  in  published  data  for  this  population,  the numerically higher rate of hypertension events in the faricimab Q4W arm was considered by the MAH as isolated findings in the BALATON study.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for RVO; the overall rate of hypertension reported in Balaton and COMINO was in line or lower than published data in this patient population.

## Non-Ocular AEs Pooled Part 2 Dataset

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of non-ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arms  was 52% and 49.3%, respectively.  The  majority  of non-ocular AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Consistent with Part 1, the most common non-ocular AEs in Part 2 ( ≥ 2% incidence in any treatment arm of the pooled Part 2 dataset: faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively) by PT were COVID-19 (12.4% and 11.7%), nasopharyngitis (2.9% and 4.3%), hypertension (4.3% and 2.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.2% and 2.8%), back pain (2.4% and 1.3%), and influenza (1.9% and 2.6%).

In the pooled  Part  2 dataset, the exposure-adjusted incidence  rate  of  non-ocular  AEs per  100 patient  years  was  consistent  with  Part  1. ( 145.10 and 141.68 in  the  pooled  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab PTI and the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms in Part 2, respectively; and 126.19 and 156.02 in the pooled faricimab and the aflibercept arms in Part 1 , respectively.

In the entire study dataset, the incidence of non-ocular AEs in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 63.2%. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of non-ocular AEs per 100 PY was 140.50 which was consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 172.42 and nAMD: 139.29).

The incidence of serious  non-ocular  AEs was low and comparable between the treatment arms (9 patients [3.3%] and 16 patients [5.8%] in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; The most common ( ≥ 1% of patients in any arm) was cerebral infarction (3 events in the faricimab Q4W  arm;  All  cerebral  infarction  events  were  reported  as  severe,  of  which 2  were  assessed  as related  to  the  study  treatment and 1 assessed as related to other cause (concurrent illness)-see LoQ.

Cases  reporting serious  non-ocular  events were  similar  across  the  faricimab  and  aflibercept treatment  arms  in  Part  I  of  both  phase  III  studies.  Of  note, three  serious cases  of cerebral infarction were  reported  in  the  faricimab  treatment  arm  in  the  Balaton  study  up  to  week  24.  No similar cases were reported for the comparator group aflibercept or for either faricimab or aflibercept groups in the Comino study to week 24. From review of the narratives of the three serious cases of cerebral infarction , it is noted that these cases were all reported in the Faricimab arm in the Balaton study up to week 24 in Asian males aged in their 60's.

The MAH was requested to further discuss this finding and present the totality of the safety data in respect  of  all  cerebral  infarction  cases,  including  any  available  updates  on  the  above  highlighted narratives.  It  was  also  asked  to  discuss  if  any  difference  in  safety  could  be  expected  depending  on ethnicity.

The MAH acknowledged this reference to the important potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events and  CNS  haemorrhagic  events  of  faricimab  and  of  all  anti-VEGFs  and  provided  in  their  additional information on the 3 cases of cerebral infarction.

All  of  the cerebral  infarction events  across  treatment  arms  in  the  BALATON  and  COMINO  studies noted above were reported in Asian patients with a majority from China (5 out of 6 patients); however, other  non-ocular  non-fatal  stroke  adjudicated  Anti-Platelet  Trialists'  Collaboration  (APTC)-defined arterial  thromboembolic  event  (ATEs)  (ischemic  stroke,  cerebrovascular  accident,  and  haematoma) were reported in the other racial subgroups (i.e., white, unknown and black or African American).

The MAH further discussed these findings and presented the totality of safety data in respect of all cerebral infarction cases including the available updates on the above highlighted narratives. It also discussed if any difference in safety could be expected depending on ethnicity and whilst this does not seem likely, particularly as no differences in PK can be expected, this is a topic which should continue to be closely monitored.

Additionally, the PopPK analysis did not shown any effect of race on the pharmacokinetics (ocular and systemic) of faricimab. Therefore, based on faricimab PK, no differences are expected in the population of Asian origin. The APTC rates reported in the entire study were consistent with the previous faricimab Phase III studies in nAMD and DME, and the rate of non-fatal strokes observed in Part 2 was consistent with  Part  1.  RVO  is  associated  with  cardiovascular  risk  factors  which  are  also  well-known  risks  for stroke  and  this  should  be  reflected  in  the  PI.  The  overall  rate  is  in  line  with  event  rates  for cerebrovascular accidents in patients with RVO reported in the literature.

The  MAH's  available  data  did  not  suggest  an  association  between  the  faricimab  safety  profile  and ethnicity. However, this issue should continue to be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance.

In the pooled Part 2 dataset, the incidence of serious non-ocular AEs was low in both treatment arms.  There  were no  serious  non-ocular  AEs with ≥ 1%  incidence  in  any  treatment  arm  of  the pooled Part 2 dataset.

In  the entire  study dataset,  the  incidence  of serious  non-ocular  AEs in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to faricimab PTI arm was 12.6%. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of serious non-ocular AEs per 100 PY was 14.26 which is consistent with other faricimab Phase III studies (nAMD: 17.06 and DME: 27.83).

## Fatal cases

In the entire study dataset, 7 patients (1.1%) died in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 5 patients  (0.8%)  died  in  the  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence rate of deaths per 100 PY was lower (0.81) compared with other faricimab Phase III studies (DME: 2.53 and nAMD: 1.7) Overall, in the entire pooled BALATON and COMINO studies through Week 72, 10 patients (0.8%) in the All Faricimab group had fatal events. None of the deaths were suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment.

In conclusion: overall, the safety profile of faricimab in patients with RVO has been well characterized to week 24. Additional safety data to week 72 has also been provided, although some uncertainties remain in relation to the longer term safety aspects in the RVO indication.

In the Phase III faricimab arms, 36.2% (BALATON study) and 48.5% (COMINO study) of patients in the faricimab arms experienced ocular AEs, of which the majority were mild or moderate in severity. In Part  2  (Week  24  through  Week  72)  when  all  patients  were  on  the  faricimab  adjustable  T&amp;E  type regimen, the safety results were overall consistent with those observed in Part 1. ADRs for faricimab are  well  characterized,  including  those  previously  treated  with  aflibercept.  No  new  ADRs  have  been identified  in  the  RVO  study  populations.  The  overall  faricimab  safety  profile  in  the  RVO  studies  is considered to be broadly in line with the known safety profile from the approved faricimab indications, although some imbalances were noted in the part II safety data set.

Of note, the absence of a comparator treatment after 24 weeks is still seen as a limitation in drawing firm conclusions on the longer term safety of faricimab in RVO, based on the evaluation of the safety data  beyond  week  24  in  Part  II  of  the  studies.  Nevertheless,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  MAH presented accordingly the safety data in Part II of the clinical studies in order to facilitate evaluation and provided an overview of relevant findings from the safety evaluations in the approved nAMD and DME indications for context.

However, due to remaining uncertainties,  the  longer-term  safety  of  faricimab  in  the  RVO  should  be closely followed over the longer term.

In addition, a focused review of relevant safety topics of interest should be presented  in future PSURs.

The MAH should also review the need to strengthen the PI in relation to any specific safety considerations relevant to the RVO patient population going forward, in order to optimise the safe use of faricimab in these patients.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, based on the pooled safety data from both pivotal phase III studies BALATON and COMINO, the available safety data from faricimab treatment in the RVO indication indicates that the ocular and non-ocular safety profiles of faricimab and aflibercept are broadly comparable up to week 24 and the safety  profile  of  faricimab  to  week  72  is  generally  well  characterised  and  broadly  in  line  with  the established  safety  data  from  the  DME  and  nAMD  indications.  However,  it  is  highlighted  that  some uncertainties  remain and a number of imbalances were noted in the comparative safety data which warrant further close monitoring.

Of note, the absence of a comparator treatment after 24 weeks is still seen as a limitation in drawing firm conclusions on the safety of faricimab based on the evaluation of the safety data beyond week 24 in  Part  II  of  the  studies.  Nevertheless,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  MAH  presented  accordingly  the safety  data  in  Part  II  of  the  clinical  studies  in  order  to  facilitate  data  evaluation  and  provided  an overview of relevant findings from the safety evaluations in the approved nAMD and DME indications for context.

Overall,  the  faricimab  safety  profile  in  the  RVO  studies  is  considered  to  be  broadly  in  line  with  the known  safety  profile  from  the  approved  faricimab  indications.  Nevertheless,  it  is  considered  that  a degree  of  uncertainty  remains  in  relation  to  the  longer-term  safety  profile  of  faricimab  in  the  RVO

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indication,  particularly  due  to  the  absence  of  a  comparator  arm  beyond  week  24  and  since  some patients were treated with both aflibercept and faricimab. In this context, it is recommended that the longer-term safety of faricimab in the RVO should be closely followed over the longer term. The MAH is therefore  asked  to  present  a  focused  review  of  relevant  safety  topics  of  interest  in  future  PSURs. Furthermore,  it  should  continue  to  review  the  need  to  strengthen  the  PI  in  relation  to  any  specific safety considerations relevant to the RVO patient population going forward, in order to optimise safe use of faricimab in RVO patients.

Two  long-term  extension  studies  (AVONELLE-X  and  RHONE-X)  in  patients  with  nAMD  and  DME, respectively,  are  currently  ongoing  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  intravitreal faricimab, which will address the missing information of long-term safety of faricimab, and will provide a cumulative 4 years of exposure data. In addition, data from these two long--term extension studies will also further characterize the important potential risk of ATE/CNS haemorrhagic events. No changes were  made  to  the  Pharmacovigilance  plan  ,  as  no  new  safety  concerns  were  identified  within  this procedure.

The 72-week RVO data presented in the BALATON and COMINO CSRs in combination with the DME and nAMD LTE studies and existing routine pharmacovigilance activities (i.e., adverse reaction reporting, Guided Questionnaires, signal detection and management activities) with all relevant safety data being reported in the PBRER are considered sufficient in providing long-term safety and immunogenicity data for faricimab to cover the RVO indication for the following reasons:

- The commonality between the pathophysiology and risk factors in DME and RVO supports that data from LTE studies in DME is relevant to the RVO population.
- Long-term RWD studies from anti-VEGF products have not identified a difference in safety profile between the DME and RVO population.
- Data obtained to date from the ongoing faricimab LTE studies in the DME and nAMD.

However, the MAH should keep the above issues, in particular, intraocular inflammation (IOI) events and  immunogenicity  in  the  RVO  indication,  as  topics  of  special  interest  in  future  PSURs.  The  MAH should also continuously review the need to strengthen current information (e.g. in the PI) on these topics, if necessary.

## Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan

The  proposed  post-authorisation  PhV  plan  is  sufficient  to  identify  and  characterise  the  risks  of  the product

Patient Information Leaflet; Summary of Product Characteristics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

RMP Part V was updated to include the RVO population as part of the target audience of the additional risk minimization measure already in place for Vabysmo (patient/carer guide).

Accordingly, Annex 6,7,8 of the RMP and Annex II-D of the Product Information were also revised. The key elements of the additional risk minimization activity of the patient/carer guide have been updated to indicate that a description of branch/central RVO will be provided.

## Conclusion on the RMP

The CHMP concluded that Vabysmo RMP version 5.1 is acceptable.

## 2.7. Update of the Product Information

As a result of this variation procedure, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to reflect information relating to the proposed new indication in RVO. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet was submitted by the MAH and found acceptable for the following reasons:

- In  2021,  a  Full  User  Testing  (Report  1804)  was  conducted  to  support  Vabysmo  Marketing Authorisation  Application  (MAA)  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  neovascular  (wet)  agerelated  macular  degeneration  (nAMD)  based  on  results  of  2  pivotal  clinical  studies  TENAYA  and LUCERNE and for the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) based on YOSEMITE and RHINE.
- The results of the Full User Testing demonstrated that at least 90% of the participants were able to find each point of information. It also showed that at least 90% of those participants were able to understand the information.
- The proposed type II variation is based on the results from the two Phase III studies; BALATON (GR41984)  in  patients  with  branch  retinal  vein  occlusion  (BRVO)  and  COMINO  (GR41986)  in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (HRVO).

The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  considered  justified  not  conducting  a novel  User Consultation for the Package Leaflet for this application because:

- No significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet are made. In particular, key safety messages are not affected by this variation. The additional text follows the same structure and uses similar descriptions and terminology as used in the approved package leaflet.
- The  posology  section  wording  in  this  application  follows  the  same  structure  and  uses  the  same descriptions and terminology as in the approved indications for Vabysmo.
- As  Vabysmo  must  be  administered  by  a  qualified  healthcare  professional  trained  in  intravitreal injections,  the  target  group  of  users  (i.e.,  HCP  specialising  in  ophthalmology)  will  be  similar between the approved indication (nAMD, DME) and the applied indication (RVO).

The MAH's justification is acceptable.

## 2.7.2. Additional monitoring

Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Vabysmo  (faricimab)  is  included  in  the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance. Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional  monitoring  and  that  this  will  allow  quick  identification  of  new  safety  information.  The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

RVO is one of the most common retinal vascular disorders and is associated with varying degrees of visual loss (Hayreh et al. 1994). RVO has been reported as the second leading cause of blindness for patients with retinal vascular disease, following diabetic retinopathy (DR) (Cugati et al. 2006; Klein et al. 2008; Rogers et al. 2010; Yasuda et al. 2010). The main types of RVO include BRVO, HRVO, and CRVO. As of 2015, approximately 28.06 million adults worldwide were affected by any type RVO, of which  4.67  million  are  CRVO  patients  and  23.38  million  are  BRVO  patients.  The  estimated  global prevalence of RVO increased with advanced age but did not show significant differences between sexes (Song et al. 2019).

The most common presenting complaint of RVO is an abrupt, painless decrease of central vision, due to  macular  oedema.  Less  frequently,  patients  may  present  with  a  history  of  transient  vision  loss, lasting a few seconds to minutes, with complete recovery of vision. These symptoms may recur over several days to weeks before being followed by a permanent decrease in vision. Metamorphopsia and visual field defects have also been described (Achiron et al. 2015; Manabe et al. 2017).

The most recognised risk factors for RVO are age and systemic vascular disorders. In over half of the cases, the age of onset is over 65 years. Systemic diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus are very strongly associated with the development of RVO.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy is the current mainstay of treatment in macular oedema due to RVO and has demonstrated efficacy across several pivotal, randomised clinical studies, although macular laser and  intravitreal  steroids-especially  steroid  implants  are  also  used  in  some  cases.  Ranibizumab (Lucentis SmPC, Lucentis USPI) and aflibercept (Eylea SmPC, Eylea USPI) are the most widely used globally approved treatments for RVO.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

Clinical evidence supporting the efficacy, safety, and favourable benefit-risk assessment of faricimab is mainly based on the primary analysis results of two pivotal Phase III studies:

- Study GR41984 (hereafter referred to as BALATON) in patients with macular edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)
- Study GR41986 (hereafter referred to as COMINO) in patients with macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (C/HRVO).

## 3.2. Favourable effects

## Key favourable effects

In both pivotal studies investigating patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BALATON study) and patients with central  or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (COMINO study), the primary endpoint was met as the patients treated with faricimab Q4W had a non-inferior change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 compared  with  patients  treated  with  aflibercept  Q4W,  as  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  confidence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interval for the adjusted mean difference between the faricimab and aflibercept arms was greater than -4 letters.

In the BALATON study , at Week 24, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.5 letters in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; the difference was -0.6 letters (95% CI: -2.2, 1.1).

In the COMINO study , at Week 24, in the ITT population, the adjusted mean change from baseline in BCVA was 16.9 and 17.3 letters in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively; the difference was -0.4 letters (95% CI: -2.5, 1.6).

In  both  pivotal  studies,  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis  were  also  supported  by  supplementary analyses  performed  by  the  MAH  such  as  the  analysis  based  on  the  PP  population,  an  analysis distinguishing COVID and non-COVID intercurrent events and an analysis using hypothetical strategy for all intercurrent events.

## Supportive outcomes

These effects are supported by similar effects results as reported for secondary endpoints investigated in studies.

In relation to the effect on additional BCVA outcomes including the proportion of patients gaining or avoiding a loss of ≥ 15, ≥ 10, ≥ 5, or &gt; 0 letters in BCVA from baseline, patients achieving ≥ 84, 69 letters or ≤ 38 letters, all assessed at week 24, in both pivotal studies the results were comparable between the treatment groups.

The graph of change from baseline in visual acuity vs. time shows that, in both group, visual acuity sharply improves by Month 4, and gradually continues to improve thereafter.

In the Balaton study, at Week 24, 56.1% and 60.4% of patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in the adjusted  proportion  of  patients  who  gained  at  least  15  letters  from  baseline  between  the  faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -4.3% (95% CI: -12.3%, 3.8%). In  the Comino study, at week 24, 56.6% and 58.1% of patients gained at least 15 letters in BCVA score from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. The difference in the adjusted proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters from baseline between the faricimab Q4W arm and the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -1.5% (95% CI: -8.4%, 5.3%).

Also, a similar proportion of patients treated with faricimab Q4W avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters from baseline at Week 24 compared with patients treated with aflibercept Q4W. In the Balaton study, at Week 24, 99.6% and 98.6% of patients avoided a loss of ≥ 15 letters in BCVA from baseline in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively. In the Comino study, at Week 24, 96.2% and 96.7% of patients  avoided  a  loss  of ≥ 15  letters  in  BCVA  from  baseline  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and aflibercept Q4W arms, respectively.

In relation the effect on anatomic outcome measures macular oedema was reduced  with a clinically meaningful  reduction  in  both  treatment  groups,  which  was  also  reflected  by  an  increase  in  the proportion of patients with absence of macular oedema, or absence of intraretinal subretinal fluid. Of note, at baseline, macular oedema was more significant in patients with central or hemi-retinal vein occlusion,  or  in  those  with  branch  retinal  vein  occlusion  and  improvements  seen  in  patients  with central or hemi-retinal vein occlusion was higher.

In the BALATON study, at Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -311.4 μ m and  -304.4  μ m  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  The  difference  in adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  CST  between  the  faricimab  Q4W  when  compared  to  the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -7.0 μm (95% CI: -14.1, 0).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the COMINO study, at Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline in CST was -461.6 μ m and  -448.8  μ m  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  and  aflibercept  Q4W  arms,  respectively.  The  difference  in adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  CST  between  the  faricimab  Q4W  when  compared  to  the aflibercept Q4W arm at Week 24 was -12.8 μm (95% CI: -26.7, 1.0). As indicated by the MAH, the majority  of  patients  in  Part  2  of  the  studies  were  treated  using    Q12W  or  Q16W  dosing  interval. Between Week 24 and Week 68, 81.5% and 74.0% of patients achieved a faricimab Q12W or Q16W dosing interval in BALATON and COMINO, respectively. The proportion of patients who only received Q4W dosing through Week 68 in BALATON and COMINO was low (1.2% and 2.5%, respectively.

Despite the lower frequency of the treatment in Part 2 of the study, the efficacy was maintained. In  the  BALATON  study,  at  Week  64/68/72,  in  the  ITT  population,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from baseline in BCVA was 18.1 and 18.8 letters in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI and aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms, respectively.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

There are no major uncertainties in relation to the efficacy. The posology as proposed by the MAH is acceptable.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

In  relation  to  clinical  safety,  the  following  ocular  and  non-ocular  AEs  were  observed  in  the  pooled integrated safety data from the two pivotal phase III studies (BALOTAN and COMINO) which evaluated the safety and tolerability of faricimab in the treatment of patients with RVO.

The most common ocular AEs in the study eye (&gt; 2% incidence in any treatment arm) by PT were: IOP  increased,  cataract,  cystoid  macular  oedema  [verbatim:  worsening  of  CMO],  macular  oedema [verbatim: worsening of MO], RVO [verbatim: worsening of CRVO, worsening of BRVO, exacerbation of BRVO, superior BRVO, accelerated worsening of BRVO, RVO aggravated], conjunctival haemorrhage, dry eye, epiretinal membrane, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and glaucoma.

Ocular adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in the study eye occurred in 21 patients [5.8%] in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 9 patients [2.6%] in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm. Fifteen patients  (4.2%) and 7  patients (2.0%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab  PTI and  the aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm,  respectively,  experienced  an  ocular  AESI  in  the  study  eye causing a decrease of &gt;30 letters in VA score lasting more than 1 hour.

The overall incidence of IOI  events in  the  study  eye  in  Part  2  (Week  24  through  Week 72) of the pivotal studies was n=10 patients (2.8%) in the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm and 5 patients (1.5%) in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arms.

Two patients reporting IOI events had a significant vision loss of &gt;15 letters associated with an IOI event:  one  serious  event  of  vitritis  in  the  faricimab  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  one  event  of iridocyclitis in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

One case of endophthalmitis in the study eye was reported in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm.

The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  ADAs  against  faricimab  from  baseline  to  Week  72  in  the faricimab Q4W to faricimab PTI arm was 16.5%.

A higher incidence of IOI was observed in ADA-positive patients compared with ADA-negative patients, Although the clinical significance of anti-faricimab antibodies on overall safety is unclear at this time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Non-ocular safety

In Part1, the incidence of serious  non-ocular  AEs was generally low and comparable between the treatment arms (9 patients [3.3%] and 16 patients [5.8%] in the faricimab Q4W and aflibercept Q4W arms,  respectively;  The  most  common  ( ≥ 1% of patients  in  any  arm)  was cerebral  infarction (3 events in the faricimab Q4W arm; All cerebral infarction events were reported as severe, of which 2 were  assessed  as  related  to  the  study  treatment and  1  assessed  as  related  to  other  cause (concurrent illness).

In Part 2 (Week 24 through Week 72), there was 1 patient (0.4%) in each treatment arm (faricimab Q4W to  faricimab  PTI  arm  and  aflibercept  Q4W  to  faricimab  PTI  arm)  that  experienced  a  cerebral infarction event. The one event in the aflibercept Q4W to faricimab PTI arm occurred on Study Day 417 (Week  59)  and  was  considered  serious,  suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  study treatment, and resolved by Week 72; the dose remained unchanged from the event.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

In view of inherent limitations in interpreting the part II safety data and some imbalances noted in the comparative safety profiles provided, the MAH is asked to continue to closely monitor the longer-term safety and immunogenicity profiles of faricimab specific to the RVO indication. A number of imbalances were initially  identified  in  relation  to  a  number  of  ocular  and  non-ocular  AEs  and  these  issues  were further  discussed  by  the  MAH  in  their  responses.  As  a  result,  follow  up  safety  monitoring  over  the longer term is requested and should be a focus of the PSURs.

In  relation  to  cases  reporting  cerebral  infarction,  from  review  of  the  narratives  of  the  three  serious cases of cerebral infarction, it is noted that these cases were all reported in the faricimab arm in the BALATON study up to week 24, in Asian males aged in their 60's. The MAH further discussed these findings and presented the totality of the safety data in respect of all cerebral infarction cases including the available updates on the above highlighted narratives. The MAH also discussed if any difference in safety could be expected depending on ethnicity and whilst this does not seem likely, particularly as no differences in PK can be expected, this is a topic which should continue to be monitored.

RVO is associated with cardiovascular risk factors which are also well-known risks for strokes. Of note, the overall rate is generally in line with event rates for cerebrovascular accidents in patients with RVO.

Whilst the safety profile of faricimab in the RVO indication is considered generally well characterised over the shorter term, the longer-term safety profile requires ongoing monitoring in order to be more fully characterised. In addition, the MAH is asked to present a focused review of relevant safety topics of interest in the PSURs. In addition, the MAH should present a focused review of relevant safety topics of interest in the PSURs.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

In both pivotal studies investigating patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BALATON study) and patients with central or hemi-retinal vein occlusion (COMINO study), the primary endpoint was met as the patients treated with faricimab Q4W had a non-inferior change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 compared  with  patients  treated  with  aflibercept  Q4W  (i.e.  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  confidence interval for the adjusted mean difference between the faricimab and aflibercept arms was greater than -4 letters). This non-inferiority was discussed and broadly agreed during the scientific advice. The proposed posology is considered acceptable.

In general, the study population is overall representative of the target population with expectations of patients with most severe symptoms, a long history and those who failed a previous treatment.

A number of imbalances were initially identified in relation to a number of ocular and non-ocular AEs and these issues were further discussed by the MAH in their responses. As a result, follow up safety monitoring over the longer term is deemed necessary and should be a focus of the PSURs.

In  relation  to  cases  reporting  cerebral  infarction,  from  review  of  the  narratives  of  the  three  serious cases of cerebral infarction, it is noted that these cases were all reported in the faricimab arm in the BALATON study up to week 24, in Asian males aged in their 60's. The MAH further discussed these findings and presented the totality of the safety data in respect of all cerebral infarction cases including the available updates on the above highlighted narratives. The MAH also discussed if any difference in safety could be expected depending on ethnicity and whilst this does not seem likely, particularly as no differences in PK can be expected, this is a topic which should continue to be closely monitored.

In  addition,  clarification  was  requested  in  relation  to  the  number  of  patients  who  were  treated  with faricimab under each different dosing regimen as part of faricimab PTI dosing and how many AEs were reported within the individual treatment schedules. The available safety data from Part II of the pivotal RVO studies were presented. It is highlighted that limited data is available in the less frequent dosing regimens (QW8 and QW12) and, again, it is recommended that long term safety in these subgroups is further monitored.

The MAH considers that the long-term safety and immunogenicity data of faricimab in patients with RVO is covered by the safety data presented in the 72-week BALATON and COMINO CSRs and can be reasonably supplemented by the data generated in the DME and nAMD LTE studies (CSRs expected to be available in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, respectively). Furthermore, the long-term safety data (including IOI, endophthalmitis, ATE, CNS haemorrhagic events, and in the elderly population) for all indications of faricimab, including RVO, will continue to be collected from post marketing sources, monitored and provided  using  the  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  (i.e.,  adverse  reaction  reporting,  guided questionnaires, signal detection, and management activities) with all relevant data being reported in the PBRER.

Overall, the safety profile of faricimab in the RVO indication is considered generally well characterised over the shorter term; the longer-term safety profile in the RVO patient population requires ongoing monitoring in order to be more fully characterised. In particular the MAH is requested to keep APTC events, IOI events and immunogenicity as topics of special interest in the PSURs.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

In both pivotal studies investigating patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BALATON study) and patients  with  central  or  hemi-retinal  vein  occlusion  (COMINO  study),  the  primary  endpoint  was  met and faricimab Q4W was found to be non-inferior to aflibercept Q4W.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, the safety profile of faricimab in the RVO indication is considered to be generally well characterised  over  the  shorter  term;  the  longer-term  safety  profile  in  the  RVO  patient  population requires ongoing monitoring in order to be more fully characterised.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

None

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Vabysmo in the treatment of patients in the proposed RVO indication is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based  on  the  review  of  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  Extension  of  indication  (EoI)  as acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation (MA), concerning the following change:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema  secondary  to  retinal  vein  occlusion  (branch  RVO  or  central  RVO)  for  Vabysmo,  based  on results  from  the  two  phase  3  studies:  GR41984  (BALATON)  in  patients  with  branch  retinal  vein occlusion (BRVO) and GR41986 (COMINO) in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or hemi-retinal  vein  occlusion  (HRVO).  These  are  global,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-masked, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group, 2-part studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and PK of faricimab.

As  a  consequence,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  have  been  updated.  The Package  Leaflet  is  updated  in  accordance.  Version  5.1  of  the  RMP  has  also  been  submitted.  In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor changes to the PI.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In  view  of  the  data  submitted  with  the  variation  amendments  to  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics  (SmPC),  amendments  to  Annex(es)  I,  II  and  IIIB  and  to  the  Risk  Management  Plan (RMP) are recommended.

## Conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency.
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## Additional risk minimisation measures

Prior to the launch of Vabysmo in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, distribution  modalities,  and  any  other  aspects  of  the  programme,  with  the  National  Competent Authority.

The educational programme is aimed at adequately informing patients/carers on the risks of Vabysmo, the key signs and symptoms of those risks, and when to seek urgent attention from their physician with  the  objective  to  minimize  the  risks  and  any  resultant  complications  by  encouraging  prompt intervention.

The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Vabysmo is marketed, all patients/carers who are expected to use Vabysmo have access to/are provided with the following educational package:

## Patient information pack

The patient information pack consists of the patient information leaflet and a patient/carer guide. The patient guide is provided in written and audio format, and will include the following key elements:

- A description  of  neovascular  age-related  macular  degeneration  (nAMD),  diabetic  macular  edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO).
- A description of Vabysmo, how it works, and what to expect from Vabysmo treatment.
- A  description  of  the  key  signs  and  symptoms  of  the  key  risks  associated  with  Vabysmo,  i.e., infectious endophthalmitis and intraocular inflammation.
- A  description  of  when  to  seek  urgent  attention  from  the  health  care  provider  should  signs  and symptoms of these risks present themselves.
- Recommendations for adequate care after the injection.

## Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures
