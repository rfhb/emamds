|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Avastin              | BEVACIZUMAB                           | See Annex A      |

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

The MAH applied for a new indication for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to make some editorial changes in the SmPC and the PL.

The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0235/2012 on the agreement of a Paediatric investigation plan and an EMA Decision CW/1/2011 on a class waiver on conditions.

At the time of submission of the application, the Paediatric investigation plan was not yet completed as the measure was deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Overall, gliomas account for 70% of adult malignant primary brain tumours (Ricard, D., et al., 2012). The incidence of malignant glioma is ~5/100 000 and may develop at all ages, the peak incidence being in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Malignant glioma comprises of glioblastoma [World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV], anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III), mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade III) (Stupp, R., et al., 2010).

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumour occurring in adults, and has the worst prognosis. Less than 3% of glioblastoma patients are still alive at 5 years after diagnosis, higher age being the most significant predictor of poor outcome (Ohgaki H, Kleihues P, 2005, Sant M. at al., 2011). GBMs only very rarely disseminate outside the Central Nervous System (CNS) and relapse usually occurs at the original tumour site.

GBM can develop at any site within the central nervous system but is most commonly located in the cerebral hemisphere. Surgical debulking of tumour may diminish or alleviate symptoms associated with mass effect. Symptomatic management is also effective in controlling seizures (anti-epileptic medications) and cerebral edema (corticosteroids). However, all patients with GBM eventually develop tumour progression and associated symptomatic deterioration.

Current treatment option in newly diagnosed glioblastoma include Temozolomide  in combination with radiotherapy based on a survival benefit compared to radiotherapy alone.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody. It inhibits angiogenesis by neutralising all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and blocking their binding to VEGF receptors.

Avastin was approved in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2005 for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum (mCRC), in combination with intravenous 5fluorouracil/folinic acid or intravenous 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid/irinotecan. Following this, Avastin was approved for the treatment of locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer, for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for renal cell cancer, for the first-line ovarian cancer, and in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelian ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications for Avastin. The MAH applied for the indication:

'Avastin, in combination with radiation and temozolomide, is indicated for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed gliomas (WHO Grade III or IV)'.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

There was no environmental risk assessment submitted as part of this application.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

A justification for not providing an updated Environmental Risk assessment for this new indication has been submitted by the MAH. This is in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk assessment for Human medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 2006) which states that for certain pharmacologically active substances, among others proteins, such is possible, as these substances are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.

Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin of isotype IgG1 and as a protein bevacizumab is exempted from providing an ERA.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

There are no new non-clinical data submitted as part of this application and the absence of an ERA is considered acceptable.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

The potential of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between bevacizumab and temozolomide was evaluated in a substudy of pivotal Study BO21990.

The BO21990 DDI substudy was conducted during the maintenance phase, which followed a treatment break  after  the  concurrent  treatment  phase  in  Study  BO21990.  During  the  maintenance  phase, patients  received  temozolomide  and  bevacizumab  or  placebo  for  six  28-day  cycles  or  until  disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During the first cycle of the maintenance phase, temozolomide was  to  be  taken  orally  on  the  first  5  days  of  the  28-day  cycle  at  dose  of  150  mg/m 2 /day.  For subsequent cycles, the dose of temozolomide was to be escalated to 200/mg/m 2  if permitted by the patient's  haematologic  and  non-haematologic  toxicity  profile  (according  to  the  National  Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3). Bevacizumab or placebo (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered to patients on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

The number of patients included in the substudy was 14 in the temozolomide/bevacizumab (T/B) arm and 6 in the temozolomide/placebo (T/P) arm. Samples for bevacizumab were obtained predose and postdose  on  Day  1  of  Cycles  1,  2,  3  of  the  maintenance  phase.  Samples  for  temozolomide  were obtained predose, 15 min, 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hrs postdose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 of the maintenance phase.

The PK outcome measures for the BO21990 DDI substudy were to summarize the observed plasma temozolomide concentrations and estimate the PK parameters (AUC, Tmax, Cmax) for patients in the placebo  (Pl  +  RT/T)  and  bevacizumab  (Bv  +  RT/T)  treatment  arms  at  Cycle  1,  Day  1  of  the maintenance phase. In addition, the observed serum bevacizumab trough and peak concentrations in patients in the bevacizumab treatment arm during Cycles 1, 2, and 3 during the maintenance phase were  to  be  summarized  and  the  observed  bevacizumab  exposures  compared  with  the  predicted exposure from PPK simulations based on the dose regimen in Study BO21990.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

A substudy of BO21990 investigating potential drug-drug interaction when bevacizumab is added to temozolomide treatment did not reveal any influence of temozolomide on bevacizumab exposure. The temozolomide exposure seems to be moderately increased by the presence of bevacizumab. The substudy included only 6 patients treated with temozolomide. No firm conclusions can be drawn on the potential for bevacizumab to modify the exposure of temozolomide. However, no DDI is expected between a monoclonal antibody like bevacizumab and a small molecule like temozolomide.

## 2.3.4. Conclusion on clinical pharmacology

Although data from a substudy of BO21990 indicate that temozolomide exposure seems to be moderately increased by the presence of bevacizumab, no DDI is expected between a monoclonal antibody like bevacizumab and a small molecule like temozolomide.

## Treatments

Trial treatment was to start between 4 and 7 weeks after debulking surgery or biopsy of the GBM. Trial treatment consisted of three phases as described in Figure 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 3. Study design

<!-- image -->

If adverse events occurred that necessitated delaying bevacizumab, the dose would remain unchanged once  treatment  resumed.  Patients  could  be  withdrawn  from  any  of  the  trial  treatment  components (radiotherapy, TMZ or Bv), or from any combination of these three treatment components, however if radiotherapy was discontinued all trial treatment was to be discontinued.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the study were to demonstrate superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator and in overall survival (OS) when Bv is added to TMZ with radiotherapy (Stupp regimen) followed by TMZ for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

Secondary objectives included the comparison of  PFS as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF) between treatment arms the comparison of  1-year and 2-year survival rates between treatment arms the  evaluation and comparison of the safety profile between treatment arms and the comparison of  health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30, BN-20) between treatment arms.

## Exploratory Objectives

To  compare  the  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  and  the  duration  of  objective  response,  between treatment arms

To assess and compare OS and PFS between and within arms in relation to MGMT status

To compare neurocognitive function (NCF) using MMSE between treatment arms

To explore and compare the use of corticosteroids between treatment arms

To explore and compare the signs and symptoms related to GBM and patient's KPS between treatment arms

To explore and compare the patterns of tumour progression between treatment arms

## Substudy Objectives

To compare neurocognitive function between treatment arms

To explore and compare the correlation between the neurocognitive function and the BO21990 efficacy outcome measures within and between treatment arms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To measure the effect of Bv on the pharmacokinetics of TMZ

To characterize the effect of TMZ on the pharmacokinetics of Bv

## Outcomes/endpoints

The co-primary endpoints of this trial were OS defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause and  PFS as assessed by the investigator, defined as the time from randomization until the first date of either objective disease progression (using adapted MacDonald Response Criteria) or death due to any cause. Disease progression was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments made by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1.

The key secondary endpoints were the following:

- PFS as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF).
- One-year and two-year overall survival defined as the percentage of patients who are still alive at 1 year and 2 years post-randomization, respectively.
- Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) Changes. HRQoL was assessed by a core instrument of the EORTC (EORTC QLQ-C30) supplemented by a brain cancer specific module (EORTC BN20).

The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item self-report questionnaire on which patients rate the items on a 4-point scale, from 1 'not at all' to 4 'very much' (except for the global health status and QoL items  on  a  7-point  scale,  from  1  'very  poor'  to  7  'excellent').  The  instrument  measures  five functional multi-item scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning), three symptoms scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), six single-item measures (dyspnea, insomnia, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact) and a global health status/QoL scale.

The  EORTC  BN20  consists  of  four  multi-item  scales  (future  uncertainty,  visual  disorder,  motor dysfunction, communication deficit) and seven single-item measures (headache, seizures, drowsiness, hair loss, itching, difficulty with bladder control, and weakness of both legs).

## Exploratory Parameters

The  following  exploratory  efficacy  parameters  were  defined  in  the  protocol  and  were  analysed descriptively:

Objective response rate (ORR) based on adapted Macdonald criteria.

Duration of response, defined as time between first response and disease progression or death due to any cause. Patients without an event were censored at the date of last follow up for progression.

OS and PFS in relation to MGMT status. Subgroup analyses of OS and PFS by treatment arm according to MGMT status were performed.

Change over time in neurocognitive function (NCF) according to the MMSE.

Extent of corticosteroid use over time.

Change over time in signs and symptoms related to GBM.

Change in KPS over time.

Patterns of tumour progression.

## Sample size

The sample size was based on a calculation assuming a 42 month recruitment period and minimum follow up of approximately 17 months for the last patient enrolled.

For the OS endpoint, assuming a median survival duration of 18.3 months in the bevacizumab and temozolomide arm and 14.6 months in the placebo and temozolomide arm (corresponding to a hazard ratio  of  0.80,  or  a  reduction  in  the  immediate  risk  of  death  by  20%),  then  683  events  would  be required to achieve 80% power of the log rank test at a 2-sided overall 4% alpha level. This calculation included two interim analyses at approximately 50% and 72% of events (the final PFS analysis was to be performed at the time of the second interim analysis).

For  the  PFS  endpoint,  assuming  a  median  PFS  duration  of  9.1  months  in  the  bevacizumab  and temozolomide arm and 7 months in the placebo and temozolomide (corresponding to a hazard ratio of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.769, or a reduction in the immediate risk of progression or death by 23%), 677 events were required to achieve 80% power of the log rank test at a 2-sided 1% alpha level. In the event that less than 72% of OS events had occurred at the time of the PFS analysis (i.e. less than 492 of the 683 death events  required),  the  PFS  analysis  would  be  delayed  until  at  least  72%  of  OS  information  was available. In order to see the required number of events in the timeframe defined above, and to allow for a 10% dropout rate in PFS at 3 years, and a 5% dropout rate in survival at 4 years, 460 patients per treatment arm was required.

## Randomisation

The patients were randomly assigned to receive to RT/TMZ+placebo or RT/TMZ+bevacizumab in a 1:1 ratio. They were stratified by the following factors: Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) Class (III, IV, V) and Region (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, USA, other).

The definition of RPA class by EORTC is based on WHO performance status, type of surgery, age and MMSE and is categorized as shown in figure 4.

Figure 4. RPA Class Definitions

Randomization and start of treatment was to occur on the same day. When this was not feasible, the delay between randomization and start of treatment was to be kept to a minimum and was not to exceed 3 days.

## Blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind trial. Prior to disease progression, the patients' treatment allocation blind was to be maintained. The only exception was in case of an emergency due to safety reasons. Patients' treatment allocation was to remain blinded at disease progression except if it was deemed necessary to unblind by the investigator for deciding on further treatment.

## Statistical methods

In order to adjust for multiplicity due to having two primary endpoints, the overall alpha of 5% was split with 4% assigned for OS and 1% for PFS.

The  null  hypothesis  was  tested  with  the  stratified  log  rank  test  (two-sided)  and  the  trial  was determined to be positive if any of the following criteria were met: if, at the time of the OS interim

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analysis/final PFS analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between treatment arms in PFS in favour of Bv with a HR&lt;0.769 and a non-detrimental effect on OS (HR &lt;1.0); or if, at the time of  the  interim  or  final  OS  analysis,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  two treatment arms for OS, in favour of Bv.

Analyses were performed using the following populations:

Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT): all patients randomized into the study. For the analysis, patients were assigned to the treatment arms to which they were randomized.

Per-Protocol  Population  (PPP):  all  randomized  patients  who  received  any  radiotherapy,  concomitant TMZ and at least 3 doses of Bv/placebo during the Concurrent phase, as well as patients who stopped treatment prior to this because of toxicity, disease progression or death. Patients had to have at least one disease assessment at baseline and during treatment (unless they died before the first scheduled assessment) and no major protocol violation. Patients were grouped as randomized.

Safety Population: all randomized patients who received at least one dose of trial treatment. Patients were assigned to treatment arms according to the treatment actually received.

In addition the following subsets of the ITT were defined:

The protocol B population: all randomized patients enrolled under protocol version B. One of the key changes that this amendment implemented was the recording of signs and symptoms of GBM, and accordingly these data were analysed using this population.

The PK population: all randomized patients enrolled in the DDI substudy for whom at least one blood sample could be taken for PK.

The NCF population (subset of the protocol B population): all randomized patients who were enrolled into the NCF substudy and who had a baseline NCF assessment, regardless of whether they received any trial treatment or completed the full course of treatment.

## Recruitment

The  first  patient  was  randomized  on  29  June  2009  and  the  last  on  29  March  2011.  A  total  of  921 patients were enrolled into the study from 120 centers in 23 countries.

## Conduct of the study

The protocol was amended once (version B). In total, 786 patients were randomized under version A of the protocol, while 252 patients were randomized under protocol version B.

Key changes to the main protocol as a result of the amendment are summarized below:

-  Following a recommendation from the DSMB, an additional interim analysis was introduced to be triggered when approximately 50% of the deaths required for the final OS analysis had occurred.
-  The collection of signs and symptoms of GBM was introduced enabling a new exploratory objective 'to  explore  and  compare  the  signs  and  symptoms  related  to  GBM  and  patient's  KPS  between treatment arms'.
-  An additional tumour assessment was added after disease progression was diagnosed enabling the addition  of  a  new  exploratory  objective  'to  explore  and  compare  the  patterns  of  tumour progression between treatment arms'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The  statistical  analysis  plan  was  changed  with  regard  to  testing  of  the  difference  between  the arms for the 1-year and 2-year OS rates from a Cochran Mantel Haenzel Test to using a z test.

Approximately 75%-80% of patients in each arm had PFS events according to both the investigator and the IRF. In about half of these cases (35-40% of patients in each arm) the investigator and IRF determined PFS events were within approximately one scheduled visit of each other (within 28 days) whereas for the remaining cases, they occurred &gt;28 days apart.

*median duration of progression-free time stable/improved compared to baseline, based on n stable/improved.

^ median duration of progression-free time improved compared to baseline based on n improved.

A linear transformation is used to standardize the raw HRQoL score, so that all scores for the scales and the singleitem measures range from 0 to 100. Stable HRQoL is defined as a change within 10 points. Improved HRQoL is defined as an increase of at least 10 points for functioning/global health status, and as a decrease of at least 10 points for symptoms. The period before each scheduled assessment is considered in calculating the total duration of stable and/or improved HRQoL.

## · Biomarker Analysis

Biomarker  analyses  were  performed  on  those  patients  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  (all  randomized) population who consented separately to participate in the translational research program. Two patient populations  were  defined:  biomarker  evaluable  protein  plasma  (BEP)  and  biomarker  evaluable  IHC tumour (BEI).

Following biomarkers were investigated: pVEGF-A, pVEGFR-2, tNRP-1, tCD31 (NV), pVEGFR-1, pVEGFC, pVEGFR-3, PDGF-C, tVEGF-A, tVEGFR-2, tVEGFR-1, bFGF, PlGF, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and IL-8.

No clear evidence of predictive value for Bv treatment in terms of PFS was observed for any of the biomarkers.  There  was  no  evidence  of  a  prognostic  effect  of  any  biomarkers  observed  in  the  Pl treatment arm (data not shown).

## RTOG-0825 STUDY

RTOG-0825 was a study conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and funded by the US National Cancer Institute, run mainly in the USA. The applicant presented the publicly available results of the study further to the CHMP's request.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

RTOG-0825, was a a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bv combined with standard therapy, consisting of radiotherapy RT and TMZ chemotherapy, in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

Eligible patients were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the control arm or active arm, and  received  additional  concurrent  RT+TMZ  concomitantly  with  placebo  or  Bv  (3-week  Concurrent Phase). Treatment with placebo or Bv continued uninterrupted (4 weeks) into a 12-cycle Maintenance Phase until progression of disease (PD). Patients could optionally complete questionnaires evaluating HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and BN20) and symptom burden (MDASI-BT) (Figure x).

## Cycle=28 days. *≤10 days after start of RT.

In the RTOG-0825 study, only patients who underwent debulking surgery were included, and started concurrent RT/T treatment for 3 weeks within 3 -5 weeks after the surgery. After this initial induction phase of 3 weeks, only patients still eligible were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the control arm or active arm, and continued to complete the 3 additional weeks of concurrent RT/T concomitantly with placebo or bevacizumab. 637 patients were randomized in the RTOG-0825 study as compared to the 978 patients initially assessed for eligibility. Following randomization, additional patients were further excluded from the analysis population ( Figure 17).

The  co-primary  endpoints  were  PFS  and  OS.  Exploratory  analyses  were  also  performed  to  examine health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL:  EORTC  QLQ-C30/BN20),  neurocognitive  function  (NCF:  mini mental status examination [MMSE], Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HVLT-R], Trail-Making Test A &amp; B [TMT A &amp; B], and Controlled Oral Word Association [COWA]), and symptom burden (MDASI-BT tool).

Results  showed  no  difference  between  the  treatment  arms  for  OS  (median  16.1  months  vs.  15.7 months; HR 1.13, 95% CI: [0.93, 1.37]; p=0.21) and showed prolonged PFS in the Bv treatment arm (median 7.3 months vs. 10.7 months; HR 0.79, 95% CI [0.66, 0.94]; p=0.007) (Table 29).

The results of the exploratory health-related quality of life endpoints showed neurocognitive functioning deterioration addition of Bv to standard therapy (Armstrong et al. 2013; Wefel et al. 2013).

The safety profile of Bv in RTOG-0825 was consistent with that seen in previous trials across multiple tumour types for approved indications.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

No dose-response finding study was performed to establish the optimal dose of Bv for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Only one dose level of bevacizumab has been investigated in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma, i.e. a dose equivalent to 5mg/kg/week.

The rationale for the use of Avastin in combination with the Stupp regimen has not been satisfactorily explained by the applicant.

Cao et al. have shown that in non-enhancing tumour regions, the uptake of gadolinium-based contrast agents peaks 3-4 weeks into chemo radiotherapy treatment. In this time period the BBB/BTB disruption is most significant and likely the period with most delivery of temozolomide. Three months after RT the effect of RT on gadolinium-uptake is no longer apparent and the delivery of temozolomide is expected to be significantly reduced. Bevacizumab is a much larger molecule than temozolomide and the question remains how bevacizumab can be delivered across the BBB/BTB when the effect of radiotherapy subsides. In addition, bevacizumab has been shown to delay enhancement with gadolinium, reflecting reduced leakage into tumour thought to be due to stabilizing effects of bevacizumab. How bevacizumab is delivered to the tumour after the BBB/BTB has been stabilized is yet to be explained. This effect of bevacizumab may also reduce the delivery of temozolomide.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

BO21990 (Avaglio) study was a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo controlled phase III trial investigating the efficacy and safety of adding bevacizumab to the Stupp regimen. The Stupp regimen, consists of radiation therapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ), as well as maintenance treatment with temozolomide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Limitations regarding radiological assessment (RA) of tumour progression in patients with glioblastoma have been debated in the scientific literature. Pseudo progression is a phenomenon related to oedema and necrosis with temozolomide and radiation which may appear as progressions on images. Pseudo response, i.e. a response seen very rapidly after start of treatment has been observed with antiangiogenic therapy in glioblastoma. It has been suggested that this is due to a normalization of the blood-brain barrier which reduces the gadolinium-enhancement. This lack of enhancement may be wrongly assessed as a decrease in tumour size, i.e. the tumour may be stable or even progressing. Thus on one hand pseudo progression with RT/T may have led to underestimation of PFS in the control arm and on the other hand pseudo response with antiangiogenic treatment may have led to an overestimation of PFS in the bevacizumab arm. In the Avaglio study, radiological tumour assessments were performed using MRI. To assess progression a set of adapted Macdonald criteria was used, with MRI methodology that was predicted to capture enhancing (Gd-T1 sequence) and non-enhancing tumours (FLAIR/T2) as well as neurological deterioration + corticosteroid use. These criteria are in line with the RANO criteria released while the Avaglio study was under progress. However, FLAIR/T2 method has its limitations since variations in FLAIR/T2 images are difficult to quantitatively assess [Chinot et al].  Non-enhancing tumours may also be indicative of infiltrative tumours. These may be difficult to differentiate from oedema, gliosis or treatment related leukoencephalopathy. With this method it is not clear whether bevacizumab actually influences tumour development or its effect is just a physiological change in the tumour surroundings. In addition, conclusion on PD was taken at the end of the 4 week treatment break following the concomitant treatment phase which is considered very early and not in line with clinical practice. This method only takes into consideration early pseudo progression, and does not account for later pseudo progressions which may occur months after chemo radiotherapy [de Wit et al]. Although an algorithm was implemented in the Avaglio trial protocol in an attempt to address bias in terms of pseudoprogression (PsPD), this is considered inadequate since PsPD can occur at later time point during the treatment and premature declaration of PD based on a single scan was possible. In addition, Bv induced pseudo-response (and delayed progression) was not accounted for at all in the Avaglio trial. No confirmatory scan was required for determination of PD and patients were taken off treatment after one scan showing progression. In cases of suspected PsPD, only one additional scan was required to decide on progression and termination of therapy. Since PsPD may be counteracted by VEGF treatment, PsPD was most frequently determined in the control arm, and consequently many patients in the control arm may have been sub-treated with temozolomide. With the limitations of the imaging techniques as previously mentioned, pseudo-response in the bevacizumab arm was not sufficiently controlled for. Thus the effect of bevacizumab may have been overestimated while patients in the control arm may have performed poorer than otherwise expected. The radiological component was the most common source leading to PD determination whether alone (≈55%) or accompanied by neurological deterioration (≈28%), while only a minor part of PD events were based on neurological deterioration without radiological PD. Considering the uncertainties regarding RA outlined above it would seem reassuring that the neurological component was part of the decision for a large part of the patients with PD. However, information provided by the applicant regarding the order of assessment of neurological function and radiological assessment reduces the reliability of the neurological assessment; i.e. for the majority of the patients neurological assessment (NA) was performed after the day of RA or at the same day. The investigators may well have been influenced by the results of the RA when assessing NA. Whether the investigator's evaluation of the patient's neurological function was made with or without knowledge of the radiological results was not recorded.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The final analysis of PFS demonstrated a statistically significant 36% reduction in the risk of progression or death in the absence of prior progression for patients in the Bv+RT/TMZ arm compared to the Pl+RT/TMZ arm with an increase in median PFS of 4.4 months (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55-0.74; p&lt;0.0001; median 10.6 vs. 6.2 months). However, the clinical relevance of the PFS is questionable in view of methodological problems associated with PFS in glioblastoma and with this type of product (see discussion above).

No improvement in OS has been demonstrated with the addition of bevacizumab to RT/T. Arguably, this may be due to cross-over at the time of progression. A number of exploratory analyses were attempted to address these issue (data not shown). However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from such types of analyses because in the majority of cases they may be biased by patient selection.

Corticosteroid use has been reduced with the addition of bevacizumab. However, the clinical relevance of this reduction seems limited considering the relatively low dose level. The reason for the reduction may be that the tumour mass is reduced and the need for corticosteroids is diminished. However, it may be that bevacizumab acts as a substitution for corticosteroids since bevacizumab is known to reduce oedema surrounding the tumour.

No detrimental effect was found in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) during treatment with bevacizumab. However, assessment of this endpoint included PD as an event and assessments were not continued beyond progression. In addition, these analyses are not able to document whether there is a difference in HRQoL between early and late progressors. Signs and symptoms of the disease were collected in a subset of the patients (N=252) and did not reveal any significant differences between the treatment arms during treatment, and at the time of PD the majority of the patients reported no signs and symptoms. In both arms nearly all patients had stable or improved KPS. As for HRQoL, signs and symptom of the disease were evaluated until PD, while KPS was also evaluated beyond PD. KPS score showed a decline at PD. However, the number of patients evaluated at and after PD was limited. Furthermore, the evaluation of HRQoL was performed by the investigator, and is likely to be biased by the investigator's knowledge of the disease assessment at PD. In conclusion, data on quality of life secondary endpoints demonstrated that bevacizumab does not have a detrimental effect on the patient's quality of life while on treatment. However, it cannot be concluded based on these analyses that bevacizumab treated patients have a better outcome in quality of life related endpoints than patients who are not treated with bevacizumab.

The publicly available results from RTOG0825 study were submitted and analyzed in relation to the BO21990  (Avaglio)  results.  Even  though  there  are  some  methodological  differences  between  these trials, the results are similar. Therefore RTOG0825 study seems to confirm that adding bevacizumab to RT/TMZ  improves  radiologically  determined  PFS  without  any  improvement  in  overall  survival.  In addition, neurocognitive functioning deterioration was observed during treatment with bevacizumab.

The applicant has performed biomarker analyses to determine if plasma VEGF-A or other plasma or tumour biomarkers has predictive value in PFS. None of the biomarkers included in these analyses can be concluded as predictive of treatment effect of bevacizumab. An extensive biomarker program for Avastin across indications is on-going.

## Additional expert consultation

Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 8 January 2014 to provide advice on the following list of questions:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Please discuss the possible impact of the methodological limitations of neuro-imaging of brain tumours by MRI on the determination of progressive disease.
2.  Is it likely that the PFS estimate is biased by PsPD induced by TMZ and pseudoresponse induced by bevacizumab?
3.  Is Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T2-weighted sequences as used in the AvaGlio adequate to detect invasive/infiltrative tumour development?

The SAG concluded that there is a likely and non-negligible bias due to a number of factors, in particular the mechanism of action of bevacizumab, which may influence tumor environment and integrity of the blood-brain barrier and may interfere with the assessment of tumor response.

The FLAIR method cannot be considered adequate because changes in MRI may represent other conditions, in particular oedema and gliosis, and are therefore not specific to the tumor. Furthermore, repeated imaging with FLAIR, T2-weighted and contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI from multiple institutions are sensitive to variations in image acquisition routines, scanner hardware and operator measurement bias that limits reproducibility. Therefore, although conventional imaging is used in clinical practice to guide treatment decisions, it does not constitute a reliable method to confirm the efficacy of new agents in glioblastoma, particularly VEGF inhibitors. Indeed, even in exploratory studies, overall survival is the preferred endpoint (EORTC experience).

The algorithm implemented to address the bias in terms of pseudo-progression cannot eliminate this bias completely and cannot address important likely bias in terms of pseudo-response (and delayed progression) that is likely to be associated with bevacizumab.

This bias may also impact on the reliability of secondary endpoints related to HR-QoL, as it not possible to rule out knowledge of the status of progression prior to completion of the QoL questionnaires (despite valid efforts to minimize such bias). For similar reasons, the fact that progression was associated with a slight decrease in HR-QoL cannot be used to establish the clinical relevance of the PFS endpoint.

Furthermore, in terms of secondary HR-QoL endpoints, the effect of bevacizumab was similar to placebo or was of small magnitude. Also, there were general methodological issues with this secondary endpoint such as multiplicity and missing data (despite the relatively high compliance and valid efforts to minimize such methodological issues).

Although the PFS endpoint included clinical components (worsening of neurological symptoms or increased corticosteroid used), similar biases might have affected these endpoints since the vast majority of events included radiological progression, which also was the only criterion for progression in the majority of cases. Also, longer follow-up after progression is lacking and it is not possible to assess the reversibility of the worsening in neurological symptoms or corticosteroid use.

Lastly, the long survival observed for a significant number of patients with early progression is counterintuitive and possibly a further indication of the lack of clinical meaningfulness of the PFS endpoint in this disease.

2.  Is the improvement in PFS of approximately 4 months of clinical relevance when seen in light of the results of the analyses of OS, HRQL and corticosteroid use? Please discuss the outcome of the AvaGlio study also in the context of the RTOG0825 study results.

Regardless of the size of the effect observed, the clinical relevance of the PFS endpoint is questionable in view of methodological problems associated with PFS in this disease and with this type of product (see answer to question No. 1). The magnitude of the observed effect is not of such an extent that the methodological problems can be considered negligible.  Additionally, there is no clinically meaningful

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effect that has been established on the basis of other clinically relevant endpoints such as OS or HRQoL, to corroborate the claimed efficacy.

It is also difficult to discuss the outcome of the AvaGlio study in the context of the RTOG0825 study results because for the latter, results are only available in the format of publicly available presentations. Nevertheless, the claimed results from the RTOG0825 study appear consistent, i.e., no effect on overall survival and no benefit in terms of QoL, possibly even a detriment (neurocognitive functioning). However, although it would most likely not bring supportive evidence of efficacy, detailed results from the RTOG0825 study would need to be assessed (e.g., in the format of a study report, even if abridged) and, specifically, the methodology used in the trial before being able to compare the results from the two studies. Therefore, the SAG recommended that CHMP should assess the RTOG study.

## 3. Please discuss the possible impact of first line treatment with bevacizumab on the efficacy of subsequent post-progression therapy.

A possible impact on the efficacy of further line therapies is not a major concern, due to the fact that the size of the effect associated with second-line treatments is debatable. The theoretical possibility that treatment with bevacizumab might select more aggressive tumors remains theoretical, at least in this indication, based on the lack of an important detriment in overall survival associated with bevacizumab in this large study.

## 4. Is the safety profile of the proposed treatment regimen acceptable for the intended patient population?

Bevacizumab was associated with increased toxicity, including Serious Adverse Events and fatal events. However, in view of the high unmet need in this indication, the toxicity associated with bevacizumab did not raise major concerns, at least in principle. However, in the absence of an established and clinically meaningful effect, the additional toxicity associated with bevacizumab cannot be considered acceptable.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In conclusion, there are issues regarding the radiological diagnosis of PD in this disease setting which question the clinical relevance and interpretation of the observed difference in PFS. This difference is not supported by prolonged overall survival. Secondary efficacy endpoints including HRQoL, KPS, corticosteroid use and changes in signs and symptoms of GMB did not provide evidence in support of a clinical benefit of bevacizumab treatment. Overall, the efficacy of bevacizumab in the proposed indication has not been demonstrated.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## 2.5.1. Introduction

The Safety Analysis Population (SAP) comprised all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment; 447 patients in the Pl+RT/T arm and 464 patients in the Bv+RT/T arm. Of 921 patients randomized, 10 patients were excluded from the SAP because they did not receive a dose of study treatment (4 from the Pl+RT/T arm and 6 from the Bv+RT/T arm). The 911 patients included in the SAP were assigned to treatment arms according to the treatment actually received; 12 of 463 patients randomized to the Pl+RT/T arm received at least one dose of Bv and had their safety considered as part of the Bv+RT/T arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All AEs and SAEs occurring after initiation of study treatment were collected up to 90 days following the last dose of study treatment, regardless of causality. Adverse events of special interest (AESI), specified in the protocol as of particular interest for Bv safety were collected up to 6 months following the last dose of study treatment. SAEs that were considered to be related to study treatment had to be reported regardless of the time elapsed since last dose of study treatment.

The safety analyses presented for Study BO21990 are based on data collected up to a clinical cut-off date of 31 March 2012. This cut-off date was based on the protocol-specified final PFS analysis with interim OS.

* % of patients based on SAP

Bv treatment is always given at a fixed dose; 10 mg/kg once every two weeks (q2w) in the maintenance phase. However, for the TMZ in the maintenance phase, there was given the opportunity to escalate or reduce the dose according to defined tolerability criteria. The proportion of patients who were able to dose escalate TMZ was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm (41.3% vs.34.8%) than in the placebo arm. A higher proportion of patients in the Bv arm also completed the 6 cycles of TMZ than in the placebo arm (64% vs. 37%).

## Adverse events

System Organ Class with a ≥ 10% higher incidence rate of AEs (any grade) in the Bv+RT/T arm compared to the Pl+RT/T arm were as follows: Gastrointestinal disorders (78% vs. 68%), infections and infestations (52% vs. 38%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (46% vs. 30%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (45% vs. 25%), vascular disorders (46% vs. 21%) and renal and urinary disorders (23% vs. 13%).

## Adverse Events of Special Interest Bleeding

Overall, an increase in bleeding events seen in the Bv+RT/T arm was primarily accounted for by grade 1-2  events,  the  majority  of  which  were  manageable  mucocutaneous  bleeding  events  that  resolved without specific intervention:

Mucocutaneous bleeding events were more common in the Bv+RT/T arm (124 [26.7%] vs . 40 [8.9%]). Nearly  all  mucocutaneous  bleeding  events  were  grade  1  or  2.  Two  events  (epistaxis),  both  in  the Bv+RT/T arm, were grade ≥ 3. These grade ≥ 3 bleeding events were treated with platelet transfusions and subsequently resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Events coded under the ''cerebral haemorrhage'' grouping occurred in a similar number of patients in each arm (12 [2.6%] Bv+RT/T vs. 10 [2.2%] Pl+RT/T). While the events in the Bv+RT/T arm tended to be more severe, the difference in the treatment arms was due to the occurrence of strokes (CVA), most of which were determined after medical review to be of ischemic origin.

Bleeding events at other sites (other than mucocutaneous or cerebral) occurred more frequently in the Bv+RT/T arm (54 [11.6%] vs. 36 [8.1%]), with the increase driven primarily by grade 1-2 events.

## Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs)

The overall incidence of ATEs (any grade) was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm (23 [5.0%] vs. 7 [1.6%], respectively) as was the incidence of grade ≥ 3 ATEs (19 [4.1%] vs 6 [1.3%]).

One ATE event in each group was fatal (CVA in the Pl+RT/T arm and MI in the Bv+RT/T arm). ATEs led to  discontinuation of Pl/Bv therapy  for more patients in the Bv+RT/T arm (13 patients) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (1 patient). The majority of ATE events in the Bv arm resolved with treatment (Table 33).

Medical review of all ATE events identified that most of the ATE terms can be grouped under the broad medical concept of 'stroke' or cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (Table x) and that most of the strokes were of ischemic origin. Thus, 16 of 23 patients in the Bv+RT/T arm and 6 of 7 patients in the Pl+RT/T

## Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs)

The overall incidence of VTEs was similar in both arms: any grade, 36 [7.8%] Bv vs. 43 [9.6%] Pl; Grade ≥ 3, 34 [7.3%] Bv vs. 36 [8.1%] Pl. There were four fatal events, all of which were pulmonary embolism (1 Pl+RT/T and 3 Bv+RT/T). Similar numbers of patients discontinued Pl/Bv treatment or dose modified for VTE events in each arm. The VTE events resolved in a higher proportion in patients in the Bv+RT/T arm (24/36; 67%) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (21/43; 49%).

## Wound Healing Complications

Wound healing complications (WHC) were more frequently reported by Bv-treated patients (17 [3.7%]) than by Pl-treated patients (10 [2.2%]). Seven patients in the Bv+RT/T arm reported grade ≥ 3 WHC events compared with three in the Pl+RT/T arm. The majority of WHC events resolved with treatment. All grade ≥ 3 wound healing complications were related to the craniotomy site.

There was one fatal wound infection in a Bv-treated patient who had developed a post-operative cyst prior to study start. On Day 360, during the Monotherapy Phase of the study, the patient developed Grade 3 head wound infection leading to hospitalization. The patient died on Day 384 reportedly after stopping antibiotic therapy and following discharge from the hospital.

Six patients in the Bv+RT/T arm discontinued therapy due to WHC compared with none in the Pl+RT/T arm.  Three  patients  in  the  Bv+RT/T  arm  and  2  patients  in  the  Pl+RT/T  arm  had  the  scheduled de-bulking surgery within four weeks of starting trial treatment. None of these patients experienced significant post-operative wound-healing complications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypertension

Hypertension was reported as an AE more frequently in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm (any  grade:  174  [37.5%]  vs.  58  [13.0%]  patients;  grade  3:  48 [10.3%]  vs.  9  [2.0%]  patients, respectively). Hypertension was reported as resolved in the majority (&gt;70%) of cases. Four patients required discontinuation of Bv therapy.

## Proteinuria

A higher proportion of patients reported proteinuria as an AE in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm  (any  grade:  65  [14.0%]  vs.  18  [4.0%];  Grade  3/4,  17  [3.7%]  vs.  0  [0.0%],  respectively). Proteinuria  resolved  without  specific  treatment  in  the  majority  of  cases;  however,  14  patients discontinued  Bv  treatment  due  to  proteinuria.  One  Bv-treated  patient  developed  grade  4  nephrotic syndrome, which resolved with treatment.

## Non-GI Abscesses and Fistulae

Five patients developed a non-GI abscess or fistula, 3 (0.6%) in the Bv+RT/T arm and 2 (0.4%) in the Pl+RT/T arm. All events were grade 3 except for one grade 4 event in the Bv+RT/T arm. All the events resolved with treatment. Two patients in each arm withdrew from Bv/Pl therapy for the event.

## GI Perforation, Abscesses and Fistulae

Eight (1.7%) patients in the Bv+RT/T arm and one patient (0.2%) in the Pl+RT/T arm experienced a ''GI perforation'' event (including GI abscesses and fistulae). Five of the 8 events in the Bv+RT/T arm were grade ≥ 3 (including one fatal large intestine perforation). Including the patient who died, three patients  in  the  Bv  arm  discontinued  Bv  due  to  the  event.  Six  of  the  seven  non-fatal  events  had resolved  with  treatment  at  the  time  of  the  analysis.  The  event  in  the  Pl+RT/T  arm  (large  intestine perforation) was grade 4 in severity, led to discontinuation of all study treatment, and was unresolved at time of the data cut.

## Congestive Heart Failure

Three patients had a CHF AE; 2 in the Bv+RT/T arm and 1 in the Pl+RT/T arm. Both events in the Bv+RT/T arm were grade 3 whereas a CTC grade was not assigned for the event in the Pl+RT/T arm. One patient in the Bv arm discontinued study treatment due to the event. The CHF had resolved at the time of the clinical cut-off for the patient in the Pl arm and for the patient who discontinued in the Bv arm, but was still unresolved at the time of the data cut for the second Bv-treated patient.

## Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)

There were no reports of PRES in either treatment arm at the time of the clinical cut-off.

## Other Selected AEs

Thrombocytopenia and infections were selected post hoc for further analysis since, apart from the AESIs, these were clinically relevant AEs that had a clearly increased overall incidence in the Bv+RT/T arm compared to the Pl+RT/T arm.

## Thrombocytopenia

The overall incidence of thrombocytopenia AEs (all grades) was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm (154 [33.2%]) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (122 [27.3%]). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia AEs was also higher with Bv than with Pl treatment (67 [14.4%] vs. 44 [9.8%]), but was not associated with clinically significant (grade ≥ 3) bleeding events. Discontinuation of treatment because of thrombocytopenia was balanced between the arms (Bv+RT/T 14 [3.0%]; Pl+RT/T 15 [3.4%], but the number of patients with dose modification/interruption/delay was slightly increased in the Bv+RT/T arm (24% vs. 18%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infections

## Overall incidence (All treatment phases)

The overall incidence of infections was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm (241 [52%] vs. 170 [38%] patients, respectively). The same was true for grade ≥ 3 infections (56 [12.1%] vs. 34 [7.6%] patients, respectively). The number of fatal (grade 5) infection AEs (occurring during treatment or within 90 days of last dose), however, was similar in both groups (8 [1.7%] vs. 7 [1.6%] patients, respectively). The total number of fatal infections during the study including post-treatment survival follow-up was also similar in each group (10 [2.2%] vs. 12 [2.7%] patients, respectively.

## Time to onset of infection

The data over the first 3 months of the study indicate no overall increased risk of infection with the addition of Bv to RT/T during the Concurrent Phase.

After 3 months, the curves of time to onset of infection separate, with the incidence higher in the Bv+RT/T arm. This pattern is not seen for grade ≥ 3 infections, for which the incidence is only slightly higher in the Bv+RT/T arm through the concurrent and maintenance phases of the study up to 6 months. Thus, the difference in incidence over the first 6 months is largely driven by grade 1 and 2 infections occurring during the Maintenance Phase of the study, after the TMZ dose could have been escalated (i.e., between months 3 to 4). Since more patients in the Bv+RT/T arm dose escalated and completed the maintenance phase of treatment this could account for an increased number of events in the Bv+RT/T arm relative to the Pl+RT/T arm.

Beyond 6 months, greater numbers of patients were still being followed in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm. The higher overall incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs of infection in the Bv+RT/T arm appears to be due to AEs with an onset in this later phase of the study and may be related to prolonged treatment exposure and observation in the Bv+RT/T arm.

## Sites of Infection

The grade ≥ 3 infection AEs included most commonly respiratory tract infections for which there was no clear  overall  imbalance  across  groups.  The  incidence  of  grade ≥ 3  sepsis  (PTs:  sepsis,  septic  shock, neutropenic  sepsis,  bacteremia,  urosepsis)  was  higher  in  the  Bv+RT/T  arm  (6  events)  than  in  the Pl+RT/T arm (1 event), as was the occurrence of grade ≥ 3 events reported as wound infections (six events, all in the Bv+RT/T arm, all post-operative cranial wounds) and skin infections (6 events vs. 1 event).  There was no clear imbalance in grade ≥ 3 infections at other sites.

## Serious adverse events

The summary of the most frequent SAEs is summarized in Table 38.

The incidence of AEs reported as serious was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm (36.6% of patients reported at least one SAE, total of 259 SAEs) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (25.7%, 156 SAEs).

## Laboratory findings

There was a higher incidence of newly occurring Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities for haematological tests in the Bv+RT/T arm compared with the Pl+RT/T arm. In line with the AE data, the incidence of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm (39 [8%] vs. 15 [3%]). Other test results appeared to be balanced between the treatment arms.

## Vital Signs

Consistent with the increased incidence of hypertension reported as an AE in Bv-treated patients small increases from pre-treatment baseline values were observed at the last visit in the Bv+RT/T arm for diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure. No notable changes were observed in the Pl+RT/T arm. Median changes from baseline in DBP and SBP at the last visit were 3.0 and 4.0 mmHg, respectively, in the Bv+RT/T arm compared with 0.0 and -1.5 mmHg, respectively, in the Pl+RT/T arm.

## Electrocardiograms

Twelve-lead ECGs were recorded at screening and thereafter as clinically indicated and at the 90-day safety follow-up visit. Very few patients had an abnormal ECG result and those who did generally had the abnormal result prior to initiation of study treatment. Approximately 2% of patients with a normal ECG result at baseline had an abnormal result after initiation of treatment (8/464 [1.7%] Bv+RT/T vs. 11/447 [2.5%] Pl+RT/T).

## Safety in special populations

## Age

In general there seems to be more AEs in the Bv+RT/T group when compared to placebo, and slightly more AEs in the ≥ 65 years group.  Most striking is the higher rate of cerebral haemorrhage, grade 3/4/5 AEs and serious AEs in the ≥65 year group. Furthermore, there is in general a higher discontinuation rate due to AE in patients receiving bevacizumab. There also seems to be higher death rate for patients over ≥ 65 years receiving placebo. Most concerning is the clinically relevant difference in grade 3/4/5 AEs seen between Bv+RT/T and Pl+RT/T, and between ‹65 years and ≥ 65 years.

## Sex

With regard to general AEs there seems to be slightly more AEs in females compared to males and more AEs in the Bv+RT/T group. Males seem to have higher and similar death rate in both treatment groups. Looking at AESI to bevacizumab the event rates are comparable between males and females in the bevacizumab group.

## Race

Since most patients were white, no comparison between different races has been made.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Overall, a higher proportion of patients in the Bv+RT/T arm (24.6%) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (13.2%) discontinued any component of treatment because of AEs. The most common AEs that led to withdrawal of treatment in both treatment arms were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, both of which are recognized as dose limiting toxicities for TMZ. The increased incidence in the Bv treatment arm was attributable to AEs in the following SOCs:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Infections and infestations (21 [4.5%] vs. 8 [1.8%]) - including 6 wound infections in Bv-treated patients vs. none on placebo
-  Nervous system disorders (15 [3.2%]) vs. 6 [1.3%]) - including 5 CVAs in the Bv+TR/T arm vs. none in the Pl+RT/T arm
- Renal disorders (15 [3.2%] vs. none) - 13 proteinuria, 1 nephrotic syndrome, 1 acute renal failure
- General disorders (7 [1.5%] vs. none) - including pyrexia (3), fatigue (2)
- Neoplasm SOC - the difference due to tumour haemorrhage (7 [1.5%] vs. none)
- Cardiac disorders (4 [0.9%] vs. none) - 2 MI,1 CHF,1 coronary artery stenosis

A higher proportion of patients in the Bv+RT/T arm (51.7%) than in the Pl+RT/T arm (37.4%) modified any component of treatment because of an AE. The most common reasons were haemotoxicity (primarily thrombocytopenia), vascular disorders (primarily hypertension) and infections, all of which led to dose modifications in a higher proportion of patients in the Bv+RT/T arm. Of the less common reasons ( ≤ 5% patients in either arm), proteinuria led to dose modification in notably more patients on Bv treatment (3.0% vs. 0.4%).

Considering individual components of trial treatment, the proportion of patients experiencing an AE leading to dose interruption/delay or discontinuation of Bv/Pl was higher in the Bv+RT/T arm than in the Pl+RT/T arm. The same was true for AEs leading to dose modification/interruption/delay or discontinuation of TMZ. The increased incidence was mainly attributable to thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and infections for Bv/Pl and to thrombocytopenia for TMZ.

A minority of patients in both arms required interruption or discontinuation of their radiotherapy treatment due to an AE (Pl+RT/T 19 [4.3%] vs. Bv+RT/T 28 [6.0%]). The SOCs most frequently affected were nervous system, infections, and blood and lymphatic disorders, with no major imbalance between arms in any particular type of AE.

## Post marketing experience

Bevacizumab in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum was approved in the United States on 26 February 2004 and in the European Union on 12 January 2005. During the 8-year period from 26 February 2004 to 25 February 2012, a total of 53586 AEs, of which 44427 were serious, were reported in 28252 patients (2.1%).  In 3411 cases (0.3%), the outcome was fatal.  Overall, the incidence of patients reporting AEs, the proportion of AEs considered serious, and the incidence of patients with AEs leading to death has remained stable over this period.

The most frequently reported SAEs in patients treated with bevacizumab during the reporting period 26 February 2011 to 25 February 2012 were GI disorders (19.0%), general disorders and administration site conditions (10.5%), and infections and infestations (9.2%).

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical safety

The overall exposure and the extent of the safety database are considered satisfactory for the evaluation of safety.

A higher proportion of patients in the Bv arm were able to both dose escalate TMZ (41.3% vs. 34.8%) and to complete the planned 6 cycles of TMZ (64% vs. 37%) compared to the placebo arm, i.e. there was a greater exposure to TMZ therapy in the Bv arm. The difference in the number of patients completing the scheduled 6 cycles of TMZ was primarily due to more patients in the Pl+RT/T arm

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuing due to PD, not primarily due to toxicity. These data indicate that the addition of Bv did not adversely affect the overall tolerability of the TMZ regimen. The follow-up period for safety assessment was approximately 4 months longer in the Bv arm than in the placebo arm, and both the higher exposure to study medication and duration may explain the differences in incidences of AEs observed across the treatment arms in this study.

Overall, there is a higher incidence of AEs in the Bv+RT/TMZ group. The AEs occurred in a pattern that reflected the safety profile of bevacizumab.  These are primarily hypertension, epistaxis, proteinuria, constipation, vomiting, headache, arthralgia, and blood and lymphatic disorders. Higher incidences of grade ≥ 3 adverse events were also seen in the mentioned SOCs/PTs in the Bv+RT/T group.

The incidence of SAEs was higher in the Bv (Bv+RT/TMZ) arm (36.6%) than in the Placebo (RT/TMZ) arm (25.7%), and was due partly to increased incidences of serious AESI, but also explained by higher incidences of infections (mainly pneumonia and sepsis) and thrombocytopenia. SAEs assessed as related to study treatment were also higher in the Bv arm than in the Placebo am (23.9% vs.14.1%, respectively) and the increased incidence in the Bv arm was primarily attributable to AESIs, thrombocytopenia and infections.

With regard to AESI, arterial thromboembolic events, mainly ischaemic strokes, were observed at a slightly higher incidence rate in this trial (5.0%) than in previous Bv trials (up to 3.8% in combination with different chemotherapies), and higher than in the Pl+RT/TMZ arm (1.6%). The potentially increased risk of ATEs elderly Bv-treated patients is reflected in the occurrence of more strokes in the elderly subgroup ( ≥ 65 years). A review of all cases of ATEs showed that the majority of the patients had co-morbidities or risk-factors.

The overall incidence of infections was higher in the Bv arm than in the Pl arm (52% vs. 38%). The same was true for grade ≥ 3 infections (12.1% vs. 7.6%). There was no single SAE with more than 2% increased incidence in the Bv arm compared to the placebo arm, but as a group, analyzed for the SOC 'Infections and infestations' overall, there were more serious infections in the Bv arm than in the Pl arm (10.6% vs. 6,5%), the most commonly reported terms were pneumonia and sepsis.

At clinical cut-off date, 56% of patients had died in the Bv arm compared with 57% patients in the placebo arm, mainly due to disease progression. There was also a similar overall incidence of deaths not due to PD (non-PD deaths; 6.3% placebo vs. 5.4% Bv) in both treatment arms. However, there were differences in the timing of these non-PD deaths. During the actual treatment phases (or within 90 days post treatment), there were more non-PD deaths in the Bv arm (22 deaths) than in the placebo arm (12 deaths). The most common non-PD related cause of death was infection, with similar incidences in both arms - and hence, cannot explain the observed difference in non-PD death rates between the Bv and the control arm. More non-PD deaths occurred in the Bv arm (11) than in the control arm (5) at an early stage , i.e. during the concurrent phase and the treatment break. Of these 11 deaths in the Bv arm there were 3 confirmed or suspected thromboembolic events, one GI perforation and one haemorrhage, all of which could potentially be related to bevacizumab. No common pattern or risk factor associated with the early AEs leading to death was found. A causal relationship with bevacizumab cannot be excluded for these additional deaths.

## Additional expert consultations

Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 8 January 2014 to provide advice on the following question:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Is the safety profile of the proposed treatment regimen acceptable for the intended patient population?

Bevacizumab was associated with increased toxicity, including Serious Adverse Events and fatal events. However, in view of the high unmet need in this indication, the toxicity associated with bevacizumab did not raise major concerns, at least in principle. However, in the absence of an established and clinically meaningful effect, the additional toxicity associated with bevacizumab cannot be considered acceptable.

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on clinical safety

Bevacizumab has a well-known safety profile which includes hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing complications, mucocutanous bleeding, ATEs, VTEs, GI-perforations and fistula. These AEs were also observed in Avaglio.

In combination with temozolomide and radiation there was also an increase in infections (52% vs 38%), including pneumonia, sepsis and skin infections. A higher incidence of ATEs were reported among bevacizumab treated patients in Avaglio than previously reported for bevacizumab, and higher than in the control arm of Avaglio (5% vs 1.6%). There were overall more SAEs in the bevacizumab treated patients than in the control arm; 36.6% vs 25.7%. In addition, there were more non-PD deaths reported as Grade 5 AEs in the bevacizumab arm (22 [4.7%]) than in the control arm (12 [2.7%]) with 11 and 5 out of these occurring in the early phase, i.e. within 70 days from randomisation. A causal relationship with bevacizumab cannot be excluded for these additional deaths.

Overall the risks of adding bevacizumab to the RT/TMZ are associated with increased risk of infections, increased incidence of ATEs and increased non-PD deaths in addition to all the known safety concerns with Avastin.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The assessment of efficacy in GBM is currently based on OS due to a number of limitation with the radiological endpoint PFS. Although standard methods for PFS assessment exist, and although PFS is used in clinical practice to make treatment decisions based on the totality of patient data, this endpoint cannot be considered to be a reliable endpoint to assess the efficacy of new cancer drugs, in particular, if belonging to the class of anti-VEGF drugs, as this further hampers radiological assessment of tumour size.

In  the  pivotal trial presented  (Avaglio),  no  difference  in  OS  or  other  clinically  relevant  endpoint  has been observed. A difference in PFS has been observed but the clinical relevance of this observation cannot be considered established. These results were similar to those observed in a similar phase III trial  (RTOG0825),  also  reporting  no  effect  on  OS  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  RT/T  whilst  observing deterioration of neurocognitive functioning.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

There are serious limitations with radiological assessment of tumour response in GBM patients treated with RT/TMZ and RT/TMZ+bev. Currently, PFS cannot be considered a reliable measure of clinically

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relevant effect in this disease and class of product (see discussion on clinical efficacy and SAG responses).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Bevacizumab has a well-known safety profile which includes hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing complications, mucocutanous bleeding, ATEs, VTEs, GI-perforations and fistula. These AEs were also observed in Avaglio.

The incidence of SAEs was higher in the Bv (Bv+RT/TMZ) arm (36.6%) than in the Placebo (RT/TMZ) arm (25.7%), and was due partly to increased incidences of serious AESI, but also explained by higher incidences of infections (mainly pneumonia and sepsis) and thrombocytopenia. SAEs assessed as related to study treatment were also higher in the Bv arm than in the Placebo am (23.9% vs.14.1%, respectively) and the increased incidence in the Bv arm was primarily attributable to AESIs, thrombocytopenia and infections.

With regard to AESI, arterial thromboembolic events, mainly ischaemic strokes, were observed at a slightly higher incidence rate in this trial (5.0%) than in previous Bv trials (up to 3.8% in combination with different chemotherapies), and higher than in the Pl+RT/TMZ arm (1.6%).  The overall incidence of infections was higher in the Bv arm than in the Pl arm (52% vs. 38%).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

There were more non-PD deaths reported as Grade 5 AEs in the bevacizumab arm than in the control arm, i.e. 22 [4.7%] vs 12 [2.7%], respectively, with 11 and 5 out of these occurring in the early phase, i.e. within 70 days from randomisation. A causal relationship with bevacizumab cannot be excluded for these additional deaths.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Based on the data presented, there was no clinically meaningful effect that has been established on the basis of clinically relevant endpoints such as overall survival or health-related quality of life. The claimed improvement in progression-free survival associated with the combination of bevacizumab+ RT/T compared to placebo +RT/T based on the Avaglio trial cannot be considered of clinical relevance in view of methodological problems associated with PFS in this disease and with this type of product.

The bevacizumab + RT/T combination was associated with increased toxicity, including serious adverse events and fatal events.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

In the absence of an established clinical efficacy or other clinically relevant benefits, and considering the significant toxicity of the combination of bevacizumab+ RT/T, the benefit-risk cannot be considered positive in the proposed indication.

Extension of indication to include Avastin in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

## Grounds for refusal:

## Whereas

- The efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma has not been sufficiently demonstrated;
- In the absence of established efficacy, a positive benefit-risk balance has not been established.

the CHMP on the grounds of Article 16 of Regulation 1234/2008/EC has recommended the refusal of the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation.

## Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 22 May 2014

Following the CHMP conclusion that the claimed indication in glioblastoma for Avastin was not approvable, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.

## Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant

The applicant presented his rationale in writing and at an oral explanation.

A summary of the applicant's grounds for re-examination is presented below.

Study methodology including imaging and disease assessment criteria:  The applicant considered that the pivotal study (Avaglio) was designed using standard methodology in GBM for the assessment of tumour growth and followed the current clinical practice. While the applicant acknowledged that there is an on-going evolution of the criteria used to assess disease progression in brain tumours, they contended that the criteria used in Avaglio study represent the most advanced and accepted technology in line with expert recommendations. Several strategies were applied prospectively in Avaglio in order to minimize the possibility of incorrectly interpreting the MRI scan including implementation of an algorithm for the determination of pseudo-progression.

Reliability of PFS:  The applicant considered that the robustness and reliability of the primary analysis of PFS was confirmed in a number of predefined and post-hoc sensitivity analyses. Key post-hoc sensitivity analyses that took into account the concerns raised by the CHMP on the reliability of the imaging technique to detect disease progression excluded patients 1) with potential or confirmed pseudo-progression, 2) with possible pseudo-progression in the Pl+RT/T arm and possible pseudoresponse in the Bv+RT/T arm and 3) with PFS &lt; Day 93 to avoid any potential impact of pseudo-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

progression and post-radiation imaging changes at the first disease assessment. The applicant provided an additional post-hoc PFS analysis where all progressions exclusively based on non-index lesions were not regarded as a PFS event.

Finally, the applicant provided a post-hoc analysis in line with the RANO criteria (Wen et al., 2010), which are the current standard used in clinical trials. According to this analysis, 84% of the PFS events could be considered unequivocal.

Clinical relevance of PFS:  The applicant considered that Avaglio study used a variety of validated and reliable measures to assess the clinical status that captured the patient's perspective (health-related quality of life [HRQOL]), neurocognitive function (Mini Mental Status Examination [MMSE]), and functional status (Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS]). According to the applicant, the KPS results showed a delay in time to definitive deterioration in KPS in favour of bevacizumab irrespective of whether PD was included (pre-specified) or excluded (exploratory) as an event. At the time of disease progression, the data indicated a trend for deterioration in functional status and HRQoL compared to the assessments prior to progression, which underscores the clinical importance for the patients of delaying the time until disease progression. While the Applicant acknowledged that limited data was captured beyond the time of progression, they contended that this does not diminish the value of the data captured on study.

Absence of OS benefit:  According to the applicant, the use of subsequent lines of therapy, that often included bevacizumab, may have confounded the result. The applicant concluded that despite the obvious flaws and biases of the exploratory survival analyses these analyses indicated a beneficial effect of bevacizumab.

## Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant.

Regarding the MRI evaluation of disease progression, the CHMP maintained the view that the impact of the use of adapted criteria in Study BO21990 remains unclear. The number of PD events may have been overestimated in the placebo arm and underestimated in the bevacizumab arm. The applicant did not convincingly show that the sensitivity analyses performed were able to mitigate the risk of systematic biases in the evaluation of PFS and were adequate to provide sufficient reassurance that bevacizumab produces a PFS increase of clinically important magnitude. In particular, the applicant did not clearly justify how the criteria chosen to exclude specific patients or events in the various sensitivity analyses were able to address the biases/uncertainties around the assessment of progression.

The results of the post hoc analysis according to the RANO criteria were not considered sufficiently robust to resolve the uncertainties around the PFS results. This analysis resulted in an estimated benefit of smaller magnitude, based on an analysis that, necessarily but problematically, introduces some informative censoring. All the additional analyses cannot exclude the possibility of important bias and the estimated effect is not regarded as sufficiently reliable to conclude that a clinically relevant therapeutic efficacy has been established.

Thus, the CHMP maintained the view that it was not possible to estimate with sufficient confidence the magnitude of the gain in tumour control provided by bevacizumab when added to standard of care.

Regarding clinical outcomes, the applicant proposed that only maintenance of QoL to the time of disease progression may be expected, and this can be accepted. However, the CHMP concluded that the positive effects claimed by the applicant are mainly driven by the inclusion of PD as an event in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these analyses, and therefore, they cannot provide independent support or insight into the clinical benefits of delaying progression. Nominally, statistically significant results were retained for some parameters when PD was not counted as a deterioration event. These analyses should be interpreted with caution since relevant data were not collected systematically after disease progression and the consequent impact of (potentially informative) censoring on the results is unclear. In addition, some assessments may have been influenced by knowledge of progression status.

Concerning overall survival, the CHMP acknowledged that no OS benefit had been observed in Study BO21990, a finding consistent with the result of the RTOG 0825 trial. It has not been established that the most likely cause for the failure to demonstrate an OS benefit is confounded by post-progression treatments (including crossover to bevacizumab) rather than lack of an effect.

In conclusion, as the clinical relevance of the efficacy results is uncertainthe benefit-risk balance of bevacizumab as an add-on therapy to standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is considered negative.

## Recommendations following re-examination

Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated, and, therefore maintains its recommendation for the refusal of the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation for the above mentioned medicinal product. The CHMP considers that:

- The efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma has not been sufficiently demonstrated;
-    In the absence of established efficacy, a positive benefit-risk balance has not been established.

## DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS

Some members of the CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows:

## Divergent opinion

## Efficacy

The AVAglio study (BO21990) is a large randomized study that evaluates the effect of the addition of bevacizumab to standard radiotherapy-temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The study was designed based on current best practices for disease assessment using MRI for tumour response and progression. Radiographic criteria were adapted to address specific concerns related to the effect of antiangiogenic therapy on imaging. Specifically, assessment of nonenhancing tumor components was included, and a specific algorithm was used to assess pseudoprogression. These adaptations are consistent with current international consensus guidelines.

The ITT analysis included 921 patients (463 in the placebo group and 458 in the bevacizumab group). Two co-primary endpoints (investigator-reported PFS and OS) were used. Median PFS was prolonged by 4.4 months, from 6.2 months (placebo) to 10.6 months (bevacizumab) whereas median OS was almost identical for the two treatment groups (16.6 months vs. 16.8 months). It should be noted that the PFS for the placebo group is consistent with the results of multiple studies using the Stupp regimen.

The PFS gain was associated with diminished use of glucocorticoids, which may be a consequence of improved tumor control (reduced tumor mass) as well as the decreased permeability of tumor vasculature afforded by bevacizumab. More importantly, median time to KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status) deterioration &gt; 20 points was prolonged from 5.5 months (placebo) to 9.0 months (bevacizumab). A KPS of 70 indicates that the patient is capable of self-care but is not able to perform normal activity or work. The median duration of KPS &gt; 70 was 6 months (placebo) as compared to 9 months (bevacizumab). This finding suggests that the PFS gain is associated with important clinical benefit to the patient and KPS assessment is independent of tumour measurement by MRI. The quality of life was maintained during the therapy with bevacizumab. The PFS endpoint was robust across all subgroups.

It is acknowledged that MRI assessment of response and progression poses special challenges when antiangiogenic agents are included in treatment of GBM. Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon related to oedema and necrosis with temozolomide and radiation which may appear as progressions on images. Pseudoresponse, i.e. a response seen very rapidly after start of treatment has been observed with antiangiogenic therapy in glioblastoma. Several sensitivity analyses, as requested by the CHMP, all support the primary estimate. In a sensitivity analysis, where PDs only based on scans are excluded, the PFS estimate supports the primary estimate. As shown by the Applicant, to further investigate the concern with PsPD, a PFS subgroup analysis of patients who were progression-free for at least 93 days, showed a significant difference in favour of the bevacizumab arm. Another exploratory analysis excluding possible PsPD in the Pl+RT/T arm and pseudoresponse in the Bv+RT/T arm was also conducted. In the Bv+RT/T arm all patients without a response within the first 92 days after randomisation in the Bv+RT/T arm were included. In the Pl+RT/T arm only patients with a unmistakable PFS event in the first 92 days were included. The analysis shows  significant difference in favour of Bv+RT/T arm.

The lack of OS benefit should not preclude an approval of a first-line therapy. The influence of subsequent therapies and cross-over from placebo to bevacizumab may have confounded the OS coprimary endpoint.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Several sensitivity analyses including comparison of unequivocal events of progression supported the reliability of the data obtained on PFS.

## Safety

Due to the high unmet medical need in this indication, the toxicity associated with bevacizumab therapy does not raise major concerns. No detriments on OS were observed.

## Conclusion on the overall B/R

There is high medical need for improved therapy of GBM. Temozolomide was the latest agent approved for the indication (EU MAA 26/01/1999). GBM is a brain tumor with significant differences from other solid tumors both in characteristics and in the presentation of the well being of patients. The applicant has provided data that shows a clinically meaningful gain in PFS when bevacizumab is added to standard radiotherapy/chemotherapy. The PFS gain is associated with a significantly prolonged functional status as measured by KPS and diminished steroid use. Thus, efficacy has been adequately demonstrated despite the lack of significantly superior OS results. The added toxicity associated with bevacizumab therapy does not raise major concerns.

B/R balance is considered favourable.
