## 1. Background information on the annual renewal

The European Commission issued on 6 January 2021, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for Spikevax. This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA.

A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L., submitted to the Agency on 4 th July 2022 an application for renewal of the conditional MA for Spikevax. The expiry date of the MA is 6 th  January 2023. A revised RMP version 5.0 was submitted as an addendum to the initial annual renewal application submission.

The period covered by this annual renewal is 6 th  January 2021 to 5 th  June 2022.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on the SOBs have been submitted. The CHMP is of the view that all three quality related SOBs are fulfilled.

With regard to the clinical SOB 010, the study milestones for mRNA-1273-P301 are updated due to delays in last subject last visit (LSLV) scheduled for Dec 2022. Study P301 continues to follow the safety and effectiveness of the 2-dose primary series of mRNA-1273 in adults 18 years of age and older for 24 months. Data summarising 6 months post dose 2 follow up have been provided and the safety profile demonstrated no unexpected reactogenicity or any new safety signals. The currently available data base from study P301 in terms of vaccine efficacy and safety is considered sufficiently comprehensive to allow for a confirmatory conclusion on the benefit risk ratio at this point in time. It is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in P301 will alter the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax. The clinical SOB 010 can therefore be reclassified as a Category 3 study in the RMP and removed from Annex II.

With regard to the clinical SOB 040, results from mRNA-1273-P203 evaluating the overall safety profile of mRNA-1273 in the adolescents aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years are generally consistent with the findings t o date in the Phase 3 Study P301 in adults 18 years of age and older. Study P203 was amended to offer booster doses to all participants and will continue follow-up also including the administration of a booster dose.  No  new  safety  signals  have  been  observed  so  far  and  it  is  not  expected  that  the  remaining outstanding data in P203 will alter the benefit risk profile of Spikevax in this age group. The clinical SOB 040 can therefore be reclassified as a Category 3 study in the RMP and removed from Annex II.

Regarding  the  clinical  SOB  060,  study  mRNA-1273-P204  will  continue  to  monitor  the  safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of mRNA1273 in children 6 to &lt; 12 years of age. The safety and data reactogenicity  data  for  the  mRNA  1273  vaccine  are  consistent  with  events  commonly  seen  in  the paediatric population according to the safety follow-up analysis up to data cut off 21 February 2022. The benefit risk profile of Spikevax in children 6-11 years of age is well established and it is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in P204 will alter the benefit risk profile of Spikevax in this age group. The clinical SOB 060 can therefore be reclassified as a Category 3 study in the RMP and removed from Annex II.

In summary, it is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in Studies P301, P203 and P204 will bring substantial additional confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax in the respective age groups. The remaining clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as Category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data.

As part of this annual renewal the CHMP is of the opinion that SOBs 010, 040 and 060 can therefore be deleted from Annex II.

## 2.3. Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations

During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on the quality related SOBs 001, 002 and 003 have been submitted and assessment completed. All three quality-related SOBs are now fulfilled. From the clinical point of view, the available safety and efficacy data available for Spikevax is considered comprehensive and supportive of the positive benefit-risk balance of Spikevax. The clinical SOBs 010, 040 and 060 may be reclassified as Category 3 studies in the RMP, with a final CSR to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. They can therefore be deleted from Annex II.

## 3. Additional scientific data provided relevant for the assessment of the benefit/risk balance

## 3.1. Quality

All the requested quality data was provided, and all remaining SOBs were fulfilled (see status report above).

## 3.2. Clinical efficacy

Since the initial conditional marketing authorisation, the indication was extended for use in individuals 6 years of age and above. A booster dose at least 3 months after the 2 nd  dose of the primary vaccination was approved for individuals of 18 years of age and older. (mRNA.1273.214) in children aged 12 years and older is currently under review in the EU, US, Canada,

An application for use in children aged 6 months to 5 years is under review. The application for a booster dose of an updated vaccine including ancestral mRNA and Omicron BA.1 mRNA Australia and Switzerland.

## 3.3. Clinical safety

Within the current application for CMA renewal, the MAH has not provided any new safety data.

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new safety data have emerged and have been assessed in procedures summarised below. Also, additional safety assessments based on the data emerged since the DLP have been conducted or are still ongoing as summarised below:

Since the previous annual renewal (DLP 05.06.2021), two periodic safety update reports (PSUR) have been submitted PSUR#1 (PSUSA/00010897/202106) and PSUR#2 (PSUSA/00010897/202112), for which PSUR#1 was assessed and finalised within the period whereas PSUR #2 was finalised after DLP. The procedures had the following outcomes:

PSUR#1: Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction 'paraesthesia' with a frequency 'rare'. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

PSUR#2: Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction 'extensive swelling of vaccinated limb' with a frequency 'not known'. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

Since the previous annual renewal, a total of seven summary safety reports have been submitted and assessed. The below list summarises a review period and procedure number for each report:

EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0066 ( ongoing ):

- Update of section 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data for Spikevax concerning concomitant administration with high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Submitted 28 April 2022 and evaluation is still ongoing at time of submission of the renewal application.

Since the previous annual renewal, the PRAC has initiated the following signal assessments:

Myocarditis and pericarditis (Procedure nr: SDA 033 and SDA 033.1; EPITT no: 19713):

- The PRAC has agreed that based on the evidence assessed, a causal association between COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside-modified) Spikevax (previously COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) and myocarditis/pericarditis is considered of at least a reasonable possibility. A variation to update the PI in section 4.4 and 4.8 to implement the signal recommendations from the PRAC was submitted by 09 July 2021 and approved 13 July 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005791/IAIN/0027). In addition, the RMP was updated to further characterise the risk in a separate procedure: RMP version 2.1 with DLP 31 May 2021 was updated to include myocarditis and pericarditis as important identified risks and submitted to the EMA by 19 July 2021 and approved by 10 February 2022 (EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0028). Direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) has been distributed 19 July 2021.

Erythema Multiforme (EPITT no: 19720):

- The PRAC concluded that a causal relationship between Spikevax and Erythema multiforme is at least a reasonable possibility and that the MAH should submit a variation to amend the product information in section 4.8 to include 'Erythema multiforme' with frequency 'Not Known' under the SOC: 'Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders'. The PIL should be updated accordingly. Variation to update the PI (EMEA/H/C/005791/IAIN/0040) was submitted by 01 November 2021 and approved 11 November 2021.

Glomerulonephritis and Nephrotic Syndrome (EPITT no: 19724):

- The PRAC concluded that the MAH should closely monitor the issue of 'glomerulonephritis/nephrotic syndrome', including exacerbations, and present a cumulative review of cases from all sources and relevant literature in the upcoming PSUR submissions.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome for Children (EPITT no: 19732):

- The PRAC concluded that the data is currently insufficient to support regulatory action and therefore no update of the PI in relation to MIS is currently warranted. The PRAC agreed that all the MAHs of COVID-19 vaccines should continue to closely monitor MIS, and all new cases should be reported in SSRs and PSURs. In addition, a dedicated questionnaire should be implemented to retrieve an appropriate level of information to facilitate the assessment of the cases of suspected MIS, as agreed by the PRAC.

Myocarditis and pericarditis (SDA 033.2, FU EPITT no: 19713):

- Having considered the available evidence from large observational studies in and outside the EEA, as well as the data provided by the MAH, the PRAC concluded that the MAH should submit a variation to amend section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. The PIL should be updated accordingly (EMEA/H/C/005791/IAIN/0045).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Capillary Leak Syndrome/Capillary permeability (EPITT no: 19743):

- The PRAC concluded that the few cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups reported with Spikevax merited a warning in the product information. The PRAC agreed that the MAH of Spikevax should amend the product information to include a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The PIL should be updated accordingly. A variation to update PI in section 4.4 to implement the signal recommendations from the PRAC Signal assessment report on capillary leak syndrome + MAH address with Spikevax was submitted by 7 April 2022 and approved 29 April 2022 (EMEA/H/C/005791/IAIN/0063/G).

Autoimmune Hepatitis (EPITT no: 19750):

- The PRAC recommended that the signal of autoimmune hepatitis should be kept under close monitoring with an updated cumulative review to be submitted in the next PSUR (DLP: 30 June 2022).

Amenorrhoea (SDA 058; EPITT no: 19781):

- The PRAC concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to warrant an update to the product information at present. The PRAC agreed that the MAH should provide an updated analysis of amenorrhea events post-vaccination in the PSUR with the DLP of 18 Dec 2022.

Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (SDA 059; EPITT no: 19780) (ongoing):

- The PRAC concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to warrant an update to the product information at present. The PRAC has agreed that the MAH should provide an updated cumulative review of heavy menstrual bleeding post-vaccination by 24 August 2022.

Corneal Graft Rejection (EPITT no: 19792) (ongoing): The initial submission was on 10 May 2022 and evaluation is still ongoing.

Evaluations of the following safety topics are currently ongoing and MAH's analyses are expected in the next PSURs (PSUR#3: PSUSA/00010897/202206 and PSUR#4: PSUSA/00010897/202212):

- Chronic urticaria/chronic spontaneous urticaria (PSUR#3)
- Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PSUR#3)
- Solid organ cutaneous vasculitis (PSUR#3)
- Delayed onset urticaria presenting &gt;48 hours after vaccination (PSUR#3)
- Neuralgic Amyotrophy (PSUR#3)
- Myasthenia Gravis (PSUR#3)
- Acquired haemophilia (PSUR#3)
- Autoimmune hepatitis (PSUR#3)
- Amenorrhea (PSUR#4)

## 3.4. Pharmacovigilance inspections

Various Health Authorities around the globe performed inspections of the Moderna pharmacovigilance system.

Swissmedic from 21 st  to 22 nd  December 2020 and a re-inspection from 8 th  to 9 th  March 2021

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The scope of the 21 st -22 nd  December 2020 inspection was to evaluate the pharmacovigilance system in place at Moderna in accordance with applicable Swiss legislation and international pharmacovigilance guidelines. The inspectors raised 1 critical finding, 3 major and 1 minor. Following the inspection report, a CAPA plan was developed by Moderna and endorsed by the inspection team.

The scope of the 8 th  to 9 th  March 2021 re-inspection was to verify the implementation of the agreed CAPA plan from the previous inspection and the adherence to the applicable regulation. The inspectors raised 4 major findings and 2 minor. Following the inspection report, a CAPA plan was developed by Moderna and endorsed by the inspection team.

## MHRA from 1 st  February to 4 th  February 2021

The scope of the inspection included the routine and enhanced pharmacovigilance activities described in the Spikevax RMP and in sections 6b-g of the MHRA Guidance on Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Plan Requirements for COVID-19 Vaccines in the UK. The inspection included a review of the local (UK) and global pharmacovigilance systems as they apply to the Spikevax and was performed remotely due to the COVID- 19 pandemic. As EU supervisory authority for the PSMF MFL17546, the HPRA attended the inspection as observers. Personnel from Moderna and IQVIA were available for interview sessions to participate in the inspection.

The inspectors raised 1 critical finding and 1 major finding related to the management and reporting of adverse  reactions.  Following  the  inspection  report,  a  CAPA  plan  was  developed  by  Moderna  and endorsed  by  the  inspection  team.  It  was  recommended  that  'when  the  company  has  adequately implemented the proposed corrective and preventative actions, the pharmacovigilance system will be considered to be in general compliance with applicable legislation.'

## EMA/Health Canada joint inspection from 21 st  June to 2 nd  July 2021

The CHMP asked for an inspection to be carried out of the conduct of pharmacovigilance for Spikevax (CX-024414, mRNA-1273). The inspection was conducted at the PSMF site by the HPRA and the DKMA. The inspection was systems- based and the scope was in accordance with GVP Module III and the IREQ.

A copy of this inspection report has been made available to the EMA and to the competent authorities of other EU member states. Health Canada and the MHRA (as observer) also received a copy.

The inspectors raised 5 major findings and 5 minors. Following the inspection report, a CAPA plan was developed by Moderna and endorsed by the inspection team.

In accordance with Union procedures (EMA/INS/PhV/192230/2014) as the CAPA proposed was acceptable, the inspection was considered complete and closed by the inspectors on the date of issuance of the Final IR (16 th  September 2021).

## TGA inspection from 14 th  to 17 th  March 2022

The inspection was conducted under the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The purpose of the inspection was to assess compliance with the pharmacovigilance legislation and guidelines, as well as the conditions specified in the relevant approvals for registration or listing, and subsequent variations.

The inspectors raised 1 critical deficiency in collection of the safety data, 1 major deficiency in QMS and 2 minor deficiencies. A CAPA plan has been developed by Moderna and endorsed by the inspection team.

## Health Canada re-inspection from 1 st  to 2 nd  June 2022

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This re-inspection was conducted remotely by one inspector (Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement Specialist) who served as the Lead Health Canada inspector during the combined EMA / Health Canada GVP inspection of Moderna conducted 21 st  June to 2 nd  July 2021. The re-inspection focused on the verification of Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) taken to remediate non-compliance noted by Health Canada in the fourteen (14) observations cited during the 2021 joint inspection.

The inspector raised no findings and concluded that the CAPAs from the previous inspection (June- July 2021) were satisfactorily implemented, and no further actions are requested.

## 3.5. Discussion

In summary, the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax in individuals 6 years of age and older is confirmed. It is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in Studies P301, P203, and P204 will bring substantial additional confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax. The remaining clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as Category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. The conditional marketing authorisation can therefore be converted into a standard marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations.

## 4. Risk management plan

The RMP v4.1 has been submitted within procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0067 to update the Spikevax indication to include individuals 6 months of age and older and to update clinical trial exposure data for mRNA-1273-P204 to include the use of Spikevax in children 6 months to &lt; 2 years of age and 2 years to &lt; 6 years of age. Furthermore, the RMP is updated to include the 0.10 mg/mL dispersion for injection supplied as a multidose vial and associated strengths and posology as well as including the international non-proprietary name (INN) to elasomeran in line with SmPC. The RMP is currently under assessment.

After the initial submission of the renewal material (04 July 2022), the MAH submitted additional documents (20 July 2022) such as addendum with the comprehensiveness of the clinical studies covered by SOBs (P301, P203 and P204) along with supportive clinical data, updated PI, and updated RMP v5.0. The rationale for an update of the RMP with a reclassification of the clinical studies mRNA1273-P301, mRNA-1273-P203, and mRNA-1273-P204 from category 2 to category 3 studies in the Pharmacovigilance Plan is based on the application to convert the conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax to a full marketing authorisation.

The updated RMP version 5.0 summary table of additional pharmacovigilance activities is shown below.

The CHMP considered that the efficacy of Spikevax is sufficiently described and that Studies P301,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

P203, and P204 are no longer key to the benefit-risk of the product. The CHMP therefore supports the reclassification of the studies as Category 3 studies in the RMP. The revised RMP version 5.0 is agreed.

## 5. Changes to the Product Information

Annexes I, II and IIIA of the current marketing authorisation were amended to reflect the granting of a marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations for Spikevax.

## Additional monitoring

Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Spikevax (elasomeran) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.

Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

## 6. Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance

## 6.1. Specific Obligations (SOBs)

## Compliance of SOB data submitted

During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on the SOBs have been submitted. The quality related SOBs 001, 002 and 003 are now fulfilled.

With regard to SOB 010, the study milestones for mRNA-1273-P301 are updated due to delays in last subject last visit (LSLV) scheduled for Dec 2022. Study P301 continues to follow the safety and effectiveness of the 2-dose primary series of mRNA-1273 in adults 18 years of age and older for 24 months. Data summarising 6 months post dose 2 follow up have been provided and the safety profile demonstrated no unexpected reactogenicity or any new safety signals. It is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in P301 will alter the benefit risk profile of Spikevax.

With regard to SOB 040, results from mRNA-1273-P203 evaluating the overall safety profile of Spikevax in the adolescents aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years are generally consistent with the findings to date in the Phase 3 Study P301 in adults 18 years of age and older. Study P203 was amended to offer booster doses to all participants and will continue follow-up also including the administration of a booster dose. No new safety signals have been observed so far and it is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in P203 will alter the benefit risk profile of Spikevax in this age group.

With regard to SOB 060, study mRNA-1273-P204 will continue to monitor the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax in children 6 to &lt; 12 years of age . The safety and data reactogenicity data for the mRNA 1273 vaccine are consistent with events commonly seen in the paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

according to the safety follow-up analysis up to data cut off 21 February 2022. The benefit risk profile of Spikevax in children 6-11 years of age is well established and it is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in P204 will alter the benefit risk profile of Spikevax in this age group.

In summary, it is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in Studies P301, P203 and P204 will bring substantial additional confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax in the respective age groups. The remaining clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as Category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data.

As part of this annual renewal the CHMP is of the opinion that SOBs 010, 040 and 060 can therefore be deleted from Annex II.

## Conversion of the Specific Obligations (SOBs) to Category 3 studies in the RMP (MEAs)

The CHMP is of the opinion that the comprehensive existing data package for this vaccine warrants conversion of the current conditional approval into a full marketing authorisation. The three remaining Specific Obligations (SOBs) may be reclassified as Category 3 studies in the RMP (MEAs) and final study reports for the ongoing clinical trials should be submitted as supportive data according to the agreed due dates, as shown in the below table.

All interim reports have been provided as per agreement with EMA. The study milestones for mRNA-1273-P203 are updated due to the inclusion of a booster (homologous and heterologous) and lower dose arms at the request of the FDA, leading to the addition of an interim long-term safety CSR for Part A & B to capture 6 months of safety data and an update to the final CSR milestone respectively. As the lower dose arms of P203 have not begun enrolling, the final CSR timeline is significantly delayed. The interim long-term safety CSR for Part A&B is intended to provide a comprehensive update as initially agreed. |

## 6.2. Benefit-risk Balance

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not have an impact on the benefit-risk of Spikevax in the approved indications.

The data collected as part of the specific obligations for Spikevax during the period covered by this annual renewal supported its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indications.

## Favourable effects

Since the initial conditional marketing authorisation for use in individuals 18 years of age and older, the indication has been extended for use in children 6 years and above.

An application for use in children aged 6 months to 5 years is under review. A booster dose at least 3 months after the second dose of the primary vaccination was approved for individuals of 18 years of age and older.

An application for a booster dose of 50 micrograms to be given at least 3 months after the second dose to adolescents aged 12-17 years and older has been approved but it has not been part of this renewal period.

An additional dose may be given to people aged 6 years and older with a severely weakened immune system, at least 28 days after their second dose.

The application for a booster dose of an updated vaccine including ancestral mRNA and omicron mRNA (mRNA.1273.214) in individuals aged 12 years and older is currently under review in the EU, US; Canada, Australia and Switzerland.

The most important favourable effects are briefly summarised below.

## Clinical efficacy in adults

Clinical efficacy has been investigated in a placebo-controlled study conducted with about 30,000 participants of which about 14,000 received two doses the vaccine 1 month apart. Participants were monitored for a median of 92 days for the development of COVID-19 disease. Results are summarised in the table below for vaccine efficacy in terms of protection from COVID-19 of any severity starting 14 days post 2nd dose:

## Efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

An ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, clinical trial to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years was/is conducted in the United States. 3,732 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax or saline placebo 1 month apart. Participants will be followed for efficacy and safety until 1 year after the second dose. The study showed that Spikevax produced a comparable antibody response in 12- to 17-yearolds to that seen in young adults (aged 18 to 25 years), as measured by the level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, none of 2,163 children receiving the vaccine developed COVID-19, compared with four of 1,073 children given a dummy injection. These results allowed to conclude that the efficacy of Spikevax in children 12 to 17 years old is similar to that in adults.

## Clinical efficacy in children 6 through 11 years of age

An ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, clinical trial to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of Spikevax in children ages 6 through 11 years was/is conducted in the United States and Canada. Participants with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the study. 4,011 participants were randomised 3:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax or saline placebo 1 month apart. A secondary efficacy analysis evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases was performed in 3,497 participants who received two doses (0.25 mL at 0 and 1 month) of either Spikevax (n=2,644) or placebo (n=853), and had a negative baseline SARS- CoV-2 status. There were three COVID-19 cases (0.1%) in the Spikevax group and four COVID-19 cases (0.5%) in the placebo group, started 14 days after the second dose. An analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titers and seroresponse rates 28 days after Dose 2 was conducted in a subset of children aged 6 through 11 years (n=319) in the paediatric study and in participants aged 18 through 25 years (n=295) in the adult study. The GMR of the neutralising antibody titers in children 6 through 11 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-olds was 1.239 (95% CI: 1.072, 1.432). The difference in seroresponse rate was 0.1% (95% CI: -1.9, 2.1) and the non-inferiority criteria were met. Based on the immunobridging, the VE of Spikevax in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age is expected to match the vaccine efficacy observed in adults, where VE was 94.1%.

## Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

The uncertainties and limitations of favourable effects are the same as in the initial assessment. The principal uncertainties relate to duration of protection and efficacy in risk groups, e.g., pregnant women and immunocompromised subjects. Another uncertainty relates to vaccine efficacy against upcoming virus variants of concern. Regarding this point, the MAH has already submitted a grouped Type II variation, on 20 th  July 2022 to introduce bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine mRNA1273.214.

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of Spikevax is based on data generated in a placebo-controlled clinical study on 30,351 adults ≥ 18 years of age, another placebo -controlled clinical study with 3,726 participants 12 through 17 years of age, another clinical study with 4,002 participants 6 through 11 years of age, and post-marketing experience.

Solicited adverse reactions are reported more frequently among vaccine than placebo recipients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), fatigue (70%), headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23%), axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness (10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination.

Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to &lt; 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above.

Grade 3 solicited local adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. In the participants who received the vaccine, solicited systemic adverse reactions were reported numerically more frequently by vaccine participants after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. Grade 3 systemic adverse reactions (fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache) were reported more frequently after Dose 2 than after Dose 1.

Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 28 days following each vaccination were reported by 23.9% of participants who received Spikevax and 21.6% of participants who received placebo. Unsolicited AE that occurred in ≥ 1% of study particip ants who received Spikevax and at a rate at least 1.5-fold higher rate than placebo, were lymphadenopathy related events (1.1% versus 0.6%) and delayed injection site reactions reported &gt;7 days after vaccination (1.2% versus 0.4%). All of the lymphadenopathy events are similar to the axillary swelling/tenderness in the injected arm reported as solicited adverse reactions. Delayed injection site reactions included one or more of the following: erythema, pain and swelling, and are likely related to vaccination.

Serious adverse events were reported at the same rates in participants who received Spikevax (0.6%) and placebo (0.6%) from the first dose until 28 days following the last vaccination. Serious adverse events were reported at the same rates in participants who received Spikevax (1.0%) and placebo (1.0%) from the first dose until the last observation.

## Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age

In a clinical study, the most frequent adverse reactions in participants 12 through 17 years of age were injection site pain (97%), headache (78%), fatigue (75%), myalgia (54%), chills (49%), axillary swelling/tenderness (35%), arthralgia (35%), nausea/vomiting (29%), injection site swelling (28%), injection site erythema (26%), and fever (14%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Children 6 through 11 years of age

In a clinical study, the most frequent adverse reactions in participants 6 through 11 years of age following administration of the primary series were injection site pain (98.4%), fatigue (73.1%), headache (62.1%), myalgia (35.3%), chills (34.6%), nausea/vomiting (29.3%), axillary swelling/tenderness (27.0%), fever (25.7%), injection site erythema (24.0%), injection site swelling (22.3%), and arthralgia (21.3%).

The product information has been updated since approval as new data has emerged. Since the initial approval of the vaccine in EU, safety variations have been submitted to EMA.

## Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

The principal uncertainties are related to long-term effects, and effects in specific risk groups.

## Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

The benefits of Spikevax in terms of protection against COVID-19 clearly outweigh the identified risks, and no new information has emerged during this renewal period that would necessitate a reconsideration of the initially concluded positive benefit-risk balance. The three quality related SOBs are fulfilled. The fulfilment of the remaining Category 3 studies in the RMP and submission of the final CSRs is due by 31 July 2024.

## Balance of benefits and risks

Based on the cumulative evidence in terms of favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax remains positive.

## Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations

The benefit-risk profile of Spikevax in children, adolescents, and adults, 6 years of age and older is well established from the clinical data obtained thus far in the clinical program, and corroborated by postauthorisation data.

Cumulatively, a total of 1,091,443,760 doses of Spikevax had been delivered to 88 countries, and more than 663 million vaccine doses having been administered globally as of 15 June 2022. Statistically significant vaccine efficacy to prevent COVID-19 was demonstrated during the ongoing pandemic in interim and primary analyses.

In the adult clinical development program, two doses of 100 µg Spikevax demonstrated 93.2% efficacy against COVID-19 in more than 30,000 participants over a median observation period of over 5.3 months.

In addition, immunobridging demonstrated non inferiority for the age groups from 6 to 17 years, based on comparable antibody response to that seen in young adults (aged 18 to 25 years).

The clinical benefit of Spikevax is supported by evidence of a robust immune response both in terms of binding and neutralising antibodies as well as the induction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th-1 dominant phenotype.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall safety profile of two doses of Spikevax observed in Studies 203 and 204 was consistent with the known safety profile to date observed in the pivotal Study 301 as well as post-marketing surveillance. Based on administration of Spikevax across all clinical studies and in the extensive postauthorisation setting, there have been no emergent safety concerns and the AE profile is manifested largely by mild to moderate reactogenicity lasting 2 to 3 days. This has not changed since the granting of the initial marketing authorisation. Also, across the paediatric age groups, the adverse event profile of Spikevax is characterised primarily by transient local injection site and systemic reactions, Grade 1 to Grade 2 in severity, and of 2 to 3 days in duration.

In the post-authorisation period, there have been rare reports of anaphylaxis following Spikevax administration. Following the identified safety signal of events of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines, the MAH had implemented an enhanced surveillance on the events of myocarditis and pericarditis. The MAH has submitted periodic safety update reports (PSUR).

According to the Guideline on the conditional MA (EMA/CHMP/509951/2006, Rev.1), section 6. MA not subject to SOB:

'When the specific obligations have been fulfilled, the CHMP may, in accordance with Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, adopt an opinion recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 ('marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations').This can be done at the time of renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation or at the time of assessment of the data submitted to fulfil the last remaining specific obligation.'

Based on the comprehensive data available from multiple sources, it is agreed that the remaining specific obligations regarding the Studies P301, P203 and P204 may be reclassified as Category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at a later stage as supportive data. The conditional marketing authorisation can therefore be converted into a standard marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations.

## 7. Recommendations

Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, the benefit-risk balance for Spikevax in its approved indications (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable. As all Specific Obligations have either been fulfilled or reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP, there are no remaining grounds for the marketing authorisations to remain conditional and the CHMP therefore recommends the granting of a standard marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations for Spikevax.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the annual renewal, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

The CHMP is of the opinion that the comprehensive existing data package for this vaccine warrants conversion of the current conditional approval into a full marketing authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations. As a result, it is recommended that the final study reports for the three ongoing clinical trials are reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP and are therefore deleted from the Annex II to this opinion.
