## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Brinsupri 25 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 25 mg of brensocatib (as monohydrate).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

## Film-coated tablet (tablet)

Grey, approximately 9 mm diameter round tablet debossed with '25' on one side and 'BRE' on the other side.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Brinsupri is indicated for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) in patients 12 years of age and older with two or more exacerbations in the prior 12 months.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The recommended dose is 25 mg orally once daily with or without food.

## Missed dose

Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time the next day. Patients should not double the dose to make up for the missed dose.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).

## Renal and hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Brinsupri in children younger than 12 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For oral use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product should be taken once daily with or without food.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Fungal infections

In clinical studies, fungal infections, mainly candida-related, indicative of immunosuppression (i.e., oral candidiasis, oesophageal candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, fungal bronchitis) and isolated cases of Aspergillus infections, were more frequent with brensocatib 25 mg (1.5%) compared to placebo (1.1%).

## Immunocompromised patients

The safety of brensocatib has not been established in immunocompromised patients. Caution is advised when using brensocatib in patients with moderate to severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; 1,000/mm³).

## Vaccinations

The concomitant use of brensocatib and live attenuated vaccines has not been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving brensocatib.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of brensocatib to induce CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). In vivo induction cannot be excluded. Co-administration with CYP3A4 substrates used in bronchiectasis (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids, macrolide antibiotics or inhaled bronchodilators such as salmeterol or vilanterol) may result in decreased plasma concentrations and reduced therapeutic effect. Adjustment of the concomitant treatment may be considered if efficacy is reduced.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of brensocatib in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Brinsupri is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether brensocatib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in animals have suggested excretion of brensocatib in milk (see section 5.3).

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from brensocatib therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies indicate no impact on male or female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Brinsupri has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are headache (9.2%), hyperkeratosis (5.9%), dermatitis (4.2%), rash (4.1%), upper respiratory tract infections (3.9%), and dry skin (3.0%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety of brensocatib was evaluated on the pooled safety population from two placebo-controlled clinical trials, ASPEN and WILLOW, which consisted of 1 326 adult and 41 adolescent patients 12 years of age and older with NCFB who received at least one dose of brensocatib for up to 52 weeks.

The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

| Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders | Common      | Hyperkeratosis* Rash Dry skin Dermatitis Skin exfoliation Alopecia |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hyperkeratosis

In the pooled safety population, hyperkeratosis (including skin lesion, keratosis pilaris, exfoliative rash and seborrheic keratosis) was reported more frequently with brensocatib 25 mg than placebo (5.9% vs 3.1%). All events were of mild or moderate severity.

## Paediatric population

The safety assessment in adolescents aged 12 to 17 with NCFB is based on 41 subjects exposed to brensocatib in the 52-week Phase 3 ASPEN trial (see section 5.1). The safety profile in these adolescents was similar to that observed in adults.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Doses of up to 120 mg, given as a single dose, did not have evidence of dose-related toxicities.

There is no specific treatment for an overdose with brensocatib. If an overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: not yet assigned

## Mechanism of action

Brensocatib is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1). DPP1 activates pro-inflammatory neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) during neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow. Brensocatib reduces the activity of NSPs implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis, including neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

At 5 times the maximum recommended daily dose of brensocatib, there was no effect on QTc prolongation.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of brensocatib was assessed in a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trial (ASPEN) with a total of 1 721 patients 12 years of age and older with NCFB (1 680 adults and 41 adolescents).

All patients were randomised to one of two doses of brensocatib (25 mg: n = 575; 10 mg: n = 583) or placebo (n = 563), administered once daily for 52 weeks.

All adult patients enrolled had a history of confirmed NCFB by chest computed tomography with at least 2 documented pulmonary exacerbations prior screening in the past 12 months. Adolescent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients had at least one pulmonary exacerbation in the prior 12 months. A qualifying exacerbation was defined by the need for a physician-prescribed course of systemic antibiotics for signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.

Demographics and baseline characteristics of ASPEN are provided in Table 2.

N = number of patients in the intent-to-treat analysis set; n = number of patients; PEx = pulmonary exacerbations; pp = percent predicted; FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second; SD = standard deviation

## Exacerbations

The primary efficacy endpoint in ASPEN was the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) over the 52-week treatment period.

Pulmonary exacerbations were defined as worsening of 3 or more major symptoms over 48 hours with increase in cough, sputum volume, sputum purulence or increased breathlessness or decreased exercise tolerance and fatigue and/or malaise and, haemoptysis, resulting in a healthcare provider's decision to prescribe systemic antibiotics. Pulmonary exacerbations were considered as severe if requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics and/or resulted in hospitalisation.

In ASPEN, treatment with 25 mg of brensocatib in patients with NCFB demonstrated significant reductions in the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations compared with placebo. Key results are shown in Table 3.

## Lung function

Change from baseline in post-bronchodilator FEV1 was assessed as a secondary endpoint. A dose of brensocatib 25 mg significantly reduced FEV1 decline in comparison to placebo at week 52 (Least Squares mean difference 38; 95% CI: 11, 65) (Figure 1).

## Paediatric population (adolescents)

In the pivotal 52-week study, 41 adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years) were randomised to brensocatib 25 mg once daily, brensocatib 10 mg once daily or placebo. The adolescent subgroup was small and the study was not powered for efficacy in adolescents; confidence intervals were wide and results are inconclusive. Trends towards fewer pulmonary exacerbations and positive changes in post-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed with 25 mg brensocatib versus placebo. Safety and pharmacokinetic data in adolescents were generally consistent with adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Brinsupri in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in NCFB (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

The absolute oral bioavailability of brensocatib has not been studied in humans. Brensocatib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Tmax for tablets is approximately 1 hour in patients. Brensocatib oral absorption is not affected by food intake. Co-administration with a high fat meal delayed the time to reach peak concentration by 0.75 hours, however, the extent of brensocatib absorption remained the same.

## Distribution

After oral administration, the volume of distribution at steady state was 126-138 L (CV: 22.4-23.3%) in adult patients and 71.3-83.6 L (CV: 19.9-26.3%) in adolescents with NCFB. The protein binding of brensocatib to human plasma was 82.2%-87.2%.

## Biotransformation

Brensocatib undergoes metabolism primarily by CYP3A. Brensocatib accounted for 16.2% of the total radioactivity in plasma. Only one major circulating metabolite, thiocyanate, was detected in plasma. Thiocyanate is an endogenous compound, and clinical data showed that thiocyanate plasma concentrations were not affected and remained in the normal range on brensocatib treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interactions

## In vitro studies

## CYP450 enzymes

## Brensocatib is a substrate of CYP3A.

Brensocatib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. In vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of brensocatib to induce CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. In vivo induction cannot be excluded.

## Transporter systems

Brensocatib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Brensocatib is not a substrate of MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and OCT2.

Brensocatib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K.

## Effect of brensocatib on other medicinal products

In vitro data and population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that brensocatib is unlikely to inhibit or significantly induce the activity of CYP isozymes or drug transporters at clinically relevant dose levels. However, in vitro studies were inconclusive regarding the potential of brensocatib to induce CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, and in vivo induction cannot be excluded.

## Effect of other medicinal products on brensocatib

Brensocatib AUC and Cmax increased by 55% and 68% with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (e.g. clarithromycin) and by 32% and 53% with a strong P-gp inhibitor (e.g. verapamil) but decreased by 33% and 15% with a strong CYP3A inducer (e.g. rifampicin). Cmax and AUC remained unchanged with a potent proton-pump inhibitor (e.g. esomeprazole). The interaction effect on brensocatib systemic exposure is not clinically meaningful.

## Elimination

Following a single oral dose of radiolabelled brensocatib, 54.2% of dose was excreted in urine and 28.3% in faeces with most radioactivity excreted within 72 hours. The unchanged brensocatib in urine and faeces were 22.8% and 2.41% of dose, respectively.

Terminal half-life was 32.6-39.6 hours (CV: 26.6-33.0%) in adult patients and 26.9-27.8 hours (CV: 26.8-37.3%) in adolescent patients.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Brensocatib exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with low to moderate intra- and inter-subject variability over a dose range of 5-120 mg following single administration and a dose range of 10-40 mg following once-daily administration. Population pharmacokinetics analysis using pooled data from 11 clinical studies in healthy subjects (n = 291) and patients with NCFB (n = 783) showed that brensocatib pharmacokinetics can be adequately described by a 2-disposition compartments with first-order oral absorption.

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships

Exposure-response relationships were observed between brensocatib exposure (AUC) and clinical efficacy (i.e. decline of lung function measured as FEV1). At 25 mg, &gt; 99% NCFB patients in the ASPEN trial achieved an AUC threshold that was associated with clinically meaningful improvement in FEV1. No exposure-response relationships were detected for the occurrence of periodontal disease or pneumonia. A relationship between brensocatib exposure (AUC) and hyperkeratosis (mild and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

moderate) was observed. However, the predicted probability of mild or moderate hyperkeratosis was low at brensocatib 25 mg (3.01% in adults and 3.36% in adolescents).

## Special populations

Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no evidence of a clinically significant effect of age (range: 12 to 85 years), sex, race/ethnicity or body weight (range: 32 to 155 kg) on the pharmacokinetics of brensocatib.

## Paediatric population

Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was no clinically meaningful age-related difference in the pharmacokinetics of brensocatib between adults and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Brensocatib has not been studied in children under 12 years of age (see section 4.2).

## Hepatic impairment

In subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores 5 to 12), brensocatib clearance following a single dose was comparable to that in healthy subjects. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

In subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, (creatinine clearance ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and not requiring dialysis), brensocatib clearance following a single dose was comparable to that in healthy subjects. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

## General toxicity

In a 6-month rat study microscopic changes in the kidney (basophilic tubules in the outer medulla) and the lung (perivascular neutrophil infiltration and vacuolated macrophage accumulation consistent with phospholipids) were observed at 50 mg/kg/day. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level was considered to be 9 mg/kg/day (AUC 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]).

In a 9-month dog study no adverse findings were observed at any dose (AUC 5 times the MRHD). In a preceding 6-month dog study, administration of brensocatib at 50 mg/kg/day caused periodontal disease resulting in early termination of the group. At ≥ 8 mg/kg/day, dose-dependent microscopic findings were noted in the testis (seminiferous tubule degeneration and atrophy), in the epididymis (decreased number of spermatozoa and cellular debris), and in the lung (accumulations of vacuolated macrophages consistent with phospholipids). At 50 mg/kg/day, additional microscopic findings were noted in the kidney (tubular regeneration) and in the lymphoid tissues (axillary, mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, gut associated lymphoid tissue and spleen) as indicated by the accumulations of vacuolated macrophages.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

In a rat fertility and embryo-foetal development study, following treatment with brensocatib from 2 weeks prior to mating, during mating and up to the end of major embryonic organogenesis, recoverable minor malformations of bent scapula and wavy ribs were noted at plasma exposure (AUC) 128-times the human exposure at the MRHD. There was an increased incidence of skeletal variations (malpositioned pelvic girdle and vestigial supernumerary full and/or short ribs in both cervical and thoracolumbar regions) and differen ces in ossification at AUC ≥ 42-times the human exposure at the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MRHD. The no effect dose for developmental toxicity was at AUC of 3-times the human exposure at the MRHD. In a rabbit embryo-foetal development study, treatment with brensocatib during implantation and major organogenesis induced maternal toxicity (reductions in body weight gain and food consumption) at AUC ≥ 5-times the human exposure at the MRHD. There were no adverse developmental effects at AUC 20-times the human exposure at the MRHD.

In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats treated from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20, no adverse findings were observed at any dose (up to AUC 17-times the human exposure at the MRHD). Brensocatib was detected in pups, suggesting that male and female pups were likely exposed via maternal milk during lactation.

## 1. What Brinsupri is and what it is used for

## What Brinsupri is

Brinsupri contains the active substance brensocatib, which belongs to the class of medicines called dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitors.

## What Brinsupri is used for

Brinsupri is used to treat patients 12 years and older with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) who have experienced two or more flare-ups or worsening of symptoms (also known as exacerbations) in the past 12 months. NCFB is a long-term (chronic) condition where the airways of the lungs are damaged, causing a cough with mucus production.

## How Brinsupri works

Brinsupri targets a protein called DPP1, which is involved in the process that causes inflammation in the lungs. By blocking the activity of this protein, the medicine prevents flare-ups in the lungs and may improve some symptoms of NCFB.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Brinsupri

Do not take Brinsupri if you are allergic to brensocatib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Brinsupri if you have recently had or plan to have a vaccination.
