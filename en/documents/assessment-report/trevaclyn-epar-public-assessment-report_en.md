## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidemia should be treated as other known factors to reduce the risk  for  cardiovascular  disease.  Treatment  is  based  on  diet  and  lifestyle  adjustment  to  reduce  low density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C),  raise  high  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (HDL-C)  and  if needed, reduce triglycerides (TG) and other lipids. If adjunctive medication is needed, statins are the medications  of  the  first  choice.  Reduction  in  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  has  been demonstrated in the past with nicotinic acid (also known as niacin) at a time when statins were not available  yet.  Adverse  events  (AEs)  are  its  main  limitation,  in  particular  flushing,  gastrointestinal symptoms and elevation of liver enzymes. For these reasons, its use in patients with dyslipidemia is mainly second or third line therapy in those patients who do not respond to statins or fibrates.

Based  on  the  established  nicotinic  acid  efficacy  and  risk-benefit  profile  the  key  objective  of  the prolonged release nicotinic acid and laropiprant programme was to demonstrate improved tolerability of  nicotinic  acid  when  laropiprant  is  added.  A  fixed  dose  combination  tablet  of  prolonged  release nicotinic  acid  with  laropiprant,  a  selective  antagonist  of  the  PGD2  receptor  subtype  1 (DP1),  is intended to reduce these PGD2 mediated flushes and improve the tolerability profile, while the lipid lowering properties are maintained.

The  use  of  nicotinic  acid  however  has  been  limited  by  its  tolerability.  The  most  common  adverse effect  occurring  during  the  treatment  with  nicotinic  acid  is  flushing.  Although  the  mechanism  by which nicotinic acid induces flushing is not completely understood, observations suggest that blockade of the prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) receptor, specifically the subtype 1 (DP1), may suppress the flushing symptoms associated with nicotinic acid in the human. Importantly, although these flushing effects are mediated by the nicotinic acid receptor, they appear to be independent of the beneficial lipid-altering effects of nicotinic acid. Treatment  with  nicotinic  acid  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  risk  of  overall  and  cardiovascular morbidity  and  mortality,  as  well  as  to  slow  progression  or  promote  regression  of  atherosclerotic lesions. The Coronary Drug Project, completed in 1975, assessed the safety and efficacy of nicotinic acid  and  other  lipid-altering  drugs  in  men  30  to  64  years  old  with  a  history  of  MI  (Coronary  Drug Project Research Group, 1975). Nicotinic acid showed a statistically significant benefit in decreasing nonfatal,  recurrent  MIs.  The  incidence  of  definite,  non  fatal  MI  was  8.9%  for  the  1,119  patients randomized  to  nicotinic  acid  versus  12.2%  for  the  2,789  patients  who  received  placebo  (p&lt;0.004). Though total mortality was similar in the two groups at five years (24.4% with nicotinic acid versus 25.4% with placebo; p=N.S.), in a fifteen-year cumulative follow-up there were 11% (69) fewer deaths in the nicotinic acid group compared to the placebo cohort (52.0% versus 58.2%; p=0.0004) (Canner et al., 1986).

Trevaclyn is indicated for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, particularly in patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia (characterised by elevated levels of LDL-C and TGs and low HDL-cholesterol) and in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial).

Trevaclyn  should  be  used  in  patients  in  combination  with  hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-Co-enzyme-A (HMG-CoA)  reductase  inhibitors  (statins),  when  the  cholesterol  lowering  effect  of  HMG-CoA reductase  inhibitor  monotherapy  is  inadequate.  It  can  be  used  as  monotherapy  only  in  patients  in whom HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are considered inappropriate or not tolerated. Diet and other non-pharmacological treatments (e.g. exercise, weight reduction) should be continued during therapy with Trevaclyn.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Trevaclyn  is  presented  as  modified-release  tablets  containing  two  active  substances.  Each  tablet contains 1000 mg of nicotinic acid and 20 mg of laropiprant. Tablets are bilayer and the lower layer is a  prolonged  release  layer  containing  nicotinic  acid,  the  upper  layer  is  an  immediate  release  layer containing laropiprant. The excipients used in the formulation of Trevaclyn are well known excipients typically used in the tablet formulations such as hypromellose (E464), colloidal anhydrous silica (E551), sodium stearyl fumarate, hydroxypropylcellulose (E463), microcrystalline cellulose (E460), croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate.

Trevaclyn modified-release tablets are capsule-shaped, white to off-white with '552' debossed on one side. The tablets are supplied in Aclar/PVC or Alu/Alu blisters.

Nicotinic acid is white, not hygroscopic solid powder, sparingly soluble in water, soluble in boiling water and in boiling alcohol. Only crystalline form of nicotinic acid exists and no other polymorphic forms are known.

## · Manufacture

The manufacturing process of nicotinic acid is a one step-step chemical synthesis process. A detailed description of the manufacturing process including process flow diagram and in process controls was provided  in  the  restricted  part  of  the  Active  Substance  Master  File  (ASMF).  The  proposed manufacturing process has been adequately described, and critical steps with accompanying in-process controls have been identified. Appropriate specifications for the starting materials and reagents have been established.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition to the ASMF procedure a Certificate of Suitability with requirements of PhEur (CEP) for the active substance has also been provided.

The  chemical  structure  of  nicotinic  acid  has  been  confirmed  by  FT-IR,  UV, 1 H  and 13 C  NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS) and elemental analysis. The assessment of possible polymorphism has been performed using X-ray powder diffraction studies. It has been demonstrated that only crystalline form of nicotinic acid exists.

- Specification

The active substance specification is in line  with  PhEur  monograph for nicotinic acid and with the USP  monograph  for  nicotinic  acid,  and  includes  tests  for  identification  (IR  and  UV),  appearance,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

colour, transparency of the solution, melting point, heavy metals, chlorides, sulphated ash, residue on ignition,  water  content,  assay  (titration),  insoluble  particles,  magnetic  particles,  carbon  content, impurities and related substances (HPLC and TLC), particle size distribution.

Analytical methods for control of the active substance are equivalent to the respective PhEur methods or are based on the PhEur methods with minor modifications. All analytical methods were described sufficiently. Validation data on HPLC method for impurity and the titration method for assay, as well as cross validation data of the titration method with the titration method described in the PhEur, and with  the  UV  assay  method  described  in  the  USP  have  been  provided.  It  has  been  proven  that  the proposed analytical methods are suitable to control the quality of nicotinic acid.

Batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches have been provided. All batches complied with the requirements from the active substance specification.

## · Stability

<!-- image -->

Stability studies have been performed on 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance. Data was provided  on  batches  stored  up  to  36 months  at  25°C/60 % RH  (long  term  stability  studies)  and 6 months  at  40°C/75 % RH  (accelerated  conditions).  Additionally  the  stability  data  on  the  active substance stored up to 36 months at -20°C was provided. The stability data confirmed the re-test period proposed for nicotinic acid. Laropiprant Laropiprant is a selective PGD2 receptor (DP1) antagonist that reduces the incidence and severity of nicotinic acid-induced flushing. It is chemically designated as (3 R )-4-(4-chlorobenzyl)-7-fluoro-5(methylsulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[ b ] indol-3-yl]acetic acid (CAS) and has the following structure: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Laropiprant  is  a  white  powder  very  soluble  in  acetone  and  acetonitrile,  soluble  in  ethanol  and methanol, and insoluble in water. The pH of saturated water solution is 6.1. Its pKa is 7.0 ± 0.2 (due to the carboxylic acid functional group). It has one chiral center, which has the R absolute configuration. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed a single melting endotherm with a peak temperature of 178.6°C. In temperatures close to 180 ° C decomposition (evaporation) was observed. Extensive polymorph screening was performed and no other polymorphic forms were observed.

## · Manufacture

Laropiprant is manufactured via a three-stage manufacturing process which comprises coupling of the starting materials followed by hydrogenation of the resulting intermediate to form the 'crude salt of laropiprant'. The final step involves the breaking of the salt and isolation (purification) of laropiprant active substance.

The  proposed  manufacturing process has been adequately described, and critical steps with accompanying  in-process  controls  have  been  identified.  Appropriate  specifications  for  the  starting materials and reagents have been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  early  development two types of manufacturing processes were used 'first generation' enzymatic process, and 'second generation' synthetic process. The second generation process is comparable with the current one which is an optimized 'second generation' process with the same synthetic route.

Confirmation of the chemical structure of the active substance has been provided by ATR-FTIR, UV, 1 H  and 13 C  NMR  spectroscopy,  mass  spectrometry  (MS)  and  elemental  analysis.  The  solid  state structure of laropiprant was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.

## · Specification

The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (IR),  assay  (HPLC), impurities  (HPLC),  chiral  purity  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water  content,  Ruthenium,  heavy metals, sulphated ash and particle size.

Analytical  methods  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  validated  with  regards  to  accuracy, intermediate precision and reproducibility, specificity, linearity, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) where relevant. Particle size method has been validated regarding reproducibility and robustness. The HPLC methods for assay and impurities (including chiral purity) are sufficiently stability indicating. The GC method for residual solvents was validated with regards to linearity, precision, specificity, accuracy, limits of quantification and detection, system suitability, and robustness. Batch  analysis  data  on  batches  of  the  active  substance  produced  during  the  development  of manufacturing process, clinical and safety trials and stability programs were presented. The data includes results on five batches from the 'first generation process' used for the early clinical and safety batches, eight batches from the 'second generation process' used for other clinical trials and twelve batches from the 'optimized process' for recent clinical and safety tests. All batches complied with the requirements in the active substance specification. · Stability The stability studies have been performed on three batches of laropiprant after storage up to 24 months at  25°C/60 % RH (normal conditions) and at 40°C/75% RH  (accelerated conditions). Additionally, data from forced degradation studies (exposure to elevated temperature, photolytic, acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions) has been provided to characterise potential degradation products and demonstrate the stability indicating nature of the HPLC analytical procedures. As a supportive data results from stability studies on three pilot development batches manufactured according to 'first generation' process and stored up to 24 or 36 months have been provided. The stability data confirmed the re-test period proposed for laropiprant. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  medicinal  product  has  been  developed  as  a  bilayer  tablets  containing  two  separate  layers (extended release with nicotinic acid and immediate release with laropiprant). Prolonged release layer with nicotinic acid is prepared by roller compaction and immediate release layer with laropiprant is prepared by high shear wet granulation.

During the development a Quality by Design approach was applied which allowed to

- o define the design space after identification of process parameter ranges that lead to a product of acceptable quality.
- o determine the initial control space, i.e. process parameter points or ranges to be used for routine manufacture

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o identify  critical  processing  parameters,  quality  attributes  and  raw  material  property  ranges required to ensure final tablet quality.

Layers with different content of laropiprant and excipients have been examined during the formulation development program. Optimisation studies of the lubrication system (magnesium stearate and sodium stearyl  fumarate)  resulted  in  optimal  balance  between  bilayer  adhesion  and  sticking  propensity. Additional  dissolution  studies  of  single-layer  tablets  containing  laropiprant  granulation  mixture showed the desired rapid release of laropiprant. After evaluation of different polymers, hypromellose was  selected  as  the  extended  release  polymer,  which  led  to  the  target  in-vitro  dissolution  rates  of nicotinic acid. In addition to in-vitro dissolution, granule flow properties, particle size and hardness were examined in dependence to composition.

Formulation development was focused on optimization of extended release polymer levels to achieve consistent release of nicotinic acid at the target release rate, flow and compression properties of the granulations,  and  physical  and  chemical  stability  of  the  bilayer  tablet.  The  key  critical  product attributes were  derived  from  statistical analyses (Failure Modes  Effects  analysis).  Design  of experiments  applied  to  the  manufacturing  process  identified  the  critical  process  parameters  and defined the limits necessary to avoid delamination of the bilayer tablets.

- Adventitious Agents

Among  excipients  used  in  the  medicinal  product  only  lactose  monohydrate  is  of  animal  origin. Declarations  from  the  lactose  suppliers  were  provided,  stating  that  the  lactose  was  sourced  from healthy animals under the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption.

Magnesium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate used in the formulation are of vegetable origin.

- Manufacture of the Product

The  medicinal  product  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  steps  (1)  laropiprant  high  shear granulation, (2) lubrication of laropiprant high shear granulation, (3) nicotinic acid roller compaction granulation, (4) lubrication of nicotinic acid granulation, (5) compression of bilayer tablets.

The  critical  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  identified  and  adequately  studied. Appropriate in-process controls of the critical steps have been established.

In  addition  to  the  extensive  studies  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  in-process  controls  during process development, the applicant has provided validation data on three commercial scale batches of the medicinal product.

- Product Specification

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  product  specification  contains  tests  with  suitable  limits  for  appearance,  identity  of  active substances  (IR  and  HPLC),  assay  of  laropiprant  and  nicotinic  acid  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC), content uniformity (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC) and microbial bioburden.

The  analytical  methods  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  validated  for  the  intended  use.  The discriminative power of the dissolution method was assessed for both laropiprant and nicotinic acid. The  method  has  been  adequately  described  and  validated  regarding  specificity,  working  range, linearity, precision, accuracy, sample preparation and stability of solutions. The method is robust to changes of dissolution conditions as well as HPLC parameters. The analytical methods and acceptance criteria have been established to confirm the identity, purity and quality of the medicinal product and to ensure its suitability for their intended use.

Batch analyses results on pilot scale batches and production scale batches of the medicinal product indicate satisfactory uniformity and compliance with the agreed specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability of the Product

The  stability  data  was  provided  on  three  pilot  scale  batches,  packed  in  the  proposed  packaging materials stored up to one year at long-term conditions (25°C/60 % RH) or at intermediate conditions (30°C/65 % RH)  and  up  to  six  months  at  accelerated  40°C/75 % RH.  No  significant  changes  have been observed during the stability studies. In addition a supportive stability data on so-called 'bridging batch'  (production  batch)  stored  up  to  thirteen  weeks  was  provided.  Results  from  a  photo  stability study performed according to ICH conditions have also been provided.

Based on the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions, as defined in the SPC, are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The active substances and medicinal product have been adequately described. Excipients used in the formulation  of  the  medicinal  product  and  the  manufacturing  process  selected  are  typical  for  tablet formulations. The results of the tests indicate that the active substances and the finished product can be reproducibly  manufactured  and  therefore  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform performance.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues, which have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve it as a Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  main  disadvantage  of  nicotinic  acid  as  a  lipid-modifying  drug  is  the  induction  of  cutaneous flushing. Evidence suggests that this side effect is mediated by the release of PGD2 from cells in the skin, which   binds to DP1 receptors on vascular smooth muscles in the skin vasculature, resulting in vasodilatation.  Provided  non-clinical  pharmacology  documentation  on  nicotinic  acid  consists  of literature publications only.

Laropiprant is a high affinity antagonist of DP1 receptors and exerts antagonistic action with weaker affinity at the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor (TP). Laropiprant antagonises the vasodilatory effect of nicotinic acid via inhibitory action on DP1.

The non-clinical pharmacology documentation provided for laropripant consists of a standard set of original  studies  for  new  active  compound  in  form  of  the in  vitro receptor  binding  and  inhibition studies.

All pivotal studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practise (GLP).

Non-pivotal, ancillary pharmacology/toxicology studies were stated as not fully GLP compliant and only summaries of the studies were provided, e.g. the individual datasets on the individual animals investigated were omitted. Nevertheless, a quality assurance statement is included confirming that a data  audit  in  accordance  with  Merck-intern  'Worldwide  Non-clinical  Quality  Assurance  Resources Standard Operating Procedures' was conducted.

Safety Studies were performed in accordance with current FDA GLP Regulations (21 CFR Part 58).

## Pharmacology

Nicotinic acid has been used in the treatment of dyslipidaemia for over fifty years, during which the utility  of  several  different  animal  models  has  attempted  to  explore  the  mechanism  of  action  of  this drug. As described in the literature, it is believed that the lipid lowering effect is achieved by multiple mechanisms, one of them being the ability of nicotinic acid to inhibit mobilisation of free fatty acids from adipose tissue and transiently reduce their serum concentration. Nicotinic acid lowers both serum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TG  and  apolipoprotein  B  (Apo  B),  the  major  protein  component  of  very  low  density  lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL. Given that LDL is formed as a result of VLDL catabolism, reduced hepatic VLDL output  may  contribute  to  the  reduced  serum  total  cholesterol  (TC)  and  LDL-Cholesterol  (LDL-C) observed with nicotinic acid therapy.

In the species where HDL metabolism has been examined, nicotinic acid generally lacks the effects seen in humans, with the possible exception of the mouse model, in which the human cholesterol ester transfer  protein  (CETP)  transgene  is  expressed.  Studies  in  both  rabbits  and  mini-pigs  indicate  the possibility that nicotinic acid has benefits in atherosclerosis over and above the effects on serum lipids.

In vitro cell culture studies with various human and mouse monocytoid cell lines suggest that nicotinic acid induces production of PGD2 and its metabolite, 15-dPGJ2, in macrophages, the latter acting as an activator of PPAR γ activity. This activation may potentially impact lipid metabolism and cholesterol efflux in these cells in a fashion that would be beneficial when treating atherosclerosis.

The mechanism by which nicotinic acid raises HDL-C is unclear, but is thought to be due to reduced HDL catabolism, since the kinetic turnover studies showed that nicotinic acid significantly reduces the fractional catabolic rate of both apoA-I  and 125 I-labeled HDL. A high affinity receptor for nicotinic acid has been described recently. The PR109a (also known as PUMA-G, HM74a or HM74b) is a G α i -coupled, seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in adipose, spleen  and  lung  tissues  as  well  as  in  cultured  macrophages  stimulated  with  pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN γ . Studies in mice genetically engineered to lack GPR109a have shown that this receptor mediates both the serum FFA and TG-lowering effects of nicotinic acid in this species. The  presented  non  clinical  studies  show  that  laropiprant  binds  with  high  affinity  to  human  DP1 receptor (Ki of 0.57 ± 0.17 nM) and addition of 0.5% human serum albumin decreased the affinity at the  human  DP1  about  2-fold  (Ki  of  1.07  ±  0.33  nM).  The  dissociation  of  laropiprant  from  the  DP 1 receptor  was  confirmed  to  be  much  slower  than  its  association.  No  agonistic  activity  on  the  DP1 receptor was observed. The antagonistic potency at native platelet DP1 receptors in washed platelets and platelet rich plasma (PRP) of human, cynomolgus monkey and sheep origin was found to be similar in the three species tested. Laropiprant was less potent by a factor of about 40 in the PRP preparations, which is most likely due to its protein binding. Examination of the DP-mediated effect of laropiprant in vivo was demonstrated using several animal models of asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis, since studies in animals and humans established an association of PGD2 and DP1 in allergic airway diseases. Laropiprant was shown to be effective in animal  models  of  allergic  vasodilation  in  the  upper  airways:    PGD2  and Ascaris -antigen  increased nasal  airway  resistance  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  and  sheep.  In  three  animal  models  of  allergic bronchoconstriction  laropiprant  inhibited  antigen-induced  bronchoconstriction  in  guinea  pigs  and sheep  incompletely,  but  did  not  show  inhibition  of  antigen-bronchoconstriction  in  cynomolgus monkeys.  Other  possible  effects  of  laropiprant  on  different  DP1  receptor  mediated  physiological responses have been investigated in additional studies with a more selective DP1 antagonist related to laropiprant in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. The data did not reveal strong evidence for potential undesirable effects due to antagonistic effects on other DP1 mediated physiological processes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Although the key pharmacological effect of nicotinic acid is played by the released PGD2 binding to the DP1 receptors on the vascular smooth muscles in the skin vasculature, the literature data indicate that the formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) ) and its interaction with its EP2 and EP4 receptors may contribute as well.

The affinity of laropiprant to receptors other than DP1 was examined in series of tests. Laropiprant binds to the human prostanoid G-protein coupled receptors in the following affinity order: DP1 &gt; TP &gt; EP2 &gt; CRTH2 &gt;, EP3-III, EP1 &gt; IP (prostanoid I receptor) &gt; FP (prostanoid F receptor), EP4. Based on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  value  of  the  dissociation  constants,  affinity  of  laropripant  for  the  DP 1 receptor  significantly exceeds  that  of  the  TP  receptor:  Kd  =  0.03  nM  and  10.9  nM  for  DP1  for  TP,  respectively.  The determined affinity to the EP2 was markedly low, as well as the affinities to other prostanoid receptors. The selectivity of laropiprant for the DP1-receptor is favourable with respect to its intended use.

The effects of laropiprant on platelet  aggregation,  examined  as  the  ability  of  laropiprant  to  interact with the U46619 (a TXA2 mimetic)-induced platelet aggregation in PRP from human and cynomolgus monkey, showed inhibition of U46619-induced platelet aggregation in  a  dose-dependent  manner  in human PRP with a mean inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) ) of 0.77 ± 0.49 μ M. In cynomolgus monkey PRP laropiprant inhibited U46619-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner with a mean IC50 of 1.5 ± 2.1 μ M. Association to and dissociation from TP receptor are fast (T1/2[on] and T1/2[off] of about 4 min).

Laropiprant  has  been  investigated  in  a  battery  of  157  receptor-binding  and  enzyme  assays  and affinities  to  all  of  these  targets  were  markedly  lower  than  those  described  above  and  did  not  raise safety concerns.

Three oxidative metabolites of laropiprant show affinities and potencies at human and dog DP1 and TP, which are markedly lower than those for the parent compound, but these may contribute to the effects observed after laropiprant administration.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

According  to  the  limited  literature  data  on  the  safety  pharmacology  of  nicotinic  acid,  adverse  side effects were observed in rats at doses of 0.5-2.0 mg/kg. There is an extensive experience with the use of nicotinic acid and thus, no further data are requested.

Safety  studies  with  laropiprant  investigating  respiratory  safety  in  rats,  cardiovascular  safety  in conscious dogs and neurobehavioural safety in rats showed that maximum exposures of 71-90 times higher than the human exposure with the intended dose of 40 mg did not raise safety concerns.

In vitro measurements of recombinantly expressed hERG channels using standard whole-cell voltageclamp techniques showed a reduction of 3-14% at 100 µM laropiprant concentration. Since the Cmax in humans was determined as 3 µM and since laropiprant is bound to a very high degree (&gt; 99 %) to the plasma proteins, the results do not raise significant safety concerns.

Additional  studies  investigating  cardiovascular  and  autonomic  effects  of  laropiprant  in  barbiturateanesthetized  dogs,  renal  function  in  conscious  dogs,  respiratory  function,  homeostasis,  and  platelet function in barbiturate-anesthetized dogs, gastrointestinal functions in dogs and mice, and neurobehavioural effects in mice do not indicate potential safety concerns.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Medicinal product no longer authorised

No formal preclinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with nicotinic acid or laropiprant or with the combination of nicotinic acid and laropiprant. The rationale for this approach is  acceptable,  since  the  molecular  targets  of  nicotinic  acid  are  likely  to  be  distinct  from  those  of laropiprant.  In  addition,  the  animal  models  for  nicotinic  acid  pharmacology,  beyond  its  ability  to suppress  plasma-free  fatty  acids  and  induce  flushing,  are  not  fully  validated.  Furthermore,  clinical studies  examining  the  key  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  nicotinic  acid,  its  ability  to  reduce  TG  and LDL-C and to elevate HDL-C, demonstrate that co-administration of laropiprant has no effect on the lipid modifying properties.

Potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions  with  other  medicines  likely  to  be  used  concurrently  with nicotinic  acid/laropiprant,  e.g.  aspirin,  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  HMGCoA inhibitors, are considered unlikely.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

Most pharmacokinetic studies were performed with laropiprant. The absence of the pharmacokinetic data  for  nicotinic  acid  alone  and  in  combination  with  laropiprant  was  justified,  since  this  has  been evaluated extensively in humans, therefore no further non clinical studies were necessary.

Studies  examining  the  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  (ADME)  of  laropiprant were conducted in rat and dog, the two species selected also for the toxicological evaluation of the compound.  For  the  purpose  of  interspecies  comparisons  between  non-clinical  animal  models  and humans, plasma protein binding,  blood-to-plasma  concentration  ratio,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of laropiprant in humans were also discussed.

Based on in vitro studies on the metabolism of laropiprant and nicotinic acid, no interactions between the drugs are anticipated.

- Absorption

The in vitro reversible plasma protein binding in rats, dogs, mouse, rabbit, monkeys and humans was ~99%, and the in vitro blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was between 0.54 and 0.60 in the above named species.

Following oral administration to male rats and dogs at 5, 25 and 100 mg/kg, absorption was rapid with peak plasma concentrations achieved between 0.8 to 2 hr. Plasma AUC(0-∞ ) values increased in a dose proportional manner in rats, while in dogs, the plasma AUC(0-∞ ) values were disproportionately high at the  higher  dose  levels  compared  to  the  low  dose.  The  oral  bioavailability  (F  %)  of  laropiprant  at 5 mg/kg was ~50 % in rats, ~70 % in dogs and ~8 % in monkeys. Following oral dosing to male cynomolgus monkeys at 2.9 mg/kg, the dose-normalized AUC(0-∞ ) value was lower than that observed in rats and dogs, and the oral bioavailability was 8%. · Distribution Following intravenous (i.v.) administration at 1 and 5 mg/kg in male rats and dogs, and 2.9 mg/kg in male monkeys, laropiprant was cleared from the systemic circulation at a low to moderate rate (CLp ~2, 5 and 8 mL/min/kg, respectively).  The volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) ranged from 0.7 L/kg in rats to 5 L/kg in dogs, and the terminal half-life (t1/2) was longer in rats and dogs (8 and 14 hr) than in monkeys (3 hr). In  a  tissue  distribution  study  conducted  following  the  oral  administration  of  a  single  dose  of laropiprant (5 mg/kg) to rats, the drug was mainly distributed in the stomach, small and large intestine and the bile. The Cmax was reached at approximately 2 hrs and declined steadily throughout 24 hrs post administration. Laropiprant concentrations were not measurable in any central nervous system tissue, pineal gland, bone, or incisor pulp throughout the study period. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vitro was evaluated in the LLC-PK1 cell line. The diffusion rate was relatively high for laropiprant (27 to 30 x 10 -6 cm/sec). At substrate concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 μ M, laropiprant was not a substrate of human MDR1, but was a substrate for mouse Mdr1a.  In addition,  laropiprant  was  found  to  have  no  significant  effect  on  the  transport  of  digoxin,  quinidine, verapamil, and vinblastine across LLCMDR1 cell monolayers.

## · Metabolism

The  metabolism  of  nicotinic  acid  has  been  described  in  humans,  thus  non  clinical  testing  was  not deemed necessary. However, two metabolism-interaction studies with nicotinic acid were conducted (see section Pharmacokinetic drug interactions).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The in  vitro cytrochrome  P  450  (CYP)  and  UDP-glucuronyl-transferase  (UGT)  metabolism  of laropiprant  was  studied  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog,  monkey  and  human  liver  microsomes,  human intestinal  microsomes  and  hepatocyte  suspensions.  The  major  metabolites  identified  in  these  media were hydroxy-, oxo-derivatives and the acyl glucuronide. Incubations of laropiprant with recombinant human  CYPs  suggested  major  involvement  of  CYP3A4,  with  a  minor  contribution  from  CYP2C9 isoforms. A comparison of Km values obtained from recombinant human UGT isoforms indicated that UGT1A9 and UGT1A3 were the major isoforms responsible for the glucuronidation of laropiprant.

The in vivo studies were conducted in rats, dogs and humans. The major compound in the plasma of the animals was laropiprant, which was primarily eliminated by acyl glucuronidation.

In summary, laropiprant is metabolised primarily via acyl glucuronidation, with a smaller component of oxidative metabolism.

## · Excretion

Data on the excretion of laropiprant from one study in rats shows that the main excretion route is the faeces (97% of the dose) and studies in bile duct cannulated dogs and rats confirmed that laropiprant is excreted into faeces via bile. Approximately 2.3% of the dose is excreted in urine.

Clinical studies in humans indicate that the main route of excretion is via faeces (mean of 68% of total dose), with urinary excretion (mean of 22% of total dose) as a minor excretion route.

Placental transfer of orally administered laropiprant was investigated in pregnant rats at doses 100 or 400 mg/kg and rabbits at doses 25 or 125 mg/kg. The results demonstrated that laropiprant readily crosses placenta in both species. Nicotinic acid is actively transferred across the placenta.

The excretion of laropiprant into the milk of lactating rats was examined by measuring concentrations of parent  drug  in  maternal  plasma  and  milk  on  lactation  day  14  following  daily  oral  administration  of laropiprant  at  100  or  400  mg/kg  from  gestation  day  (GD)  6  to  lactation  day  14.  Results  of  this investigation demonstrated excretion of circulating drug into the milk of lactating rats.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

Nicotinic acid and its metabolites (nicotinuric acid, methyl nicotinamide and 1-methyl-2-pyridone-5carboxamide) did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4-mediated reactions in in vitro studies.  The  UGT1A1-mediated  3-glucuronidation  of  estradiol  was  not  inhibited  by  nicotinic acid and its metabolites either. Based on these data, nicotinic acid would not be expected to cause drug interactions with drugs metabolised by these enzymes.

The in vitro assessment of laropiprant's ability to interact with CYP450 enzymes showed that the drug is  a  moderate  CYP2C8  and  a  weak  CYP2B6,  CYP2C9  inhibitor. In  vitro laropiprant  did  not demonstrate  a  time-dependent  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  activity,  but  was  shown  to  be  its  moderate inducer.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a clinical drug-drug interaction study, laropiprant showed an interaction with midazolam. Plasma concentration of  1 ′ -hydroxymidazolam was elevated in subjects receiving laropiprant, while midazolam  plasma  levels  were  not  affected.  Subsequently,  laropiprant  was  evaluated in  vitro as  a possible  inhibitor  of  the  glucuronidation  of  1 ′ -hydroxymidazolam  by  human  liver  microsomes  and recombinant  UDP-glucuronyltransferase  (UGT)  isoforms.  Laropiprant  was  found  to  be  a  moderate inhibitor of UGT2B4 and 2B7, and a weak inhibitor of UGT1A4.

Furthermore,  the  inhibitory  effects  of  clarithromycin,  erythromycin,  ketoconazole,  and  diltiazem (CYP3A4 inhibitors) on the formation of the acyl glucuronide of laropiprant were evaluated in human liver microsomes. The formation of the acyl glucuronide was inhibited in the presence of ketoconazole with an IC50 value of 44.5 μ M. No inhibition of the formation of the acyl glucuronide was observed in the presence of clarithromycin, erythromycin or diltiazem at the evaluated concentrations. Based on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these in vitro data,  co-administration  of  clarithromycin,  erythromycin  or  diltiazem  would  not  be expected to have a clinically meaningful effect on laropiprant plasma exposures in vivo .

## Toxicology

The toxicity profile of laropiprant was defined in oral single dose studies in mice and rats, and in oral and i.v. repeat dose studies of up to 53 weeks duration with laropiprant alone in mice, rats and dogs; laropiprant in combination with nicotinic acid in rats and dogs; and laropiprant in combination with nicotinic acid and simvastatin in rats and dogs.

The  potential genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity,  embryo-  and  developmental toxicity, local tolerance and other toxicity aspects were evaluated in the respective studies in several species.

## · Single dose toxicity

The oral LD50 of nicotinic acid has been reported to be between 5000 to 7000 mg/kg in mice and rats. Animals died between 12 to 36 hours after dosing.

Laropiprant treatment  caused  death  in  mice  at  a  dose  of  750  mg/kg/day.  Effects  on  the  kidneys occurred in male mice from 250 mg/kg/day and in females from 500 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related effects on the liver were seen at all doses. A variety of treatment-related changes in haematological and serum biochemical parameters were also observed at all doses, including decrease in haemoglobin and haematocrit, and increase in total protein and cholesterol. In rats renal toxicity of laropiprant was apparent after 14 weeks at doses higher than 125 mg/kg/day in females and higher than 250 mg/kg/day in  males. Increased liver weights and changes of urinalysis (e.g. staining, increased volume), serum biochemical parameters (e.g. increase of alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, creatinine and decrease of glucose  and  chloride)  and  haematological  parameters  were  apparent  at  doses  higher  than  250 mg/kg/day. In the 27 weeks study the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was determined as 60 mg/kg/day. In dogs, orally administered doses above 5 mg/kg/day caused treatment related increase of ALT activity, whereas the i.v. administration of doses up to 6 mg/kg/day did not result in treatment related  findings.  Transient  post  administration  salivation  was  observed  in  rats  and  dogs,  but  was considered to be caused by the administration procedure and thus, without toxicological significance.

In  single  dose  toxicity  studies  the  approximate  lethal  dose  of  laropiprant  was  estimated  as  1224 mg/kg/day in mice and 1591 mg/kg/day in rats. The exposure multiples for the lethal doses can be estimated as more than 400 for mice and 1000 for rats, when compared with the AUC(0-∞ ) in humans after administration of the combination of 40 mg laropiprant and 2000 mg nicotinic acid. In  mice,  after  each  dose  increment  the  treatment-related  effects  were  seen,  including  decreased activity, ptosis, bradypnea,  lacrimation, sternal  recumbancy  and  ataxia  at  1  or 2 days  after administration. In  rats,  a  14-day  observation  period  followed  a  single  dose  of  laropiprant.  The  two  rats  that  died showed  signs  of  ptosis  and  salivation  on  day  1  before  death  at  day  2.  Surviving  rats  showed  no treatment-related effects at day 14. · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) Oral  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  of  laropiprant  alone,  or  in  combination  with  nicotinic  acid  and/or simvastatin, was evaluated in mice, rats and dogs. For laropiprant alone, two studies of 5 and 14 weeks were conducted in mice, five studies of up to 27 weeks of duration were conducted in rats, and four studies of up to 53 weeks duration were conducted in dogs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The AUC values obtained in the toxicity studies for laropiprant are sufficiently high when compared with  the  human  exposure  of  13 μ M/l/hr  during  clinical  use.  The  animal  to  human  multiples  at  the NOAEL varied between 2 and 470 times which is considered sufficient.

The combination of laropiprant with nicotinic acid was investigated in rats and dogs in 26-27 weeks oral toxicity studies. In rats, post administration changes in serum levels of glucose, total protein and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

albumin  and  phosphorus,  ketonuria  and  histomorphological  changes  in  liver  and  kidney  were observed.  Although  no  NOAEL  was  determined,  it  was  concluded  that  the  no-effect  level  for laropiprant  is  60  mg/kg/day  in  males  and  180  mg/kg/day  in  females  in  this  study,  since  findings typically associated with laropiprant could only be found above this level. In dogs, the bioavailability of  laropiprant  was  much  reduced  and  apart  from  vomiting  starting  at  the  lowest  dose,  only  mild adverse effects were observed. No conclusions can be drawn about the possible toxicological effects of laropiprant in dogs, after combination therapy with nicotinic acid. The NOAEL for laropiprant was estimated to be 5 mg/kg/day in dogs.

The combination of laropiprant with nicotinic acid and simvastatin was investigated in rats and dogs. Rats showed salivation, decrease in body weight gain, cataract, increased neutrophils and monocytes, increased ALT, decreased triglycerides, and increased level of ketones in urine. No clear NOAEL was shown for the combination, although the NOAEL for laropiprant was estimated as 180 mg/kg/day, since no signs of toxicity typically associated with laropiprant were apparent. Dogs showed amongst other  effects  also  redness  of  ears,  abdomen,  and  genitalia,  lacrimation,  emesis  and  salivation, conjunctival  vasodilation,  miosis,  chorioretinopathy,  increase  in  ALT,  decrease  in  cholesterol  and triglycerides and retinopathy. The NOAEL for laropiprant was estimated as 5 mg/kg/day, although no clear NOAEL for the combination of laropiprant with simvastatin and nicotinic acid was shown.

Nicotinic  acid  is  a  well  known  and  extensively  tested  substance  and  the  amount  of  available  data demonstrates the lack of clinically relevant genotoxicity.

In the toxicokinetic evaluation of the studies in rats, co-medication of laropiprant with nicotinic acid, or  with  nicotinic  acid  and  simvastatin  did  not  result  in  different  AUC(0-∞ ) levels  of  laropiprant. However, the AUC of nicotinic acid decreased by about 30% at higher dosing levels of laropiprant. In the additional presence of simvastatin the decrease in AUC levels of nicotinic acid was not observed. In  dog,  the  AUC(0-∞ ) of  laropiprant  was  decreased  by  at  least  50%  in  case  of  co-medication  with nicotinic  acid  and  simvastatin.  Internal  exposure  of  simvastatin  was  reduced  in  the  presence  of laropiprant.  The interaction between laropiprant and nicotinic acid was not considered significant and relevant,  since  the  observed  toxicity  related  to  nicotinic  acid  remained  similar  in  both  rat  and  dog despite differences in AUC(0-∞ )  Furthermore, interactions between laropiprant and nicotinic acid and simvastatin have been evaluated in the clinical development program, and have no clinical relevance. It is worth noting that effects on the liver were seen in all species tested. In mice these effects were evident from the lowest dose tested with an exposure multiple of 39. In rats, effects are seen from 180 mg/kg/day  (exposure  multiple  182),  with  or  without  nicotinic  acid,  but  not  in  combination  with simvastatin. In dogs, increased ALT was observed from 100 mg/kg/day with laropiprant alone or in combination with nicotinic acid, and from 25 mg/kg/day (exposure multiple 3) in combination with simvastatin. Considering these findings, monitoring of liver function tests is recommended in patients before  initiation  and  periodically  during  the  product  administration,  as  stated  in  the  Summary  of product characteristics (SPC). · Genotoxicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

A  standard  battery  of  genotoxicity  studies  were  performed  to  assess  the  genotoxic  potential  of laropiprant, showing it to be devoid of any clinically relevant genotoxic potential.

Thus, both compounds were considered non-genotoxic.

- Carcinogenicity

The  effect  of  the  combination  therapy  was  not  studied,  but  the  lack  of  carcinogenic  potential  in previous studies on nicotinic acid published in the literature justifies this omission.

Carcinogenic  potential  of  laropiprant  was  investigated  in  two-year  studies  in  rats  and  mice.  No treatment related findings were reported in rats. In mice, however, statistically significant increase in tumours of testes was observed at the highest dose of 250 mg/kg/day compared to the control groups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(tumour was detected in 5  mice compared to none in the two control groups). This increase is not considered to be related to the treatment, since the statistical significance was most probably caused by an  atypical  absence  of  spontaneous  tumours  of  testes  in  the  control  groups  in  comparison  with historical control data of the laboratory. The exposure multiple and safety margin at the NOAEL are considered sufficient to exclude a human safety concern at this dose.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

No reproduction toxicity studies have been performed either with the combination of nicotinic acid and  laropiprant  or  nicotinic  acid  alone.  An  overview  of  the  literature  data  on  the  use  of  high  dose nicotinic  acid  during  pregnancy  has  been  provided.  Animal  data  on  rats  suggest  no  concern  for teratogenic  effects,  but  very  limited  data  on  human  pregnancies  indicate  there  might  be  a  small increase  in  risk  of  congenital  malformations.  Thus,  the  use  of  high  dose  nicotinic  acid  should  be avoided during pregnancy, as stated in the SPC.

In case of laropiprant, all main reproductive toxicity studies had been conducted in accordance with the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Reproductive  Toxicology:  Detection  of  Toxicity  to  Reproduction  for Medicinal Products (CHMP/ICH/386/95). The laropiprant dosages used in the main reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits were based on  the  results  of  dose-range-finding  studies.  Haematological  and  serum  biochemical  examinations revealed  that  laropiprant  did  not  affect  any  haematological  parameter  in  either  species.  Changes  in biochemical  parameters  (dose-dependent  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  ALT  increase)  were seen in rabbits but not in rats. Effects of laropiprant on male and female fertility were studied in rats. Treated males or females were mated with untreated females or males, respectively. Minimal toxicity (slight decrease in body weights and food consumption) was evident in treated females during the pre-mating period at 400 mg/kg/day dose. In treated males body weight gain was already reduced at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day dose groups. No effects  were  observed  in  the  reproductive  capacity  of  both  genders.  Litter  parameters  and  sperm parameters were not affected by the treatment. Embryo-foetal  development  studies with  laropiprant  were  conducted  on  rats  and  rabbits.  The combination therapy was not examined. In  rats,  only  the  maternal  body  weight  gain  was  decreased  at  high  doses  (400  mg/kg/day)  with corresponding effects in the F1-generation (decreased body weight and incomplete ossification). No malformations were detected. In the rabbit study, clear toxic effects were seen at 125 mg/kg/day dose and  post-implantation  loss  was  also  increased.  Some  malformations  were  detected  in  the  F1generation.  In  both  species,  laropiprant  effects  were  associated  with  reduced  maternal  body  weight gain (56%); nevertheless, the safety margins in both species are sufficiently high to consider a risk for human safety unlikely. The finding of 'absent kidney' observed in rabbits was of some concern and it was questioned if it can be explained by the reduced number of litters and foetuses (3 abortions, 1 doe was found dead and another one was sacrificed) in the 5 mg/kg/day and 25mg/kg/day dosage groups. Historical  control data on kidney malformations have been provided for the time period 2000-2007 and the submitted information justified the non-significance of the observed 'absent kidney' effect. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Possible  effects  of  laropiprant  on  the prenatal  and  postnatal  development had  been  investigated  in rats.  In  the  F0-generation  toxic  effects  were  limited  to  doses  of  400  mg/kg/day.  Gestational  body weights were decreased, whereas lactation body weights were increased. Furthermore postimplantation  loss  was  increased  in  this  dosage  group.  In  the  F1-generation,  pup  mortality  was increased during postnatal days 1 to 3. No major effects were seen in behavioural testing. The fertility index was decreased in the 400 mg/kg/day dose group (90% vs. 100% in the control group).

Overall, there were no effects on male or female fertility in rats from the use of laropiprant at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. The safety margins for both species at the NOAEL are sufficiently high to consider a risk for human safety unlikely.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Local tolerance

No new studies on local tolerance of nicotinic acid or the combination of nicotinic acid and laropiprant were submitted. This is accepted, as clinical experience with nicotinic acid over many years indicates a low risk for local irritation and toxicity studies with oral administration of the combination did not raise concerns in regard to local irritation.

Local tolerance of laropiprant was assessed in three test systems: in vitro bovine corneal opacity assay, EpiDerm human skin culture system and in vivo using rabbit skin. The results indicated no skin irritant potential,  whereas  a  slight  ocular  irritation  potential  may  be  apparent,  but  this  does  not  raise  any concerns.

## · Other toxicity studies

No other toxicity studies with nicotinic acid or with the combination of nicotinic acid and laropiprant were submitted. This is accepted, as there is an extensive clinical experience with nicotinic acid and there  were  no  concerns  identified  suggesting  that  the  combination  would  exhibit  toxicological characteristics requiring further specific toxicity studies.

Antigenicity of  laropiprant  has  been  tested  in  two in  vitro test  systems.  In  both  tests  no  sensitising potential was detected.

There was no indication of immunotoxicity observed for laropiprant in the routine repeat dose toxicity studies and there was no evidence of mechanism-based immunotoxicological risk. As such, in accord with ICH Guidance S8, no additional immunotoxicity studies were conducted

No  additional dependence studies  were  conducted,  since  evidence  of  physical  dependence  or withdrawal  was  not  observed  in  any  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  or  safety  pharmacology studies  evaluating  neurobehavioral  function.  Additionally,  laropiprant  has  undetectable  levels  of distribution in the brain.

Laropiprant  was  tested  for haemolytic properties  after  intravenous  application  at  clinically  relevant concentration. No haemolytic activity was observed in washed human red blood cells (RBC).

No phototoxicity studies  have  been  performed  since  the  absorbance  in  the  relevant  parts  of  the spectrum is poor and no relevant distribution into the skin and eye have to be assumed.

The  potential  of  laropiprant  as in  inducer  of microsomal  enzyme  activity was  investigated  in  liver homogenates of CD-1 mice and showed that the compound increases hepatic weights, induces fatty acyl-CoA oxidase activity, and increases CYP 3A and 4A activity.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Medicinal product no longer authorised

As a vitamin, nicotinic acid is exempt from environmental testing.

The environmental risk of laropiprant was assessed according to the guideline on the environmental risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  June  2006. Laropiprant is not degradable, but it is not classified as persistent. There is no indication of a risk for bioaccumulation.  The  method  used  to  determine  log  KOC  (adsorption  coefficient)  was  considered insufficient  and  the  commitment  to  conduct  an  OECD  106  study  was  recorded  as  a  Follow  Up Measure. Laropiprant does not pose a risk to aquatic or sediment organisms, to micro-organisms in sewage sludge and to ground water.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical programme of Trevaclyn included four phase II studies, four phase III studies and three phase II extension studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Phase II programme consisted of 4 studies designed to address the following key objectives:

- -Selection of the most appropriate flushing endpoints to assess nicotinic acid induced flushing
- -Selection of the laropiprant dose
- -Selection of the appropriate formulation of ER nicotinic acid for use in the combination tablet
- -Demonstration of the lack of effect of laropiprant on lipids.

The  four  Phase  III  studies,  which  provide  pivotal  efficacy  data  for  extended  release  nicotinic acid/laropiprant, set out the specific effects on lipids and flushing as their primary endpoints.

## The claimed indication for Trevaclyn is:

Adjunctive  therapy  to  diet  for  use  in  patients  with  primary  hypercholesterolaemia  (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia:

- -who are treated with a statin and could benefit from having Trevaclyn added to their regimen;
- -in whom a statin is considered inappropriate or not tolerated

The approved indication for Trevaclyn is: Trevaclyn is indicated for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, particularly in patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia  (characterised  by  elevated  levels  of  LDL-cholesterol  and  triglycerides  and  low HDL-cholesterol)  and  in  patients  with  primary  hypercholesterolaemia  (heterozygous  familial  and non-familial). Trevaclyn should be used in patients in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), when the cholesterol lowering effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor monotherapy is inadequate. It can be used as monotherapy only in patients in whom HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are considered inappropriate or not tolerated. Diet and other non-pharmacological treatments (e.g. exercise, weight reduction) should be continued during therapy with Trevaclyn.

The extended release formulation nicotinic acid (niacin)/laropiprant (also known as MK-0524A) is a fixed-dose  combination  of  extended-release  nicotinic  acid  with  an  immediate  release  layer  of laropiprant (also known as MK-0524). The product has been formulated as a bilayer tablet consisting of 20 mg of laropiprant and 1g of ER nicotinic acid.

Because of the extensive and rapid metabolism of nicotinic acid in the liver (see section Metabolism and Elimination), its plasma levels are not a reliable measure of the rate or the extent of nicotinic acid absorption. Furthermore, liver is a potentially important site of action, and thus, it is crucial to measure endpoints that reflect the rate and extent of nicotinic acid delivered to the liver. Before reaching the systemic  circulation,  over  90%  of  orally  absorbed  nicotinic  acid  is  metabolised  to  nicotinuric  acid (NUA),  N-methyl-nicotinamide  (MNA),  or  N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide  (2PY).  Therefore, the  total  amount  of  nicotinic  acid  and  its  metabolites  excreted  in  urine  and  the  total  exposure  to nicotinic acid and its metabolites in plasma provide a reliable measure of the extent of absorption of the oral dose. The NUA plasma levels are used for the estimation of nicotinic acid absorption rate due

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  the  better  correlation  with  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  parent  drug  in  comparison  with nicotinic acid. The variability of NUA is substantially lower than that of nicotinic acid.

Thus,  the  early  studies  provide  preliminary  information  primarily  on  plasma  NUA  as  the  primary endpoint,  whereas  the  definitive  phase  III  studies  characterising  the  ER  nicotinic  acid  in  the  ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant tablets use plasma NUA concentrations and the total urinary nicotinic acid and metabolites as the primary endpoints.

The pharmacokinetics of nicotinic acid is considered to be well known and the current evaluation is mainly dealing with the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant and its potential interactions with nicotinic acid.

Overall,  35  phase  I  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  biopharmaceutical  and  pharmacokinetic properties of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant, including:

- -biopharmaceutical studies with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant
- -laropiprant single dose studies in healthy subjects

-laropiprant multiple dose studies in healthy subjects -laropiprant absorption, disposition, metabolism and excretion in humans -laropiprant in special populations -laropiprant drug interaction studies -ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant drug interaction studies. Commercially available NIACOR™ and NIASPAN™ nicotinic acid formulations were used in phase I  studies.  The  phase  II  dose  ranging  studies  were  performed  with  NIASPAN™ and the evaluations were based on the suppression of NIASPAN™ induced flushing symptoms. In phase III studies, the comparability of the ER nicotinic acid formulation and NIASPAN™ in its activity to induce flushing symptoms was demonstrated in bridging studies, including investigations comparing the pharmacokinetic profiles of the two products. One  formulation  of  laropiprant  has  been  used  throughout  the  clinical  development  with  minor alterations, either as separate tablets or as a part of a bilayer tablet. The laropiprant layer of the bilayer formulation  used  in  phase  III  studies  is  identical  with  the  proposed  final  market  composition formulation, with the exception of minor alterations to excipients. These differences are not expected to affect the in vivo pharmacokinetics of laropiprant. · Absorption The absolute bioavailability of laropiprant in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant tablet was determined in  a  three  period  open-label  clinical  study  in  healthy  adults  as  approximately  71%.  The  C max was achieved in 1.9 hrs post oral administration. In addition, food does not appear to have a significant effect on laropiprant pharmacokinetics, the ratio of AUC0-∞ values in fed and fasted state is 0.94. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The oral bioavailability of nicotinic acid (based on the recovery of the dose in urine) as nicotinic acid and  its  major  metabolites  is  estimated  to  be  at  least  69%.  Administration  in  fed  conditions  has  no major effect on the extent of absorption of nicotinic acid in ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant, but slows down the rate of nicotinic acid absorption.

As food does not have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant, nicotinic acid or the nicotinic acid metabolites, a specific dose recommendation with respect to food intake was deemed unnecessary.  The SPC  recommends taking  the  tablets  with  food.  This,  however,  is  for  the reasons of tolerability and not bioavailability.

## · Distribution

After i.v.  administration  of  laropiprant  concomitantly  with  nicotinic  acid  the  volume  of  distribution and  the  elimination  half  life  of  laropiprant  are  approximately  70 L  and  15  hrs,  respectively.  The determined volume of distribution is considered to be of moderate magnitude and exceeds the extra-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cellular fluid space. This implies some uptake or binding to the cellular components of body tissue. Such assumption was confirmed by the in vitro studies in rats. The in vitro reversible plasma protein binding of laropiprant in humans was approximately 99% and its blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was estimated to be 0.55.

Based  on  data  available  in  literature,  nicotinic  acid  is  less  than  20%  bound  to  serum  proteins  in humans. Nicotinic acid has been reported to be excreted in human breast milk. Plasma protein binding studies were not conducted with the combination of laropiprant and nicotinic acid since the affinity of nicotinic acid to plasma proteins was low and therefore, the likelihood of it displacing laropiprant and causing interactions is small.

## · Metabolism and Elimination

Nicotinic acid undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism through two pathways that are dose and rate dependent:

1. Formation  of  nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide  (NAD)  and  nicotinamide,  which  is  further metabolised to MNA and to 2PY.

Laropiprant  is  eliminated  mainly  in  liver.  Approximately  89.5%  of  administered  dose  could  be recovered: 22% in urine and 68% in faeces. The acyl glucuronide was the primary compound detected in urine (64% of the total urinary material), with smaller contributions of two hydroxylated epimers and  their  glucuronic  acid  conjugates,  the  keto-derivative,  and  the  parent  compound.  Unchanged laropiprant  was  the  primary  compound  detected  in  faeces  (73%  of  the  total  faecal  material).  The epimers of the hydroxylated metabolite and the keto-derivative were also detected in the faeces and accounted for 10% and 17% of the material, respectively.

2. Conjugation with glycine forming NUA. The first pathway predominates at low doses or at a low absorption rate. At higher doses or higher rates of absorption, the NAD pathway is saturable, and an increasing fraction of the oral dose reaches the  bloodstream  unchanged  as  nicotinic  acid.  The  glycine  conjugation  pathway  does  not  saturate across the clinically relevant dose range. Nicotinic acid is excreted mainly in urine; approximately 69% of the total nicotinic acid dose can be recovered within 96 hrs post oral administration, accounting for 2% nicotinic acid, 7% NUA, 12% MNA and 46% 2PY. Laropiprant is metabolised mainly via glucuronidation.  The  metabolic profile  of  laropiprant  did  not reveal  the  presence  any  significant  levels  of  metabolites  with  strong  DP  activity  (e.g.  oxidative metabolites)  in  plasma.  Only  laropiprant  and  its  glucuronide  were  detected  as  the  main  circulating forms, with the parent compound accounting for approximately 27% of the total exposure in plasma. Thus,  any  effect  of  laropiprant  on  the  DP 1 receptors  is  mediated  by  laropiprant  alone  and  not  its metabolites. The metabolism of laropiprant investigated in vitro using human liver microsomes and suspension of hepatocytes  revealed  formation  of  hydroxylated  epimers  and  keto-derivative.  Involvement  of  CYP 3A4 and CYP 2C9 in the oxidative metabolic pathway was confirmed, whereas several UGT isoforms were capable of generating the acyl glucuronide derivative.

## Interconversion:

Laropiprant  is  a  chiral  molecule  with  one  chiral  centre.  The  active  substance  used  in  the  fixed combination product is the R -enantiomer. Therefore, a concern related to a potential interconversion of the R - to the S -enantiomer has been raised. The supplied information on the results of the in vitro and in vivo stability testing indicated no interconversion of the examined R -enantiomer.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The dose dependency was investigated over a wide range of single and multiple doses. No clinically significant  deviation  from  linearity  was  detected  between  3  mg  to  400  mg  doses  after  single  or multiple  dosing.  No  unexpected  increase  in  the  exposure  was  found  after  once  daily  dosing  for  10 consecutive  days;  the  minimal  accumulation  of  approximately  30%  for  AUC  and  10%  for  Cmax averaged across all examined doses did not raise concern. In addition, only one strength of laropiprant is  proposed to be marketed and thus, the linearity of the dose-dependency profile is not considered relevant.

## · Special populations

Effects  of  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  demographic  factors  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  laropiprant  were evaluated through 2 different types of analyses. Phase I studies were conducted to directly evaluate the effect of demographic and some other factors on laropiprant pharmacokinetics (gender, age, hepatic function,  renal  function,  and  food  effect).  Subsequently,  a  composite  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was performed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  gender,  age,  race,  and  body  mass  index  on  laropiprant pharmacokinetics in the phase I population. An evaluation of possible differences in the pharmacokinetics  of  laropiprant  in  the  presence versus absence  of  ER  nicotinic  acid  was  also performed.

Results from both, the individual studies and the composite analysis, indicate that the demographic factors  (age,  gender,  race  and  body  mass  index)  do  not  clinically  impact  pharmacokinetics  of laropiprant when administered as laropiprant alone or in combination with ER nicotinic acid. Thus no dose adjustment for laropiprant is warranted on this basis. The  data  currently  presented  on  pharmacokinetic  of  laropiprant  do  not  include  the  information  on pharmacokinetics  in  target  population.  Pharmacokinetic  population  analysis  in  such  population  is required  and  the  submission  of  a  plan  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetic  of  laropiprant  in  the  target patients was taken up as a follow up measure. While no clinically relevant effect of age on the pharmacokinetic of laropiprant or nicotinic acid was observed  in  the  studies  in  the  elderly,  no  specific  evaluation  has  been  conducted  in  children  and adolescents. In the population with severe renal insufficiency, a modest, but clinically insignificant increase in the AUC of laropiprant was observed. Severe renal insufficiency did not alter the Cmax of laropiprant, but the apparent terminal half-life was prolonged. The effect of mild or moderate renal insufficiency on laropiprant  pharmacokinetics  was  not  evaluated  in  phase  I  studies,  but  given  that  no  clinically meaningful impact was observed in severe renal insufficiency patients, a lack of significant effects in mild and moderate renal insufficiency can be expected. Based on the high degree of plasma protein binding, it is unlikely that laropiprant is dialyzable. As only 22% of the laropiprant dose is excreted via the kidney, renal insufficiency will most probably have only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Even  though  the  pharmacokinetics  of  laropiprant  was  not markedly  altered by  severe renal insufficiency,  nicotinic  acid  and  its  metabolites  are  primarily  excreted  by  the  kidney;  thus,  caution should  be  applied when  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant is administered  to patients  with renal insufficiency. The warning taken up in the SPC stating that Trevaclyn should be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction is based on the pharmacokinetics of nicotinic acid.

In studies with patients suffering from moderate hepatic insufficiency, a 3-fold increase in exposure of 40 mg single dose laropiprant was observed compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, the exposure to  the  main  metabolite  (glucuronide)  is  increased.  In  addition,  nicotinic  acid  is  contraindicated  in patients  with  significant  liver  dysfunction.  Thus,  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  combination product should not be administered to these patients. These findings are in line with the results of the study with mild liver insufficient patients and the contraindication warning has been incorporated into the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Studies  of  the  hepatic  metabolism  of  nicotinic  acid  were  not  performed,  because  these  have  been studied  and  reported  in  animals  and  humans  in  the  past. In  vitro drug  interaction  studies  with  the combination of laropiprant and nicotinic acid were not conducted, since each of the compounds was extensively studied to evaluate their maximum potential for drug interactions. These tests showed that laropiprant  and  nicotinic  acid  did  not  affect  the  common  metabolic  pathways,  and  thus,  further combination studies would be unlikely to provide substantial information.

The in  vitro metabolism  laropiprant  was  studied  in  animal,  human  liver  and  human  intestinal microsomes, and suspensions of freshly prepared or cryopreserved hepatocytes. Results indicate that laropiprant is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs. In experiments with human  liver  microsomes  laropiprant  did  not  inhibit  CYP1A2-,  CYP2B6-,  CYP2C9-,  CYP2C19-, CYP2D6-, CYP2E1- and CYP3A4-mediated reactions and is not a substrate for, or an inhibitor of the human p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Laropiprant was a moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and has the potential to cause drug interactions via UGT1A1, 2B4, and 2B7 effects.

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin are not influenced by the co-administration of laropiprant. ( R )-warfarin is metabolised by CYP3A4, 1A2 and 2C19 and ( S )-warfarin preferably by CYP2C9, the results of this study confirm the observed in vitro data. Laropiprant does not appear to have an effect on the pharmacovigilance of digoxin. Administration of laropiprant with clarithromycin,  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4,  is  associated  with  a  modest  increase  of  laropiprant AUC0-∞ and  Cmax  values,  but  this  was  not  considered  clinically  important.  Furthermore,  laropiprant does not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone, which is primarily metabolised by  CYP2C8.  Administration  of  laropiprant  40  mg  single  daily  dose  combined  with  the  oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and norelgestromin does not result in significant alterations of plasma levels of the contraceptive components.

Interactions of laropiprant with other drugs were examined in a series of in vivo studies. Nicotinic acid did not influence the pharmacokinetics of laropiprant in a clinically significant way and vice versa. The interaction studies with midazolam, which is predominately metabolised by  CYP3A4, demonstrate  that  laropiprant  does  not  influence  its  metabolism,  but  inhibits  the  metabolism  of  the oxidative  metabolite,  1-hydroxy-midazolam.  This  indicates  that  laropiprant  significantly  inhibits UGT2B4 and UGT2B7, since these enzymes appear to be further involved in the metabolism of 1hydroxy-midazolam.  However,  additional  data  in  support  of  the  hypothesis  that  laropiprant  is  an inhibitor of UGT2B7 and of the consequent SPC statement are necessary. The commitment to conduct in vitro studies with UGT2B7 substrates has been included as a follow up measure. Depending on the results of the in vitro studies, further in vivo evaluations might be needed. The lack of laropirant's effect on the CYP3A4 isoform was also confirmed in an interaction study with simvastatin.  However,  a  different  study  examining  the  effect  of  simvastatin  on  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant  indicated  a  non  negligible  increase  in  relevant  parameters  of  simvastatin;  the  mean AUC and Cmax  are increased  by  approximately  60%  and  40%,  respectively.  It  is  implied  that  these parameters can rise in a similar magnitude in the elderly and thus, the increase may be additive. Since the currently provided data are not sufficient to exclude adverse effects on liver and/or muscle in the subgroup  of  patients  &gt;65  years,  the  incidence  of  such  events  (hepatic  symptoms,  abnormal  liver function tests, myopathy/rhabdomyolysis tests) is to be monitored as stated in the Risk management plan (RMP). Data from elderly patients in the ongoing trial will be analysed and the commitment to provide  CHMP with the  DSMB recommendations of this study has been requested  as  a  follow  up measure. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall,  the  potentials  for  drug-drug  interactions  of  both  components  of  the  proposed  fixed combination  have  sufficiently  been  addressed  in  the  provided  programme  or  in  the  follow  up measures, and are appropriately labelled.

## Pharmacodynamics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The development programme was focused on establishing the pharmacodynamic properties of the new active  substance  laropiprant.  The  mode  of  action  of  laropiprant,  including  primary  and  secondary pharmacology  has  been  investigated  sufficiently.  Since  clinical  efficacy  regarding  nicotinic  acid  is based on pharmacodynamic surrogate endpoints, the phase III programme provides further assessment of the pharmacodynamics (lipid efficacy and flushing) of the ER nicotinic acid component of the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant tablet either when given alone or as a part of the combination product.

## · Mechanism of action

Flushing symptoms include redness of the skin, sensation of warmth, itching and tingling. Nicotinic acid-induced  flushing  (NIF)  is  mediated  primarily  by  PGD2  released  by  skin  cells.  Animal  studies showed that the PGD2 receptor subtype 1 (DP1) is an important mediator of the flushing induced by nicotinic acid.

Laropiprant is a potent and selective antagonist of DP1 receptor.  It also has the affinity to interact with thromboxane A2 receptor (TP), although it is approximately 190-fold less potent when compared to DP1. Activation of TP has been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro ,  whereas activation of human platelet DP1 inhibits platelet aggregation. These in vitro data indicate that laropiprant may alter platelet function either by enhancement of platelet reactivity through DP1 antagonism or by inhibition of platelet aggregation through TP antagonism.

Effect on platelet function is the key issue with respect to the secondary pharmacology of laropiprant. Since laropiprant has affinity to both, the DP1 receptor and the thromboxane A2 receptor, there is a possibility  that  laropiprant  may  alter  platelet  function.  This  can  be  demonstrated  either  as  an enhancement of platelet reactivity through DP1 antagonism, or as an inhibition of platelet aggregation through TP antagonism. No dose-dependent effect on PGD2 stimulated cAMP in platelets aggregation was observed ex  vivo. The collagen agonist-induced platelet aggregation showed a small increase in inhibition with a lower dose of laropiprant (60 mg), but the clinical meaning of these results is unclear. Results from studies examining the changes in the in vivo bleeding time are conflicting between the different  studies.  Clinically  meaningful  prolongation  of  bleeding  time  can  only  be  expected  with higher doses leading to Cmax levels 3 times higher than the therapeutic doses. In summary, no clinically relevant  effects  on  platelet  mediated  bleeding  effects  were  noted  at  therapeutic  concentrations  of laropiprant, but the lack of clear pharmacological results indicated the need for further research and clinical testing. New studies evaluating the effects of multiple doses of laropiprant on the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel alone and clopidogrel and aspirin in combination and the effect of nicotinic acid and/or laropiprant on platelet aggregation and bleeding are in progress, and the results will be provided to the CHMP as a follow up measure.

· Primary and Secondary pharmacology The primary pharmacology programme involved the examination of the effect of laropiprant on NIF symptoms  (measured  by  Visual  Analog  Score  (VAS)  and  intensity  scores)  and  on  nicotinic  acid induced increases in skin blood flow, as measured by Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI). It was demonstrated  that  both,  the  symptom  scores  and  skin  blood  flow  measurements,  show  a  dose dependent  decrease  in  NIF  with  multiple  dosing  of  laropiprant  in  the  dose  range  of  5-300  mg. Administration of single and multiple doses of laropiprant can reduce flushing, especially when higher doses  (100-300  mg)  are  used.  The  proposed  dose  of  laropiprant  in  the  final  combination  product appears to reduce flushing, but a real cut-off dose for maximum reduction of flushing is not apparent from the conducted studies. Differences between 30 mg laropiprant, 100 mg laropiprant and aspirin treatment  were  small  and  not  significant,  thus,  questioning  the  claim  that  these  dosages  are significantly  better  in  reducing  flushing  than  aspirin.  The  results  of  the  Maximum  Overall  Severity Symptoms Score (OSSS) test indicate that co-administration of aspirin and laropiprant does not seem to produce a major effect on flushing. Aspirin is currently used in the treatment of NIF. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Concomitant use with aspirin does not show additive effects on bleeding time when lower doses of laropiprant are used which is in line with the previous results. Furthermore, other possible effects of laropiprant due to the inhibition of different DP1 receptor mediated physiological responses may play a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

role in the pathophysiological process of endothelial dysfunction potentially leading to atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. Thus, a commitment to conduct regular review and evaluation of post-marketing reports within the PSURs and monitoring of clinical trial reports of adverse events related to inhibition of platelet function was included in the RMP.

Laropiprant was found to have no clinically relevant effect on QTc and no further investigations on this aspect were needed.

Phase II studies established that laropiprant doses of 18.75 mg - 150 mg were similarly effective in reducing flushing symptoms induced by 1 g nicotinic acid, and laropiprant doses of 37.5 mg - 300 mg were effective for NIF reduction after administration of 2 g of nicotinic acid.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response studies

The efficacy of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant was demonstrated in four phase II and phase III studies. The phase II programme aimed to select the most appropriate flushing endpoints, to assess nicotinic acid induced flushing, to select the dose of laropiprant, to select a formulation of ER nicotinic acid for use in the combination tablet, and to demonstrate that laropiprant has no effect on lipids.

## Lipid altering effect of laropiprant (study P011)

Information  on  the  effect  of  laropiprant  on  lipid  parameters  was  provided.  A  dose  of  150  mg laropiprant did not affect HDL-C and TG, whereas a small (&lt;3% change) was noted in LDL-C. As these levels are known to fluctuate, changes within this limit were not considered relevant.

## Dose finding (studies P011 and P033)

The co-administration of laropiprant with nicotinic acid was shown to be effective in reducing flushing symptoms caused by nicotinic acid. No dose-dependency was noted in the daily dose range of 18.75150 mg laropiprant when 1 g of nicotinic acid was given daily. A dose-dependent response was noted

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between  5 mg  and  37.5  mg  when  1  g  nicotinic  acid  was  administered.  Thus,  the  pharmacological effect  may  still  be  present  at  dosages  lower  than  20  mg.  A  minimal  effective  dose  has  not  been established. Less effect is shown at dosages &lt; 37.5 mg laropiprant when added to 2 g dose of nicotinic acid indicating that with the 2 g dose of nicotinic acid  there is still dose-dependency effect between 10 mg and 37.5 mg of laropiprant. These observations suggest that as a starting dose, the combination of 20 mg of laropiprant with 1 g of nicotinic acid is suitable, which can be followed by combination of 40 mg laropiprant with 2 g of nicotinic acid (double dose of 20 mg laropiprant/1 g nicotinic acid tablet) in chronic use.

## Flushing Symptom Questionnaire validation (study P015)

The Flushing Symptom Questionnaire assesses flushing through patient report in electronic diaries, which included the main scoring method for flushing, Global Flushing Severity Score (GFSS). Overall severity of the flushing experience was expressed as the highest severity during the first week (acute flushing). In the assessment of chronic flushing, the number of days per week with flushing of certain severity  was  used  along  with  the  scores  on  quality  of  life,  the  Global  Flushing  Bothersome  Score (GFBS) and  the  Global  Flushing  Sleep  Bothersome  Score  (GFSBS).  The  evaluation  of  parameters assessing acute flushing showed significant difference in GFSS in week 1 comparing administration of 1  g  nicotinic  acid  with  placebo.  With  respect  to  the  long  term  effects,  the  scoring  of  only  once  a day/week (main parameter GFSS) showed small differences of 0.5 and 1.5 days of moderate/severe flushing for placebo and 2 g nicotinic acid, respectively. In addition, no major difference in scoring was seen between the 1 g and 2 g nicotinic acid dose. However, the some of the phase III studies were sensitive  enough  to  demonstrate  an  increase  in  flushing  with  increasing  dose  of  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant, ER nicotinic acid or NIASPAN™.

· Main studies The Phase III programme was designed to assess two types of efficacy endpoints: those related to lipid effects and those related to NIF. Lipid endpoints, defined as primary or key secondary endpoints in studies P020-02 and P022-02, aimed to show the efficacy of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant as a lipidmodifying therapy with beneficial effects on LDL-C, HDL-C and TG values. The flushing endpoints were the primary or key secondary endpoints in studies P020-02, P023-00, and P054-00, which were designed to demonstrate the effect  of  laropiprant  in  reduction  of  NIF  focusing  on  major  aspects  of nicotinic  acid  use:  during  the  therapy  initiation  when  high  degree  of  flushing  is  observed,  during chronic maintenance therapy, during return to the therapy after missing doses.

## Objectives

P020-02: The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  lipid-lowering  efficacy  of  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant with or without the use of statins relative to placebo, and its effect on flushing during the acute dosing period relative to ER-nicotinic acid.

Key secondary objectives  were  effect  of  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  on  plasma  concentrations  of HDL-C, TG, LDL-C / HDL-C ratio, non-HDL-C, Apo B, and Apo A-I relative to placebo and the effects on flushing relative to ER-nicotinic acid. Further key secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects  in  patients  not  taking  concomitant  statin  therapy  and  to  assess  safety  and  tolerability  of  ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant.

P022-02: Primary objective was to evaluate LDL-C lowering efficacy of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant alone or when co-administered with simvastatin compared to ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

Key secondary objective was to evaluate the effects of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant co-administered with simvastatin on HDL-C, TG, LDL-C, LDL-C / HDL-C ratio, non-HDL-C, Apo B, and Apo A-I compared to simvastatin or to ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant, and to assess safety and tolerability of coadministration of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant with simvastatin.

P023-00: The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  laropiprant  in  the  protection against NIF in patients who resume therapy with either ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant or ER nicotinic acid after a 5-day drug holiday. The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant. P054-00: The primary objective was to assess flushing symptoms with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant versus ER nicotinic acid in lipid clinic patients for whom nicotinic acid therapy is appropriate. Key secondary objective was to assess flushing symptoms with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant versus ER nicotinic acid as  measured as GFSS ≥ 4  and  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant  versus  ER  nicotinic  acid  as  measured  by  the  incidence  of  clinical  and  laboratory adverse experiences. Outcomes/endpoints P020-02: Co-primary endpoints were percent change from baseline across weeks 12-24 in LDL-C and maximum  GFSS  categorized  as  none/mild,  moderate,  severe  or  extreme  during  the  first  week  of treatment. Secondary endpoints were percent change from baseline across weeks 12-24 for HDL-C, TG, LDLC/HDL-C ratio, non-HDL-C, Apo B, Apo A-I, the number of days with moderate or greater GFSS (GFSS ≥ 4) during weeks 2-24, the maximum daily GFSS score during week 1, the maximum GFSS categorized as none, mild, moderate, severe, or extreme during week 1, the percentage of patients with maximum GFSS moderate or greater (GFSS ≥ 4) during week 1, the percent of patients discontinuing study  medication  due  to  flushing,  the  percent  of  patients  with  maximum  GFSS  severe  or  extreme (GFSS ≥ 7) during week 1, the number of days per week with mild or greater GFSS (GFSS ≥ 1) during weeks 2-24, and the percent change from baseline across weeks 12-24 in lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), TC, and TC/HDL-C ratio.

P022-02: The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in LDL-C at week 12. Key  secondary  endpoints  were  percent  changes  from  baseline  in  HDL-C,  TG,  LDL-C,  LDL/HDL ratio, non-HDL-C, Apo B, and Apo A-1 at week 12. Other secondary endpoints were percent change from baseline in TC, Lp(a), TC/HDL ratio, c-reactive protein (CRP), Apo C-III, and lipid subfractions at  week  12.  Exploratory  endpoints  were  percent  change  from  baseline  in  LDL-C,  HDL-C,  TG, LDL/HDL ratio, non-HDL-C, Apo B, and Apo A-1 at week 4. In addition, repeated measure mixed model analysis was performed using data at weeks 4, 8, and 12 for percent change at week 12 in LDLC and HDL-C as exploratory sensitivity analyses.

P023-00: The  primary  endpoint  was  the  maximum  GFSS  categorized  into  none/mild,  moderate, severe, extreme during the first 7 days following a 5-day drug holiday period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary Endpoints were maximum GFSS during the first 7 days following a 5-day drug holiday period  for  percentage  of  patients  with  moderate  or  greater  GFSS  (GFSS ≥ 4),  and  percentage  of patients with severe or extreme GFSS (GFSS ≥ 7), both during the first 7 days following a 5-day drug holiday period.

P054-00: The primary endpoint parameter was the number of days per week with moderate or greater GFSS (GFSS ≥ 4) across the treatment period.

Secondary endpoint parameters were the number of days per week with moderate or greater GFSS (GFSS ≥ 4) across weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 combined and the number of days per week with moderate or greater GFSS (GFSS ≥ 4) across weeks 2-16. Exploratory endpoint parameters were (1) Percent change form baseline in LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TG, and TC at Week 16; (2) number of days per week with  moderate  or  greater  GFSS  (GFSS ≥ 4)  across  Weeks  6-16;  (3)  number  of  days  per  week  with severe or extreme GFSS (GFSS ≥ 7) across Weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 combined; (4) average GFSS score across  the  treatment  period;  (5)  discontinuing  study  medication  due  to  flushing  (Yes/No);  (6) maximum GFSS score across Weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 combined; (7) maximum GFSS categorized as none/mild,  moderate,  severe  or  extreme  across  Weeks  1,  5,  9,  and  13  combined;  (8)  percentage  of patients with maximum GFSS severe or extreme (GFSS ≥ 7) across the treatment period; (9) number of days  per  week  with  moderate  or  greater  GFBS  during  the  following  time  intervals:  the  treatment period, Weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 combined, Weeks 2-16, Weeks 6-16; (10) number of days per week with moderate  or  greater  individual  symptom  scores  (itching,  tingling,  warmth,  redness)  during  the following time intervals: the treatment period, Weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 combined, Weeks 2-16, Weeks 616; (11) median duration of flushing episodes (minutes, as reported on the e-diary) across Weeks 1, 5, 9,  and  13  combined;  (12)  number  of  days  per  week  with  bother  score  of  difficulty  sleeping  due  to flushing  (moderate  or  greater)  across  Weeks  1,  5,  9,  and  13  combined;  (13)  Flushing  Impact Questionnaire variables score(s); (14) number of days per week with aspirin or other NSAID use to mitigate flushing symptoms during the following time intervals: across the treatment period, across Weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 combined, across Weeks 2-16, across Weeks 6-16. With  respect  to  the  NIF,  the  experience  is  defined  as  a  collection  of  symptoms  including  itching, tingling, redness and warmth. Differences can be observed with respect to the number and types of symptoms, experienced during a flushing episode, frequency of flushing episodes in a given treatment period,  duration  of  each  episode  or  the  severity  of  the  individual  flushing  symptoms.  All  of  these factors form the overall patient's flushing experience and its consequent impact on the quality of life. Flushing  symptoms  were  assessed  through  patient  report  on  electronic  diaries  using  the  Flushing Symptom Questionnaire (FSQ) and specifically the Global Flushing Severity Score (GFSS).  A family of GFSS-based flushing endpoints was used in each of the studies with flushing endpoints to quantify the number of patients experiencing flushing and their frequency and intensity. Percentage of patients discontinuing therapy due to flushing was also assessed. Sample size Medicinal product no longer authorised

P020-02: A total of 1613 patients were randomised, 800 on ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant, 543 on ER nicotinic acid and 270 on placebo.

P022-02: A total  of  3  302  patients  were  screened,  of  which  1  904  were  excluded  and  1  398  were randomised. Of the 1 398 patients randomised, 1 135 (81.2%) completed the study and 245 (17.5%) patients discontinued study drug prior to the trial completion.

P023-00: In  the  MK-0524A/Placebo/MK-0524A  group  406  patients  were  randomised  and  309 analysed in the All-Patient-Treated analysis. In the MK-0524A/Placebo/ER nicotinic acid group, 411 patients  were  randomised  and  325  analysed  in  the  All-Patient-Treated  analysis.  In  the  MK0524A/MK-0524A  group  77  patients  were  randomised  and  57  patients  were  analysed  in  the  AllPatient-Treated analysis.

P054-00: 726 patients were randomised to MK-0524A and 729 to ER Nicotinic acid, 1 patient in the MK-0524A and 2 patients in the ER Nicotinic acid discontinued prior to treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For all four studies, the sample size and number of patients in each treatment group were considered adequate.

## Randomisation

A computer-generated randomisation schedule stratified by centre and presence/absence of concomitant statin medication, if applicable, was used for this study, and patients were randomised and assigned an allocation number via interactive voice response system (IVRS).

## Blinding (masking)

In  all  studies,  the  investigator,  site  personnel,  patients,  and  research  personnel  were  blinded  to treatment  assignment  during  the  study  period  and  before  the  database  was  complete  and  clean. Blinding was accomplished by random, masked, assignment of allocation numbers to the treatment groups and by ensuring the drug supplies (active and placebo) administered in the treatment groups appear identical.

Statistical methods Lipid lowering: study P020-02 and P022-02: An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to analyze the primary lipid endpoint of percent change from baseline in LDL-C across Weeks 12 to 24 and testing the difference in least square means of MK-0524A versus placebo. Key secondary lipid endpoints of percent change from baseline in HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, nonHDL-C, Apo B, Apo A-I were analysed by the ANOVA model similar to the one used for the LDL-C analysis. Percent change from baseline in TG was analysed using non-parametric methods based on medians. GFSS  (flushing)  efficacy:  study  P020-02,  P023-00  and  P054-00: The  primary  and  secondary endpoints used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by country. The primary analysis was performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population, which included all patients who took at least one dose of the treatment study drug and had at least one treatment period GFSS score available. All days with e-diary entries across the treatment period were used to define the primary endpoint. Medicinal product no longer authorised

P054-00: No formal protocol amendments were declared for the study; however, certain aspects in the analysis  of  the  study  results  were  changed,  raising  a  concern  for  their  potential  effect  on  result evaluation. The nature of the individual changes was clarified. These included addition or deletion of assessment  factors,  e.g.  country,  GFFS  scores,  evaluation  of  medication  discontinuation  due  to flushing.  These  were  conducted  to  facilitate  the  comparison  across  the  studies  and  to  enable  the integration of the results across the programme. These analyses have been cited as unplanned in the clinical study report.

Recruitment Studies were conducted in USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia, Latin America. P020-02: 16-Jan-2006 to 07-Dec-2006 (138 sites) P022-02: 17-May-2006 to 14-Jan-2007 (108 sites) P023-00: 17-Jul-2006 to 19-Jan-2007 (68 sites) P054-00: 09-Aug-2006 to 14-Mar-2007 (110 sites) Conduct of the study In  both  studies, P020-02 and P022-02 ,  two  protocol  amendments  were  implemented.  The  protocol amendments were not considered to have an influence on the interpretation of the study results. No major protocol deviations have been identified. P023-00: Changes to the conduct of the study P023-00 were implemented, including the analysis of maximum  duration  of  flushing,  which  was  not  pre-planned.  The  additional  analysis  was  clearly described and was performed prior to unblinding of the data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Baseline data

P020-02: Elderly patients (&gt;65 years) accounted for 29.4% of the study population, 66.5% of subjects used statins. The mean baseline LDL-L level was 113.5 ± 40.2 mg/d. Baseline data were considered to be comparable across the treatment groups.

P022-02: Elderly patients (&gt;65 years) accounted for 25.8% of the study population. The mean baseline LDL-L  level  was  151.3 ± 16.5  mg/d.  Baseline  data  were  considered  to  be  comparable  across  the treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

P023-00: Elderly patients (&gt;65 years) accounted for 15.3% of the study population. The mean baseline LDL-L  level  was  118.1 ± 37.6  mg/d.  Baseline  data  were  considered  to  be  comparable  across  the treatment groups.

P054-00: Elderly patients (&gt;65 years) accounted for 25.2% of the study population and 46.5% used statins.  The mean baseline LDL-L level was 111.0 ± 39.4 mg/d. Baseline data were considered to be comparable across the treatment groups.

## Numbers analysed

The number of patients/treatment arm was adequately reported for each pivotal study including the information on patients who discontinued treatment and did not complete the study protocol. Of the 1613  patients  randomized  in  the  study P020-02 ,  1609  received  study  treatment,  and  453  (28.1%) discontinued study drug prior to the trial completion.

More than 80% of the randomised patients in study P022-02 completed the trial. There was a higher number of patients discontinuing the treatment in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant group than in the group taking simvastatin in addition to the combination.

A  significant  number  of  discontinuations  was  noted  prior  to  the  post-drug-holiday  phase  of  study P023-00 (200  out  of  894  randomised  patients).  These  were  equally  distributed  across  the  treatment groups. The primary outcome measure in this study focuses on the post-drug-holiday period, in which the numbers of patients discontinuing treatment were low and thus, this issue does not raise a concern. In study P054-00 , approximately 99% randomized patients were included in the full analysis set. Outcomes and estimation LIPID LOWERING EFFECTS Study P020-02 Patients in P020-02 were randomized after a 4 week run-in period to one of the 3 treatment groups (MK-0524A, nicotinic acid or placebo) and after 4 weeks the dose was raised from nicotinic acid 1g to 2g in the MK-0524 and nicotinic acid groups until week 24. A  significantly  greater  reduction  in  LDL-C  was  observed  in  study  P020-02  in  the  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant group compared with placebo. The reduction in LDL-C of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant increased when the dose was increased from 1 g to 2 g nicotinic acid, in week 4, with the slope of reduction diminishing until week 24. Results based on the least square (LS) means (or medians) within each treatment group as well as the differences in LS mean (or medians) between MK-0524A and placebo for the primary and key secondary lipid endpoints are in the table below.

## P022-02

Patients in P022-02 were randomized after a 5 week washout and 2 week run-in period to MK-0524A 1g + 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg simvastatin, MK0524A alone, or simvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg alone. Doses were doubled after 4 weeks, except for the 2 highest dose groups.

This study showed further significant reduction in LDL-C by combining ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant 2g and simvastatin versus ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant 2g or simvastatin alone. A summary of the treatment  effects  expressed  in  LS  means  (or  medians)  for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  lipid endpoints are in the table below.

The most important secondary endpoints with respect to the increase of HDL-C and decrease of TG are  in  accordance  with  the  primary  endpoint.  In  study  P020-02,  the  HDL-C  levels  increased significantly 20.0 (17.7, 22.3) difference between MK-0524A vs placebo, and in study P022-02, with 4.1 (1.2, 6.9) difference between MK-0524A with pooled simvastatin 20 and 40 mg vs MK0524A. The levels of TG were significantly reduced.

In summary, both studies showed that the fixed combination of laroprirant and nicotinic acid reduces LDL-C and triglycerides and increase HDL-C. These results are in line with the known characteristics of  nicotinic  acid.  Comparison  between  laropiprant  and  nicotinic  acid  alone  indicates  that  the combination with laropiprant does not affect the effects of nicotinic acid on lipids, in particular the LDL-C  lowering  effect.  This  confirms  earlier  conclusions  from  the  pharmacodynamic  studies, especially study P-011. The co-administration of simvastatin showed greater reductions of LDL-C and TG values as well as the increase in HDL-C, in comparison with simvastatin monotherapy.

## FLUSHING

## P020-02

Study  P020-02  was  conducted  for  assessing  the  effect  on  the  acute  flushing  (in  addition  to  the assessment of the lipid lowering effects).

Evaluation of the primary endpoint - maximum GFSS categorized as none/mild, moderate, severe or extreme during the first week of treatment -  showed that administration of ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant results  in a  significant  less  moderate,  severe  and  extreme  flushing  compared  to  ER

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nicotinic acid. Patients taking the combination reported lower number of days per week, on which they experienced  moderate  to  severe  flushing  (GFSS ≥ 4)  in  comparison  with  ER  nicotinic  acid.  This resulted in lower study discontinuation due to flushing (10.2% in MK-0542A group vs 22.2% in ER nicotinic acid group). However, almost no patients discontinued treatment after week 16, which raises the question whether laropiprant is still efficacious after this period. No comparison has been made between  patients  who  stay  on  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  and  patients  who  have  discontinued treatment with laropiprant. Since flushing declines during long term treatment, the CHMP expressed a concern  that  the  long  term  efficacy  of  the  combination  remains  unproven.  Therefore,  a  study demonstrating the impact of long-term withdrawal of laropiprant on flushing symptoms in patients on a  stable  nicotinic  acid  maintenance  dose  will  be  performed.  This  has  been  noted  as  a  Follow  up measure in the Letter of undertaking.

MK-0524A = MK-0524A 1 g for 4 weeks followed by MK-0524A 2 g for 20 weeks. ER niacin 2 g = 2 x ER niacin 1 g tablet. P023-00 Study  P023-00  was  conducted  to  determine  the  effects  of  a  5  day  drug  holiday  period  on  acute flushing with ER nicotinic acid 2g/laropiprant 40 mg. Patients underwent a 4 week MK-0524A 1g runin phase, after which followed 4 weeks with MK-0524A 2g run-in period and then were treated with: 5 day drug holiday + MK0524A 2g; or 5 day drug holiday + ER-nicotinic acid 2g; or stayed on MK524A 2g  for another 2 weeks. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were significant in favour of MK-0542A (p&lt;0.01 in all tests). The maximum GFSS categorised as none/mild, moderate, severe and extreme during the first 7 days following the 5 day drug holiday was significantly lower in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant 2 g arm than in the ER nicotinic acid 2 g arm; the difference in the LS means of maximum GFSS was -0.6 (p=0.005).  The  percentage  of  patients  with  moderate  GFSS  was  29.8%  with  MK-0542A  2  g  and 40.9% with ER nicotinic acid 2g (p=0.004). However, only a 10% difference between each group in none/mild category was obtained (non/mild 70.2%, 59.1% and 82.5% for MK-0524A, ER nicotinic acid, and non-drug holiday group, respectively). Reliable discontinuation rates could not be obtained due to the short follow-up time. Nevertheless, considering the significant reduction in severe flushing observed after  drug-holiday,  results  of  the  study  support  the  proposed  posology  and  no  up-titrating from very low doses is needed after this period.

P054-00 After a 2 week run-in period, patients were randomized to NIASPAN TM followed by dose titration of nicotinic  acid  (0.5  g  every  4  weeks  to  final  2  g  after  12  weeks)  or  4  weeks  ER  nicotinic  acid 1g/laropiprant 20 mg raised after 4 weeks to ER nicotinic acid 2g/laropiprant 40 mg for a total of 16 weeks. The patients on the fixed combination of laropiprant and nicotinic acid were averagely on a higher nicotinic acid-dose that the NIASPAN TM patients. Evaluated were the number of days per week with moderate or greater GFSS (GFSS ≥ 4)  across  the treatment  period  and  secondarily,  the  number  of  days  per  week  with  moderate  or  greater  GFSS (GFSS ≥ 4) across weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 combined, and the number of days per week with moderate or greater GFSS (GFSS ≥ 4) across weeks 2-16.

Patients treated with MK-0542A experienced less flushing syndromes compared to ER nicotinic acid group,  measured  by  both,  the  primary  and  the  secondary  endpoints.  According  to  the  results, approximately  83%  of  the  group  using  MK-0524A  and  approximately  72%  of  the  group  using

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nicotinic  acid  alone  had ≤ 1  day  per  week  with  a  maximum  GFSS ≥ 4,  somewhat  questioning  the clinical  relevance  and  the  need  for  long  term  treatment.  Number  of  days  per  week  with  GFBS  or GFSBS score ≥ 4 followed the pattern of the GFSS score. Quality of life scores supported the primary endpoint,  as  the  FIQ  score  with  analyses  of  the  irritation/frustration  domain,  sleep  energy  domain, social domain favouring the use of MK-0524A.  Discontinuation due to flushing started to differ at week  8  with  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  already  being  on  the  highest  dose  at  week  4  and  ER nicotinic acid being at the 1.5 g dose at week 8. At week 16, 7.4% discontinued due to flushing with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant compared to 12.4% with ER nicotinic acid. However, considering the different dose regimens, overall discontinuation rates were the same between the two treatment groups (27% and 28.2%, respectively) due to other clinical AE (2.4% difference) and laboratory AE (0.8%). Regarding the conclusion that ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant also reduces the amount of aspirin/NSAIDS used to mitigate flushing, this has to be interpreted with caution, since these analyses have not been properly pre-specified and fewer patients used aspirin/NSAIDs in MK-0542A treatment group (11.3%) than in the ER nicotinic acid group (21.6%).

## · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No  separate  clinical  studies  have  been  performed  in  special  populations  during  the  phase  III programme. Analyses across subpopulations in all phase III studies were provided. Female and male patients  as  well  as  the  relevant  age  groups  have  been  appropriately  included  in  the  studies.  The combination  of  ER  nicotinic  acid  and  laropiprant  appears  to  be  effective  in  a  variety  of  adult populations including subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, regardless of the age, race, gender, baseline LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels. The modest influence of gender and age is not considered of major clinical significance.

Comparisons and analyses of results across the pivotal phase III studies P020-02, P022-02, P023-00 and P054-00 were provided. The proportion of females was greater in P022-02 (&gt;50%) than in the other studies (approximately 40%). The proportion of Hispanic patients was larger, and the proportion of Caucasian patients was smaller in the P054-00 trial than in the other studies. There was a significant number of patients &gt;65 years in each study. As patients in the NCEP high risk category were excluded from P022-02, there was a greater proportion of low risk patients in P022-02 than in P020-02. The proportion of patients  with  diabetes  was  similar  across  studies  with  the  exception  of  P022-02  from which diabetic patients were excluded. There was a considerable number of patients on concomitant statin use. Concomitant use of statins was higher in P020-02 and the combined extension than in the other studies. Consistent with the data from the individual studies comparing ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant to the nicotinic acid formulations, the incidence of patients discontinued due to flushing symptoms in the ER nicotinic  acid/NIASPAN™ group was significantly higher than in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant group.  This  reduction  of  NIF  with  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  compared  to  ER  nicotinic  acid  or NIASPAN™ was consistent across the subgroups defined by age, gender, race, and region. ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant was effective in a wide variety of adult patient populations with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, regardless of race, gender, baseline LDL-C, HDL-C and TG  or  age,  and  in  special  populations,  such  as  diabetics.  A  modest  effect  of  gender  and  age  was identified. The lipid effects of ER nicotinic acid 2 g/40 mg laropiprant were maintained over 52 weeks of treatment. · Clinical studies in special populations Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Clinical safety

Since the applied medicinal product is a fixed-dose combination of ER nicotinic acid and laropiprant, the  main  focus  of  the  safety  analysis  is  based  on  the  published  safety  profile  of  nicotinic  acid  and potential AEs identified in the presented preclinical and early clinical studies for laropiprant. Further emphasis  is  laid  on  the  safety  evaluation  of  the  co-administration  with  statins,  since  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant is intended for use as monotherapy as well as in coadministration.

Based on the literature data, the most common side effects of nicotinic acid are non-serious tolerability issues related to flushing and gastrointestinal effects. The AE of interest include increases in ALT or AST, increase in fasting serum glucose (FSG) or UA, and skeletal muscle effects. Nicotinic acid has also  been  associated  with  clinical  hepatotoxicity  in  rare  cases.  Nicotinic  acid  product  labelling recommends  frequent  monitoring  of  liver  function  tests.  Thus,  liver  function  tests  were  measured routinely in the current phase II and III studies. Consecutive elevations of AST or ALT of ≥ 3xULN and hepatitis-related clinical AE were analysed as of special interest.

The potential for AEs of special interest based on the extensive clinical experience with nicotinic acid and on the preclinical findings for laropiprant have been sufficiently determined and targeted in the safety assessment.

It has also been previously suggested that the concomitant use of statin and nicotinic acid increases the risk of skeletal muscle rare serious adverse events (SAE). Therefore, muscle safety was extensively monitored in the clinical trials presented. Increases in CK ≥ 10xULN with or without symptoms were analysed  as  AEs  of  special  interest.  There  is  little  clinical  trial  evidence  that  nicotinic  acid  causes myopathy  or  rhabdomyolysis  on  its  own,  or  that  it  potentiates  muscle  effects  of  statins  when  coadministered. Since nicotinic acid is known to cause small increases in FSG levels and in HbA1c in patients with diabetes,  glycemic  status  was  determined  at  baseline  as  normal,  impaired,  or  diabetic.  Effect  on glucose regulation was assessed by changes in FSG in all patients and changes in HbA1c in diabetics. Clinical and laboratory AEs related to glycemic control, along with the number of cases of new onset diabetes  and  worsening  of  diabetes,  were  analysed  as  AEs  of  special  interest.  Due  to  the  known, nicotinic  acid-related  gastrointestinal  side  effects,  patients  with  active  peptic  ulcer  disease  within  3 months of randomization were excluded from the study. The main potential AE for laropiprant based on preclinical studies was the off-target activity on the TP receptor. Activation of the TP receptor has been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro , thus TP antagonism  has  the  potential  to  inhibit  platelet  aggregation.  Potential  bleeding-related  AEs  were assessed through the routine monitoring. Prothrombin time was measured in study P020-02 and in the Phase II extension. In addition, the most consistent target organ (identified in mice, rats, and dogs) was the liver. All species studied with laropiprant had indications of changes in the liver at high exposures. Liver  changes  were  characterised  and  assessed  predominantly  as  increased  ALT.  In  all  phase  III studies and the long-term safety extensions, effects on liver, especially changes in ALT or AST, were evaluated as AEs of special interest. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Patient exposure

Assessment of safety profile was performed in the following ways:

- -from the individual pivotal studies P020-02, P022-02 and P054-00,
- -from a selection of patients from phase II studies who were on the finalized ER nicotinic acid 2 g/laropiprant 40 mg product for up to 1 year (phase C of the studies P011, P015 and P026),
- -from the above mentioned studies pooled (phase III and pooled phase C).

All randomized patients in the different safety population groups who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses, summarized and analysed according to the treatment they received. Study P023-00 was not included in the analysis due to unsuitable design. These pooled data are presented and compared across 3 treatment groups:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. all patients who were randomized to ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant across the phase III and phase II extensions regardless of other background lipid-modifying therapies (ER nicotinic acid/laropiprantexposed),
2. patients who took either ER nicotinic acid or NIASPAN™ (ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™);
3. patients who were randomized to simvastatin or placebo (simvastatin/placebo), and therefore lacking a general distinction in the use of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant alone or with a statin.

For ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant-exposed, 2538 patients dosed for a mean exposure of 115.6 days on drug.  For  ER  nicotinic  acid,  541  patients  dosed  for  a  mean  exposure  of  199.9  days  on  drug.    For NIASPAN™, 727 patients dosed for a mean exposure of 90.2 days. 338 patients  on  placebo  were dosed for a mean exposure of 186.3 days and 592 simvastatin patients dosed for a mean exposure of 78.3 days. For  the  long-term  (1-year)  safety  extensions  (Phase  C)  evaluation,  data  from  three  long-term extensions were pooled to provide 1 year safety data for ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant versus placebo as  monotherapy  or  co-administered  with  statins  and  other  lipid-modifying  agents.  Phase  B  results, which were also pooled for analysis, provide additional long-term safety experience with a higher dose of laropiprant (150 mg) coadministered with NIASPAN™ for up to 11 months. Overall Disposition of Patients MK-0524A Long Term Safety Pool (Phase C) Treatment (EXT 1) Phase C and Post-Study (EXT 1) completed study extension* pat. discont. * Includes those patients that had status of 'Patient Completed' A positive bias selection of patients to the safety extension pool has been acknowledged in the longterm  safety  assessment.  When  interpreting  the  data  from  the  long-term  extensions  it  has  to  be considered that patients agreeing to enter the extension are a selected group of patients who may or may not represent the safety profile of individuals randomized to the same treatments from the outset. Moreover, the number of patients from the phase C extension studies is relatively low. Nevertheless, comparison of phase B and C was discussed in order to give a better overview of long term safety, a higher  incidence  of  gastro-intestinal  AEs  and  discontinuation  due  to  gastro-intestinal  problems  is reported  with  higher  doses  of  laropiprant.  This  confirms  that  the  lower  discontinuation  rate  due  to flushing is partly offset by other side effects, in particular the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. No difference in AEs of special interest appears in either study phases. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Adverse events

The incidence of adverse events and drug-related adverse events was similar  between ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant  ER  nicotinic  acid/NIASPAN TM and  lower  in  the  simvastatin/placebo  group  with 62.6%,  63.3%  and  46.9%  of  patients  experiencing  AEs.  The  rate  of  discontinuation  due  to  AE  is highest  in  ER  nicotinic  acid/NIASPAN TM and  lowest  in  simvastatin/placebo,  however,  the  patients exposed to MK-0524A experienced of the most serious drug related adverse events.

As  expected,  the  number  (%)  of  patients  with  flushing  is  reduced  when  laropiprant  is  added  to nicotinic  acid  (12.3% vs 22.8%).  A  striking  group  of  adverse  events  were  in  the  gastro-intestinal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adverse events with a rate higher in ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant group compared with ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™ leading to discontinuation.

The most common specific AEs and the most common drug related AEs that occurred more frequently in patients taking ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant or ER nicotinic acid than in placebo patients included diarrhea within the gastrointestinal disorders, paraesthesia within nervous system disorders, pruritus within the skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and flushing within the vascular disorders.

Patients With No Adverse Experience Cardiac Disorders Eye Disorders Gastrointestinal Disorders General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions Infections And Infestations Injury, Poisoning And Procedural Complications Metabolism And Nutrition Disorders Musculoskeletal And Connective Tissue Disorders Nervous System Disorders Psychiatric Disorders Respiratory, Thoracic And Mediastinal Disorders Skin And Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Vascular Disorders Flushing Although a patient may have had two or more clinical adverse experiences, the patient is counted only once within a category. The same patient may appear in different categories. This table was run using a \"percent incidence\".  This means that a row will appear on this report only if one of the columns is greater than or equal to that percentage, after rounding. Myalgia  was  reported  with  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant,  but  the  incidence  rate  was  higher  in  the simvastatin/placebo group. The incidence of diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting was higher in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant group than in the other 2 treatment groups. Gout occurred rarely. Of interest  is  the  observation  of  a  higher  incidence  overall  of  gastrointestinal  AE  in  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant patients compared to ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™ and simvastatin/placebo groups. Although  the  distribution  and  frequency  of  the  relevant  specific  AEs  do  not  raise  an  immediate concern, this issue will be reflected in the Risk management plan. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The findings are in favour of the assumption that laropiprant has an acceptable safety profile and that its addition to nicotinic acid does not alter the safety profile significantly of nicotinic acid. The safety profile of ER nicotinic acid is comparable with that of NIASPAN™.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

Overall, five deaths occurred during the double-blind treatment periods in the phase III studies; three subjects in P022-02 study and one subject in P054-00 study. One death occurred during the doubleblind treatment periods in the phase II extension of P011 study. No deaths were reported for patients participating in the phase I or phase II base studies.

From the patients who died, four (out of 2548 patients=0.2%) were in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant group, one (out of 1268 patients=0.1%) was in the ER nicotinic acid group, and one died in an ongoing study, for which the treatment assignments were not unblinded at the time of analysis (study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

P024). No deaths were drug-related and all appeared to be associated with pre-existing factors, known coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD-equivalent risk conditions, or were due to suicide (one patient).

## Non-fatal serious adverse events

Overall, 115 patients experienced serious non-fatal AEs during the study programme, with ten patients with AEs assessed by the investigators as be possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug: eight patients (0.3%) in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant exposed treatment group, one patient (0.1%) in  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/NIASPAN™  group  and  one  patient  (0.1%)  in  the  simvastatin/placebo treatment pool.

Amongst  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  patients  with  drug  related  non-fatal  SAEs,  five  patients reported drug intolerance, spontaneous abortion, cholecystitis/cholelithiasis, unstable angina/flushing/ presyncope, extreme flushing, respectively, and three patients hypersensitivity reactions. The serious AEs of hypersensitivity and drug intolerance occurred shortly after starting the nicotinic acid 1 g/20 mg laropiprant dose. Other symptoms that were common in at least two of the four patients included urticaria, shortness of breath, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. The AE of acute cholecystitis and cholelithiasis,  was  considered  serious  and  drug-related  to  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  and  study therapy was discontinued after 91 days. The AE of presyncope (as a consequence of vasodilatation caused by the study drug) and unstable angina pectoris was probably related to study therapy while flushing was definitely related to study therapy.

The following AEs were pre-specified as AEs of special interest: AEs related to hepatic functions, muscle, and glycemic control.

In  study  P022-02,  the  SAE  of  transient  elevation  of  liver  enzymes  leading  to  acute  hepatitis  was observed  in  a  patient  taking  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant+simvastatin.  This  was  considered  by  the investigator to be definitely not related to study therapy. One other hepatitis-related AE occurred in phase III study P023-00, but similarly, it was not considered drug-related. Analysis by System Organ Class revealed no significant differences between the cardiovascular events in patients exposed and not exposed to ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant. In general, in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant vs ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™ group, the incidence of AEs was slightly higher in the group exposed to MK-0524A with vascular disorders (0.4% vs 0.0%), infection (0.4% vs 0.2%) and general disorders/administration site disorders (0.3 vs 0.0%), but not for gastrointestinal disorders (0.2 vs 0.4%). Additional data on safety will be obtained from other clinical studies currently ongoing. Only  a  small  number  of  SAEs  was  reported  during  the  use  of  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant combination and nicotinic acid alone. A slightly higher number of drug-related SAEs were apparent with the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant combination compared to nicotinic acid alone and placebo. A causal relationship could be attributed in the case of hypersensitivity reactions, but whether this is due to nicotinic acid or laropiprant remains cannot be established. Less than 2% patients in any treatment pool discontinued study due to an SAE. Adverse events of special interests Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic Safety

Liver function tests (LFTs) were measured routinely in all phase II and III studies and elevations of AST  or  ALT  of  &gt;3x  ULN  and  hepatitis-related  clinical  AE  were  pre-specified  as  AEa  of  special interest.  No  specific  signal  from  LFTs  has  been  identified  with  laropiprant  used  either  alone  or  coadministered  with  nicotinic  acid.  There  were  two  reports  of  hepatitis  in  the  entire  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant  development  programme,  neither  of  which  was  considered  drug  related,  both  had clear alternate causalities (acute alcohol intoxication and infectious mononucleosis). Incidences of any AEs classified as hepatobiliary disorders were low across all studies, and comparable between the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant and ER nicotinic acid groups.

Drug-related laboratory AEs of increased liver function tests (ALT and/or AST) occurred at a slightly higher rate with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant than either of the other 2 treatment groups (ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™  and  simvastatin/placebo).    Similarly,  the  incidence  rate  of  laboratory  AEs  of increased ALT and AST that led to discontinuation of therapy was slightly higher with ER nicotinic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acid/laropiprant (0.6% and 0.2%, respectively) compared to 0.2% and 0.1% for the simvastatin/placebo group and none for the ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™ group. Of the 25 (22 on the 2g dose) ALT and/or AST ≥ 3xULN elevations that occurred in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant treatment group, 10 were presumed to be drug-related. Most cases resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. The recommendation for LFT monitoring proposed in the SPC is considered adequate. Liver toxicity will be closely monitored in the post-marketing surveillance programme as stated in the Risk management plan.

## Muscle-Related Safety

ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant is intended for use alone or with statins, therefore a large proportion of patients  treated  with  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  in  the  pivotal  phase  III  and  long-term  safety extensions were also taking statins. Increase in CK ≥ 10xULN accompanied by unexplained muscle symptoms  as  AEs  of  special  interest  was  monitored,  as  this  is  a  widely  accepted  definition  of myopathy.

Of 2548 patients on ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant, 62.8% were concomitantly taking statins, 41.9% simvastatin,  12.4%  atorvastatin,  and  8.5%  others.  There  were  no  reports  of  rhabdomyolysis  in  the pivotal  phase  III  or  phase  II  extension  studies;  however,  MK-0524A  exposure  did  increase  the proportion  of  patients  with  elevated  CK ≥ 10x  ULN.  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  related  to increased  CK  was  highest  in  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  group  and  lowest  in  simvastatin/placebo group (2.0% and 0.7%, respectively) and a similar trend was observed for drug-related elevations in CK (1.2% and 0.3%). Two patients in the pooled studies reported myopathy; one in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant  group  and  one  in  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/  NIASPAN™  group.  Both  cases  were associated with unusual levels of physical activity. There was one serious and drug-related event of increased CK (12,780 IU/ml). Patient was not on statins and was hospitalized overnight for hydration and observation. The patient's CK was near normal eight days after discontinuing study medication. No apparent differences between the treatment groups regarding CK elevations could be identified and there were no statistically significant between-group differences in the exposure adjusted event rates. Muscle-related AEs will be monitored in the post-marketing use. Change in Glycemic Status Increases of approximately 4 mg/dL in FSG were consistently observed across all phase III and phase II extension studies in patients taking ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant. In study P020-02, patients in the ER nicotinic acid group also had a 4 mg/dL increase in FSG, indicating that the effects on glucose might be mediated by the nicotinic acid component. In diabetic patients, there was the same 4 mg/dL increase at the end of P020-02. There were only small increases in HbA1c (0.1%-0.3%) in diabetic patients treated with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant, ER nicotinic acid, and NIASPAN™, with similar effects across these treatment groups. Observed effects on blood glucose and HbA1c are comparable reported effects for other immediate release or ER forms of nicotinic acid. Of the 4258 patients without diabetes at baseline, 16 patients met the criteria for new onset diabetes, 12 (0.5%) in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant group, 3 (0.3%) in ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™ and 1 (0.1%) in the simvastatin/placebo group. There were no significant differences between groups based on analyses of crude or exposure adjusted rates. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Of the 488 patients with diabetes at baseline, 85 patients met the pre-defined definition of 'worsening of  diabetes', 54 (19.9%) in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant group, 29 (16.7%) in the ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™ group and 2 (4.6%) in simvastatin/placebo group.

The data do not raise a specific concern beside the known nicotinic acid effects. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients treated with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant should be observed closely as adjustment of diet or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.

## · Laboratory findings

The  incidence  rates  of  laboratory  drug  events  and  drug-related  laboratory  events  were  comparable between  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  and  nicotinic  acid/NIASPAN TM group  with  the  lowest incidence  in  the  simvastatin/placebo  group.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  due  to laboratory adverse experiences was highest with ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant (1.3%), compared to ER nicotinic  acid/NIASPAN™  (0.7%)  and  simvastatin/placebo  (0.4%).  The  incidence  of  drug-related laboratory adverse experiences leading to discontinuation was highest with ER nicotinic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acid/laropiprant (1.1%), followed by ER nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™ (0.4%) and simvastatin/placebo groups (0.2%).

Specific laboratory AE by test category were assessed in pooled treatment groups. Not all tests were performed in all studies. The incidence of laboratory AEs was highest in the Blood Chemistry Test category,  with  similar  incidence  rates  between  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  and  ER  nicotinic acid/NIASPAN™  pools,  compared  to  a  lower  incidence  in  the  simvastatin/placebo  pool.  The  AE occurring with the highest incidence in this category were increased ALT, AST, blood uric acid, CK, and FSG.

In  summary,  the  evaluation  of  laboratory  AEs  of  special  interest  revealed  that  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant  group  had  the  highest  incidence  rates,  but  the  absolute  numbers  were  low  and  no specific  laboratory  AE  emerged.  The  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  group  had  the  highest  rate  of elevated CK levels ≥ 10x ULN, but incidence was very low and absolute conclusions cannot be drawn. Difference in clinical events is not apparent because rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are low. Exposure to laropiprant did not significantly affect glucose levels, whereas the data confirmed that a slight increase may occur after nicotinic acid. Platelet count and prothrombin time were not affected, but  laropiprant  may  affect  bleeding  time  at  higher  concentrations,  however,  a  potential  risk  is  not apparent from the phase II studies. Therefore, bleeding incidences will be followed up in the PSUR cycles.

## · Safety in special populations

A slightly higher percentage of older patients in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant and simvastatin/placebo  groups  reported  AEs  and/or  discontinued  treatment  due  to  the  AEs.  A  slightly higher percentage of female than male across all treatment groups reported and discontinued due to AEs. Small differences are present between races, but do not give any reason to exclude a population from treatment with the product.

Patients  with  impaired  renal  function  (creatinine ≥ 2  mg/dL)  or  nephrotic  syndrome  were  excluded from Phase II and III clinical trials. Therefore, no data were provided and this is adequately reflected in the SPC.

The safety and efficacy of the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant tablet has not been studied in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Patients with  chronic hepatobiliary or hepatic disease were excluded from all Phase  II  and  III  studies.  As  with  other  nicotinic  acid  products,  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  is contraindicated  in  patients  with  significant  or  unexplained  hepatic  dysfunction.  This  is  adequately reflected in the SPC.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

In  clinical  studies,  laropiprant  did  not  significantly  alter  the  pharmacokinetics  of  midazolam, simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptives or rosiglitazone providing further in vivo evidence for  a  low  propensity  for  perpetrating  drug  interactions  with  substrates  of  CYP3A4,  CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and human p-glycoprotein. Multiple doses of laropiprant increased the plasma concentration of a metabolite of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam. These results suggest that laropiprant might be an inhibitor of UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 in vitro and that there may be interactions with compounds that are  predominantly  metabolized  by  UGT2B4  or  UGT2B7.  Laropiprant  concentrations  are  not meaningfully  altered  by  clarithromycin  suggesting  that  strong  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  do  not  alter laropiprant pharmacokinetics.

No  specific  evaluation  of  safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  and  other  interactions  has  been provided. However, general pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been extensively investigated and possible mechanisms of interaction discussed. In addition, these issues are adequately reflected in the proposed SPC.

Nevertheless,  regarding  statins,  only  investigations  on  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant and simvastatin were provided, while specific information on atorvastatin, fluvastatin,  pravastatin  and  rosuvastatin  is  missing.  Subsequently,  clinical  and  laboratory  adverse

There were no ≥ 3xULN increases in ALT/AST or ≥ 10xULN increases in CK  among  patients  taking  simvastatin  80 mg,  atorvastatin  80 mg,  or  rosuvastatin  40  or  80 mg. However, the results should be viewed with caution due to the relatively small number of patients in each  of  the  statin  subgroups.  The  incidence  of  clinical  and  laboratory  adverse  experiences  and discontinuations was comparable for patients in the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant, ER nicotinic acid /NIASPAN™,  and  simvastatin/placebo  groups,  who  were  also  taking  80 mg  of  simvastatin  or atorvastatin. Patients taking rosuvastatin showed the highest incidence of laboratory AE, followed by patients  taking  lovastatin.  More  patients  taking  rosuvastatin  discontinued  due  to  laboratory  AEs (6.6%) than did patients taking any other statin including simvastatin (1.4%) and atorvastatin (1.0%). The clinical and laboratory adverse experience summaries for patients in the highest dose statin groups was  similar  in  the  other  statin  group  compared  to  the  80  mg  simvastatin  or  atorvastatin  group. Additional  safety  data  from  patients  taking  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  with  rosuvastatin  will  be provided  based  on  new  long  term  clinical  trials  with  patients  administered  rosuvastatin  and  ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant.

· Discontinuation due to adverse events Two primary reasons for discontinuation in both ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant and ER nicotinic acid were flushing symptoms associated with the test product (7.2% and 16.6%, respectively) and clinical AEs  (9.7%  and  7.0%,  respectively). It is apparent that flushing is an important factor for discontinuation, favouring the use of ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant compared to nicotinic acid alone (4.5% vs 8.8%). The lower discontinuation rate due to flushing in the nicotinic acid/laropiprant group in comparison with the nicotinic acid group is partly compensated by the occurrence of AEs related to laropiprant, in particular  gastrointestinal  AEs  (2.5% vs 1.5%)  and  laboratory  AEs  (1.3% vs 0.7%),  although  the overall incidence is low. The distribution and frequency of the relevant specific AEs do not raise an immediate concern, and most of these effects are accounted for in the Risk management plan. · Post marketing experience There is currently no post-marketing experience with the use of this fixed dose combination. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

| Abnormal liver function tests | Routine pharmacovigilance Monitor reports of abnormal liver function tests in ongoing and planned clinical trials | Labelling - EU SPC 4.2 Posology and method of administration Use in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Use  of  Trevaclyn  in  patients  with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied. Like other nicotinic acid medicinal products,  Trevaclyn  is  contraindicated  in patients with significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hepatic effects

Switching from immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid to Trevaclyn has not been studied. However, cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic  necrosis,  have  occurred  in  patients who have switched from immediate-release nicotinic  acid  to  long-acting  nicotinic  acid at equivalent doses. Therefore, patients switching from immediate-release nicotinic acid to Trevaclyn should be initiated at the 1000 mg/20 mg dose.

Trevaclyn  should  be  used  with  caution  in patients who consume substantial quantities of  alcohol  and/or  have  a  past  history  of liver disease.

Like other lipid-lowering therapies, nicotinic acid medicinal products have been associated with abnormal liver function tests (see section 4.8). Transaminase elevations were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy.

Liver function tests are recommended before  initiation,  every  6  to  12 weeks  for the first year, and periodically (e.g. semi-annually) thereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormalities have  resolved.  Should  an  increase  in  ALT or  AST  of ≥ 3 X ULN persist,  reduction  of dose or withdrawal of Trevaclyn is recommended.

## Further

As with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, patients with a history of jaundice, hepato-biliary disorder or peptic ulcer should be observed closely

Effect on skeletal muscle Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses ( ≥ 1000 mg/day) of nicotinic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) Physicians contemplating combined therapy with statins and Trevaclyn should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and when the dose of either medicinal product is increased. Periodic serum CK should be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Caution should be exercised in patients |

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The active substances and medicinal product have been adequately described. Excipients used in the formulation  of  the  medicinal  product  and  the  manufacturing  process  selected  are  typical  for  tablet formulations. The results of the tests indicate that the active substance and the medicinal product can be  reproducibly  manufactured  and  therefore  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform performance. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues, which have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve it as a Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The pharmacodynamic properties of nicotinic acid have been investigated previously and confirm its lipid  lowering  effects  observed  in  clinical  environment.  The  flushing  effect  of  nicotinic  acid  is believed to be mediated by the compound's ability to induce the generation of PGD2, which following its interaction with DP1 receptors results in vasodilatation observed as undesirable effect of flushing. The primary pharmacodynamic studies conducted with laropiprant provided adequate evidence that the drug is a high affinity antagonist of DP1 receptors and exerts an antagonistic action with weaker affinity  at  the  thromboxane  A2  receptor  (TP).  Laropiprant  antagonises  the  vasodilatory  effect  of nicotinic acid via inhibitory action on DP1. The oxidative metabolites of laropiprant show markedly lower  affinities  and  potencies  at  the  DP 1 and  TP  receptors,  which  are  unlikely  to  contribute  to  the clinical effects. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pharmacokinetic investigations of laropiprant showed that absorption after the oral administration to  dogs  and  rats  is  rapid  and  the  drug  is  distributed  mainly  in  the  gastrointestinal  system.  Plasma protein binding is &gt;99% in most investigated species. Laropiprant is metabolised via oxidation  and glucuronidation,  with  the  acyl  glucuronide  being  the  major  metabolite.  The  potential  interactions between nicotinic acid and laropiprant investigated in toxicokinetis studies in rats did not show any clinical relevance in humans. Laropiprant is excreted mainly via faeces and urine.

Low oral toxicity of laropiprant and nicotinic acid was seen in single dose toxicity studies in mice and rats.  The  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  other  species  showed  treatment-related  effects  on liver  at  all  doses.  Further  evaluation  of  the  potential  hepatic  adverse  effects  was  investigated  in  the clinical programme and relevant statements were included in the SPC.  Based on the genotoxixity tests performed with laropiprant and on the experience from the long term use of nicotinic acid, both are considered  to  be  void  of  genotoxic  potential.  Carcinogenicity  studies  conducted  in  rats  and  mice confirmed  that  there  is  no  safety  concern  for  humans.    Laropiprant  was  tested  in  a  reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits and there was no indication of a risk for human safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  environmental  risk  of  laropiprant  was  assessed  and  there  is  no  indication  of  a  risk  for bioaccumulation.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  the  method  used  to  determine  log  KOC  as insufficient and a the company committed to conducting additional tests to estimate Koc of laropiprant in soil.

## Efficacy

Studies confirm that the fixed combination of laropiprant and ER nicotinic acid reduces LDL-C and triglycerides and increases HDL-C values. These results are in line with the known characteristics of nicotinic acid. Furthermore, the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant combination produced significant lipidaltering  efficacy  relative  to  placebo.  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  co-administered  with  simvastatin was more effective than either of the individual components with respect to altering levels of LDL-C, HDL-C,  and  TG  without  inducing  deleterious  effects  on  other  lipid  parameters.  ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant was effective in a variety of adult patient populations with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia, regardless of race, gender, baseline LDL-C, HDL-C and TG or age and in special populations such as diabetics. The across trial analyses show that the lipid effects were maintained over 52 weeks of treatment in the extensions phase population.

As expected, the number (%) of patients reporting flushing-related AEs is smaller when laropiprant is added to nicotinic acid. One of the main safety issues is whether the addition of laropiprant in this fixed combination leads to an increase in the number and severity of other AEs that might already be associated with nicotinic acid. Of significance are the gastrointestinal AEs showing a higher incidence rate  in  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  group  than  in  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/NIASPAN TM group. However,  the  majority  of  these  events  were  non-serious.  Incidence  of  AEs  related  increased  liver function tests was higher with ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant and the product is therefore contraindicated  in  patients  with  liver  function  disorders.  In  addition,  a  follow-up  requirement regarding liver tests monitoring is included in the Risk management plan.

Considering the second primary endpoint, the effect of the ER nicotinic acid/laropiprant on nicotinic acid  induced  flushing,  reduction  of  these  symptoms  was  achieved  by  addition  of  laropiprant  to nicotinic acid. A dose-dependent response was noted between 5 mg and 37.5 mg when 1 g nicotinic acid was given daily, but not in the higher dose ranges (up to 150 mg laropiprant). With 2 g nicotinic acid, the dose-dependency was observed in the range 10 mg-37.5 mg laropiprant. A minimal effective dose has not been established, but the pharmacological effect may still be present at doses lower than 20  mg.  Thus,  the  combination  of  20  mg  laropiprant  and  1  g  nicotinic  acid  has  been  chosen  as  the initiation dosage. The dosage can be doubled if indicated. The results of the clinical programme  of four pivotal studies indicated that ER  nicotinic acid/laropiprant  shows  less  flushing  in  the  acute  phase  than  the  monotherapy  with  nicotinic  acid. Important evaluation factor is the number of patients free of flushing and the contribution of flushing to  therapy  discontinuation. On both primary and secondary endpoints, fewer days with moderate to severe flushing were experienced with the fixed combination than with nicotinic acid monotherapy. The combination product was also effective in the chronic phase and fewer patients discontinued the treatment  due  to  flushing.  Reduction  in  severe  flushing  was  observed  after  a  period  of  temporary discontinuation  of  therapy,  suggesting  no  need  for  up-titrating  from  very  low  doses.  The  effect  of long-term  withdrawal  of  laropiprant  on  flushing  symptoms  in  patients  continuing  nicotinic  acid  is under investigation. Safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

Only  a  small  number  of  SAE  were  reported.  A  slightly  higher  number  of  drug-related  SAEs  were apparent  with  the  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  combination  compared  to  nicotinic  acid  alone  and placebo. A causal relationship could be attributed in the case of hypersensitivity reactions, but whether this is due to nicotinic acid or laropiprant remains could not be established. These data originate from a small population of patients and results of the ongoing clinical trial will be reported to the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  specific  laboratory  AE  emerged.  Any  differences  in  the  observed  incidence  rates  result  from differences  in  dose  regimen.  Safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  is  adequately  reflected  in  the SPC.

With regards to the skeletal and muscle related safety, exposure is not sufficient to come to a definite conclusion due to the low occurrence of this AE. The limited data indicate that there is no specific increase in muscle related AEs for the fixed dose combination. Nevertheless, there is a requirement to specifically monitor muscle related AEs during post marketing surveillance.

Exposure to laropiprant did not significantly affect glucose levels, whereas the data confirmed that a slight increase may occur after nicotinic acid administration. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients treated  with  ER  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  should  be  observed  closely  as  adjustment  of  diet  or hypoglycaemic therapy may be necessary.

Elderly  patients  showed  higher  incidence  of  AEs  and  higher  discontinuation  rate  due  to  AEs,  but differences between the treatment arms are small and no specific dose recommendations are necessary. The  minor  differences  between  races  and  between  genders  do  not  give  any  reason  to  exclude  a population from treatment with the product.

The Applicant performed a user consultation testing on the package leaflet. The results demonstrated that participants of the study were able to find and understand key safety messages. In conclusion, the package leaflet meets the requirements set for user testing.

In  principle,  no  specific  and  significant  safety  issues  have  been  identified  in  the  clinical  studies. Furthermore, outstanding issues will be addressed in the ongoing studies with high number of patients. Data related to hepatic, muscle, or bleeding safety profile of the combination product will be evaluated on a large scale. The findings are in favour of the assumption that laropiprant has an acceptable safety profile and its addition to nicotinic acid does not significantly alter the safety profile of nicotinic acid. It is concluded that  the  improved  tolerability  of  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  combination  leading  to  an  enhanced treatment and dosage compliance without compromising the established nicotinic acid effects has been successfully demonstrated. As a commitment, a study will be performed demonstrating the impact on flushing  symptoms  of  long-term  withdrawal  of  laropiprant  in  patients  on  a  stable  nicotinic  acid maintenance dose to establish the need for the continued laropiprant use. The risk/balance ration is considered acceptable providing the post-authorisation commitments are fulfilled. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these concerns. · User consultation Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Risk-benefit assessment

The  main  benefit  of  this  fixed  dose  combination  therapy  was  demonstrated  when  evaluation  of nicotinic acid induced flushing in the acute phase (week 1), chronic phase (week 2 and longer) and after a temporary treatment discontinuation showed that the addition of laropiprant to nicotinic acid can be considered effective in reducing the occurrence and severity of flushing symptoms. This is also reflected in the lower flushing related discontinued rates in the combination product group.

The  need  for  a  long-term  nicotinic  acid  treatment  alternative  in  form  of  a  fixed  dose  combination containing laropiprant to reduce flushing seems justified, since nicotinic acid is a life-time treatment. The impact of long-term withdrawal of laropiprant in patients continuing treatment with nicotinic acid on the flushing symptoms was not adequately demonstrated. Therefore, as a follow-up measure, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP requested a commitment to further investigate whether withdrawal of laropiprant after 12-24 weeks  of  therapy  has  a  negative  impact  potentially  leads  to  further  nicotinic  acid  treatment discontinuation due to flushing. Until then, the SPC states that efficacy has not been established for period of treatment longer than 24 weeks.

No major safety risks can be attributed to the addition of laropiprant to nicotinic acid on the basis of the  clinical  data  submitted.  Gastrointestinal  adverse  events  may  occur  more  frequently,  as  well  as increased liver enzymes and creatinine values, but the causal relationship was not proven. The current experience with the use of this fixed dose combination is limited and will be closely monitored during the post-marketing phase.

The  risk-benefit  ratio  for  the  fixed  dose  combination  of  nicotinic  acid/laropiprant  was  considered favourable, provided the company performs the post authorisation follow up measures and reports to the CHMP within the foreseen timeframes.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that

· pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns · no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Trevaclyn  in  the  treatment  of  dyslipidaemia, particularly  in  patients  with  combined  mixed  dyslipidaemia  (characterised  by  elevated  levels  of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol) and in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
