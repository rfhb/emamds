## 1. Introduction

On January 13 th  2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Kaftrio in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Kaftrio is currently indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Kaftrio initially obtained a marketing authorisation in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation in 2020. In 2021, the indication was extended to patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for patients who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recently, the indication was extended to children with CF aged 6 years through 11.

Elexacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR correctors and facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR, leading to an increase in the amount of CFTR protein, while ivacaftor increases channel gating of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor results in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR chloride transport.

Within this procedure, the MAH submitted the final study results of Study VX20-445-126 (Study 126). This was a Phase 3b, open-label study designed to evaluate additional endpoints related to quality of life beyond those evaluated in the pivotal studies (i.e., cough, daily activity, and sleep quality) using wearable technology in CF patients aged 12 years and older.

The MAH stated that Study VX20-445-126 (Study 126) is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

In Study VX20-445-126, the study drug was administered orally as 2 ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg tablets in the morning and 1 tablet of IVA 150 mg in the evening. This pharmaceutical formulation and posology are authorised for patients aged 6 and older, weighing 30 kg or more and thereby also for the study population aged 12 years and older.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: Study VX20-445-126 (Study 126), a Phase 3b Open-label Study Evaluating the Effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA on Cough and Physical Activity in CF Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older Who Are Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation and a Minimal Function Mutation (F/MF).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry.

## Sample size

Assuming a standard deviation of 1 for the log ratio of cough frequency post-baseline versus baseline, a sample size of approximately 100 subjects will provide 95% confidence intervals (which represents the estimation precision) as shown in Table 2 at various observed percent reductions in cough frequency (30%, 40%, and 50%), after accounting for 20% missing. Note: percent reduction equals 100% × (1- ratio of cough frequency post-baseline vs. baseline).

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable, as this is an open-label single arm trial. However, subjects and their parent/legal guardian were not informed of their study-related spirometry, cough, activity, and sleep quality (from the actigraphy sensor) results during the Treatment Period.

## Statistical Methods

## Analysis sets

All Subjects Set - all subjects who were enrolled. This analysis set was used for all individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified.

Full Analysis Set (FAS)- all enrolled subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS was used in efficacy analyses.

Safety Set - all subjects who had received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set was used for all safety analyses.

## Efficacy analyses

For efficacy analyses, baseline cough was defined as the geometric mean of valid cough measurements before the first dose of study drug. Baseline step count, other activity endpoints, and other sleep endpoints measured by actigraphy were defined as the average of valid weekly interval measurements prior to the first dose of study drug. Baseline PSQI, ESS, and CFQ-R were defined as the Day 1 assessment.

The method of analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints are shown in Table 3.

Secondary endpoint Absolute change from baseline in total step count per day to the average of Week 8 through Week 12.

Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an improvement in total step count per day at average of Week 8 through Week 12, with an LS mean absolute change from baseline of 637.56 steps (95% CI: 298.16, 976.96).

## Exploratory endpoints

The absolute change from baseline in activity patterns to the average of Week 8 through Week 12, as measured by the actigraphy watch is summarised in Table 9. The other endpoints 'absolute change from baseline in best 6-minute effort (B6ME) per day to the average of Week 8 through Week 12' and 'absolute change from baseline in preferred cadence to the average of Week 8 through Week 12' are shown in Table 9 as well. For most activity pattern endpoints, scores improved with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment or remained more or less similar.

Notes: The daily assessment was considered as valid if there were at least 10 howrs of valid wear data while awake on that day. For each weekly interval, the value per day was calculated by averaging valid daily assessments in that week, provided that there were valid daily assessments on at least 3 weekdays amd 1 weekend day. Baseline value is defined as the average of valid weekly interval measurements before the first dose of study drug.

95% CI were estimated as part of an ad hoc analysis.

The absolute change from baseline in sleep quality to the average of Week 8 through Week 12, as measured by the actigraphy watch is shown in Table 10. There were no notable changes in the validated sleep quality endpoints.

## Adverse events

Almost all patients (92.6%) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE; Table 14). All AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Two patients (2.5%) had serious adverse events (SAEs), both of which were considered possibly related to study drug. There were no life-threatening AEs or deaths.

Sowce: Table 14.3.1.1

Notes: AEs were coded using MedDRA version 25.0. A subject with multiple events within a category was counted only once with the maximum severity in that category according to the order, where the order of decreasing severity is: 1. Death, 2. Life-threatening, 3. Severe, 4. Moderate, 5. Mild, 6. Missing. When summarizing number of events, a subject with multiple events within a category was coumted multiple times in that category. When summarizing number and % of subjects, a subject with multhiple events within a category was counted only once in that category. An AE with relationship missing was counted as Related. Subjects with Grade 3/4/5 AEs include the *Severe\", *Life-threatening' and *Death' categories. If subjects

- only had one event which has missing severity, then the subject was summarized in the *Missing\" category. When summarizing number of subjects with related AEs and SAEs, AEs with relationship of related, possibly related, and missing were coumted.

## Common adverse events

AEs that occurred in ≥5% of patients are summarised by preferred term (PT) in Table 15. The most common adverse events were headache (17.3%), COVID-19 (16%), nasopharyngitis (16%) and diarrhoea (13.6%).

AE: adverse event; ELX: elexacaftor; IVA: ivacaftor, n: size of subsample; N: total sample size; PT: Prefenred Term; TEZ: tezacaftor

Notes: AEs were coded using MedDRA version 25.0. A subject with multiple events within a category (Overall or PI) was coumted only once in that category.

## Severity of adverse events

All AEs were mild (58%) or moderate (34.6%) in severity. No patients had severe AEs, life-threatening AEs, or an AE that resulted in death.

## Relationship of adverse events

There were 10 (12.3%) patients with related AEs and 28 (34.6%) patients with possibly related AEs. AEs at least possibly related to study drug were most frequently reported for system organ class (SOC) gastro-intestinal disorders (19.8%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (9.9%) and skinand subcutaneous tissue disorders (9.9%).

The most common (&gt;3%) at least possibly related AEs were diarrhoea (4.9%), rash (4.9%), headache (4.9%), abdominal pain (3.7%), abdominal pain upper (3.7%) and sputum increased (3.7%).

## Deaths and other serious adverse events

There were no life-threatening AEs or deaths.

Two patients (2.5%) had serious adverse events (SAEs; anxiety and pancreatitis), both of which were assessed by the investigator as moderate in severity and possibly related to study drug. The SAE of anxiety resulted in study drug discontinuation and the SAE was considered resolved.

## Study drug discontinuation

There were 2 (2.5%) patients with AEs resulting in discontinuation. One patient (1.2%) discontinued study drug due to a SAE of anxiety, and one patient discontinued study drug (IVA only) due to AEs of ALT and AST increased.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Elevated transaminase events

Three (3.7%) patients had elevated transaminase events, all of which were assessed by the investigator as mild or moderate in severity. One (1.2%) patient had an elevated transaminase event that led to study drug interruption and one (1.2%) subject had an elevated transaminase event that led to treatment discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rash events

Seven (8.6%) patients had at least 1 of any rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in severity; none were serious. Three subjects had rash events that led to treatment interruption, all of whom resumed study drug. There were no study drug discontinuations due to rash events.

By sex, 3 (8.1%) female patients and 4 (9.1%) male subjects had rash events. Of the female patients who had rash events, all 3 (21.4%) had concomitant use of hormonal therapy.

## Clinical laboratory evaluation

## Chemistry

Elevated transaminase events - are described above.

Creatinine kinase (CK) -AEs of blood CK increased were reported in 1 (1.2%) patient.

Other chemistry parameters There were no clinically significant findings in mean value in other nonLFT chemistry parameters.

## Vital signs

There were no trends observed in the vital signs or ECG parameters. No patients had AEs related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac disorders.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Design and conduct

With this article 46 procedure, the MAH presented the final study results of Study VX20-445-126 (Study 126). This was a Phase 3b, open-label study designed to evaluate additional endpoints related to quality of life beyond those evaluated in the pivotal studies (i.e., cough, daily activity, and sleep quality) using wearable technology in CF patients aged 12 years and older. Study 126 is a stand-alone study. No changes to the current product information for ELX/TEZ/IVA have been proposed.

The single-arm trial design and lack of definition of a minimal important clinical difference (MCID) in CF for the main clinical endpoints hamper the interpretation of obtained results.

The investigated dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA is identical to the registered posology for the study population.

## Results

## Efficacy

A total of 81 patients enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 79 (97.5%) patients completed study drug treatment. The median age at baseline was 24.6 years, with 24 patients (29.6%) &lt;18 years of age. At baseline, the geometric mean cough frequency per day was 241.3 coughs per day, and the mean step count was 5278.63 steps per day.

Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 12 years of age and older with F/MF genotypes resulted in a 91.7% (95% CI: 89.2%, 93.6%) reduction in cough frequency from baseline to the average of Week 8 through Week 12. This resembles a substantial reduction from approximately 24 coughs per hour to less than 1 per hour, which is considered clinically relevant.

Subgroup analysis by age (i.e. adolescents 12-18 years vs. adults ≥18 years) have not been presented. In line with previous procedures for ELX/TEZ/IVA, it is acceptable to pool results for adolescents and adults and no separate analysis per age group is requested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 12 years of age and older with F/MF genotypes improved the secondary endpoint total step count, with an LS mean absolute change from baseline 637.56 steps (95% CI: 298.16, 976.96). It is acknowledged that it is uncertain whether this improvement is clinically relevant, as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for step count has been established in a chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD) but not, to date, in CF. The differences between the two populations, e.g. in mean age and concomitant diseases, do not allow for an interpretation of the relevance based on the validation in COPD patients.

The other endpoints showed limited (activity patterns) or no notable changes (sleep quality endpoints) in the quality of life endpoints as measured by the actigraphy watch. In contrast, the patient reported outcomes as measured by questionnaires (sleep related questionnaire PSQI and ESS; and the vitality and physical functioning domains of CFQ-R) suggest some improvements with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. However, the study was not designed to draw firm conclusions based on these exploratory endpoints.

## Safety

No new safety concerns were identified. Almost all patients (92.6%) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE). All AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Two patients (2.5%) had serious adverse events (SAEs), both of which were considered possibly related to study drug. There were no life-threatening AEs or deaths The data related to AEs of special interest rash events and transaminase elevations were consistent with prior experience. ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated with a low rate of treatment discontinuations. Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

## Conclusion

Based on final results of Study 126, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA reduced the cough frequency and seems to increase the activity as measured by step count. The clinical relevance of most quality-of-life endpoints, including step count, is uncertain as no MCID was defined. No new safety concerns were identified. Overall, it is agreed with the Applicant that the benefit-risk of ELX/TEZ/IVA remains positive, and no update to the product information is deemed necessary.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The benefit-risk evaluation of Kaftrio remains positive.
