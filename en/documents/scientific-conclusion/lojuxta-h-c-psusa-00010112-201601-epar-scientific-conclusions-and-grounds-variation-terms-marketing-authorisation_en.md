## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lomitapide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Regarding diarrhoea and dehydration, cumulatively there were six cases (including two serious cases) of dehydration and all these cases also reported diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is a known effect of lomitapide and it is known that diarrhoea can result in serious dehydration which, as described in the two serious cases, can sometimes lead to hospitalisation. Since patients may use lomitapide for a long period, gastrointestinal effects including diarrhoea or vomiting (which both occur very commonly among lomitapide users) may also persist for a long period and hence lomitapide users are at increased risk of developing dehydration. Although dehydration may be an indirect effect of lomitapide use and related to other gastrointestinal effects of lomitapide, the MAH's proposal to include this safety information in the product information is accepted since healthcare professionals and patients should become aware of the risk of dehydration with lomitapide use.

Regarding the signal myalgia/myopathy, the MAH provided further information on the reported nonserious muscle related events of which the majority concerned myalgia (68 out of the 120 cases reported). Due to existence of reports with probable causality, especially in view of positive dechallenge and the fact that the reaction was observed also in clinical trials for one of the indications (elevated LDL), it is considered likely that lomitapide might cause myalgia also in patients with HoFH. Therefore, the MAH's proposal to include this safety information in the product information is agreed.

Although the number of reported alopecia cases is rather low overall, it should be taken into account that there might be considerable underreporting for this non-serious adverse event. There are three conclusive cases with positive dechallenge and a potential mechanism exists through which lomitapide might cause alopecia i.e. malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins. Therefore, the MAH's proposal to include this ADR in the product information is endorsed. It is agreed this should be considered an identified, albeit non-important risk.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing lomitapide were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lomitapide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lomitapide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
