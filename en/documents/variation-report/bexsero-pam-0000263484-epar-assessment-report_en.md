## 1. Introduction

On 28 March 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Bexsero, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.

The present submission includes the Clinical Study Report for study 212458 conducted with EU licensed products to assess the safety, effectiveness and immune response of meningococcal combined ABCWY vaccine when administered to healthy adults (Phase I) and to healthy adolescents and adults (Phase II). Bexsero and Menveo were administered in the study as a comparator vaccine.

Study 212458 was not conducted in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan for Bexsero or Menveo.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The current indications for these vaccines in EU are following:

Bexsero is indicated for active immunization of individuals from 2 months of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B.

Menveo (MenACWY vaccine) is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study 212458, A Phase I/II, randomised, controlled study to assess the safety, effectiveness and immune response of meningococcal combined ABCWY vaccine when administered to healthy adults (Phase I) and to healthy adolescents and adults (Phase II) is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Study interventions administered in the study are MenABCWY-2Gen low dose, MenABCWY-2Gen high dose , placebo (saline), MenACWY (Menveo) and MenB (Bexsero). All the interventions were administered via intramuscular injection.

The current vaccine formulation of Bexsero is based on 3 proteins: i) factor H binding protein (fHbp), ii) Neisseria adhesion A (NadA) and iii) Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) or 287. The fHbp protein has been combined with the accessory protein GNA2091 (936), and the 287 protein has been combined with GNA1030 (953), to create 2 fusion proteins. In addition, the vaccine also contains OMV (with Porin A [porA] antigen) derived from the New Zealand epidemic strain.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study number 212458: A Phase I/II, randomised, controlled study to assess the safety, effectiveness and immune response of meningococcal combined ABCWY vaccine when administered to healthy adults (Phase I) and to healthy adolescents and adults (Phase II).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neisseria meningitidis infections causing invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are an important public health concern worldwide due to the substantial morbidity and mortality they cause, as well as the transmissibility of these infections. Ninety percent of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia are caused by only 5 N. meningitidis serogroups: A, B, C, W and Y.

In January 2013, a centralised marketing authorisation in European Union (EU) was granted for Bexsero for use in individuals from 2 months of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B.

In March 2010, a centralised marketing authorisation in European Union (EU) was granted for Menveo for use in individuals from 11 years of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y. In April 2012, an extension of indication was granted to include children from 2 to 10 years of age inclusive.

GSK is currently developing a MenABCWY combination vaccine intended to protect against IMD caused by all 5 meningococcal serogroups.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study number 212458: A Phase I/II, randomised, controlled study to assess the safety, effectiveness and immune response of meningococcal combined ABCWY vaccine when administered to healthy adults (Phase I) and to healthy adolescents and adults (Phase II).

## Description

The early clinical development plan consisted of a seamless Phase I/II study. The study was conducted at 54 sites in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Turkey and United States. The firsttime-in-human, Phase I part of this study was conducted in healthy adults in a dose-escalating fashion with 2 formulations of the investigational MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine, and was served as a safety lead-in to the Phase II study part.

The Phase I safety lead-included 4 study groups (randomised 3:1), with a staggered enrolment (16 participants initially followed by 16 participants later) of a total of 32 participants.

| Study groups      | Study intervention(s)                 | Blinding         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| ABCWY low dose    | MenABCWY-2Gen in a 0,1-month schedule | Observer-blinded |
| ABCWY high dose   | MenABCWY-2Gen in a 0,1-month schedule | Observer-blinded |
| Placebo low dose  | NaCl in a 0,1-month schedule          | Observer-blinded |
| Placebo high dose | NaCl in a 0,1-month schedule          | Observer-blinded |

The Phase II part of the study was conducted in 2 parts: The 'formulation and schedule -finding' part (hereafter referred to as Phase II FSF) was conducted in healthy adolescents and young adults and was designed to select the vaccine formulation and sched ule to be tested in Phase III. The 'blood sourcing' part (hereafter referred to as Phase II Sourcing) was conducted in healthy adults to collect sufficient serum samples for the development of assays to be used in the MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine clinical development program. Phase II FSF assessed the safety, the effectiveness and the immunogenicity of the above 2 formulations of the investigational MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine, while Phase II Sourcing assessed the safety. Bexsero (rMenB+OMV NZ, hereafter referred to as MenB, 0,6months schedule) and Menveo (hereafter referred to as MenACWY; single dose) were administered as control vaccines for assessing the response to serogroups B and ACWY, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The purpose of this partially blinded Phase II FSF was to assess the safety, effectiveness and immunogenicity of the MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine in healthy adolescents and young adults (10-25 years). It included 5 study groups with a staggered enrolment of initial 45 participants in a 3:1:3:1:1 ratio for safety lead-in, followed by the remaining participants in 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive the investigational or control vaccines. Blood samples were collected to assess the immune responses.

Phase II FSF included 5 study groups, a staggered enrolment was planned (45 participants for safety lead-in and 955 participants thereafter).

**For the serogroup A C, W, Y and serogroup B evaluations, the 4-fold rise (for serogroup B - per each indicator strain) is defined as:

- -a postvaccination hSBA titre ≥16 for participants with a pre -vaccination hSBA titre &lt;4,

-a postvaccination hSBA titre ≥4 times the LLOQ for participants with a pre -vaccination hSBA titre ≥LOD but &lt;LLOQ, and

- -a postvaccination hSBA titre ≥4 times the pre -vaccination hSBA titre for participants with a pre-vaccination hSBA titre ≥LLOQ.

† The primary objective of immunological NI of the MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine to MenACWY will be evaluated only in participants without a previous MenACWY vaccination (unprimed). All other primary and secondary objectives will be evaluated in participants with and without previous MenACWY vaccination (primed/unprimed).

## Sample size

The number of participants planned was 32 for Phase I, 1000 for Phase II FSF and 466* for Phase II Sourcing.

A thousand (1000) participants are to be enrolled in 5 arms of Phase II of the study, 206 participants for both MenABCWY low dose\\_06 and MenABCWY high dose\\_06arms and 196 participants for MenABCWY low dose\\_02, MenABCWY high dose\\_02and Control arms. It is assumed that 15% of the participants will drop out or will not contribute to an evaluable result for the primary endpoints resulting in about 170 evaluable participants per arm. The power to show both immunological noninferiority of MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine (low or high dose) when administered at 0,2- or 0,6-m schedules compared to the Control vaccine (single dose) and effectiveness superiority of the MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine (low or high dose)when administered at 0,2- or 0,6-m schedules compared to the Control vaccine

The actual number of participants enrolled and entered into Exposed Set by receiving at least 1 dose of study intervention are presented in the below table.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

In Phase II (Formulation and Schedule-finding), the minimisation procedure will account for age category (10-17 years of age and 18-25 years of age) and previous MenACWY vaccination (priming) (Yes and No).

Once a participant identification number is allocated, the randomisation system will determine study group and will provide the study intervention number to be used for the first dose. The study intervention number(s) to be used for subsequent dosing will be provided by the same automated Internet-based system (SBIR).

Phase II (Formulation and Schedule-finding) partially blinded. Data in the 4 ABCWY groups will be collected in an observer-blind manner. To do so, study intervention(s) will be prepared and administered by qualified study personnel who will not participate in data collection, evaluation, review or the entry of any study endpoint (i.e. reactogenicity, safety, efficacy). Data in the Control group will be collected in an open-label manner i.e. study participants, investigator and site staff personnel will be aware of the treatment administered as 2 study interventions are administered at Visit V1.

The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing will be blinded to the treatment as well as to the subject number. There will be no link between the study intervention groups and the identity of the participant. In addition, for each sample, a different randomly selected subject code will be used at each timepoint. This subject coding will prevent the testing laboratory personnel from linking the consecutive timepoints to a specific subject

## Statistical Methods

Primary effectiveness and immunogenicity analyses:

Superiority of effectiveness: The analysis was performed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The 97.5% CIs for the difference in percentages between MenABCWY-2Gen groups and the control group was constructed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen.

Superiority criterion: Superiority of MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine compared to the MenB vaccine would be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 97.5% CI for the difference in percentages of samples with bactericidal serum activity using enc-hSBA against a randomly selected panel of endemic US N. meningitidis serogroup B invasive disease strains was above 5% in the ABCWY groups compared to the Control group at 1 month after the last vaccination.

Immunological Non-Inferiority: The analysis was performed using the Per Protocol Set (PPS). The 97.5% CIs for the difference in percentages between MenABCWY-2Gen groups and the control group was constructed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen.

Non-inferiority criterion : Non-inferiority of MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine compared to the MenACWY vaccine would be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 97.5% CI for the difference in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

percentages of participants achieving a 4-fold rise in hSBA titres was above -10% at 1 month after the last vaccination in the ABCWY groups compared to after the first vaccination in the Control group.

Note: The objectives were tested in a hierarchical manner.

Primary Safety analyses:

The safety analyses were descriptive and were conducted on Exposed Set.

## Efficacy results

The effectiveness and immunogenicity analysis were evaluated in Phase II FSF.

## Primary objectives:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Immunological non-inferiority of MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine compared to MenACWY vaccine: The immunological non-inferiority of the MenABCWY-2Gen high doseand MenABCWY-2Gen low dose(at both 0,6 and 0,2-month schedules) compared to the control (MenACWY) vaccine against serogroups A, C, W and Y at 1 month after the last vaccination in unprimed participants was demonstrated, as the LL of the 2-sided 97.5% CI for the group difference in overall percentages of participants achieving a 4-fold rise in hSBA titres was above the predefined criteria of -10% .
- Superiority of the effectiveness of MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine compared to MenB vaccine: The superiority of MenABCWY-2Gen high doseand MenABCWY-2Gen low dose(at both 0,6 and 0,2month schedules) compared to the MenB vaccine was not demonstrated, as the LL of the 2sided 97.5% CI for the difference in percentages of samples with bactericidal serum activity using enc-hSBA was below the pre-defined criteria of above 5%.
- The effectiveness of MenABCWY-2Gen high dose and MenABCWY-2Gen low dose at 0,6-month schedule appeared to be greater compared to the control (MenB) as the percentages of samples with bactericidal activity using enc-hSBA were 91.0% in the MenABCWY-2Gen high dose\\_06\\_ group, 91.0% in the MenABCWY-2Gen low dose\\_06group and 86.4% in the control (MenB) group.
- Regardless of dose, the effectiveness of MenABCWY-2Gen vaccine was higher with 0,6month schedule compared to the 0,2-month schedule.

## Secondary objectives:

- Distribution of percentages of Men B strains killed using enc-hSBA: The percentage of participants with ≥ 90% killed strains was 70.7% and 71.2% in MenABCWY-2Gen high dose\\_06 and MenABCWY-2Gen low dose\\_06 (0,6-month schedule groups), 55.0% and 53.4% in MenABCWY-2Gen high dose\\_02 and MenABCWY-2Gen low dose\\_02 groups (0,2-month schedule groups) and 52.3% in the control (MenB) group.
- Immune response to Serogroup B indicator strains: For both formulations of MenABCWY2Genvaccine (low or high dose), post 2 doses, the percentage of participants with 4-fold rise in hSBA titres in the 0,6-month schedule groups compared with the control group appeared to be higher for fHbp and NHBA and comparable for NadA and PorA (Table 1).
- The immune responses to all 7 serogroup B indicator strains were comparable between MenABCWY-2Gen high dose\\_06and MenABCWY-2Gen low dose\\_06groups (Table 1).
- Regardless of the dose, overall, the immune response for all the serogroup B indicator strains appeared to be generally better with the 0,6-month schedule compared with the 0,2-month schedule.
- Immune response to A, C, W and Y strains: After 1 dose of MenABCWY-2Gen high dose or MenABCWY-2Gen low dose, the percentage of participants with 4-fold rise in hSBA titres were comparable for C and W and appeared to be lower for A and Y compared to single dose of MenACWY (Table 1).
- The immune responses to all 4 serogroups were comparable between MenABCWY-2Gen high dose\\_06 and MenABCWY-2Gen low dose\\_06groups (Table below).

## Specific results for the Control study arm:

## Bexsero

The effectiveness of Bexsero vaccine at 0,6-month schedule against a panel of 110 randomly selected endemic N. meningitidis serogroup B strains as measured by the percentage of samples with bactericidal activity using enc-hSBA was 86.4%.

The percentages of strains killed was measured by enc-hSBA against a randomly selected panel of Men B strains. The percentage of participants with ≥ 90% killed Men B strains at 1 month after the second dose of Bexsero vaccination was 52.3%.

The percentage of participants with hSBA titres ≥LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) at 1 month after the second dose of Bexsero vaccine in the Control group against each serogroup B indicator strain was 76.5% for fHbp, 86.0% for NadA, 97.2% for NHBA and 76.4% for PorA. The percentage of participants with hSBA titre s ≥LLOQ for all serogroup B indicator strains (composite response) was 19.0%.

The percentage of participants with 4-fold rise in hSBA titres at 1 month after the 2nd dose of Bexsero vaccine in the Control group was 67.2% for fHbp, 80.8% for NadA, 81.3% for NHBA and 63.4% for PorA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At 1 month after the second dose of Bexsero vaccine compared to the baseline, increase in geometric mean antibody titre (GMT) was observed against each serogroup B indicator strain and was 62.0 for fHbp, 109.1 for NadA, 58.2 for NHBA and 30.4 for PorA.

## Menveo

The percentage of participants with hSBA titre s ≥LLOQ for each serogroup A, C, W and Y in the Control group 1 month after administration of Menveo was 93.0%, 77.9%, 74.5% and 74.2% respectively.

In the Full Analysis Set, the percentage of participants with 4-fold rise in hSBA titres against serogroups A, C, W and Y in the Control group 1 month after administration of Menveo was 92.2%, 63.5%, 67.8% and 62.4% respectively.

At 1 month after vaccination compared to baseline, an increase in hSBA GMTs was observed against each serogroup all serogroups A, C, W and Y in the Control (Bexsero/Menveo) group. The geometric mean ratios (GMR) for serogroups A, C, W and Y were 42.9, 15.6, 12.5 and 13.1, respectively.

## Safety results

The Bexsero and Menveo vaccines were tolerated in the study in healthy adolescents and young adults. Pain was the most frequently reported solicited administration-site event, while fatigue and headache were the most frequently reported solicited systemic events. Most of the solicited (administration-site or systemic) events were mild to moderate in intensity and with a mean duration of ≤ 4 days. The most frequently reported unsolicited adverse events (AE) were under the SOC of 'infections and infestations'. The most frequently reported unsolicited AE was upper respiratory tract infection in the Control (Bexsero/Menveo) group. The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs considered related were injection site reactions. None of the serious adverse events (SAEs) or adverse events of special interest (AESIs) reported throughout the study in the Control (Bexsero/Menveo) group were considered as related to study vaccination by the investigator. There were no fatal AEs or AESIs characterized as exacerbations throughout the study.

The safety results were found to be in line with the established safety profile of the Bexsero and Menveo vaccines the current European Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The present submission includes the Clinical Study Report for study 212458; this was a Phase I/II, randomised, controlled study to assess the safety, effectiveness and immune response of meningococcal combined ABCWY vaccine when administered to healthy adults (Phase I) and to healthy adolescents and adults (Phase II). EU authorised MenB vaccine Bexsero was administered in the study as a comparator vaccine in Phase II FSF part.

The data set has very limited size for children in this study. Altogether 79 participants in this study were at age below 18: 24 participants were 2-11 years of age, 55 participants were 12-17 years of age. Generally, the Control group, exposed to Bexsero and Menveo, show similar immunogenicity and safety as demonstrated in much larger pivotal trials for Bexsero and Menveo authorisation.

The MAH considers no changes to the current SmPC of Menveo are necessary. This is agreed.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The control group, exposed to Bexsero and Menveo, show similar immunogenicity and safety as demonstrated in much larger pivotal trials for Bexsero and Menveo authorisations. The results of this study does not indicate new efficacy or safety concern.
