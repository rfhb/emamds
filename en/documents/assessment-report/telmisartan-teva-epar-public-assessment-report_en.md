## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Telmisartan Teva 20, 40 and 80 mg is a generic medicinal product containing telmisartan as the active substance.

Telmisartan is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adults. Telmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor.  Telmisartan  selectively  binds  the  AT1  receptor.  The  binding  is  long-lasting.  Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. Telmisartan does  not  inhibit  angiotensin  converting  enzyme  (kininase  II),  the  enzyme  which  also  degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykin in mediated adverse effects. The efficacy and safety of telmisartan has been demonstrated in several well-controlled studies. A summary of these studies can be found in the EPAR of the reference product Micardis. The indication proposed for Telmisartan Teva is the same as the authorised indication for the reference medicinal product. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Telmisartan Teva is presented as immediate release tablets, containing 20, 40 and 80mg of telmisartan as the active substance. Other ingredients include microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, poloxamer 188, meglumine, povidone (PVP K-30), sorbitol and magnesium stearate. All strengths have the same proportional composition. The tablets are packaged in Alu-Alu blister packs. Active Substance The  active  substance  is  telmisartan,  a  well  known  active  substance  described  in  Ph.  Eur.  (Ph.Eur monograph number: 2154). Its chemical name is 4'-[(1,4'-Dimethyl-2'-propyl[2,6'-bi-lHbenzimidazol]-l'-yl)methyl][l,l'-biphenyl]-2-carboxylic acid. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is a white to slightly yellowish coloured powder, practically insoluble in water, but freely soluble in organic  solvents.  Telmisartan  has  no  chiral  centers  and  exhibits  no  stereoisomerism.  The  chemical structure  of  the  molecule  has  been  established  by  spectral  (UV,  IR, 1 H  and 13 C  NMR  and  mass spectra)  elemental  and  thermal  (DSC)  analyses.    The  active  substance  exhibits  polymorphism.  The capability  of  the  analytical  methods  used  to  discriminate  the  potential  polymorphs  has  been demonstrated  and  batch  analysis  data  confirm  that  the  manufacturing  process  used  consistently produces the same polymorphic form.

An Active Substance Master File has been provided in support of this application  from  the active substance manufacturer.

## · Manufacture

The active substance is synthesised using commercially available starting materials.  The process is adequately described and satisfactory specifications have been set for reagents, solvents and auxiliary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

materials  used  in  the  process.  All  critical  in-process  controls  parameters  are  well  established  and justified.

A reasoned discussion on impurities arising from the starting materials, the route of synthesis and on degradation  products  has  been  provided.  All  impurities  are  controlled  in  the  final  active  substance specification  in  accordance  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  An  in-house  process  related  impurity (intermediate) is also controlled in the active substance specification. The residual solvents are also controlled at the specifications in accordance with ICH Q3C.

Appropriate information of packaging materials for Telmisartan active substance has been described. Specifications  and  analytical  reports  for  the  packaging  components  have  been  presented  and  the suitability of the container closure system of the active substance for use with food and pharmaceuticals has been confirmed.

A common formulation was developed for Telmisartan 20, 40 and 80 mg tablets that is proportional for each strength. Most of the excipients of Teva's products are common to the reference product except that Telmisartan Teva does not contain sodium hydroxide, and Micardis tablets do not contain poloxamers (Lutrol F68, Poloxamer 188) and cellulose microcrystalline (Avicel PH-102).

· Specification The specification of telmisartan was set to be in line with the current Ph. Eur. monograph and the ICH guidelines. The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, assay (HPLC), identification (IR), solubility, related substances (by HPLC), X-ray powder diffraction pattern, loss on drying and sulphated ash. In addition the finished product manufacturer is testing for residual solvents (by GC), and particle size distribution. The non-compendial analytical methods have been appropriately validated. Batch analysis data from five batches have been provided. The results confirm batch-to-batch consistency and compliance to the Ph. Eur. monograph and the additional specifications. · Stability Data from stability studies on three production scale batches have been provided. Samples were stored  for up to 36 months at long term conditions (25°C/60% RH) and for 6 months at accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) in accordance with ICH requirements.  All batches have been tested for conformance  with  the  specifications  using  stability  indicating  analytical  methods.  In  all  cases  the batch analysis data met the predefined specifications and no significant trends were observed. In  addition  stability  data  have  been  provided  under  stress  conditions  (heat,  acid  hydrolysis,  base hydrolysis, photo degradation, water hydrolysis and hydrogen peroxide treatment). The presented stability data support the assigned retest period of 36 months for telmisartan with no special storage conditions, when packaged in the packaging material described. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical Development The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  immediate-release  tablets  containing qualitatively and quantitatively the same active substance and exhibiting the same bioavailability as the reference product Micardis ® tablets marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, in order to comply with the regulations pertaining to abridged applications in the European Union. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The manufacturing process is common for all strengths.

The  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  using Telmisartan  TEVA  80  mg  tablets  (batch  K-36856) versus Micardis® 80 mg tablets (batch number 706944 ,  marketed in Germany).  It is acceptable to rely  on  the  80  mg  bioequivalence  study  also  for  the  20  mg  and  40  mg  strengths  for  the  following reasons:

- the pharmaceutical products of different strengths are manufactured at the same site by the same manufacturer and manufacturing process,
- the qualitative composition of the different strengths are the same,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- the composition of the strengths are proportional,
- Although there is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels Cmax over the dose range  of  20-160  mg,  there  is  no  evidence  of  clinically  relevant  accumulation  of  the  active substance taken at the recommended dose. Therefore the selection of the 80 mg dose to establish bioequivalence is acceptable, in line with the Questions and Answers on the Bioavailability and Bioequivalence  guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006):  a  single  strength  study  may  be acceptable if the study is conducted on the highest dose for drugs with a demonstrated greater than proportional increase in AUC or Cmax with increasing dose during single or multiple dose studies.
- Appropriate  in  vitro  dissolution  data  has  been  provided  to  confirm  the  adequacy  of  waiving additional in vivo bioequivalence testing.

The dissolution test design has been extensively discussed and has been found adequate based on data from solubility tests of the active substance and similarity tests for the new and reference products in different pH media. The discriminatory nature of the dissolution method has also been satisfactorily demonstrated. · Manufacture of the Product The manufacturing process is a standard process. All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. Validation  data  from  pilot  scale  batches  demonstrate  that  the  process  is  capable,  reproducible  and provides  a  product  that  complies  with  the  in-process  and  finished  product  specifications.  The validation protocol for the production scale batches had been adequately described. · Product Specification The finished product specification includes tests for description, appearance, identification, assay (HPLC), dissolution, content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), friability (Ph. Eur.), thickness, resistance to crushing (Ph. Eur.), impurities and degradation products (HPLC), microbial count and water content. Batch analysis data from two production scale batches for each strength have been presented. All batches met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release. · Stability of the Product Data from stability studies on two stability batches for each strength have been provided. Samples were  stored  for  up  to  12  months  at  long-term  conditions  (25°C/60%  RH)  and  for  6  months  at accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) in accordance with ICH requirements.  All batches have been tested for physical and technological (appearance, dissolution), chemical (assay, degradation products)  and  microbiological  parameters  using  stability  indicating  methods.    In  all  cases  the parameters  tested  remained  within  the  proposed  specifications  and  no  significant  trends  were observed. The results of photostability studies show that the finished product is not sensitive to light. As  a  conclusion  the  proposed  shelf-life  has  been  sufficiently  supported  by  the  stability  studies performed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological aspects.

The  quality  of  Telmisartan  Teva  is  adequately  established.  In  general,  satisfactory  chemical  and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

The active substance is well known and has is described in a Ph. Eur. monograph. The quality of the active substance is regarded to be suitable for the intended use and appropriately controlled by the applicant. The excipients are commonly used in these types of formulations and comply with Ph. Eur. requirements.  The packaging material is commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

process  of  the  finished  product  has  been  adequately  described  and  controlled  with  appropriate  in process  controls.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.

In  comparison with the EU reference product, Telmisartan Teva has been shown to have the same qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  in  terms  of  the  active  substance.  The  excipients  used  are mostly the same with some minor modifications. Both the EU reference product and Telmisartan Teva exhibit similar dissolution profiles.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of telmisartan are well known. As telmisartan  is  widely used, well-known active substance, the Applicant has not provided additional studies and further studies are not required. Overview based on literature review is, thus, appropriate. The Nonclinical Overview is based on literature searches including several databases as Medline and Toxline  and  information  available  via  the  US  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FDA  1998).    The Nonclinical Overview refers to 18 publications up to year 2008. The environmental risk assessment (ERA) in line with the CHMP Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CPMP/SWP/4447/00)  was  not  submitted; however, a justification for omission of environmental risk assessment was provided. This was based on the fact the generic medicinal product is intended to substitute the reference product and it will not result in additional hazard to the environment. The supplied justification for the lack of a full ERA was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Pharmacology In vitro, AT1 receptor antagonists inhibit the contractile effects of AII in all vascular smooth muscle preparations.  In vivo, they prevent and reverse all the known effects of AII including: rapid pressure response; slow pressure response; stimulatory effects on the peripheral sympathetic nervous system;  CNS  effects  such  as  thirst,  vasopressin  release  and  sympathetic  tone;  release  of  adrenal catecholamines; secretion of aldosterone; direct and indirect effects of AII on the kidneys; growthpromoting actions.  Furthermore, they reduce arterial blood pressure in animals with renovascular and genetic hypertension, and in transgenic animals over-expressing the renin gene, but have little effect in animals with low-renin hypertension.  They are highly selective in that they do not displace ligands that  bind  to  calcium  channels  or  adrenergic,  muscarinic,  dopaminergic,  opioid  or  neurotensin receptors, and do not antagonise the actions of vasopressin, catecholamines, acetylcholine, serotonin, bradykinin or histamine. Mechanistically,  AII  is  formed  from  AI  in  a  reaction  catalysed  by  ACE.    AII,  being  the principal pressor agent of the RAAS,  elicits effects that promote hypertension, including vasoconstriction, stimulation of the synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption  of  sodium.    AII  antagonists  such  as  telmisartan  prevent  the  vasoconstrictor  and aldosterone-secreting effects of AII by selectively blocking the binding of AII to the AT1 receptor in the cell membranes of various tissues including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.  This action is therefore dependant upon the pathways of AII synthesis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

AT2  receptors  are  also  present  in  a  wide  variety  of  tissues  but  they  are  not  known  to  be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis.  In any event, the selectivity of telmisartan comes from its &gt;3000 times greater affinity for AT1 receptors compared with AT2's,

ACEI also block the renin-angiotensin system by inhibiting the biosynthesis of AII from AI, and are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and CHF.  ACEI also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin (which is also catalysed by ACE), a property not associated with telmisartan.  It is possible that the lack of activity in this respect may make telmisartan less likely to be associated with the side effect of cough that is experienced by some patients taking ACEI.

Blockade  of  the  AT1  receptor  inhibits  the  negative  regulatory  feedback  of  AII  on  renin secretion, but the resulting elevated plasma-renin activity (PRA) and circulating levels of AII do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.  It is also pertinent that telmisartan does not bind to, or affect, other receptors or ion channels important in cardiovascular regulation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vivo, telmisartan has shown hypotensive activity in the main species used in the toxicology (rat and dog)  and  in  rabbits,  cynomolgus  monkeys  and  marmosets.    Telmisartan  reduced  diastolic  blood pressure in normotensive rats, dogs and rabbits.  In AII-induced hypertension in rats, telmisartan dosedependently  lowered  blood  pressure  after  oral,  i.v.  or  i.d.  administration,  identifying  it  as  a  noncompetitive receptor antagonist. It also lowered blood pressure in renin-dependent hypertensive rats (in which losartan was 3 times less potent) and in renal hypertensive rats. The effect was long-lasting, particularly in the dog, which appeared to be the more sensitive species.  The enduring effect could result from slow dissociation or from slow off-rate of telmisartan from its binding sites.  In sodiumdepleted  normotensive  cynomolgus  monkeys,  telmisartan  elicited  up  to  a  42%  reduction  in  MAP without affecting heart rate.  Increases in PRA and plasma AII levels suggested that increased PRA maybe a consequence of blocking AII receptors in renin-sensitive tissues. Furthermore, telmisartan inhibited the AII pressor response in anaesthetised marmosets.

Cmax after an oral dose of 1 mg/kg was similar in rats, dogs and humans, but higher in mice and  rabbits.    The  t½  was  reasonably  similar  in  rats,  mice  and  dogs,  but  was  longer  in  rabbits  and humans.  In rats, mice and dogs, the compound-related material in plasma was predominantly parent drug  whereas,  in  rabbits,  there  were  roughly  equal  amounts  of  parent  and  metabolite(s).    Doseproportionality with single rising doses was apparent at lower doses in rats and dogs but, at higher doses,  it  was  greater  than  proportional;  similar  non-proportionality  occurs  in  humans.    In  rabbits, plasma concentrations 24 hours after dosing were high, indicating constantly high exposure during repeated daily dosing.

Telmisartan also has a cardioprotective function that has been demonstrated in rats.  As well as lowering blood pressure in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat, it also lowered cholesterol, very low  density  lipoproteins  and  triglycerides,  and  prevented  cardiac  hypertrophy.    In  another  model, telmisartan  improved  cardiovascular  remodelling  associated  by  the  production  of  e-NOS  through PPARγ , inhibition of the Rho-kinase pathway and suppression of oxidative stress. In a series of studies unrelated to its therapeutic activity, telmisartan at very high doses in rats and  guinea  pigs  had  some  non-specific  inotropic  activity  giving  rise  to  ECG  changes,  ventricular tachycardia  and  AV-block  with  bradycardia;  importantly,  there  were  no  ECG  changes  in  the comprehensive programme of toxicity studies.  In renal function tests in rats, telmisartan had diuretic and  natriuretic  effects  and  elevated  BUN  and  creatinine  levels;  these  changes  were  prevented  in animals that were  sodium-loaded.  It was  also reported that telmisartan protects against the nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporin A in minipigs and of diatrizoate in rats.  Telmisartan attenuated glitazone-induced increases in body fat mass in genetically obese rats and rats fed a high-fat diet.  It did not affect bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in anaesthetised guinea pigs. Finally, in CNS studies,  telmisartan  had  no  muscle-relaxant  activity  in  mice,  and  did  not  affect  spontaneous  motor activity or hexobarbital sleeping time in rats. There  is  no  nonclinical  information  on  drug  interactions  with  telmisartan,  but  clinical  data exist  in  relation  to  co-administration  with  digoxin,  diuretics,  NSAID's,  highly  protein-bound  drugs and drugs that are metabolised by CYP2C19. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan were investigated by the oral and i.v. routes in rats, mice, dogs  and  rabbits  (the  main  species  used  in  the  toxicology).  In  addition,  toxicity  studies  had complementary toxicokinetics. Orally administered telmisartan was rapidly absorbed in rats, mice and dogs, but more slowly in  rabbits.    Absorption  was  high  in  rats  and  mice,  with  absolute  bioavailability  of  56-75%.   It was lower in dogs though less so when administered after food. In mice and humans, Cmax and AUC were higher in F, but there were no clear gender differences in rats or dogs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Orally  administered  telmisartan  concentrates  predominantly  in  the  plasma  fraction  of  the blood in all species, and correlates with the very high binding to plasma proteins (around 99%).  The high degree of binding results in relatively slow metabolism of the parent compound.

Telmisartan is rapidly distributed into a volume of distribution greater than total body water (5.3L/kg  in  rats,  and  1.7-3.0  L/kg  in  dogs).    Tissue  distribution  studies  in  rats  showed  the  highest concentration to be in the liver, with lower levels in blood, lung, renal cortex and myocardium; only very low levels were identified in the CNS.  In pregnant rats, telmisartan crossed the placenta and was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identified in foetal liver, kidney and lung where, 24 hours after dosing the dam, levels were higher than in maternal blood at that time.

After  absorption  from  the  oral  route,  telmisartan  appears  predominantly  as  parent  compound  (8090%) in the plasma.  It was readily glucuronidated in all microsomal fractions except lung, and its affinity  for  liver  enzymes  was  greater  than  those  from  kidney  or  small  intestine.    The  rate  of metabolism in the liver was slow and drug was retained in the liver, but the rate of elimination of the glucuronide  was  rapid.    The  main  metabolite  in  rat  and  human  systems  was  telmisartan  1-Oacylglucuronide.  The metabolism of telmisartan is similar in rats, mice and dogs though, in mice, a glycoside of telmisartan was also identified and accounted for 5-11% of the administered dose.

In all species including humans, telmisartan is preferentially eliminated via the bile into the faeces, with &lt;1% excreted in the urine.  There was virtually no enterohepatic recycling of parent drug and only about 10% of the acylglucuronide.  In lactating rats, the levels of telmisartan-related material secreted in the milk were about twice those in plasma.

There were also consistent anaemic changes (such effects are known to occur with ACEI and AII antagonists as a result of reductions in erythropoietin, presumably due to the decreased influence of  AII  on  the  kidney).    The  effects  were  generally  time-  and  dose-related  in  both  incidence  and severity, and are considered to be a consequence of exaggerated pharmacodynamic activity.  They can be prevented by salt-loading in rats.

Toxicology · Single dose toxicity The  single-dose  studies  provided  limited  useful  information.    An  oral  dose  of  2000  mg/kg  had  no effects in rats, while dogs given 100 mg/kg had white material (presumably drug) in their faeces.  Rats dosed  i.v.  at  200  mg/kg  showed  depressant  effects  and,  amongst  other  post-mortem  changes, discoloured kidneys and gastric haemorrhage. · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) A full regulatory programme of toxicity studies up to 12 months' duration was conducted in rats and dogs.  In  all  repeated  dosing  studies,  there  was  a  commonality  of  effects  in  the  kidney  and gastrointestinal  tract,  irrespective  of  whether  the  drug  was  administered  by  gavage,  in  the  diet  or intravenously (i.v. studies are not considered in this document).  The primary target organs in rats, dogs and mice were kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. The kidney changes were associated with elevated circulating levels of BUN and creatinine and alterations in electrolyte concentrations. In rats and dogs, there was juxtaglomerular hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the afferent glomerular arterioles; the effects were blocked by sodium loading in rats.  They probably arose as a consequence of exaggerated pharmacology; blockade of AII induced inhibition  of  renin  release,  thereby  stimulating  renin-producing  cells.    Similar  changes  occur  with other  sartans  and  with  ACEI,  and  are  considered  not  relevant  to  therapeutic  doses  in  patients. Telmisartan  was  also  associated  with  renal  tubular  changes  in  normotensive  dogs,  which  were consistent  with  hypotension  reducing  renal  perfusion,  leading  to  tubular  hypoxia  and  consequent tubular  cellular  degeneration  and  necrosis.    In  hypertensive  patients,  the  objective  of  telmisartan treatment  would  be  to  restore  normal  blood  pressure;  under  these  circumstances,  the  hypotensive states necessary for reductions in renal blood pressure and consequent pathology would not arise. Gastrointestinal  erosion  and  ulceration,  and  mucosal  and  submucosal  inflammation  and subsequent  fibrosis,  occurred  predominantly  in  rats  and  rabbits;  dogs  were  less  sensitive  and  mice were not affected.  The effects were not a consequence of local irritation because i.v. administration (in studies not reviewed here) gave rise to similar lesions.  The precise mechanism is unknown but, like the renal changes, the gut changes can be ameliorated in rats by salt-loading. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The decrease in heart weight recorded in most toxicity studies probably reflected a reduction of hypertrophied cardiomyocytes to their normal size, rather than any reduction from the normal.  The reduction has been attributed to the absence of trophic effects of AII on growing cardiomyocytes and the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy.  There is no loss of contractile function in the smooth muscle cells, so cardiac function is not affected.  This is also a class effect with AII antagonists and ACEI.

- Genotoxicity

The recommended range of genotoxicity studies followed accepted protocols and gave uniformly negative results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice used high multiples of the maximum human exposure level as justification for setting the highest dose level; furthermore, in rats, it is possible that the MTD was attained.  There was no effect on survival, and the toxicological findings were consistent with those in the repeated-dose studies.  In both species, statistical analyses of the results revealed no significant positive trend or increase in incidence of neoplasms in any of the telmisartan-treated groups compared with  controls.  This  conclusion  was  supported  by  the  absence  of  genotoxicity  in  a  full  battery  of mutagenicity studies.

- Reproduction Toxicity

Reprotoxicity studies with telmisartan in rats and rabbits followed the conventional Segment I, II and II approach.  Complementary toxicokinetics revealed little difference in exposure from non-pregnant rats;  there  was  constant systemic exposure at all doses and dosing periods in both rats and rabbits; furthermore, in rats, drug crosses the placenta and is secreted in the milk of lactating animals.  In both species,  toxicity  was  apparent  primarily  as  reductions  in  food  consumption  and  bodyweight  gain. There was no effect on fertility in rats and no evidence of teratogenicity in either species.  In weanling rats,  a  short  delay  in  eye-opening  was  probably  a  consequence  of  reduced  bodyweight  gain.    In rabbits,  there  was  an  all-or-nothing  effect  on  intrauterine  loss;  in  some  dams,  there  was  total resorption while, in similarly treated animals, foetal development was not affected.

The results of the bioequivalence study conducted with the 80 mg tablets could be acceptable for the 20 mg and 40 mg strength because the following criteria for a biowaiver have been fulfilled:

2.4 Clinical Aspects Introduction An  overview  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  and  a  more  extensive  review  of  the  key  clinical  trials supporting  the  established  indications  for  the  product  have  been  submitted.  A  literature  search covering the period from the date of publication of the last major review of telmisartan (2006) to the present has been conducted in order to establish that there are no recent reports which might call the efficacy into question.  A general overview of the safety is given and is supplemented by a literature search  from  2006  to  the  present  to  detect  any  recent  ADRs  or  safety  findings  which  may  be  of concern.  The bioequivalence aspects of the product are considered in detail. This application is a generic application, therefore, demonstration of therapeutic equivalence is  shown  by  means  of  pharmacokinetic  studies.  Then, new clinical studies are neither required nor submitted. The relative oral bioavailability of Telmisartan Teva 80mg tablets and the European brand product  Micardis®  80mg  tablets  (manufactured  by  Boehringer  Ingelheim  International  GmbH, Germany) was established by comparing the single dose pharmacokinetics of telmisartan from the two formulations, under fasting conditions, in a randomised crossover study. Exemption Dissolution profiles of telmisartan The dissolution profiles of Telmisartan Teva and the reference product have been compared using a discriminatory dissolution test and have been shown to be similar Justification for biowaiver Medicinal product no longer authorised

1.  The pharmaceutical products are manufactured at the same site by the same manufacturer and manufacturing process.
2.  The qualitative composition of the different strengths are the same.
3.  The composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional.

The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are nonlinear over the dose range 20-160 mg, with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmax and Telmisartan 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg Tablets AUC) with increasing doses.  The selection of the 80mg dose to establish

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bioequivalence is in line with the Questions and Answers on the Bioavailability and Bioequivalence guideline  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006,  which  indicates  that  a  single  strength  study  may  be acceptable provided that the study is conducted on the highest dose for drugs with a demonstrated greater  than  proportional  increase  in  AUC  or  Cmax  with  increasing  dose,  as  is  the  case  with telmisartan.  The biowaiver was granted for the lower strengths.

## Clinical studies

To  support the application,  the  applicant  has  submitted  one  bioequivalence  study.  No  new pharmacodynamic studies and no new therapeutic equivalence studies were submitted.

STUDY DESIGN This is  an  open-label,  single-dose, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment, crossover study. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two dosing sequences AB or BA under fasting conditions.  Each  subject  received  either  an  80mg  telmisartan  generic  tablet  (Test)  or  a  Micardis® 80mg tablet (Reference), with 240ml water, after an overnight fast, according to a computer generated randomisation  list.    Following  a  14-day  washout  period,  the  subjects  received  the  alternative formulation under identical conditions. During each study period, blood samples were taken pre-dose and at 0.125, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.0, 24.0, 48.0 (±  0.5),  72.0  (±  0.5),  96.0  (±  0.5)  and  120  (±  0.5)  hours  after  drug  administration.    Plasma  was harvested from these samples and assayed for telmisartan using a validated LC/MS/MS method. The design employed was considered by the CHMP appropriate for bioequivalence studies. The  selection  of  the  80mg  dose  to  establish  bioequivalence  is  in  line  with  the  bioequivalence guideline  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006,  which  indicates  that  a  single  strength  study  may  be conducted on the highest  dose  for  drugs  with  a  demonstrated  greater  than  proportional  increase  in AUC or Cmax with increasing dose. The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS Name: Unit dose: Regimen: Lot/Batch No.: Expiry date: Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  size  of  the  biobatch  was  considered  acceptable.  The  Product  Certificates  of  the  Test  and Reference  products  were  missing  but  were  provided  by  the  applicant  during  evaluation  of  the application. It was concluded that tablets used in bioequivalence study have the same pharmaceutical characteristics as the tablets to be marketed.

## · Conclusions

This  study  confirms  that  the  test  product  (Telmisartan  Teva  80mg  tablets)  is  bioequivalent  to  the Reference formulation (Micardis® 80mg tablets, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Germany) with respect to rate and extent of availability.

The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice. The analytical validation reports are compliant with regulatory requirements.

The design employed was appropriate for bioequivalence studies.  A single dose study is considered appropriate in view of the fact that telmisartan does not accumulate during repeated administration

The residual area was 6.65% for the test product and 6.94% for the reference product, indicating that the  pharmacokinetic  time  points  were  adequate  to  detect  80%  of  the  AUC  to  infinity,  for  both products. The 90% geometric confidence intervals of the ratio (Test/Reference) of least-squares means of the log transformed data were within the internationally accepted range of 80% and 125% for AUC0-t and for Cmax as well. Pharmacodynamics No new data were required and provided by the Applicant. Post marketing experience The  product  has  not  been  marketed  until  now  therefore  no  post-marketing  experience  could  be gathered. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance  PSUR The PSUR submission schedule for Telmisartan Teva should follow the PSUR submission schedule for the reference medicinal product.  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant Version 6, November 2008 fulfils the legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.  Risk Management Plan No description of Risk Management plan has been provided by the applicant. Since the application concerns  a  generic  with  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring additional risk management activities have been identified this approach is considered acceptable.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application contains adequate quality, non clinical, and clinical information and the bioequivalence has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information.

<!-- image -->

Recommendation Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of Telmisartan Teva in the treatment of essential hypertension in adults was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
