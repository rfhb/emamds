## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisations in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following the declaration of the pandemic by WHO, the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

- To assess whether one dose of Fluarix results in an HI immune response that meets or exceeds for each vaccine strain at least one of the CHMP criteria at D21 when administered before or after Pandemrix (H1N1) in subjects aged 61 years and older

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The  vaccine  also  contains  the  marketing  authorisation  holder's  (MAH)  proprietary  adjuvant  AS03, which is composed of squalene, DLα -tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The MAH applied to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pandemrix  H1N1 to reflect  newly  available  post  dose  1  efficacy  and  safety  results  from  a  clinical study on sequential administration of a licensed seasonal trivalent vaccine and Pandemrix administered in adults 61 years or above (D-PAN-H1N1-020). In submitting the above-mentioned data from study 020 the MAH also fulfilled the Specific Obligation to provide an abridged report for: post dose 1 data from study D-PAN H1N1-020 (SOB 052). 1.2 Clinical aspects Study 020 This  is  a  randomised,  single-blind  study  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  sequential administration of Fluarix and Pandemrix (H1N1) and vice versa in adults 61 years or above. The study is  ongoing at six sites in Germany. The current abridged study report has a Data Lock Point of 18 November 2009 and is based on the HI data to D21 only. Objectives are: Primary · To assess whether two doses of Pandemrix result in HI immune responses that meet or exceed the CHMP  criteria  at  D42  when  Fluarix  has  been  administered  at  least  21  days  before  or  not administered in subjects aged 61 years and older Secondary Medicinal product no longer authorised

- To compare GMT ratios at D42 between groups who have and have not received Fluarix at least 3 weeks previously
- To compare GMT ratios at D21 after Fluarix given to subjects who have and have not received Pandemrix (H1N1)
- To assess the anti-H1N1 SCR, SPR and SCF at 6 and 12 months after vaccination
- To evaluate safety

## Exploratory:

- To describe immunogenicity to the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like antigen at Day 0, Day 21 and Day 42 based on neutralising antibodies in each study group.

Healthy subjects aged &gt; 60 years were randomised (1:1) to Groups A and B and vaccinated as follows:

- o On Day -21, one dose of placebo was given to subjects in Group A and one dose of Fluarix was given to subjects in Group B
- o On Day 0 all subjects received the first dose of Pandemrix (H1N1)
- o On Day 21 all subjects received the second dose of Pandemrix but only the pre-vaccination HI results from the second dose (D21 sera) are currently available.
- o At D21, seropositivity rates were 100% in both groups with large increments in GMTs from D0 and final GMT values that were higher in the sub-groups that were seropositive at D-21. The 95% CI around the overall GMTs for groups A and B and between subsets in each group that were seropositive or seronegative at D-21 overlapped.

o On Day 42, one dose of Fluarix will be given to subjects in Group A and one dose of placebo will be given to subjects in Group B. The placebo is a saline solution. The data are presented for the total vaccinated cohort (TVC). It was planned to enroll 144 subjects and 145 were actually enrolled. One vaccinated subject has since withdrawn  consent;  all  others  have  completed  to  D21.  The  mean  age  was  69.4  years  for  the  total vaccinated  cohort  (range  61-86  years;  six  subjects  were  aged  &gt;  80  years)  and  the  male-female distribution was 49.7% versus 50.3%. The majority of subjects had received seasonal influenza vaccine in each of the preceding winters with an imbalance between groups for overall rates (89% in Group A and 75% in Group B). History of influenza vaccination in the previous 3 seasons (TVC) Immune response to Pandemrix (H1N1) o At Day -21, 25/72 (34.7%) in Group A and 24/73 (32.9%) in Group B were seropositive vs. H1N1v but GMTs were low (8.5 and 7.8). o At Day 0, 29/72 there were (40.3%) subjects seropositive in Group A (no Fluarix) compared to 54/72 (75%) in Group B (post-Fluarix) but GMTs remained low overall (8.9 and 14.3). There were only very small increases in GMTs from D-21 to D0 even in the subset in Group B that was seropositive at D-21. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The following tables show the same data for the three age cohorts 61-70, 71-80 and &gt;80 years. In the 61-70 years age group there were 13/44 (29.5%) in Group A and 12/42 (28.6%) in Group B who were already seropositive at D-21 compared to 10/26 (38.5%) and 9/27 (33%) in the 71-80 years age group. Of the 6 subjects in the &gt;80 years age group there were five already seropositive at D-21; the only seronegative subject was in Group B. The tables show that D21 GMTs within each of Groups A and B were at least numerically higher in the subsets that were seropositive at D-21 with some trend for GMTs to decrease with increasing age from 61-80 years. GMTs in those aged &gt; 80 years were higher because 5/6 were seropositive at D-21. In the subjects aged 61-70 years who were seronegative at D-21 a dose of Fluarix (Group B) increased the seropositivity rate to 23/30 (77%) while 4/31 (13%) given placebo (Group A) became seropositive. 61-70 years of age Medicinal product no longer authorised

In subjects aged 71-80 years who were seronegative at D-21 the seropositivity rates at D0 were 8/17 (47%) after Fluarix and 0/16 after placebo.

In  subjects  aged  &gt;  80  years  the  effect  of  Fluarix  on  D0  seropositivity  rates  cannot  be  discerned because there were only four subjects in Group B and three of these were already seropositive at D-21. Above 80 years of age Medicinal product no longer authorised

However for all subjects (i.e. across all age cohorts and baseline serostatus) there were differences observed between Group A (Placebo-Pandemrix) and Group B (Fluarix-Pandemrix) as follows:

The observed SCRs were 88.9% for Group A and 65.3% for Group B with non-overlapping 95% CI. The difference between groups reflected the much lower SCR in the 54 Group B subjects who were seropositive at D0 compared to the 29 Group A subjects who were seropositive at D0.

The SCFs were 16.6 and 7.9 with non-overlapping 95% CI. Again, the difference between groups reflected the much lower SCR in Group B subjects who were seropositive at D0. SCFs were also at least numerically lower in those seropositive vs. those seronegative at D0 in each of Groups A and B.

At D-21 9/72 (12.5%) in Group A and 5/72 (6.9%) in Group B were seroprotected . At D0, there was no increase in the numbers seroprotected in Group A but an additional six subjects in Group B (all of whom had been seropositive at D-21) had achieved a seroprotective HI antibody level following administration of Fluarix. Therefore 13/72 (18%) were seroprotected in Group B at D0. The D21 SPRs were 93.1% in Group A and 86.1% in Group B with overlapping 95% CI. Numerical differences in D21 SPRs between Groups A and B were observed in each of the subsets who were seronegative (88.4% vs. 83.3%) and seropositive (100% and 87%) at D-21 but the 95% CI overlapped for each subset comparison. Medicinal product no longer authorised

SCRs in the 61-70 and 71-80 years cohorts showed the same pattern of differences between Groups A and B and the subsets by D0 serostatus as reported above for the total population. The 95% CI did not overlap  for  the  61-70  years  cohort  but  did  overlap  for  the  71-80  years  cohort.  No  pattern  can  be discerned for the six subjects aged &gt; 80. In each cohort and subset SCRs were at least 45%.

Above 80 years of age SCFs also showed the same general pattern as reported above but the difference between Groups A and B and subsets according to D0 serostatus were really apparent only in the 61-70 years cohort with non-overlapping 95% CI between Group A and Group B and within the subsets seropositive at D0. In all cases SCFs exceeded 5.0. 61-70 years of age 71-80 years of age Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the 61-70 years age group there were 4/26 in Group A and 3/26 in Group B that were seroprotected at D-21. The SPR was increased at D0 only in Group B (8/42; 19%) and only among those already seropositive at D-21. The D21 SPRs were numerically lower in Group B regardless of D-21 serostatus but the 95% CI overlapped in each subset comparison. In all cases the D21 SPR exceeded 85%. In the 71-80 years age group there were 5/44 in Group A and 1/42 in Group B that were seroprotected at  D-21.  At  D0  only  one  additional  subject  (in  Group  B  who  was  seropositive  at  D-21)  reached  a seroprotective  HI  level.  The  D21  SPRs  were  numerically  lower  in  Group  B  regardless  of  D-21 serostatus but the 95% CI overlapped in each subset comparison. In subjects aged &gt; 80 years only one of the six subjects was seroprotected at either D-21 or D0. All six were seroprotected at D21. 61-70 years of age Medicinal product no longer authorised

Immune response to Fluarix The CHMP considered that the forthcoming comparison of the responses to Fluarix administered at D21 compared to responses to Fluarix administered at D21 after a dose of Pandemrix H1N1 will be of special importance. The data that will allow this comparison are expected by 5 February 2010. This section describes the responses to each of the strains in Fluarix. An analysis by age cohort will be examined when the comparison with D21 data is made. In addition, as outlined in Annex II to the opinion, on 5 February 2010 the MAH will provide the D42 data from study 018 in which the two parallel vaccine groups are: · F-PAN Group, one dose of Pandemrix H1N1 and one dose of Fluarix was given at Day 0 and one dose of Pandemrix H1N1 and one dose of placebo vaccine given at Day 21 · PAN-F Group, one dose of the  Pandemrix H1N1 and one dose of placebo vaccine given at Day 0 and one dose of the H1N1 candidate vaccine and one dose of Fluarix at Day 21. Thus far only the data to D21 (comparing one dose of Pandemrix with and without Fluarix) have been submitted from study 018, which showed no effect of co-administration on responses to H1N1v. The CHMP considered  that  this  D42  data  should  provide  additional  insight  into  the  possible  effect  of giving Fluarix after Pandemrix. Study results from H1N1-020 At Day -21 , despite the differences in previous seasonal vaccination histories, comparable proportions in Groups A and B were seropositive against: ¾ A/Brisbane (H1N1) [83.3% and 79.5%] and ¾ A/Uruguay (H3N2) [78.1% and 81.9%] and ¾ All subjects were seropositive for the B/Brisbane strain.

## At Day 0

- ¾ HI responses against each of the three seasonal strains in Group B (vaccinated with Fluarix at D-21)  exceeded  all  CHMP  criteria  for  HI  responses  in  adults  older  than  60  years  with  the exception of the SCR against B/Brisbane.
- ¾ In Group B the SCRs ranged from 26.4% to 50% and SCFs from 2.6 to 4.4 while the SPRs were 62.5% for A/Brisbane (H1N1), 86.1% for A/Uruguay (H3N2) and 100% for B/Brisbane.
- ¾ None of the CHMP criteria were met in Group A (who received placebo at D-21).

As  shown  in  the  tables  below,  the  three  CHMP  criteria  were  not  always  met  in  subsets  that  were seronegative or already seropositive at D-21 against A/Brisbane (H1N1). Nevertheless,  this  is  not required for seasonal influenza vaccines, which do not even have to meet all three criteria overall to be considered acceptable for the purposes of an annual strain change variation.

Although pre-study exposure to seasonal vaccination was clearly higher in Group A than Group B the D-21 seropositivity rates against H1N1v were comparable between the two groups and very much as expected from the MAH's other studies in adults (i.e. about one third were seropositive at D-21).

As noted above all subjects were seropositive against B/Brisbane before receiving Fluarix or placebo. Indeed, almost all were already seroprotected. The SCR was not met but the SCF and SPR criteria were met at D0 in Group B. Discussion on immunogenicity Overall comparison between group A and B Medicinal product no longer authorised

At  D0  subjects  in  Group  B  (who  had  received  Fluarix  at  D-21)  showed  a  marked  increase  in seropositivity rate against H1N1v (from 33% to 75%) but the GMTs showed virtually no change from D-21 to D0 and the seroprotection rate increased only from 7% to 18%.

At D21 after a dose of Pandemrix the subjects who had received Fluarix at D-21 (Group B) showed lower SCRs and SCFs overall compared to Group A. In each case the difference between Group A and Group B was driven by the much lower SCRs and SCFs in Group B subjects who were seropositive at D0. It is particularly notable that there was such a difference in SCFs since the D0 GMTs were not markedly different between Groups A and B.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SPRs at D21 after a dose of Pandemrix were numerically lower in Group B overall and within each subset that had been seropositive or seronegative at D-21. However, the marked difference was between the subsets that had been seropositive at D-21 with 100% seroprotected at D21 in group A compared to 87% in Group B.

## Despite  the  differences  all  the  CHMP  criteria  were  met  at  D21  in  each  of  Groups  A  and  B  and regardless of pre-vaccination serostatus.

The results do suggest that exposure to Fluarix at three weeks before Pandemrix is given might result in  lower  HI  responses  to  H1N1.  However,  since  all  the  CHMP  criteria  are  comfortably  exceeded regardless of whether Fluarix was or was not given, the data do not indicate any need to preclude the administration of Pandemrix H1N1 when at least 3 weeks have elapsed after a dose of Fluarix. This finding could reasonably be extrapolated to administration of Pandemrix after other non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines.

There was a baseline imbalance in seasonal vaccine exposures over the last 3 years before study entry between Groups A and B. Although the D-21 HI seropositivity rates were comparable between Groups A and B despite this imbalance, it cannot be ruled out that some of the difference in the D21 responses to  Pandemrix  might  be  related  to  more  extensive  past  exposure  to  seasonal  influenza  antigens  in Group A compared to Group B resulting in a priming effect not detectable solely based on D-21 HI antibody status. In this regard, the MAH did not provide analysis of responses according to prior vaccination history but the assessor considers that this would anyway not likely be helpful due to the high rates of any vaccination in the three preceding winters and the variability in exposure to different vaccine strains. The critical data are the responses by pre-Pandemrix HI serostatus plus the important analyses by age cohorts as described above. Analysis by age cohort The general pattern of responses according to Group and B and baseline or D0 serostatus applies also to the age cohorts 61-70 years and 71-80 years but the 95% CI more often overlap. Most importantly, for each subset the D21 HI responses to H1N1v exceed the CHMP criteria for each of  the  three  age  cohorts.  This  finding  supports  the  conclusion  that  there  is  no  need  to  preclude administration of Pandemrix provided that at least 3 weeks have elapsed since administration of a nonadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Immune response to Fluarix The CHMP considered that the immune responses to a dose of Fluarix were satisfactory. The level of HI  responses  to  the  three  strains  suggest  that  the  conclusions  drawn  regarding  any  prior  effect  of Fluarix on responses to Pandemrix should be generally valid.

## Clinical safety

## Safety following vaccination with Fluarix or Placebo at D-21

The overall comparisons between Group A (placebo) and Group B (Fluarix) in the four tables below indicate that the seasonal unadjuvanted vaccine was of low reactogenicity in this population of healthy subjects aged &gt; 60 years. That is, overall rates were not markedly higher after Fluarix compared to placebo although there was more of a difference for local symptoms than for general symptoms.

## Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and AEs of special interest (AESI)

No AESIs were reported and no subject had withdrawn due to an AE up to time-point D21.

Four  SAEs  were  reported  by  four  subjects  during  the  period  covered  by  this  report.  One  report  of myalgia following Fluarix was considered as related to vaccination by the investigator.

## SAEs during the entire follow-up period (Total Vaccinated Cohort)

Discussion on safety The data post-Pandemrix were as expected from previous studies in this age group and do not indicate a higher rate of AEs when Pandemrix is given three weeks after Fluarix compared to three weeks after placebo. 1.3 Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment At 21 days after a first dose of Pandemrix (H1N1) all CHMP and CBER regulatory acceptance criteria were met regardless of whether or not Fluarix had been given three weeks previously. This conclusion also applied within each of the age cohorts 61-70 years, 71-80 years and over 80 years. There was a detectable effect of prior Fluarix vaccination in terms of lower SCRs, SCFs and SPRs at D21 in the group that had received Fluarix compared to the group that had received Placebo at D-21. The 95% CI did not overlap for the SCRs and SCFs but did overlap for the SPRs. The same pattern was seen in each of the age cohorts 61-70 and 71-80 years. There were too few subjects aged &gt; 80 years (and 5/6 were seropositive against H1N1v at D-21) for any conclusions to be drawn regarding any effect of prior Fluarix on responses to Pandemrix (H1N1). The reactogenicity profile was comparable to that seen in other studies conducted in adults of this age group and there was no effect of prior Fluarix on the reactogenicity of Pandemrix (H1N1). Overall, and despite the pattern of immune responses observed, the data suggest that there is unlikely to  be  a  clinically  important  effect  of  prior  vaccination  with  non-adjuvanted  seasonal  influenza vaccines on the safety or immunogenicity of Pandemrix in subjects aged &gt; 60 years. 1.4 Changes to the Product Information] Medicinal product no longer authorised
