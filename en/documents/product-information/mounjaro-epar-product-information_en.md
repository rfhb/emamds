<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Type 2 diabetes mellitus

Mounjaro is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise

- as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications
- in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.

For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.

## Weight management

Mounjaro is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of

- ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (obesity) or
- ≥ 27 kg/m 2 to &lt; 30 kg/m 2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus).

For trial results with respect to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), see section 5.1.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The starting dose of tirzepatide is 2.5 mg once weekly. After 4 weeks, the dose should be increased to 5 mg once weekly. If needed, dose increases can be made in 2.5 mg increments after a minimum of 4 weeks on the current dose.

The recommended maintenance doses are 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg.

The maximum dose is 15 mg once weekly.

When tirzepatide is added to existing metformin and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy, the current dose of metformin and/or SGLT2i can be continued.

When tirzepatide is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea and/or insulin, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose self-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and insulin. A stepwise approach to insulin reduction is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## Missed doses

If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible within 4 days after the missed dose. If more than 4 days have passed, skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Changing the dosing schedule

The day of weekly administration can be changed, if necessary, as long as the time between two doses is at least 3 days.

## Special populations

## Elderly, gender, race, ethnicity or body weight

No dose adjustment is needed based on age, gender, race, ethnicity or body weight (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Only very limited data are available from patients aged ≥ 85 years.

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment including end stage renal disease (ESRD). Experience with the use of tirzepatide in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD is limited. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients with tirzepatide (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. Experience with the use of tirzepatide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients with tirzepatide (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Mounjaro is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm.

The dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals.

Injection sites should be rotated with each dose. If a patient also injects insulin, they should inject Mounjaro into a different injection site.

Patients should be advised to carefully read the instructions for use included with the package leaflet before administering the medicinal product.

## Vial

Patients and their caregivers should be trained in subcutaneous injection technique before administering Mounjaro.

For further information before administration see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Acute pancreatitis

Tirzepatide has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis, and should be used with caution in these patients.

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients treated with tirzepatide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be informed of the symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, tirzepatide should be discontinued. If the diagnosis of pancreatitis is confirmed, tirzepatide should not be restarted. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis (see section 4.8).

## Hypoglycaemia

Patients receiving tirzepatide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (for example, a sulphonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Gastrointestinal effects

Tirzepatide has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions may lead to dehydration, which could lead to a deterioration in renal function including acute renal failure. Patients treated with tirzepatide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration, due to the gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion and electrolyte disturbances. This should particularly be considered in the elderly, who may be more susceptible to such complications.

## Severe gastrointestinal disease

Tirzepatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and should be used with caution in these patients.

## Diabetic retinopathy

Tirzepatide has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular oedema, and should be used with caution in these patients with appropriate monitoring.

## Aspiration in association with general anaesthesia or deep sedation

Cases of pulmonary aspiration have been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing general anaesthesia or deep sedation. Therefore, the increased risk of residual gastric content due to delayed gastric emptying (see section 4.8) should be considered prior to performing procedures with general anaesthesia or deep sedation.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Benzyl alcohol

This medicinal product contains 5.4 mg benzyl alcohol in each 0.6 ml dose of Mounjaro KwikPen.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. This effect, resulting in decreased Cmax and a delayed tmax, is most pronounced at the time of tirzepatide treatment initiation.

Based on the results from a study with paracetamol, which was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on gastric emptying, no dose adjustments are expected to be required for most concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. However, it is recommended to monitor

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients on oral medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, digoxin), especially at initiation of tirzepatide treatment and following dose increase. The risk of delayed effect should also be considered for oral medicinal products for which a rapid onset of effect is of importance.

## Paracetamol

Following a 5 mg single dose of tirzepatide, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of paracetamol was reduced by 50 %, and the median (tmax) was delayed by 1 hour. The effect of tirzepatide on the oral absorption of paracetamol is dose and time dependent. At low doses (0.5 and 1.5 mg), there was only a minor change in paracetamol exposure. After four consecutive weekly doses of tirzepatide (5/5/8/10 mg), no effect on the paracetamol Cmax and tmax was observed. The overall exposure (AUC) was not influenced. No dose adjustment of paracetamol is necessary when administered with tirzepatide.

## Oral contraceptives

Administration of a combination oral contraceptive (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 0.25 mg norgestimate, a prodrug of norelgestromin) in the presence of a single dose of tirzepatide (5 mg) resulted in a reduction of oral contraceptive Cmax and area under the curve (AUC). Ethinyl estradiol Cmax was reduced by 59 % and AUC by 20 % with a delay in tmax of 4 hours. Norelgestromin Cmax was reduced by 55 % and AUC by 23 % with a delay in tmax of 4.5 hours. Norgestimate Cmax was reduced by 66 %, and AUC by 20 % with a delay in tmax of 2.5 hours. This reduction in exposure after a single dose of tirzepatide is not considered clinically relevant.  No dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is required.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with tirzepatide.

## Pregnancy

There are no or a limited amount of data from the use of tirzepatide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tirzepatide is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, tirzepatide should be discontinued. Tirzepatide should be discontinued at least 1 month before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether tirzepatide is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded.

A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from tirzepatide therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

The effect of tirzepatide on fertility in humans is unknown.

Animal studies with tirzepatide did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Tirzepatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When tirzepatide is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

In 12 completed phase 3 studies, 8 158 patients were exposed to tirzepatide alone or in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal products. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal disorders and these were mostly mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting was higher during the dose escalation period and decreased over time (see sections 4.2, and 4.4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following related adverse reactions from clinical studies are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10; uncommon: ≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000; very rare: &lt; 1/10 000). Within each incidence grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

# From post-marketing reports

- *Hypoglycaemia defined below.
- † Fatigue includes the terms fatigue, asthenia, malaise, and lethargy.
- 1 Adverse reaction that only applies to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
- 2 Adverse reaction that mainly applies to patients with overweight or obesity, with or without T2DM.

3  Frequency was very common in weight management and OSA trials, and common in T2DM trials.

4  Frequency was common in weight management trials, and uncommon in T2DM and OSA trials.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with tirzepatide in the pool of T2DM placebo-controlled trials, sometimes severe (e.g., urticaria and eczema); hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 3.2 % of tirzepatide-treated patients compared to 1.7 % of placebo-treated patients. Cases of anaphylactic reaction and angioedema have been rarely reported with marketed use of tirzepatide.

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with tirzepatide in a pool of 3 placebo-controlled weight management trials and in a pool of 2 placebo-controlled OSA trials, sometimes severe (e.g., rash and dermatitis); hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 3.0 - 5.0 % of tirzepatide-treated patients compared to 2.1 - 3.8 % of placebo-treated patients.

## Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

## Type 2 diabetes studies

Clinically significant hypoglycaemia (blood glucose &lt; 3.0 mmol/L (&lt; 54 mg/dL)) or severe hypoglycaemia (requiring the assistance of another person) occurred in 10 to 14 % (0.14 to 0.16 events/patient year) of patients when tirzepatide was added to sulphonylurea and in 14 to 19 % (0.43 to 0.64 events/patient year) of patients when tirzepatide was added to basal insulin.

The rate of clinically significant hypoglycaemia when tirzepatide was used as monotherapy or when added to other oral antidiabetic medicinal products was up to 0.04 events/patient year (see table 1 and sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).

In phase 3 clinical studies, 10 (0.2 %) patients reported 12 episodes of severe hypoglycaemia. Of these 10 patients, 5 (0.1 %) were on a background of insulin glargine or sulphonylurea who reported 1 episode each.

## Weight management study

In a placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 trial in patients with T2DM, hypoglycaemia (blood glucose &lt; 3.0 mmol/L (&lt; 54 mg/dL)) was reported in 4.2 % of tirzepatide-treated patients versus 1.3 % of placebo-treated patients. In this trial, patients taking tirzepatide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) had a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia (10.3 %) compared to tirzepatide-treated patients not taking a sulfonylurea (2.1 %). No severe hypoglycaemia episodes were reported.

## Gastrointestinal adverse reactions

In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, gastrointestinal disorders were dose-dependently increased for tirzepatide 5 mg (37.1 %), 10 mg (39.6 %) and 15 mg (43.6 %) compared with placebo (20.4 %). Nausea occurred in 12.2 %, 15.4 % and 18.3 % versus 4.3 % and diarrhoea in 11.8 %, 13.3 % and 16.2 % versus 8.9 % for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg versus placebo. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were mostly mild (74 %) or moderate (23.3 %) in severity. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea was higher during the dose escalation period and decreased over time.

More patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg (3.0 %), 10 mg (5.4 %) and 15 mg (6.6 %) groups compared to the placebo group (0.4 %) discontinued permanently due to the gastrointestinal event.

In a placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 study in patients without T2DM, gastrointestinal disorders were increased for tirzepatide 5 mg (55.6 %), 10 mg (60.8 %) and 15 mg (59.2 %) compared with placebo (30.3 %). Nausea occurred in 24.6 %, 33.3 % and 31.0 % versus 9.5 % and diarrhoea in 18.7 %, 21.2 % and 23.0 % versus 7.3 % for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg respectively versus placebo. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were mostly mild (60.8 %) or moderate (34.6 %) in severity. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea was higher during the dose escalation period and decreased over time.

More patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg (1.9 %), 10 mg (4.4 %) and 15 mg (4.1 %) groups compared to the placebo group (0.5 %) discontinued study treatment permanently due to the gastrointestinal event.

## Gallbladder-related events

In a pool of 3 placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 studies, the overall incidence of cholecystitis and cholecystitis acute was 0.6 % and 0.2 % for tirzepatide- and placebo-treated patients, respectively.

In a pool of 3 placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 studies and in a pool of 2 placebocontrolled OSA phase 3 studies, acute gallbladder disease was reported in up to 2.0 % of tirzepatidetreated patients and in up to 1.6 % of placebo-treated patients.

In the weight management phase 3 studies, acute gallbladder events were positively associated with weight reduction.

## Immunogenicity

There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic profile or an impact on efficacy of tirzepatide associated with the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) or neutralising antibodies.

5 025 tirzepatide-treated patients in the T2DM phase 3 clinical studies were assessed for ADA. Of these, 51.1 % developed treatment-emergent (TE) ADA during the on-treatment period. In 38.3 % of the assessed patients, TE ADA were persistent (that is TE ADA present for a period of 16 weeks or greater). 1.9 % and 2.1 % had neutralising antibodies against tirzepatide activity on the glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, respectively and 0.9 % and 0.4 % had neutralising antibodies against native GIP and native GLP-1, respectively.

3 710 tirzepatide-treated patients in the 4 phase 3 weight management and 2 phase 3 OSA studies were assessed for ADA. Of these, 60.6 - 65.1 % developed TE ADA during the on-treatment period. In 46.5 - 51.3 % of the assessed patients, TE ADA were persistent. Up to 2.3 % and 2.3 % had neutralising antibodies against tirzepatide activity on the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, respectively and up to 0.7 % and 0.1 % had neutralising antibodies against native GIP and native GLP-1, respectively.

## Heart rate

In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a maximum mean increase in heart rate of 3 to 5 beats per minute. The maximum mean increase in heart rate in placebo-treated patients was 1 beat per minute.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of patients who had a change of baseline heart rate of &gt; 20 bpm for 2 or more consecutive visits was 2.1 %, 3.8 % and 2.9 %, for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively, compared with 2.1 % for placebo.

Small mean increases in PR interval were observed with tirzepatide when compared to placebo (mean increase of 1.4 to 3.2 msec and mean decrease of 1.4 msec respectively). No difference in arrhythmia and cardiac conduction disorder treatment emergent events were observed between tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and placebo (3.8 %, 2.1 %, 3.7 % and 3 % respectively).

In 3 placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 studies, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a mean increase in heart rate of 3 beats per minute. There was no mean increase in heart rate in the placebo treated patients.

In a placebo-controlled weight management study in patients without T2DM, the percentage of patients who had a change in baseline heart rate of &gt; 20 bpm for 2 or more consecutive visits was 2.4 %, 4.9 % and 6.3 %, for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively, compared with 1.2 % for placebo. Small mean increases in PR interval were observed with tirzepatide and placebo (mean increase of 0.3 to 1.4 msec and of 0.5 msec respectively). No difference in arrhythmia and cardiac conduction disorder treatment emergent events were observed between tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and placebo (3.7 %, 3.3 %, 3.3 % and 3.6 % respectively).

## Injection site reactions

In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, injection site reactions were increased for tirzepatide (3.2 %) compared with placebo (0.4 %).

In 3 placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 studies and in 2 placebo-controlled OSA phase 3 studies, injection site reactions were increased for tirzepatide (8.0 - 8.6 %) compared with placebo (1.8 - 2.6 %).

Overall, in phase 3 studies, the most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions were erythema and pruritus. The maximum severity of injection site reactions for patients was mild (91 %) or moderate (9 %). No injection site reactions were serious.

## Pancreatic enzymes

In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in mean increases from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 33 % to 38 % and lipase of 31 % to 42 %. Placebo treated patients had an increase from baseline in amylase of 4 % and no changes were observed in lipase.

In 3 placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 studies and 2 placebo-controlled OSA phase 3 studies, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in mean increases from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 23 - 24.6 % and lipase of 34 - 39 %. Placebo treated patients had an increase from baseline in amylase of 0.7 - 1.8 % and in lipase of 3.5 - 5.7 %.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. Patients may experience gastrointestinal adverse reactions including nausea. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tirzepatide. A prolonged period of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observation and treatment of these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the half-life of tirzepatide (approximately 5 days).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins, ATC code: A10BX16

## Mechanism of action

Tirzepatide is a long acting GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, highly selective to human GIP and GLP-1 receptors. Tirzepatide has high affinity to both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors. The activity of tirzepatide on the GIP receptor is similar to native GIP hormone. The activity of tirzepatide on the GLP-1 receptor is lower compared to native GLP-1 hormone. Both receptors are present on the pancreatic α and β endocrine cells, heart, vasculature, immune cells (leukocytes), gut and kidney. GIP receptors are also present on adipocytes.

In addition, both GIP and GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the areas of the brain important to appetite regulation. Animal studies show that tirzepatide distributes to and activates neurons in brain regions involved in regulation of appetite and food intake. Animal studies show that tirzepatide can modulate fat utilization through the GIP receptor. In human adipocytes cultured in vitro, tirzepatide acts on GIP receptors to regulate glucose uptake and modulate lipid uptake and lipolysis.

## Glycaemic control

Tirzepatide improves glycaemic control by lowering fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes through several mechanisms.

## Appetite regulation and energy metabolism

Tirzepatide lowers body weight and body fat mass. The body weight reduction is mostly due to reduced fat mass. The mechanisms associated with body weight and body fat mass reduction involve decreased food intake through the regulation of appetite. Clinical studies show that tirzepatide reduces energy intake and appetite by increasing feelings of satiety and fullness, and decreasing feelings of hunger. Tirzepatide also reduces the intensity of food cravings and preferences for high sugar and high fat foods. Tirzepatide modulates fat utilisation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Insulin secretion

Tirzepatide increases pancreatic β -cell glucose sensitivity. It enhances first- and second-phase insulin secretion in a glucose dependent manner.

In a hyperglycaemic clamp study in patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was compared to placebo and the selective GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1 mg for insulin secretion. Tirzepatide 15 mg enhanced the first and second-phase insulin secretion rate by 466 % and 302 % from baseline, respectively. There was no change in first- and second-phase insulin secretion rate for placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Insulin sensitivity

Tirzepatide improves insulin sensitivity.

Tirzepatide 15 mg improved whole body insulin sensitivity by 63 %, as measured by M-value, a measure of glucose tissue uptake using hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp. The M-value was unchanged for placebo.

Tirzepatide lowers body weight in patients with obesity and overweight, and in patients with type 2 diabetes (irrespective of body weight), which may contribute to improvement in insulin sensitivity.

## Glucagon concentration

Tirzepatide reduced the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations in a glucose dependent manner. Tirzepatide 15 mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28 % and glucagon AUC after a mixed meal by 43 %, compared with no change for placebo.

## Gastric emptying

Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying which may slow post meal glucose absorption and can lead to a beneficial effect on postprandial glycaemia. Tirzepatide induced delay in gastric emptying diminishes over time.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Type 2 diabetes mellitus

The safety and efficacy of tirzepatide were evaluated in five global randomised, controlled, phase 3 studies (SURPASS 1-5) assessing glycaemic control as the primary objective. The studies involved 6 263 treated patients with type 2 diabetes (4 199 treated with tirzepatide). The secondary objectives included body weight, percentage of patients achieving weight reduction targets, fasting serum glucose (FSG) and percentage of patients reaching target HbA1c. All five phase 3 studies assessed tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg. All patients treated with tirzepatide started with 2.5 mg for 4 weeks. Then the dose of tirzepatide was increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until they reached their assigned dose.

Across all studies, treatment with tirzepatide demonstrated sustained, statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in HbA1c as the primary objective compared to either placebo or active control treatment (semaglutide, insulin degludec and insulin glargine) for up to 1 year. In 1 study these effects were sustained for up to 2 years. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in body weight were also demonstrated. Results from the phase 3 studies are presented below based on the on-treatment data without rescue therapy in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population consisting of all randomly assigned patients who were exposed to at least 1 dose of study treatment, excluding patients discontinuing study treatment due to inadvertent enrolment.

## SURPASS-1 - Monotherapy

In a 40 week double-blind placebo-controlled study, 478 patients with inadequate glycaemic control with diet and exercise, were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or placebo. Patients had a mean age of 54 years and 52 % were men. At baseline the patients had a mean duration of diabetes of 5 years and the mean BMI was 32 kg/m 2 .

SURPASS-3 - Combination therapy with metformin, with or without SGLT2i

In a 52 week active-controlled open-label study, 1 444 patients were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or insulin degludec, all in combination with metformin with or without a SGLT2i. 32 % of patients were using SGLT2i at baseline. At baseline the patients had a mean duration of diabetes of 8 years, a mean BMI of 34 kg/m 2 , a mean age of 57 years and 56 % were men.

Patients treated with insulin degludec started at a dose of 10 U/day which was adjusted using an algorithm for a target fasting blood glucose of &lt; 5 mmol/L. The mean dose of insulin degludec at week 52 was 49 units/day.

to 7.8 mmol/L) compared to patients treated with insulin degludec, with 73 % and 48 % of the 24 hour period in range, respectively.

## SURPASS-4 - Combination therapy with 1-3 oral antidiabetic medicinal products: metformin, sulphonylureas or SGLT2i

In an active-controlled open-label study of up to 104 weeks (primary endpoint at 52 weeks), 2 002 patients with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or insulin glargine once daily on a background of metformin (95 %) and/or sulphonylureas (54 %) and/or SGLT2i (25 %). At baseline the patients had a mean duration of diabetes of 12 years, a mean BMI of 33 kg/m 2 , a mean age of 64 years and 63 % were men. Patients treated with insulin glargine started at a dose of 10 U/day which was adjusted using an algorithm with a fasting blood glucose target of &lt; 5.6 mmol/L. The mean dose of insulin glargine at week 52 was 44 units/day.

SURPASS-5 - Combination therapy with titrated basal insulin, with or without metformin

In a 40 week double-blind placebo-controlled study, 475 patients with inadequate glycaemic control using insulin glargine with or without metformin were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

15 mg once weekly or placebo. Insulin glargine doses were adjusted utilizing an algorithm with a fasting blood glucose target of &lt; 5.6 mmol/L. At baseline the patients had a mean duration of diabetes of 13 years, a mean BMI of 33 kg/m 2 , a mean age of 61 years and 56 % were men. The overall estimated median dose of insulin glargine at baseline was 34 units/day. The median dose of insulin glargine at week 40 was 38, 36, 29 and 59 units/day for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and placebo respectively.

## Weight management

The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight management, in combination with a reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity, in patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ), or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 to &lt; 30 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbidity (such as treated or untreated dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea, or cardiovascular disease), and with prediabetes or normoglycemia, but without type 2 diabetes mellitus, were evaluated in three randomised double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (SURMOUNT-1, SURMOUNT-3, SURMOUNT-4). A total of 3 900 adult patients (2 518 randomised to tirzepatide) were included in these studies.

Treatment with tirzepatide demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained weight reduction compared with placebo. Furthermore, a higher percentage of patients achieved ≥ 5 %, ≥ 10 %, ≥ 15 % and ≥ 20 % weight loss with tirzepatide compared with placebo.

The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight management in patients with type 2 diabetes were evaluated in a randomised double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (SURMOUNT-2), and in a subpopulation of patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 in five randomised phase 3 studies (SURPASS-1 to -5). A total of 6 330 patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 (4 249 randomised to treatment with tirzepatide) were included in these studies. In SURMOUNT-2 treatment with tirzepatide demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained weight reduction compared with placebo. Furthermore, a higher percentage of patients achieved ≥ 5 %, ≥ 10 %, ≥ 15 % and ≥ 20 % weight loss with tirzepatide compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses of patients with obesity or overweight in the SURPASS studies (amounting to 86 % of the overall SURPASS-1 to -5 population) showed sustained weight reduction, and a higher percentage of patients achieving weight reduction targets compared to active comparator/placebo.

In all SURMOUNT studies, the same tirzepatide dose escalation scheme was used as in the SURPASS programme (starting with 2.5 mg for 4 weeks, followed by increases in 2.5 mg increments every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached).

## SURMOUNT-1

In a 72 week double-blind placebo-controlled study, 2 539 adult patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 to &lt; 30 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition, were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or placebo. All patients were counselled on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. At baseline, patients had a mean age of 45 years, 67.5 % were women and 40.6 % of patients had prediabetes. Mean BMI at baseline was 38 kg/m 2 .

In SURMOUNT-1, pooled doses of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg led to a significant improvement compared to placebo in systolic blood pressure (-8.1 mmHg vs. -1.3 mmHg), triglycerides (-27.6 % vs. -6.3 %), non-HDL-C (-11.3 % vs. -1.8 %), HDL-C (7.9 % vs. 0.3 %), and fasting insulin (-46.9 % vs. -9.7 %).

Patients with prediabetes at baseline continued for up to 176 weeks of treatment to evaluate long term effects on body weight and onset of adjudication-confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Among the patients in SURMOUNT-1 with prediabetes at baseline (N = 1032), 95.3 % of patients treated with tirzepatide reverted to normoglycemia at week 72, as compared with 61.9 % of patients in the placebo group. At the end of 176 weeks, 94.5 % of patients treated with tirzepatide reverted to normoglycemia, as compared with 60.4 % of patients in the placebo group, and 1.2% of patients treated with tirzepatide progressed to type 2 diabetes mellitus, as compared with 12.6% of patients in the placebo group.

## SURMOUNT-2

In a 72 week double-blind placebo-controlled study, 938 adult patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 to &lt; 30 kg/m 2 ) and type 2 diabetes, were randomised to tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or placebo. Patients included in the trial had HbA1c 7-10 % and were treated with either diet and exercise alone, or with one or more oral anti-hyperglycemic agent . All patients were counselled on a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. Patients had a mean age of 54 years and 51 % were women.Mean BMI at baseline was 36.1 kg/m 2 .

In SURMOUNT-2, pooled doses of tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg led to a significant improvement compared to placebo in systolic blood pressure (-7.2 mmHg vs. -1.0 mmHg), triglycerides (-28.6 % vs. -5.8 %), non-HDL-C (-6.6 % vs. 2.3 %), and HDL-C (8.2 % vs. 1.1 %).

## SURMOUNT-3

In an 84 week study, 806 adult patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 to &lt; 30 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight related comorbid condition, entered a 12 week intensive lifestyle intervention lead-in period consisting of a low calorie diet (1 200-1 500 kcal/day), increased physical activity and frequent behavioural counselling. At the end of the 12 week lead-in period, 579 patients who achieved ≥ 5.0 % weight reduction were randomised to tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or to placebo, for 72 weeks (double-blind phase). Patients were on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the doubleblind phase of the study. At randomisation patients had a mean age of 46 years and 63 % were women. Mean BMI at randomisation was 35.9 kg/m 2 .

## SURMOUNT-4

In an 88 week study, 783 adult patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 to &lt; 30 kg/m 2 ) and at least one weight related comorbid condition, were enrolled in a 36 week open label tirzepatide lead-in phase. At the start of lead-in period, the enrolled patients had a mean body weight of 107.0 kg and a mean BMI of 38.3 kg/m 2 . At the end of the lead-in period, 670 patients who achieved tirzepatide MTD of 10 mg or 15 mg dose were randomised to continue treatment with tirzepatide once weekly or to switch to placebo for 52 weeks (double-blind phase). Patients were counselled on a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. At randomisation (week 36), patients had a mean age of 49 years and 71 % were women. Mean body weight at randomisation was 85.2 kg and mean BMI was 30.5 kg/m 2 .

Patients who continued treatment with tirzepatide for an additional 52 weeks (up to 88 weeks in total) maintained and experienced further weigh loss after the initial weight reduction achieved during the 36 week lead-in phase. The weight reduction was superior and clinically meaningful compared to the placebo group, in which a substantial regain of body weight lost during the lead-in phase was observed (see Table 11 and Figure 10). Nevertheless, the observed mean body weight for placebo-treated patients was lower at week 88 than at the start of the lead-in phase (see Figure 10).

Risk of weight regain to &gt; 95 % of study baseline (Week 0) weight at week 88

Time to event analysis showed that continued tirzepatide treatment during the double-blind period reduced the risk of returning to greater than 95 % body weight observed at Week 0, for those who had already lost at least 5 % since week 0 by approximately 99 % compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.013 [95 % CI, 0.004 to 0.046]; p &lt; 0.001).

## SURMOUNT-5

In a 72-week study, 751 adult patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 to &lt; 30 kg/m 2 ) with at least 1 weight-related comorbid condition were randomised to tirzepatide 15 mg or semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly. When patients did not tolerate this dose, the dose was reduced to tirzepatide 10 mg or semaglutide 1.7 mg once weekly. Patients were counselled on a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. Participants had a mean age of 44.7 years and a mean BMI of 39.4 kg/m 2 . Overall, 64.7 % were female.

Treatment with tirzepatide for 72 weeks resulted in a superior and clinically meaningful reduction in body weight compared to semaglutide. The percent change from baseline at week 72 (primary endpoint) was -21.6 % for tirzepatide and -15.4 % for semaglutide (difference from semaglutide: 6.2 %; 95 % CI [-7.8, -4.6]; p&lt;0.001). Tirzepatide also achieved superiority compared with semaglutide for the key secondary endpoints, i.e. proportion of patients achieving ≥10 %, ≥15 %, ≥20 %, and ≥25 % body weight reduction at week 72 as well as reduction of waist circumference at week 72.

## Effect on body composition

Changes in body composition were evaluated in a sub-study in SURMOUNT-1 using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The results of the DEXA assessment showed that treatment with tirzepatide was accompanied by greater reduction in fat mass than in lean body mass leading to an improvement in body composition compared to placebo after 72 weeks. Furthermore, this reduction in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

total fat mass was accompanied by a reduction in visceral fat. These results suggest that most of the total weight loss was attributable to a reduction in fat tissue, including visceral fat.

## Improvement in physical functioning

Patients with obesity or overweight without diabetes who received tirzepatide showed small improvements in health-related quality of life, including physical functioning. The improvements were greater in the tirzepatide-treated patients than in those who received placebo. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the generic questionnaire Short Form-36v2 Health Survey Acute, Version (SF-36v2).

## Obstructive sleep apnoea

The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe (AHI&gt;15) obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), in combination with diet and exercise, in patients with obesity were evaluated in two randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies (SURMOUNT-OSA Study 1 and Study 2). A total of 469 adult patients with moderate to severe OSA and obesity (234 randomised to treatment with tirzepatide) were included in these studies. Patients with T2DM were excluded. Study 1 enrolled patients unable or unwilling to use Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy. Study 2 enrolled patients on PAP therapy. Study 2 does not allow any conclusion about a potentially added benefit of tirzepatide on top of PAP therapy, since PAP use was suspended 7 days prior to endpoint measurement. All patients were treated with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; 10 mg or 15 mg) of tirzepatide or placebo, once weekly for 52 weeks.

In both studies, treatment with tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) compared with placebo (see Table 12). Among tirzepatide treated patients, greater proportion of patients achieved at least 50 % AHI reduction compared to placebo.

## SURMOUNT-OSA, Study 1 and Study 2

In two 52 week double-blind placebo-controlled studies, 469 adult patients with moderate to severe OSA and obesity, were randomised to tirzepatide MTD of 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly, or to placebo, once weekly. In Study 1 patients had a mean age of 48 years, 33 % were female, 35 % had moderate OSA, 63 % had severe OSA, 65 % had pre-diabetes, 76 % had hypertension, 10 % had cardiac disorders, and 81 % had dyslipidemia. Patients had a mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) of 10.5. In Study 2 patients had a mean age of 52 years, 28 % were female, 31 % had moderate OSA, 68 % had severe OSA, 57 % had pre-diabetes, 77 % had hypertension, 11 % had cardiac disorders, and 84 % had dyslipidemia. Patients had a mean ESS of 10.0.

## Cardiovascular evaluation

Cardiovascular (CV) risk was assessed via a meta-analysis of patients with at least one adjudication confirmed major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). The composite endpoint of MACE-4 included CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina.

In a primary meta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 registration studies in patients with type 2 diabetes,  a total of 116 patients (tirzepatide: 60 [n = 4 410]; all comparators: 56 [n = 2 169]) experienced at least one adjudication confirmed MACE-4: The results showed that tirzepatide was not associated with excess risk for CV events compared with pooled comparators (HR: 0.81; CI: 0.52 to 1.26).

An additional analysis was conducted specifically for the SURPASS-4 study that enrolled patients with established CV disease. A total of 109 patients (tirzepatide: 47 [n = 995]; insulin glargine: 62 [n = 1 000]) experienced at least one adjudication confirmed MACE-4: The results showed that tirzepatide was not associated with excess risk for CV events compared with insulin glargine (HR: 0.74; CI: 0.51 to 1.08).

In 3 placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 studies (SURMOUNT 1-3), a total of 27 participants experienced at least one adjudication confirmed MACE (TZP: 17 (n = 2 806); placebo: 10 (n = 1 250)); the event rate was similar across placebo and tirzepatide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blood pressure

In the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with T2DM, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 6 to 9 mmHg and 3 to 4 mmHg, respectively. There was a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 2 mmHg each in placebo treated patients.

In 3 placebo-controlled weight management phase 3 studies (SURMOUNT 1-3), treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 7 mmHg and 4 mmHg, respectively. There was a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of &lt; 1 mmHg each in placebo treated patients.

In two placebo-controlled OSA phase 3 studies with pooled safety analysis, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 9.0 mmHg and 3.8 mmHg, respectively, at Week 52. There was a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 2.5 mmHg and 1.0 mmHg, respectively, in placebo treated patients at Week 52.

## Other information

## Fasting serum glucose

Across SURPASS-1 to -5 trials, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in significant reductions from baseline in FSG (changes from baseline to primary end point were -2.4 mmol/L to -3.8 mmol/L). Significant reductions from baseline in FSG could be observed as early as 2 weeks. Further improvement in FSG was seen through to 42 weeks then was sustained through the longest study duration of 104 weeks.

## Postprandial glucose

Across SURPASS-1 to -5 trials, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in significant reductions in mean 2 hour post prandial glucose (mean of 3 main meals of the day) from baseline (changes from baseline to primary end point were -3.35 mmol/L to -4.85 mmol/L).

## Triglycerides

Across SURPASS-1 to -5 trials, tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg resulted in reduction in serum triglyceride of 15-19 %, 18-27 % and 21-25 % respectively.

In the 40 week trial versus semaglutide 1 mg, tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg resulted in 19 %, 24 % and 25 % reduction in serum triglycerides levels respectively compared to 12 % reduction with semaglutide 1 mg.

In the 72 week placebo-controlled phase 3 study in patients with obesity or overweight without T2DM (SURMOUNT-1), treatment with tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg resulted in 24 %, 27 % and 31 % reduction in serum triglyceride levels respectively compared to 6 % reduction with placebo.

In the 72 week placebo-controlled phase 3 study in patients with obesity or overweight with T2DM (SURMOUNT-2), treatment with tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg resulted in 27 % and 31 % reduction in serum triglyceride levels respectively compared to 6 % reduction with placebo.

## Proportion of patients reaching HbA1c &lt; 5.7 % without clinically significant hypoglycaemia

In the 4 studies where tirzepatide was not combined with basal insulin (SURPASS-1 to -4), 93.6 % to 100 % of patients who achieved a normal glycaemia of HbA1c &lt; 5.7 % (≤ 39 mmol/mol), at the primary endpoint visit with tirzepatide treatment did so without clinically significant hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Study SURPASS-5, 85.9 % of patients treated with tirzepatide who reached HbA1c &lt; 5.7 % (≤ 39 mmol/mol) did so without clinically significant hypoglycaemia.

## Special populations

The efficacy of tirzepatide for the treatment of T2DM was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, or by baseline BMI, HbA1c, diabetes duration and level of renal function impairment.

The efficacy of tirzepatide for weight management was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, baseline BMI, and presence or absence of prediabetes.

The efficacy of tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe OSA in patients with obesity was not impacted by age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, or baseline OSA severity.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Mounjaro in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and for weight management (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Tirzepatide consists of 39-amino acids and has a C20 fatty diacid moiety attached, which enables albumin binding and prolongs half-life.

## Absorption

Maximum concentration of tirzepatide is reached 8 to 72 hours post dose. Steady state exposure is achieved following 4 weeks of once weekly administration. Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose proportional manner.

Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

Absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous tirzepatide was 80 %.

## Distribution

The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 10.3 L, and 9.7 L in patients with obesity.

Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99 %).

## Biotransformation

Tirzepatide is metabolised by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone, beta-oxidation of the C20 fatty diacid moiety and amide hydrolysis.

## Elimination

The apparent population mean clearance of tirzepatide is approximately 0.06 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 5 days, enabling once weekly administration.

Tirzepatide is eliminated by metabolism. The primary excretion routes of tirzepatide metabolites are via urine and faeces. Intact tirzepatide is not observed in urine or faeces.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Age, gender, race, ethnicity, body weight

Age, gender, race, ethnicity, or body weight do not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tirzepatide. Based on a population PK analysis, the exposure of tirzepatide increases with decreasing body weight; however, the effect of body weight on the PK of tirzepatide does not appear to be clinically relevant.

## Renal impairment

Renal impairment does not impact the PK of tirzepatide. The PK of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, ESRD) compared with subjects with normal renal function and no clinically relevant differences were observed. This was also shown for patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment based on data from clinical studies.

## Hepatic impairment

Hepatic impairment does not impact the PK of tirzepatide. The PK of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function and no clinically relevant differences were observed.

## Paediatric population

Tirzepatide has not been studied in paediatric patients.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology or repeat-dose toxicity or genotoxicity.

A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted with tirzepatide in male and female rats at doses of 0.15, 0.50, and 1.5 mg/kg (0.12, 0.36, and 1.02-fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on AUC) administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly. Tirzepatide caused an increase in thyroid C-cell tumours (adenomas and carcinomas) at all doses compared to controls. The human relevance of these findings is unknown.

In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice, tirzepatide at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly did not produce increased incidences of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia or neoplasia at any dose.

Animal studies with tirzepatide did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility.

In animal reproduction studies, tirzepatide caused foetal growth reductions and foetal abnormalities at exposures below the MRHD based on AUC. An increased incidence of external, visceral, and skeletal malformations and visceral and skeletal developmental variations were observed in rats. Foetal growth reductions were observed in rats and rabbits. All developmental effects occurred at maternally toxic doses.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Mounjaro is and what it is used for

Mounjaro contains an active substance called tirzepatide and is used to treat adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mounjaro reduces the level of sugar in the body only when the levels of sugar are high.

Mounjaro is also used to treat adults with obesity or overweight (with BMI of at least 27 kg/m 2 ). Mounjaro influences appetite regulation, which may help you eat less food and reduce your body weight.

In type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro is used:

- -on its own when you can't take metformin (another diabetes medicine).
- -with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by injection.

Mounjaro is also used together with diet and exercise for weight loss and to help keep the weight under control in adults, who have:

- -a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or
- -a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health problems (such as prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood, breathing problems during sleep called 'obstructive sleep apnoea' or a history of heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems)

BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and obesity, Mounjaro can be used with or without positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy.

It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Mounjaro

## Do not use Mounjaro

- -if you are allergic to tirzepatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before using Mounjaro if:

- -you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer than normal (including severe gastroparesis).
- -you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which may cause severe pain in the stomach and back which does not go away).
- -you have a problem with your eyes (diabetic retinopathy or macular oedema).
- -you are using a sulphonylurea (another diabetes medicine) or insulin for your diabetes, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these other medicines to reduce this risk.

When starting treatment with Mounjaro, in some cases you may experience loss of fluids/dehydration, e.g. due to vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea, which may lead to a decrease in kidney function. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.

If you know that you are due to have surgery where you will be under anaesthesia (sleeping), please tell your doctor that you are taking Mounjaro.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Mounjaro

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. This medicine should not be used during pregnancy as the effects of this medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception while using this medicine.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether tirzepatide passes into breast milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be ruled out. If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you should stop breast-feeding or delay using Mounjaro.

## Driving and using machines

It is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you use Mounjaro in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

signs of low blood sugar, e.g. headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling hungry, confusion, irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating (see section 4). See section 2, 'Warnings and precautions' for information on increased risk of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.

## Mounjaro contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use Mounjaro

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine.

## How much to use

- The starting dose is 2.5 mg once a week for four weeks. After four weeks your doctor will increase your dose to 5 mg once a week.
- Your doctor may increase your dose by 2.5 mg increments to 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg or 15 mg once a week if you need it. In each case your doctor will tell you to stay on a particular dose for at least 4 weeks before going to a higher dose.

Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to.

Each pen contains one dose of Mounjaro either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg.

## Choosing when to use Mounjaro

You can use your pen at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same day each week if you can. To help you remember, when to use Mounjaro, you may wish to tick the day of the week when you inject your first dose on the box that your pen comes in, or mark it on a calendar.

If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly Mounjaro injection, as long as it has been at least 3 days since your last injection. After selecting a new dosing day, continue with once-a-week dosing on that new day.

## How to inject Mounjaro

Mounjaro is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) at least 5 cm from the belly button or upper leg (thigh) or upper arm. You may need help from someone else if you want to inject in your upper arm.

If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a different injection site within that area. If you also inject insulin choose a different injection site for that injection.

Read the 'Instructions for Use' for the pen carefully before using Mounjaro.

## Testing blood glucose levels

If you are using Mounjaro with a sulphonylurea or insulin, it is important that you test your blood glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (see section 2, 'Warnings and precautions').

## If you use more Mounjaro than you should

If you use more Mounjaro than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this medicine may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick.

## If you forget to use Mounjaro

If you forget to inject a dose and,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- it has been 4 days or less since you should have used Mounjaro, use it as soon as you remember. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day.
- If it has been more than 4 days since you should have used Mounjaro, skip the missed dose. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day.

Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. The minimum time between two doses must be at least 3 days.

## If you stop using Mounjaro

Do not stop using Mounjaro without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Mounjaro, and you have type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar levels can increase.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

Important information you need to know before injecting Mounjaro.

Read this instructions for use and the package leaflet before using your Mounjaro pre-filled pen (pen) and each time you get a new pen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about your medical condition or treatment.

Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about how to inject Mounjaro the right way.

- Mounjaro is a single-dose pre-filled pen.
- The pen has a hidden needle which will automatically insert into your skin when the injection button is pressed. The pen will retract the needle when the injection is completed.
- Mounjaro is used 1 time each week.
- Inject under the skin (subcutaneously) only.
- You or another person can inject into your stomach (abdomen), upper leg (thigh) or upper arm.
- You may need help from someone else if you want to inject in your upper arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Guide to parts

<!-- image -->

## Preparing to inject Mounjaro

Remove the pen from the refrigerator.

Leave the grey base cap on until you are ready to inject.

Check the pen label to make sure you have the right medicine and dose, and that it has not expired.

Inspect the pen to make sure that it is not damaged.

<!-- image -->

Make sure the medicine is:

-  not frozen ·  colourless to slightly yellow
-  not cloudy ·  does not have particles

Wash your hands.

## Choose your injection site

Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can help you choose the injection site that is best for you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You or another person can inject the medicine in your stomach (abdomen) at least 5 cm from the belly button or thigh.

Another person should give you the injection in the back of your upper arm.

Change (rotate) your injection site each week.

You may use the same area of your body, but be sure to choose a different injection site in that area.

## Step 1 Pull off the grey base cap

Make sure the pen is locked .

Do not unlock the pen until you place the clear base on your skin and are ready to inject.

Pull the grey base cap straight off and throw it away.

Do not put the grey base cap back on - this could damage the needle.

Do not touch the needle.

## Step 2 Place clear base on skin, then unlock

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Place the clear base flat against your skin at  the injection site.

Unlock by turning the lock ring.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 3 Press and hold up to 10 seconds

<!-- image -->

Press and hold the purple injection button.

## Listen for:

- First click = injection started
- Second click = injection completed

You will know your injection is complete when the grey plunger is visible.

After your injection, place the used pen in a sharps disposal container.

## Disposal of your used pen

- Throw away (dispose of) the pen in a sharps disposal container or as directed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Do not throw away (dispose of) pens in your household waste.
- Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.
- Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about how to dispose of medicines you no longer use.

## Storage and handling

- For storage instructions refer to section 5 of the patient information leaflet.
- The pen has glass parts. Handle it carefully. If you drop the pen on a hard surface, do not use it. Use a new pen for your injection.

## Commonly asked questions

## What if I see air bubbles in my pen?

Air bubbles are normal.

## What if my pen is not at room temperature?

It is not necessary to warm the pen to room temperature.

## What if I unlock the pen and press the purple injection button before pulling off the grey base cap?

Do not remove the grey base cap. Throw away the pen and get a new pen.

## What if there is a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle when I remove the grey base cap?

A drop of liquid on the tip of the needle is normal. Do not touch the needle.

## Do I need to hold the injection button down until the injection is complete?

This is not necessary, but it may help you keep the pen steady against your skin.

I heard more than 2 clicks during my injection - 2 loud clicks and 1 soft one. Did I get my complete injection?

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Some people may hear a soft click right before the second loud click. That is the normal operation of the pen. Do not remove the pen from your skin until you hear the second loud click. I am not sure if my pen worked the right way.

<!-- image -->

Check to see if you have received your dose. Your dose was delivered the right way if the grey plunger is visible. Also, see Step 3 of the instructions.

If you do not see the grey plunger, contact Lilly for further instructions. Until then, store your pen safely to avoid an accidental needle injury.

## What if there is a drop of liquid or blood on my skin after my injection?

This is normal. Press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site. Do not rub the injection site.

## Other information

- If you have vision problems, do not use your pen without help from a person trained to use the Mounjaro pen.

## Where to learn more

3. How to use Mounjaro
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Mounjaro
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Mounjaro is and what it is used for

Mounjaro contains an active substance called tirzepatide and is used to treat adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mounjaro reduces the level of sugar in the body only when the levels of sugar are high.

Mounjaro is also used to treat adults with obesity or overweight (with BMI of at least 27 kg/m2). Mounjaro influences appetite regulation, which may help you eat less food and reduce your body weight.

In type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro is used:

- -on its own when you can't take metformin (another diabetes medicine).
- -with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by injection.

Mounjaro is also used together with diet and exercise for weight loss and to help keep the weight under control in adults, who have:

- -a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or
- -a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health problems (such as prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood, breathing problems during sleep called 'obstructive sleep apnoea' or a history of heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height.

In patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and obesity, Mounjaro can be used with or without positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy.

It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Mounjaro

## Do not use Mounjaro

- -if you are allergic to tirzepatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before using Mounjaro if:

- -you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer than normal (including severe gastroparesis).
- -you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which may cause severe pain in the stomach and back which does not go away).
- -you have a problem with your eyes (diabetic retinopathy or macular oedema).
- -you are using a sulphonylurea (another diabetes medicine) or insulin for your diabetes, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these other medicines to reduce this risk.

When starting treatment with Mounjaro, in some cases you may experience loss of fluids/dehydration, e.g. due to vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea, which may lead to a decrease in kidney function. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.

If you know that you are due to have surgery where you will be under anaesthesia (sleeping), please tell your doctor that you are taking Mounjaro.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Mounjaro

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. This medicine should not be used during pregnancy as the effects of this medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception while using this medicine.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether tirzepatide passes into breast milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be ruled out. If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you should stop breast-feeding or delay using Mounjaro.

## Driving and using machines

It is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you use Mounjaro in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any signs of low blood sugar, e.g. headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling hungry, confusion, irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating (see section 4). See section 2, 'Warnings and precautions' for information on increased risk of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.

## Mounjaro contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use Mounjaro

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine.

## How much to use

- The starting dose is 2.5 mg once a week for four weeks. After four weeks your doctor will increase your dose to 5 mg once a week.
- Your doctor may increase your dose by 2.5 mg increments to 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg or 15 mg once a week if you need it. In each case your doctor will tell you to stay on a particular dose for at least 4 weeks before going to a higher dose.

Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to.

Each vial contains one dose of Mounjaro either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg.

## Choosing when to use Mounjaro

You can use Mounjaro at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same day each week if you can. To help you remember when to use Mounjaro, you may wish to mark on a calendar the day of the week when you inject your first dose.

If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly Mounjaro injection, as long as it has been at least 3 days since your last injection. After selecting a new dosing day, continue with once-a-week dosing on that new day.

## How to inject Mounjaro

Always use Mounjaro exactly as your doctor has told you. Before you begin using Mounjaro, always read the 'Instructions for Use' below carefully, and talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure about how to inject Mounjaro correctly.

Mounjaro is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper leg (thigh) or upper arm. You may need help from someone else if you want to inject in your upper arm. Do not inject Mounjaro directly into a vein, as this will change its action.

If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a different injection site within that area. If you also inject insulin choose a different injection site for that injection. If you are blind or visually impaired, you will need help from someone to make your injection.

## Instructions for Use

1. First wash your hands with soap and water.
2. Check that the Mounjaro in the vial looks clear and colourless to slightly yellow. Do not use if it is frozen, cloudy, or has particles in it.
3. Pull off the vial plastic protective cap, but do not remove the stopper. Clean the stopper on the vial with a swab and prepare a new syringe. Do not share or reuse your needle or syringe.
4. Draw a small amount of air into the syringe. Put the needle through the rubber stopper on top of the Mounjaro vial and inject the air into the vial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5. Turn the Mounjaro vial and the syringe upside down and slowly pull the syringe plunger down to withdraw all the Mounjaro solution from the vial.  The vial is filled to enable delivery of a single 0.5 ml dose of Mounjaro.
6. If there are air bubbles in the syringe, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger up until there is no more air in the syringe.
7. Pull the syringe out of the vial stopper.
8. Before you make an injection, clean your skin.
9. Gently pinch and hold a fold of skin where you will inject.
10. Inject under the skin, as you have been instructed. Inject all the solution from the syringe to receive a full dose. After your injection, the needle should stay under your skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full dose.
11. Pull the needle out of your skin.
12. Throw away the vial, used needle and syringe immediately after each injection in a puncture resistant container, or as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## Testing blood glucose levels

If you are using Mounjaro with a sulphonylurea or insulin, it is important that you test your blood glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (see section 2, 'Warnings and precautions').

## If you use more Mounjaro than you should

If you use more Mounjaro than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this medicine may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick.

## If you forget to use Mounjaro

If you forget to inject a dose and,

- it has been 4 days or less since you should have used Mounjaro, use it as soon as you remember. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day.
- If it has been more than 4 days since you should have used Mounjaro, skip the missed dose. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day.

Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. The minimum time between two doses must be at least 3 days.

## If you stop using Mounjaro

Do not stop using Mounjaro without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Mounjaro, and you have type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar levels can increase.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 1. What Mounjaro KwikPen is and what it is used for

Mounjaro contains an active substance called tirzepatide and is used to treat adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mounjaro reduces the level of sugar in the body only when the levels of sugar are high.

Mounjaro is also used to treat adults with obesity or overweight (with BMI of at least 27 kg/m2). Mounjaro influences appetite regulation, which may help you eat less food and reduce your body weight.

In type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro is used:

- -on its own when you can't take metformin (another diabetes medicine).
- -with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by injection.

Mounjaro is also used together with diet and exercise for weight loss and to help keep the weight under control in adults, who have:

- -a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or
- -a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health problems (such as prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood, breathing problems during sleep called 'obstructive sleep apnoea' or a history of heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems)

BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and obesity, Mounjaro can be used with or without positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy.

It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Mounjaro KwikPen

## Do not use Mounjaro KwikPen

- -if you are allergic to tirzepatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before using Mounjaro if:

- -you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer than normal (including severe gastroparesis).
- -you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which may cause severe pain in the stomach and back which does not go away).
- -you have a problem with your eyes (diabetic retinopathy or macular oedema).
- -you are using a sulphonylurea (another diabetes medicine) or insulin for your diabetes, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these other medicines to reduce this risk.

When starting treatment with Mounjaro, in some cases you may experience loss of fluids/dehydration, e.g. due to vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea, which may lead to a decrease in kidney function. It is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.

If you know that you are due to have surgery where you will be under anaesthesia (sleeping), please tell your doctor that you are taking Mounjaro.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Mounjaro

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. This medicine should not be used during pregnancy as the effects of this medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception while using this medicine.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether tirzepatide passes into breast milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be ruled out. If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you should stop breast-feeding or delay using Mounjaro.

## Driving and using machines

It is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you use Mounjaro in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

signs of low blood sugar, e.g. headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling hungry, confusion, irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating (see section 4). See section 2, 'Warnings and precautions' for information on increased risk of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information.

## Mounjaro KwikPen contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Mounjaro KwikPen contains benzyl alcohol

This medicine contains 5.4 mg benzyl alcohol in each 0.6 ml dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding or if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

## 3. How to use Mounjaro KwikPen

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine.

A small amount of medicine may remain in the pen after all doses have been correctly given. Do not try to use any remaining medicine. After administration of four doses, the pen must be properly discarded.

## How much to use

- The starting dose is 2.5 mg once a week for four weeks. After four weeks your doctor will increase your dose to 5 mg once a week.
- Your doctor may increase your dose by 2.5 mg increments to 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg or 15 mg once a week if you need it. In each case your doctor will tell you to stay on a particular dose for at least 4 weeks before going to a higher dose.

Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to.

## Choosing when to use Mounjaro

You can use your pen at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same day each week if you can. To help you remember, when to use Mounjaro, you may wish to mark it on a calendar.

If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly Mounjaro injection, as long as it has been at least 3 days since your last injection. After selecting a new dosing day, continue with once-a-week dosing on that new day.

## How to inject Mounjaro KwikPen

Mounjaro is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) at least 5 cm from the belly button or upper leg (thigh) or upper arm. You may need help from someone else if you want to inject in your upper arm.

If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a different injection site within that area. If you also inject insulin choose a different injection site for that injection.

Read the 'Instructions for Use' for the pen carefully before using Mounjaro KwikPen.

## Testing blood glucose levels

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using Mounjaro with a sulphonylurea or insulin, it is important that you test your blood glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (see section 2, 'Warnings and precautions').

## If you use more Mounjaro than you should

If you use more Mounjaro than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this medicine may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick.

## If you forget to use Mounjaro

If you forget to inject a dose and,

- it has been 4 days or less since you should have used Mounjaro, use it as soon as you remember. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day.
- If it has been more than 4 days since you should have used Mounjaro, skip the missed dose. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day.

Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. The minimum time between two doses must be at least 3 days.

## If you stop using Mounjaro

Do not stop using Mounjaro without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Mounjaro, and you have type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar levels can increase.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
