## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension for injection. White opalescent liquid suspension.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Bexsero is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from 2 months of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B. The impact of invasive disease in different age groups as well as the variability of antigen epidemiology for group B strains in different geographical areas should be considered when vaccinating. See section 5.1 for information on protection against specific group B strains. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## Method of administration

The vaccine is given by deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants or in the deltoid muscle region of the upper arm in older subjects.

Separate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is administered at the same time.

The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

As with other vaccines, administration of Bexsero should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as cold, should not result in the deferral of vaccination.

Do not inject intravascularly.

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection (see section 4.8). It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

This vaccine should not be given to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration.

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Bexsero may not protect all vaccine recipients. Bexsero is not expected to provide protection against all circulating meningococcal group B strains (see section 5.1).

As with many vaccines, healthcare professionals should be aware that a temperature elevation may occur following vaccination of infants and children (less than 2 years of age). Prophylactic administration of antipyretics at the time of and closely after vaccination can reduce the incidence and intensity of post-vaccination febrile reactions. Antipyretic medication should be initiated according to local guidelines in infants and children (less than 2 years of age).

Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic disorder, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active immunisation.

Immunogenicity data are available in individuals with complement deficiencies, asplenia, or splenic dysfunctions (see section 5.1).

Individuals with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C3 or C5 deficiencies) and individuals receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination with Bexsero.

There are no data on the use of Bexsero in subjects above 50 years of age and limited data in patients with chronic medical conditions.

The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours should be considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.

Kanamycin is used in early manufacturing process and is removed during the later stages of manufacture. If present, kanamycin levels in the final vaccine are less than 0.01 micrograms per dose. The safe use of Bexsero in kanamycin-sensitive individuals has not been established.

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Use with other vaccines

Bexsero can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as monovalent or as combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and meningococcal groups A, C, W, Y conjugate.

Clinical studies demonstrated that the immune responses of the co-administered routine vaccines were unaffected by concomitant administration of Bexsero, based on non-inferior antibody response rates to the routine vaccines given alone. Inconsistent results were seen across studies for responses to inactivated poliovirus type 2 and pneumococcal conjugate serotype 6B and lower antibody titers to the pertussis pertactin antigen were also noted, but these data do not suggest clinically significant interference.

Due to an increased risk of fever, tenderness at the injection site, change in eating habits and irritability when Bexsero was co-administered with the above vaccines, separate vaccinations can be considered when possible. Prophylactic use of paracetamol reduces the incidence and severity of fever without affecting the immunogenicity of either Bexsero or routine vaccines. The effect of antipyretics other than paracetamol on the immune response has not been studied.

Concomitant administration of Bexsero with vaccines other than those mentioned above has not been studied.

When given concomitantly with other vaccines Bexsero must be administered at separate injection sites (see section 4.2).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Insufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.

The potential risk for pregnant women is unknown. Nevertheless, vaccination should not be withheld when there is a clear risk of exposure to meningococcal infection.

There was no evidence of maternal or foetal toxicity, and no effects on pregnancy, maternal behaviour, female fertility, or postnatal development in a study in which female rabbits received Bexsero at approximately 10 times the human dose equivalent based on body weights.

## Breast-feeding

Information on the safety of the vaccine to women and their children during breast-feeding is not available. The benefit-risk ratio must be examined before making the decision to immunise during breast-feeding.

No adverse reactions were seen in vaccinated maternal rabbits or in their offspring through day 29 of lactation. Bexsero was immunogenic in maternal animals vaccinated prior to lactation, and antibodies were detected in the offspring, but antibody levels in milk were not determined.

## Fertility

There are no data on fertility in humans.

There were no effects on female fertility in animal studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Bexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of Bexsero was evaluated in 17 studies including 10 randomised controlled clinical trials with 10 565 subjects (from 2 months of age) who received at least one dose of Bexsero. Among Bexsero recipients, 6 837 were infants and children (less than 2 years of age), 1 051 were children (2 to 10 years of age) and 2 677 were adolescents and adults. Of the subjects who received primary infant series of Bexsero, 3 285 received a booster dose in the second year of life.

In infants and children (less than 2 years of age) the most common local and systemic adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were tenderness and erythema at the injection site, fever and irritability.

In clinical studies in infants vaccinated at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, fever (≥ 38 °C) was reported by 69% to 79% of subjects when Bexsero was co-administered with routine vaccines (containing the following antigens: pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b) compared with 44% to 59% of subjects receiving the routine vaccines alone. Higher rates of antipyretic use were also reported for infants vaccinated with Bexsero and routine vaccines. When Bexsero was given alone, the frequency of fever was similar to that associated with routine infant vaccines administered during clinical trials. When fever occurred, it generally followed a predictable pattern, with the majority resolving by the day after vaccination.

In adolescents and adults, the most common local and systemic adverse reactions observed were pain at the injection site, malaise and headache.

No increase in the incidence or severity of the adverse reactions was seen with subsequent doses of the vaccination series.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions (following primary immunisation or booster dose) considered as being at least possibly related to vaccination have been categorised by frequency.

Frequencies are defined as follows:

Very common:

(≥ 1/10)

Common:

(≥1/10 0 to &lt;1/10)

Uncommon:

(≥1/1,00 0 to &lt;1/100)

Rare:

(≥1/10,00 0 to &lt;1/1,000)

Very rare:

(&lt;1/10,000)

Not known:

(cannot be estimated from the available data)

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

In addition to reports in clinical trials, worldwide voluntary reports of adverse reactions received for Bexsero since market introduction are included in the list. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency and they are consequently listed with the frequency unknown.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Experience of overdose is limited. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH09

## Mechanism of action

Immunisation with Bexsero is intended to stimulate the production of bactericidal antibodies that recognize the vaccine antigens NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA P1.4 (the immunodominant antigen present in the OMV component) and are expected to be protective against Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). As these antigens are variably expressed by different strains, meningococci that express them at sufficient levels are susceptible to killing by vaccine-elicited antibodies. The Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) was developed to relate antigen profiles of different strains of meningococcal group B bacteria to killing of the strains in the serum bactericidal assay with human complement (hSBA). A survey of approximately 1 000 different invasive meningococcal group B isolates collected during 2007-2008 in 5 European countries showed that, depending on the country of origin, between 73% and 87% of meningococcal group B isolates had an appropriate MATS antigen profile to be covered by the vaccine. Overall, 78% (95% CI: 63-90) of the approximately 1 000 strains were potentially susceptible to vaccine-induced antibodies.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of Bexsero has not been evaluated through clinical trials. Vaccine efficacy has been inferred by demonstrating the induction of serum bactericidal antibody responses to each of the vaccine antigens (see section Immunogenicity). Vaccine effectiveness and impact have been demonstrated in real-world settings.

Impact of vaccination on disease incidence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the UK, Bexsero was introduced into the national immunisation programme (NIP) in September 2015 using a two-dose schedule in infants (at 2 and 4 months of age) followed by a booster dose (at 12 months of age). In this context, Public Health England (PHE) conducted a 3-year observational study at the national level covering the entire birth cohort.

After three years of the programme, a statistically significant reduction of 75% [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0.25 (95% CI: 0.19-0.36)] in MenB IMD cases was observed in vaccine-eligible infants, irrespective of the infants' vaccination status or predicted meningococcal group B strain coverage.

In South Australia, more than 30 000 students aged 16 through 19 years (from 91% of high schools), received two doses of Bexsero with a one- to three-month interval. In an interrupted time-series analysis, a statistically significant reduction of 71% (95% CI: 15-90) in MenB IMD cases was observed in the two years of follow-up (July 2017-June 2019).

## Immunogenicity

Serum bactericidal antibody responses to each of the vaccine antigens NadA, fHbp, NHBA and PorA P1.4 were evaluated using a set of four meningococcal group B reference strains. Bactericidal antibodies against these strains were measured by the Serum Bactericidal Assay using human serum as the source of complement (hSBA). Data are not available from all vaccine schedules using the reference strain for NHBA.

Most of the primary immunogenicity studies were conducted as randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical trials. Immunogenicity was evaluated in infants, children, adolescents and adults.

## Immunogenicity in infants and children

In infant studies, participants received three doses of Bexsero either at 2, 4 and 6 or 2, 3 and 4 months of age and a booster dose in their second year of life, as early as 12 months of age. Sera were obtained both before vaccination, one month after the third vaccination (see Table 2) and one month after booster vaccination (see Table 3). In an extension study the persistence of the immune response was assessed one year after the booster dose (see Table 3). The immunogenicity after two or three doses followed by a booster has been evaluated in infants 2 months to 5 months of age in another clinical study. The immunogenicity after two doses has been also documented in another study in infants 6 months to 8 months of age at enrolment (see Table 4).

Previously unvaccinated children also received two doses in the second year of life, with antibody persistence being measured at one year after the second dose (see Table 4).

## Immunogenicity in infants 2 months to 5 months of age

## Three-dose primary series followed by a booster

Immunogenicity results at one month after three doses of Bexsero administered at 2, 3, 4 and 2, 4, 6 months of age are summarised in Table 2. Bactericidal antibody responses one month after the third vaccination against meningococcal reference strains were high against the fHbp, NadA and PorA P1.4 antigens at both Bexsero vaccination schedules. The bactericidal responses against the NHBA antigen were also high in infants vaccinated at the 2, 4, 6-month schedule, but this antigen appeared to be less immunogenic at the 2, 3, 4-month schedule. The clinical consequences of the reduced immunogenicity of the NHBA antigen at this schedule are not known.

A decline in antibody titers to PorA P1.4 and fHbp antigens (reaching 9%-10% and 12%-20% of subjects with an hSBA ≥ 1:5, respectively) has been observed in an additional study in children 4 years of age who received a full priming and booster schedule as infants. In the same study the response to a further dose was indicative of immunological memory as 81%-95% of subjects reached an hSBA ≥ 1:5 to PorA P1.4 and 97%-100% to fHbp antigens following further vaccination. The clinical significance of this observation and the need for additional booster doses to maintain longer term protective immunity has not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Two-dose primary series followed by a booster

The immunogenicity after two primary doses (at 3 and a half and 5 months of age) or three primary doses (at 2 and a half, 3 and a half and 5 months of age) of Bexsero followed by a booster dose in infants starting vaccination between 2 and 5 months of age has been evaluated in an additional phase 3 clinical study. The percentages of seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 1:4) ranged from 44% to 100% one month after the second dose and from 55% to 100% one month after the third dose. At one month following a booster administered 6 months after the last dose, the percentages of seropositive subjects ranged from 87% to 100% for the two-dose schedule, and from 83% to 100% for the three-dose schedule.

Antibody persistence was evaluated in an extension study in children 3 to 4 years of age. Comparable percentages of subjects were seropositive at 2 to 3 years after being previously vaccinated with either two doses followed by a booster of Bexsero (ranging from 35% to 91%) or three doses followed by a booster (ranging from 36% to 84%). In the same study the response to an additional dose administered 2 to 3 years after the booster was indicative of immunological memory as shown by a robust antibody response against all Bexsero antigens, ranging from 81% to 100% and from 70% to 99%, respectively. These observations are consistent with adequate priming in infancy with both a two-dose and a threedose primary series followed by a booster of Bexsero.

## Immunogenicity in infants 6 to 11 months and children 12 to 23 months of age

The immunogenicity after two doses administered two months apart in children 6 months to 23 months of age has been documented in two studies whose results are summarised in Table 4. Against each of the vaccine antigens, seroresponse rates and hSBA GMTs were high and similar after the two-dose series in infants 6-8 months of age and children 13-15 months of age. Data on antibody persistence one year after the two doses at 13 and 15 months of age are also summarised in Table 4.

## Immunogenicity in children 2 to 10 years of age

The immunogenicity after two doses of Bexsero administered either one or two months apart in children 2 to 10 years of age has been evaluated in an initial phase 3 clinical study and its extension. In the initial study, whose results are summarised in Table 5, participants received two doses of Bexsero two months apart. The seroresponse rates and hSBA GMTs were high after the two-dose schedule in children against each of the vaccine antigens (Table 5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the extension study, in which two doses of Bexsero were administered one month apart in unvaccinated children, high percentages of subjects were seropositive one month after the second dose. An early immune response after the first dose was also evaluated. The percentages of seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 1:4) across strains ranged from 46% to 95% at one month after the first dose and from 69% to 100% at one month after the second dose (Table 6).

The same extension study also evaluated antibody persistence and the response to a booster dose in children who received the two-dose primary series at 2-5 or 6-10 years of age. After 24-36 months, the percentages of seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 1:4) declined, ranging across strains from 21% to 74% in children 4-7 years of age and from 47% to 86% in children 8-12 years of age. The response to a booster dose administered 24-36 months after the primary series was indicative of immunological memory as the percentages of seropositive subjects ranged across strains from 93% to 100% in children 4-7 years of age and from 96% to 100% in children 8-12 years of age.

## Immunogenicity in adolescents (from 11 years of age) and adults

Adolescents received two doses of Bexsero with one, two or six-month intervals between doses; these data are summarised in Tables 7 and 8.

In studies with adults, data were obtained after two doses of Bexsero with a one-month or two-month interval between doses (see Table 9).

The vaccination schedules of two doses administered with an interval of one or two months showed similar immune responses in both adults and adolescents. Similar responses were also observed for adolescents administered two doses of Bexsero with an interval of six months.

** GMT = geometric mean titer.

In the study in adolescents, bactericidal responses following two doses of Bexsero were stratified by baseline hSBA less than 1:4 or equal to or greater than 1:4. Seroresponse rates and percentages of subjects with at least a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer from baseline to one month after the second dose of Bexsero are summarised in Table 8. Following Bexsero vaccination, a high percentage of subjects were seropositive and achieved 4-fold increases in hSBA titers independent of pre-vaccination status.

* % seropositive = the percentage of subjects who achieved an hSBA ≥ 1:4.

Antibody persistence data for the study in adolescents were obtained in an extension phase 3 study. At approximately 7.5 years after the two-dose primary series, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:4 declined, ranging across strains from 29% to 84%. The response to a booster dose administered 7.5 years after the primary series was indicative of immunological memory as the percentages of subjects reaching an hSBA ≥ 1:4 across strains ranged from 93% to 100%. The same study also evaluated antibody persistence data from an additional phase 3 initial study in adolescents. At approximately 4 years after the two-dose primary series, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:5 generally declined from a range across strains of 68% to 100% after the second dose to a range across strains of 9% to 84%. The response to a booster dose administered 4 years after the primary series was indicative of immunological memory as the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:5 ranged across strains from 92% to 100%.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child receive this medicine because it contains important information for you or your child.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only.
- -If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What Bexsero is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you or your child receive Bexsero
3. How to use Bexsero
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Bexsero
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What BEXSERO is and what it is used for

Bexsero is a Meningococcal group B Vaccine.

Bexsero contains four different components from the surface of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis group B.

Bexsero is given to individuals from 2 months of age and older to help protect against disease caused by the Neisseria meningitidis group B bacteria. These bacteria can cause serious, and sometimes life-threatening, infections such as meningitis (inflammation of the covering of the brain and spinal cord) and sepsis (blood poisoning).

The vaccine works by specifically stimulating the body's natural defense system of the vaccinated person. This results in protection against the disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you or your child receive BEXSERO

## Do NOT use Bexsero

- -if you or your child are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child receive Bexsero:

- -if you or your child have a severe infection with a high temperature. If this is the case, then vaccination will be postponed. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require postponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first.
- -if you or your child have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from clotting properly, such as treatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants). Talk to your doctor or nurse first.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -if you or your child receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as complement activation, such as eculizumab. Even if you or your child have been vaccinated with Bexsero you or your child remain at increased risk of disease caused by the Neisseria meningitidis group B bacteria.
- -if your child was born prematurely (before or at 28 weeks of pregnancy), particularly if they had breathing difficulties. Stopping breathing or irregular breathing for a short time may be more common in the first three days following vaccination in these babies and they may need special monitoring.
- -if you or your child have an allergy to the antibiotic kanamycin. If present, the kanamycin level in the vaccine is low. If you or your child may have an allergy to kanamycin, talk to your doctor or nurse first.

Fainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously.

There are no data on the use of Bexsero in adults above 50 years of age. There are limited data on the use of Bexsero in patients with chronic medical conditions or with weakened immunity. If you or your child have weakened immunity (for example, due to the use of immunosuppressive medications, or HIV infection, or hereditary defects of the body's natural defence system), it is possible that the effectiveness of Bexsero is reduced.

As with any vaccine, Bexsero may not fully protect all of those who are vaccinated.

## Other medicines and Bexsero

Tell your doctor or nurse if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines, or have recently received any other vaccine.

Bexsero can be given at the same time as any of the following vaccine components: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), Haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and meningococcus A, C, W, Y. Talk to your doctor or nurse for further information.

When given at the same time with other vaccines Bexsero must be given at separate injection sites.

Your doctor or nurse may ask you to give your child medicines that lower fever at the time and after Bexsero has been given. This will help to reduce some of the side effects of Bexsero.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before Bexsero is given. Your doctor may still recommend that you receive Bexsero if you are at risk of exposure to meningococcal infection.

## Driving and using machines

Bexsero has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4 'Possible side effects' may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## Bexsero contains sodium chloride

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use BEXSERO

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bexsero (0.5 ml) will be given to you or your child by a doctor or nurse. It will be injected into a muscle, usually the thigh for infants or the upper arm for children, adolescents and adults.

It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that you or your child completes the course of injections.

## Infants 2 months to 5 months of age at the time of first dose

Your child should receive an initial course of two or three injections of the vaccine followed by an additional injection (booster).

- -The first injection should be given no earlier than 2 months of age.
- -If three initial doses are given, the interval between injections should be at least 1 month.
- -If two initial doses are given, the interval between injections should be at least 2 months.
- -A booster will be given between 12 months and 15 months of age after an interval of at least 6 months from the last injection of the initial course. In case of delay, the booster should not be given later than 24 months of age.
