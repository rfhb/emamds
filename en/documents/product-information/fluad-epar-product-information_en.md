Fluad may contain traces of eggs such as ovalbumin or chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) which are used during the manufacturing process (see section 4.3).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection). Milky-white suspension.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Prophylaxis of influenza in adults 50 years of age and older.

Fluad should be used in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

One 0.5 ml dose.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Fluad in children from birth to less than 18 years has not been established. Currently available safety and immunogenicity data in children from 6 months to less than 6 years of age are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on posology can be made.

## Method of administration

For intramuscular injection only.

The preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.

The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

For instructions for preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the components of the adjuvant, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible trace residues such as ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and hydrocortisone.

A severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in patients with febrile illness until the fever is resolved.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with all injectable vaccines, Fluad must be administered with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

## Immunocompromised patients

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to prevent influenza.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## Potassium

This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No clinical data on concomitant administration of Fluad with other vaccines are available. If Fluad is to be used at the same time as another vaccine, it should be administered at separate injection sites and preferably on different limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified by any co-administration.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

This medicine is not indicated in women of childbearing potential (see section 4.1). It is not to be used in women who are, or may be, pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of Fluad in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Fluad has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

Data for the adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluad Tetra) are relevant to Fluad because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

## Summary of the safety profile

Safety in adults 50 to less than 65 years of age, and elderly 65 years of age and older was assessed in 4 clinical studies. In these studies, 9 729 subjects received Fluad (N=3 545, Study V70\\_27), an adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N=5 296, Studies V118\\_18, V118\\_20 and V118\\_23) or one of two formulations of an adjuvanted trivalent comparator (N=888).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most commonly reported (≥10%) adverse reactions in adults 50 to less than 65 years of age who received adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine were injection site pain (47%), fatigue (30%), headache (22%), arthralgia (14%) and myalgia (13%).

The most commonly reported (≥10%) adverse reactions in subjects 65 years of age who received Fluad, adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine or adjuvanted trivalent comparators were injection site pain (32%), injection site tenderness (21%), fatigue (16%), myalgia (15%) and headache (13%).

Most reactions were reported as mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within the first 3 days after vaccination.

.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 -&lt;1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 -&lt;1/100); Frequency not known.

## Paediatric population

Fluad is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2. Safety information in the paediatric population is presented in section 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are limited post-marketing data for Fluad in the paediatric population.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdosage is unlikely to have any untoward effect.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02

## Mechanism of action

Fluad provides active immunisation against the influenza virus strains contained in the vaccine. Fluad induces humoral antibodies against the haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. Specific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus, but the HI antibody titres have been used as a measure of vaccine efficacy. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype.

Fluad contains the adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59), which is designed to increase and broaden the antigenspecific immune response and to extend the duration of the immune response.

Annual revaccination with influenza vaccines is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus may change from year to year.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Immunogenicity in the elderly population 65 years of age and older

Study V70\\_27 was a large Phase 3, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multi-centre study conducted in 2010-2011 to evaluate the immunogenicity, the safety and the consistency of three consecutive lots of Fluad in comparison to non-adjuvanted vaccine. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to receive a single 0.5 mL dose of 1 of 3 consecutive lots of Fluad or a single lot of a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. All subjects were followed for approximately one year postvaccination.

A total of 7 082 subjects were randomised and vaccinated, including 3 541 subjects in each of the pooled Fluad and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. A total of 2 573 subjects (1 300 in Fluad and 1 273 in non-adjuvanted vaccine group) were regarded as 'high risk' subjects (underlying chronic diseases including congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hepatic disease, renal insufficiency and/or neurological/neuromuscular or metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective of superiority of Fluad versus non-adjuvanted vaccine was not achieved for all homologous strains; the co-primary objective of non-inferiority of Fluad versus non-adjuvanted vaccine was achieved for all homologous strains; however significantly higher HI titre rates against all three homologous strains of influenza at day 22 post vaccination were seen in subjects that received Fluad compared with non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Table 2). The results were similar for high-risk subjects with predefined comorbidities.

In addition, in a subset of subjects (n=1 649 subjects), Fluad was compared to the non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine for heterologous strains, i.e. influenza variants of the same type/subtype that were not included in the vaccine composition (secondary objective). Superiority of Fluad as compared to nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine was not achieved for all 3 heterologous strains at day 22; however non-inferiority  was  demonstrated  for  all  3  heterologous  strains  at  day  22.  Results  were  similar  for high-risk subjects (609 subjects).

Immunogenicity of adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the adult population 50 to less than 65 years of age

Data for adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine are relevant to Fluad because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

Immunogenicity of adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine in adults 50 to less than 65 years of age was evaluated in Study V118\\_23. This was a randomised, observer-blind, controlled, multi-centre clinical study conducted in the US, Germany and Estonia, during the 2021-22 Northern Hemisphere season. In this study, adults 50 to less than 65 years of age who were healthy or had comorbidities that increased their risk of hospitalisation for influenza-associated complications, were enrolled to receive one dose of either adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N=1027) or a non-adjuvanted

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

quadrivalent comparator influenza vaccine (N=1017). The mean age of subjects enrolled in the adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine group was 57.8 years and females represented 62% of subjects.

The immunogenicity endpoints assessed 3 weeks after vaccination were HI GMT and HI seroconversion rate (pre-vaccination HI titre &lt;1:10 and postvaccination HI titre ≥ 1:40 or at least a 4-fold increase in HI from prevaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10).  As was seen in studies in older adults with aTIV (see above study V70\\_27), adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine elicited higher immune responses compared to a non-adjuvanted quadrivalent comparator influenza vaccine although superiority of adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine versus non-adjuvanted vaccine was not achieved for all four homologous strains. The HI GMT ratios (comparator/ adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine ) ranged from 0.80 to 0.99 with the highest limit of the 95% CI of 1.07 and differences in HI seroconversion rates (comparator - adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine) ranged from 4.5% to -1.8% with the highest limit of the 95% CI of 2.5%.

## Paediatric Population (6 months to less than 6 years)

Fluad is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2.

Efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine was evaluated in clinical study V118\\_05, a multi-centre, randomised, observer-blinded, controlled study conducted in the 2013-14 (season 1) and 2014-15 (season 2) Northern Hemisphere seasons in children of 6 months to less than 6 years. Children less than 3 years of age received 0.25 ml vaccine, older children received 0.5 ml vaccine. Children naïve to prior influenza vaccination received two doses of vaccine, at least 4 weeks apart. 10,644 children were enrolled and randomised to receive adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine or the non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine in a 1:1 ratio: 5,352 children were enrolled in the adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine group and 5,292 children in the nonadjuvanted comparator vaccine group.

## Immunogenicity in the paediatric population

A subset of children enrolled in this study was evaluated for their immunological response to adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine and the non-adjuvanted comparator. Immunogenicity assessments were performed prior to (each) vaccination and 3 weeks after the last vaccination. A total of 2886 children were included in the subset for immunogenicity evaluation (adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine: N=1481; non -adjuvanted comparator vaccine: N=1405).

Adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine demonstrated a higher immune response compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine. In addition, in children naïve to influenza vaccination antibody titres 4 weeks after the first vaccination as well as 3 weeks after the second vaccination were greater in subjects who received adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine.

At 12 months post-vaccination, persistence of the immune response was higher in the adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine group compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator group.

## Efficacy in the paediatric population

Vaccine efficacy was assessed for the prevention of first-occurrence laboratory confirmed influenza associated with symptomatic influenza-like illness (ILI). Influenza-like illness was defined as fever of 37.8°C or above along with any of the following: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or runny nose occurring at ≥ 21 days and ≤ 180 days after the last vaccination or until the end of the influenza season, whichever was longer. Subjects with ILI had nasopharyngeal swabs collected and tested for influenza A (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and B (both lineages) by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 508 cases of first-occurrence RT-PCR confirmed influenza occurred during the study; 10 during season one and 498 during season two. The maj ority of influenza cases were A/H3N2. Based on antigenic typing, more than ninety percent of A/H3N2 strains from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

season two were determined to be antigenically distinct from egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012, the H3N2 vaccine strain.

Vaccine efficacy compared to the non-adjuvanted influenza comparator vaccine was assessed. The relative vaccine (rVE) efficacy between adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine and the comparator vaccine group in subjects ≥6 to &lt;72 months of age was -0.67 [95% CI: -19.81; 15.41]), which did not meet the primary objective of the study.

## 1. What Fluad is and what it is used for

Fluad is a vaccine against flu (influenza).

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

Fluad is used to prevent flu in adults 50 years of age and older.

The vaccine targets strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World Health Organisation for the 2025/2026 Season.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Fluad

- -If you have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Fluad.

## BEFORE receiving the vaccine

- Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration. This reaction may occur with Fluad as with all vaccines that are injected.
- You should tell your doctor if you have an illness associated with fever. Your doctor may decide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see Section 'Other medicines and Fluad').
- You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.
- Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.

As with all vaccines, Fluad may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.
