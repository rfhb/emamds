## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

Many patients (30 to 40% of the overall population with epilepsy) continue to have seizures in spite of receiving antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The prevalence of active epilepsy, 5-10/1000, is one of the highest among serious neurological disorders with more than 50 million people affected worldwide. Two peaks of incidence are observed, in early childhood and among elderly people. Some patients will have life-long epilepsy.

International  classifications,  such  as  the  International  League  Against  Epilepsy  (ILAE)  classification recognise many epileptic diseases or syndromes and each of them can be expressed clinically by one or several seizure groupings. Partial epilepsies (localisation related) are the more frequent, accounting for more  than  60%  of  the  epilepsies,  and  they  include  most  of  the  difficult-to-treat  patients.  In  terms  of seizure types, partial epilepsies include simple partial seizures (without impairment of consciousness), complex partial seizures (with impairment of consciousness and often more disabling) and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The symptoms are a function of the localisation of the site of seizure onset in the brain (epileptogenic zone) and of the propagation pathways of the abnormal discharge.

Therapeutic  management  usually  follows  a  staged  approach  with  newly  diagnosed  patients  starting prophylactic treatment with a single drug, and several alternative drugs may be tried in the event of lack of  efficacy  or  poor  tolerability.  For  patients  not  responding  to  several  attempts  of  monotherapy, combinations of antiepileptic drugs are generally employed early in the management process.

Uncontrolled  epilepsy  is  associated  with  cognitive  deterioration,  psychosocial  dysfunction,  dependent behaviour,  restricted  lifestyle,  poor  quality  of  life  and  excess  mortality,  in  particular  from  sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP).

Combination therapy is the preferred strategy in the management of difficult-to-control epilepsies and the  recent  introduction  of  several  new  AEDs  has  considerably  increased  the  number  of  possible combinations.    The  rational  basis  for  combining  AEDs  is  largely  based  upon  their  modes  of  action, although these mechanisms are not fully understood for some drugs.

The efficacy of the newer AEDs in adjunctive therapy trials is often evaluated in terms of percentages of responders, a responder being defined as a patient experiencing a ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency over  a  certain  period  of  time.    Responder  rates  on  treatment  range  between  20%  and  50%  in  recent controlled studies; however responder rates obtained on placebo, ranging from 6-18%, should be taken into account when evaluating the actual effect of the drug.

This  intended  indication  of  Zonegran  was  the  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial  seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults and adolescents over 12 years with epilepsy.

## The development programme

The development of Zonegran is somewhat complicated. Dainippon Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Dainippon)  in  Japan  and  Europe  and  Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis  (WL)  in  the  United States  (US) initiated  the  earliest clinical studies with zonisamide.  Subsequently, WL discontinued development of zonisamide in 1987 and Dainippon assumed responsibility for its development in the US and conducted studies during the period up to 1997.  Athena Neurosciences (now Elan) acquired rights to zonisamide in 1997.  Since 1998, Elan has managed the development programme in Europe and the US.

Zonisamide is currently marketed as Zonegran  in  the  US  (since  2000)  and  as  Excegran  in  Japan and Korea (since 1989 and 1990, respectively).  It received regulatory approval in Mexico in 2002.

A  European  marketing  authorisation  application  submitted  in  1997  was  withdrawn  and  in  1999,  the applicant sought scientific advice from the Committee for Proprietary Medical Products (CPMP) on the further development of zonisamide.

Zonegran has been subject of a centralised procedure in 1998. The application was withdrawn due to major deficiencies in that dossier. The studies were not in accordance to the past (adopted in 1989) and revised  NfG  (adopted  end  2000)  concerning  anti-epileptic  agents. Especially, the  duration of the two most important studies submitted was too short for an efficacy assessment. Subsequently a new clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study has been conducted also in response to the regulatory advice given by the CPMP (scientific advice October 1999). This new study is study 302 which was conducted between 2000-02

Although the  current  NfG  concerning  anti-epileptic agents was adopted end 2000 the revised version was  in  full  development  at  the  time  (1999)  of  the  scientific  advice  (1999).  Therefore  this  advice reflected  the  recommendations  of  the  current  revised  NfG.  In  summary,  for  the  add-on  indication  a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study design was recommended. The study should  include  a  run-in  period,  a  titration  period,  a  maintenance  period  of  at  least  12  weeks  and  a controlled withdrawal period. Baseline seizure frequency should be sufficiently high, concomitant antiepileptic therapy should be stable after the titration period. The rationale behind the maintenance period of  12  week  is  that  it  generates  stable  conditions.  Such  period  allows  assessment  of  whether  the conditions are indeed stable, to assess the variability of the response, to assess whether efficacy is not short lasting and to assess whether tolerance on the short term does not develop. Endpoint should be the responders' analysis but the (median) percent change in seizure frequency is also considered crucial as both  facilitate  the  assessment  of  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  effect.  After  the  maintenance period, a controlled withdrawal period is recommended wherein the test and the placebo are gradually phased out and the occurrence of a rebound and withdrawal effects are evaluated. With respect to longterm  data,  the  continuation  or  extension  of  add-on  studies  is  necessary  in  order  to  assess  the maintenance of safety and absence of tolerance in the long term. A one-year duration may be required.

## General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP and agreed ethical principles.

Many  of  the  pre-clinical  studies  were  performed  prior  to  implementation  of  the  standardised  GLP guidelines, or were performed according to older Japanese guidelines. A few pivotal safety studies were performed  according  to  GLP  standards.  However,  the  studies  are  adequate  to  assess  the  effects  of zonisamide in animals and to estimate the potential effects in human.

There are no GMP concerns; the manufacturing site is within the EEA and is appropriately authorised for the pharmaceutical form.

It  is  stated  that  all  studies  initiated  after  1995  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  Good  Clinical Practice  (GCP)  and  since  January 1997  have  been  in  compliance  with  International  Conference  on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95).  Studies initiated prior to the effective date of Good Clinical Practice regulations were conducted in accordance with the relevant standards at the time.

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

Zonegran is presented in the form of hard capsules, and contains 25, 50 and 100 mg of zonisamide as active  substance.  Other  ingredients  are  microcrystalline  cellulose,  hydrogenated  vegetable  oil  and sodium  laurilsulfate,  gelatin,  titanium  dioxide  (E171),  Allura  red  AC  (E129)  (100  mg  only),  Sunset yellow FCF (E110) (100 mg only), shellac, propylene glycol, potassium hydroxide, and black iron oxide (E172).

The capsules are packaged in PVC/PCTFE (Aclar)/aluminium blisters.

## Drug Substance

Zonisamide is a white to pale yellow crystals or a crystalline powder, which is very slightly soluble in water. Zonisamide does not contain any optically active centres, and therefore, it does not exhibit any optical isomerism. The active substance is not hygroscopic.

- Manufacture

Information on zonisamide has been supplied in the form of an active substance master file ('ASMF /EDMF').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specification

The active  substance  specification  includes  test  for  description,  identification  (UV,  IR),  particle  size, assay (HPLC, 98.0% - 102.0%), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals, loss on drying, residue on ignition, microbial limit, etc.

The specifications  reflect  all  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  active  substance  and  were  found  to  be adequate to control the quality of the drug substance.

Batch  analysis  data  of  a  number of batches of active substance (n=20) are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

## · Stability

Three batches made by the original route and three by other route were placed on stability, stored in the packaging described above under both long-term and accelerated conditions.   Five years' data on the original lots are available under long-term conditions and 24 months on the new route lots.  Six months' data are available on all lots stored under accelerated conditions.

Stress  testing  was  carried  out  on  one  batch  from  the  original  synthetic  route,  at  50°C,  humidity conditions of 30°C/90 % RH and exposed to 500 lux light. The related substances method differed from that proposed; details of the method are given, as well as validation results for specificity, LOD, LOQ, relative response, linearity, precision, and stability of solutions.

The results show that zonisamide is a very stable compound, with no discernible degradation occurring under the test conditions.  The proposed re-test period with no special storage condition is acceptable.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The aim of development was to maximise the rate of dissolution by optimising drug particle size, improve wettability and use a suitable diluent. Hard capsules were also developed due to the bitter taste of the active substance.  Adequate  information  has  been  provided  on  the  development  of  the  capsules.    Dissolution results indicate that the aim of the formulation development was achieved.

The capsules have been manufactured by a number of manufacturing sites.  The changes in manufacturing site are supported by comparative dissolution testing which showed that the dissolution profiles are equivalent.

Other  than  the  colour  of  the  capsules,  the  commercial  formulation  has  been  used  in  all  Phase  III  studies. Earlier formulations were also capsules with qualitatively and quantitatively slightly different formulations.

The excipients used in the finished product are microcrystalline cellulose, hydrogenated vegetable oil, sodium  laurilsulfate,  gelatin,  titanium  dioxide  (E171),  Allura  red  AC  (E129)  (100  mg  only),  Sunset yellow FCF (E110) (100 mg only), shellac, propylene glycol, potassium hydroxide, and black iron oxide (E172). Excipients are tested to PhEur monographs or BP in the case of hydrogenated vegetable oil that is  not  in the Ph. Eur.    The only substance of animal origin is gelatin; TSE certificates of suitability were provided.  Sodium laurilsulphate is not of animal origin.

The blister material proposed is a two-component thermoformable laminate of PVC and

PCTFE. The material complies with PhEur requirements.

- Manufacture of the Product

The  manufacturing  process  involves  milling  of  the  drug  substance,  wet  mixing,  drying,  dry  mixing,  and blending, and encapsulation.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the manufacturing process . The manufacturing process has adequately been validated and is satisfactory. The in process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

The  commercial  scale  three  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  hard  capsules  can  be  manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Product Specification

The  specification  includes  tests  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  identification  (FTIR,  HPLC), assay  (HPLC,  95.0%-105%),  uniformity  of  content  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  dissolution test (Ph Eur), identification of colours.

The test and limits of the specification for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality of this medicinal product for the intended purpose.

Batch data are provided for pilot and production batches and indicate satisfactory uniformity as well as compliance with the specification.

## · Stability of the Product

The shelf life specification contains tests for appearance, assay, related substances and dissolution, with limits which are the same as those in the release specification.

A number of batches from pilot-scale to commercial scale and manufactured by different manufacturer sites were place on stability according to the ICH Guidelines. Supporting stability studies, photostability studies and stress testing studies were also provided.

Results have been generated by validated, stability indicating methods and indicate satisfactory stability. These results support the shelf life and storage conditions stated in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of  important  product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

This  application  for  Zonegran  relies  heavily  on  published  material.  The  pharmacodynamic  and phamaco-kinetic studies are old and fall short of GLP standards, e.g. analytical methods are not well defined, but do give a picture of the disposition of zonisamide.

## Introduction

Many of the pharmacology studies presented are in the form of published papers. Many of the toxicology studies  were  performed  prior  to  implementation  of  standardised  GLP  guidelines,  others  were  carried  out according to the older Japanese guidelines (e.g. in chronic studies animals were dosed 5 times a week rather than daily). A few pivotal safety studies were done to current GLP standards.  Despite these deficiencies, the studies conducted appear adequate to assess the effects of zonisamide in laboratory animals and to support its potential effects in man.

## Pharmacology

Zonisamide  is  an  anti-epileptic  medicine  with  weak  carbonic  anhydrase  activity in-vitro . It is chemically unrelated to other anti-epileptic agents. It has a blocking action on voltage sensitive sodium and  calcium  channels,  which  is  thought  to  disrupt  synchronised  neuronal  firing,  and  so  reduces  the spread of seizure discharges and disrupts subsequent epileptic activity.  It also has a modulatory effect on GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition as well as a variety of other effects, which may contribute to its pharmacological effects.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

The non-clinical pharmacodynamics and pharmacological activity of zonisamide has been demonstrated in  various in  vitro studies  including  binding  assays  screening  for  a  range  of  receptors  and  in experimental models using several different animal species. The models include the inhibition of neuroprotective mechanisms, stimulation of cortical and subcortical structures by trauma, irritant substances

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or  by  electrical  stimulation  (either  in  the  form  of  maximum  electroshock  seizures  or  as  kindling)  and evaluation  in  animals  genetically  predisposed  to  seizures.  The  result  is  the  development  of  motor seizures comparable to those observed in epileptic patients. Experimental models in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and cats employed different stimuli leading to convulsions. Results of studies, plus a review of literature, were summarised by the applicant.

## Anticonvulsive activity

Based on animal model data, zonisamide appears to possess a broad anticonvulsant profile and thus a broad  mechanistic  profile.  Efficacy was  primarily  defined  as  anticonvulsant activity against maximal electroconvulsive seizures (MES), and neurotoxicity (uncoordinated motor function, ataxia, sedation). The results of these studies indicated that the therapeutic window between minimum doses and plasma concentrations required for efficacy and those resulting in toxicity is larger for zonisamide than for a range of other anticonvulsant drugs

## Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action of zonisamide is not known, but inhibition of seizure propagation appears to be related at least in part to its ability to both block voltage sensitive sodium and voltage sensitive, T type  calcium  channels,  thus  reducing  the  spread  of  seizure  discharges.  This  mixture  of  action  is comparable to that of other anticonvulsant drugs, such as phenytoin. The role of GABA in zonisamide induced inhibition of seizures is not clear. There does not seem to be a direct effect of zonisamide on GABA mediated  mechanism.  Other  studies  suggest  that  part  of  its  anticonvulsive  effects  may  be  by increasing  the  inhibitory  effects  of  GABA  by  either  affecting  GABA  binding  to  its  receptor  or increasing GABA release in the hippocampus. The effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase activity does not play a significant role in the anticonvulsant activity of the drug. Zonisamide also appears to increase synaptic concentrations of monoamines.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Studies have evaluated secondary pharmacodynamic actions of zonisamide, including the potential for neuroprotection, analgesia and to evaluate its actions as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.

Zonisamide appears to have significant neuroprotective effects in various animal models of epilepsy and ischemia, possibly independently of its anticonvulsant effects. Although the mechanism of action is not known, the  applicant suggested  that  zonisamide appears to protect neurons from free radical damage and to stabilise the neuronal membrane. At high doses ( ≥ 100 in rats, at 300 in mice) slight hypothermia was observed.

Some of the data from animal neuropathic pain models suggest that zonisamide may also have analgesic properties  in  certain  situations,  as  has  been  shown  for  other  anticonvulsant  drugs.  This  activity  is probably derived from zonisamide's effects on reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.

- Safety pharmacology

A series of safety pharmacology studies have been performed, including cardiovascular studies. These studies include both in vitro studies and studies conducted in vivo as part of repeated dose toxicology studies.

With regard to CNS safety, the median neurotoxic dose for zonisamide was twice that of carbamazepine and  three-fold  greater  than  that  for  phenytoin  and  phenobarbital.  Behavioural  studies  indicated  that carbamazepine  was  two  to  3-fold  more  potent  than  zonisamide  in  causing  behavioural  disturbances. However, rapid  high  loading  of zonisamide  at  doses  of  10,  25  or 40 mg/kg may inhibit spontaneous activity  in  the  rat,  whereas  gradual  dosing  had  no  unfavourable  effects  on  spontaneous  activity.  This observation would support the gradual introduction of zonisamide to humans.

As  regards  the  potential  for  sedation,  zonisamide  displayed  markedly  less  hypnotic  potential  in  mice than phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. Zonisamide was also less effective than these drugs in potentiating barbiturate hypnosis in mice; the potentiating effect of zonisamide was about one-tenth that of  phenytoin,  carbamazepine  or  phenobarbital.  Overall,  the  results  from  these  series  of  evaluations indicate that zonisamide shows little potential to produce adverse effects on the CNS at anticonvulsive doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effect on the cardiovascular system was evaluated by an in vitro study of the effects of the drug on the  current  in  the  cardiac  potassium  channel  hERG  applied  to  the  HEK293  cells  expressing  hERG.. Zonisamide at 500 µM (approximately equivalent to 100 mg/mL) did not inhibit hERG current.

The lack of cardiovascular effect was also shown in three separate repeated dose GLP safety studies in dogs, ranging in duration from one week to 52 weeks.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

An in  vivo pharmacodynamic drug interaction  study  was  performed,  evaluating  the  effect  of  chronic administration of phenobarbital on the anticonvulsant effects of zonisamide. Pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic drug interaction  studies  were performed  with  zonisamide in MES seizures in rats, indicating that repeated dosing with phenobarbital has fewer effects on the pharmacodynamic response to zonisamide than in the case of phenytoin or carbamazepine. Additional data from other studies evaluating the pharmacokinetic and phamacodynamic interactions of zonisamide with other drugs are summarized in the Pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic profile of zonisamide has been characterised in a series of studies performed by Dainippon  and  Warner  Lambert,  as  well  as  by  Elan  and  in  published  papers  from  laboratories  in Europe, North America and Japan in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys as well as in humans.

## · Absorption- Bioavailability

Tmax is about two-four hours in all species, with AUC and Cmax being dose-dependent. Plasma T1/2 in  rats,  dogs,  monkeys,  and  healthy  humans  is  8,  15,  24,  and  68  hours  respectively  and  the  site  and route  of  absorption  may  influence  the  rate,  but  not  the  extent  of  absorption.  The  plasma  zonisamide concentration  data  in  mice  and  rats  following  dietary  administration  provide  satisfactory  evidence  of systemic exposure in these species following administration via this route.

- Distribution

Zonisamide distributes evenly throughout the body with maximal tissue concentrations being observed three hours after dosing. Concentrations greater than those in plasma are observed in erythrocytes, brain and to a lesser degree, in most other tissues. In the brain, concentrations are higher in the cortex than in sub-cortical structures. Zonisamide binds in a reversible manner to carbonic anhydrase in blood, brain and  to  a  lesser  degree,  in  other  tissues.  This  accounts  for  the  greater  concentrations  in  these  tissues, compared  with  other  tissues  and  plasma.  Plasma  protein  binding  is  low.  Age  does  not  appear  to influence the distribution profile of zonisamide, other than a lower tissue concentration in neonatal rats that correlates with lower carbonic anhydrase protein concentrations. Zonisamide appears to distribute evenly in the foetus, with foetal tissue concentrations comparable to maternal tissues.

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo )

Zonisamide  is  readily  metabolised  following  oral  administration  with  little  first-pass  or  pre-systemic metabolism (except possibly increased pre-systemic metabolism in the mouse compared to other species, based  on  an  in  vitro  study  performed  with  gut  flora  of  various  species).  Zonisamide  is  metabolised primarily by CYP 3A4 with subsequent ring-opened sulphate and glucuronide conjugates accounting for 34% of urinary radioactivity whereas unchanged zonisamide accounts for 32% and does not induce its own  metabolism.  Metabolism  in  younger  rats,  compared  with  adult  rats  is  qualitatively  similar;  the observed quantitative differences are expected given known expression of drug metabolising enzymes in neonates.

## · Excretion

The  major  route  of  excretion  of  zonisamide  and  its  metabolites  is  via  urine.  Studies  in  rats,  dogs, primates and humans indicate that approximately 85% of the dose is excreted in urine within 96 hours of either single or repeated doses. The remaining 15% is excreted via the faeces. Studies in immature  rats  indicate  age  does  not  influence  the  route  of  excretion.  No  non-clinical  studies  of  the secretion  of  zonisamide  into  milk  have  been  performed.  Studies  in  lactating  mothers  have  shown secretion, with concentrations in breast milk approximating those in maternal plasma within a few days of delivery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

In  vitro and in  vivo drug interaction studies using zonisamide and the common anticonvulsant drugs; phenobarbital,  valproic  acid,  carbamazepine  and  phenytoin,  indicate  no  alteration  in  the  binding  and distribution  characteristics  of  zonisamide to plasma proteins or erythrocytes (Kimura, M et al, 1993, Kimura, M et al, 1992). Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly cytochromes of the CYP3A family, may enhance the metabolism of zonisamide in humans as demonstrated by work in rats pre-treated with phenobarbital, valproic acid, or carbamazepine (Kimura, M et al, 1992).

## Toxicology

Zonisamide toxicology programme included single dose studies in mice, adults or juvenile rats, dogs and monkeys; repeat-dose studies (diet and gavage) in mice (2, 4 and 13 week treatment), rats (1, 9 and 12 month  treatment)  and  dogs  (2  and  12  months);  full  set  of  genotoxicity  ( in  vitro and in  vivo ); reproductive toxicology (mice, rats, dogs, monkeys) studies; 2-year carcinogenicity evaluation in mice and rats (diet); antigenicity and environmental risk assessment studies. In addition special studies on the potential for dependence were performed.

## · Single dose toxicity

In mice, the LD50 was approximately 2000 mg/kg by oral route, and 850 mg/kg by IV. Onset of effects was rapid, 5-15 min depending on route of administration, survivors recovered in 48 hours. Recorded toxic effects were sedation, ataxia, reduced reflexes, coma, respiratory paralysis and death. Post-mortem observations were of distended bladder and gastro-intestinal (petechial haemorrhages). There were no distinct sex differences.

In  adult  rats  the  oral  LD 50 was  approximately  2000  mg/kg.  In  juvenile  animals,  the  oral  LD 50 was approximately 270 mg/kg at 1 day old, 400 mg/kg at 1 week old, 500 mg/kg at 2 weeks old and 1800 mg/kg at 4 weeks old. Clinical signs were also CNS-related, similar to mice but with a more rapid and marked onset in younger animals.

Non-rodent oral LD50 was approximately 1000 mg/kg in dogs and &gt;1000 mg/kg in monkeys. In dogs onset was in 1-4 hours, recovery in 2-4 days, observations were depression, emesis staggered gait, ataxia, prone position,  coma,  respiratory  depression,  loss  of  corneal  reflex,  death.  In  monkeys  onset  was  in  1-4  hours, recovery in 2-6 days, observations were staggered gait, poor co-ordination, nasal mucous discharge, emesis, prone position, loss of pain/corneal reflex, hypothermia, and anorexia.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

In mice, no mortality or drug related clinical signs were seen after 2 week of oral (diet) administration up to 800 mg/kg day. Sedation, ataxia and drowsiness were seen as an initial response, i.e. in the first week only in a 30 day oral toxicity study in females (a dose range finding study for reproductive toxicity tests) at dose levels of 200 and 600 mg/kg/day. In a 13 week study mice given up to 800 mg/kg/day in diet,  no behavioural changes nor histopathological changes were noted in contrast to the comparators phenobarbitone, diphenylhydantoin or carbamazepine used in the same study where hepatotoxicity was seen.

In the rat, a 4 week oral (diet) dose range finding/toxicity study at 0-50-100-200-300-600mg/kg/day did not result in mortality or abnormal behaviour patterns. At 600 mg/kg/day there was an increase in relative weight of  the  brain  and  liver  but  no  significant  drug  related pathology. NOAEL was given as 50 mg/kg/day, this would be expected to result in plasma levels of approximately 35 µ g/ml, less than 1.5-fold the efficacious plasma levels in man.

In  a  9-month  oral  study,  rats  were  given  0-10-30-100-300  mg/kg/day  zonisamide  or  300  mg/kg/day diphenylhydantoin,  and  a  6  week  recovery  group  was  included.  There  was  no  mortality.  At  doses  of  300 mg/kg/day  zonisamide  there was mild sedation, reduced muscle tone and slight ataxia. There was a slight increase in the relative weight of the liver and kidney with both zonisamide (at doses over 100 mg/kg/day) and diphenylhydantoin (these animals also had increased pituitary and thyroid weights).  There was no abnormal histopathology. The NOAEL was between 30-100 mg/kg/day, i.e. 1-4-fold the expected exposure in man.

In a chronic repeated dose study, rats (20/sex/group) were given 0-2-20-200 mg/kg/day (2ml/kg) orally for 1 year. In life observations included: dose related reduction in body weight gain, associated with reduced food consumption.  Fine  renal  pelvic  stones  were  found  in  four  top  dose  animals,  these  were  found  to  contain primarily magnesium phosphate. This effect may be due to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Histopathology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of the kidneys was comparable to controls. The NOAEL was given as 20 mg/kg/day, a dose which results in exposure levels equivalent to therapeutic exposure in man.

Animals in the two-month dog study were only dosed on six days per week at 0-10-30-100 mg/kg/day orally (gelatine capsules). There was sporadic emesis at the top dose, and a slight increase in liver and lung weight post-mortem, but no associated pathology. Plasma levels were measured 4 hours after the first (4.9-8.8/21.4-29.6/58.3-77.2 µ g/ml) and fourteenth (x1.5 over previous) dose and corresponded to 0.9-3-8-fold the minimum effective plasma level (12.6 µ g/ml) or 0.3-1.0-2.7-fold the anticipated mean therapeutic plasma level in man. The NOAEL is given as 30 mg/kg/day.

In  a  subsequent  1-year  oral  dosing  study,  beagle  dogs  were  given  0-10-30-75  mg/kg/day  in  gelatine capsules.  There  was  no  mortality.  Occasional  emesis  and  aggressive  behaviour  was  seen  from  30 mg/kg/day.  Post-mortem  there  was  a trend towards an increase in liver and kidney weight. A diffuse dark brown discoloration of the liver was seen not correlated with microscopic changes. Urinary bladder congestion and/or mucosal thickening or nodularity was seen at the mid- and top-doses. The NOAEL is given as 30 mg/kg/day.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics)

Zonisamide was not mutagenic in two Ames tests carried out in 5 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and  in  Escherichia  coli  WP2  uvrA),  with  or  without  metabolic  (S9)  activation,  an  in  vitro  forward mutation  test  in  mouse  lymphoma  cells,  with  or  without  metabolic  activation  nor  in  an  in  vitro chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes. The ability of zonisamide to induce sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and cell mutation (at the HGPRT locus) has been investigated in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells. No significant increase in SCE frequency was seen at any test concentration, either with or without activation. A small, but statistically significant, increase in mutation frequency at the HGPRT locus  was,  however,  observed  in  the  absence  of  metabolic  activation.  The  increase  in  mutation frequency  was,  however,  very  small  and  there  was  no  dose-response.  Whilst  the  increase  was statistically significant, the biological significance is questionable. Therefore, zonisamide did not appear to  be  mutagenic in this test.  Zonisamide was also not mutagenic in a bone-marrow cytogenetic study following  administration  by  oral  gavage  in  mice  where  systemic  exposure  was  provided.  Overall, zonisamide is not considered to pose a mutagenic hazard.

## · Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

Mice (B6C3F1, 50/sex/group) were given zonisamide 0-20-40-80 mg/kg/day as an ad mix in the diet for  104 weeks. There was good survival to terminal sacrifice (80-90% in males, 72-78% in females). There was no increase in non-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions, in treated animals compared to controls.

Rats (Wistar, 50/sex/group) were given zonisamide 0-20-40-80 mg/kg/day as ad mix in diet for 104 weeks. There was good survival to terminal sacrifice (60% in males, 70% in females). There was no increase in nonneoplastic or neoplastic lesions in treated animals compared to controls except for a slightly higher incidence of  interstitial  cell and uterine tumours in treated vs. control animals, but without dose relationship. Plasma exposures  at  steady  state  were  extrapolated  from  a  4-week  oral  study  in  rats.  This  was  considered  to  be acceptable in view of the pharmacokinetic and metabolism of zonisamide in rodents.

- Reproductive and developmental studies

## Fertility

Two fertility studies were conducted. In the first one, rats were dosed in the diet at 0-25-50-100 mg/kg for 60 days in males and 14 days prior to mating and up to sacrifice or weaning in females. In the second fertility study, the dosing was given by gavage at 0-20-60-200 mg/kg in males and females. In both studies, there was no  apparent  dose  related  effect  on  fertility  and  no  significant  effect  on  F1  developmental  or  reproductive capacity. The NOAEL is given as 20 mg/kg/day (second study) for parents and pups. This dose results in systemic exposure equivalent to the therapeutic dose in man.

## Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity

In the mouse teratogenicity study, pregnant mice were given zonisamide 0-125-250-500 mg/kg by gavage. Clinical  observations  and  effects  on  body  weight,  food  intake,  and  organ  weights  observed in the F0

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

generation  were  consistent  with  those  observed  during  the  repeat-dose  gavage  studies.  Zonisamide evoked maternal and foetotoxicity at 250 mg/kg and was teratogenic at 500 mg/kg.

In the rat teratogenicity and development studies, pregnant rats were given zonisamide by gavage at up to 200 mg/kg/day. The clinical signs observed in treated dams, as well as the effects on body weight, food intake, and organ weights were consistent with the effects seen during the repeat-dose studies. Visceral abnormalities  such  as  ventricular  septal  defects  of  the  heart  were  seen  at  doses  of  200  mg/kg. Developmental effects such as delayed ossification and reduced foetal weight were observed at around 60 mg/kg and above, however these effects are likely to be secondary to effects on maternal body weight gain and are, consequently, not considered to be significant. Zonisamide was, therefore, maternally toxic at 60 mg/kg and higher and teratogenic at 200 mg/kg. Slight delays in foetal development also occurred at 60 mg/kg and higher, although these are considered secondary to maternal toxicity.

In the dog teratogenicity study, zonisamide was given at 0-10-30-60 mg/kg/day in capsules on days 14-35 of  gestation, followed by caesarean delivery on day 55 of gestation. There was an increased occurrence of short/kinky  tails,  due  mainly  to  fusion/deformity  of  the  caudal  vertebrae,  at  60  mg/kg.    Cardiovascular abnormalities, hypoplasia/dysplasia of the spleen and thymus, umbilical hernia and higher incidence of eight lumbar vertebrae were seen at doses over 30 mg/kg. Therefore zonisamide was teratogenic in dogs at doses of 30 mg/kg or higher and materno-toxic at 60 mg/kg as characterised by reduction in body weight gain and food consumption.

In  the  primate  teratogenicity  study, cynomologus monkeys were given 0-10-20 mg/kg by gavage on days 21-45 of gestation, followed by caesarean delivery on day 100 of gestation. There was some emesis in treated animals and reduced food consumption. Zonisamide was abortifacient at from the lowest tested dose (10 mg/kg).  It  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  abortion  was  a  secondary  effect  consequent  to  teratogenicity. Zonisamide was, therefore, maternally toxic and abortifacient at 10 mg/kg and higher.

## Pre- and post- natal

Pregnant rats were given 0-10-30-60 mg/kg/day by gavage from day 17 of gestation to day 20 of lactation. No effect was noted on pregnancy or delivery, there were no maternal deaths. Body weight gain and food consumption  were  reduced qt  the  top  dose.  There  were  no  adverse  effects  on  F1  pups  at  delivery  and  no increase  in  pup  mortality  to  weaning.  Physical  and  behavioural  development  was  normal  in  all  groups. Reproductive performance and F2 pups were also normal. The NOAEL is given as 30 mg/kg/day, a dose which gives about 1.5-times the expected exposure in man.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Special toxicity studies

Antigenicity  studies  were  carried  out  by  immunising  mice,  guinea  pigs  and  rabbits  with  a  BSAzonisamide  conjugate  given  for  up  to  5  weeks.  Zonisamide  conjugates,  but  not  zonisamide  alone, induced  positive  responses  in  PHA  tests  and  the  PCA  test  in  naive  guinea  pigs.  The  observations suggest that zonisamide is not likely to be antigenic when administered as a free hapten.

## Dependence

The potential for dependence have been studied in 3 animal models.

In a model of physical dependence on pentobarbital (PTB) induced in rats, zonisamide did not prevent the loss of body weight associated with PTB abstinence which suggests that zonisamide is unlikely to produce barbiturate-like physical dependence, even at doses well in excess of those intended for clinical use.  Zonisamide  substitution  did,  however,  produce  a  partial  but  significant  (p&lt;0.05)  suppression  of behavioural withdrawal signs of hyperexcitability associated with PTB abstinence, suggesting sedative or depressant activity of zonisamide.

In a drug discrimination model in the rat (SN2; n=6), zonisamide was tested at up to 176 mg/kg/day IP, for its ability to induce diazepam (DZP)-like discriminative stimulus effects. At these doses, zonisamide failed to substitute for DZP (2.5 mg/kg IP), suggesting that it should not produce benzodiazepine-like intoxication if taken at high doses.

In a similar substitution procedure in monkeys zonisamide at doses in excess of the human therapeutic range  lacked  reinforcing  effects  on  trained  monkeys  for  self-administration  of  methohexital, a known

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

drug reinforcer. These data confirm that zonisamide lacks potential for abuse since results of drug selfadministration testing in monkeys is usually predictive of abuse liability.

Whilst  zonisamide  treatment  did  appear  to  suppress  some  of  the  behavioural  signs  associated  with withdrawal from pentobarbital, it is considered that this represents the depressant effect of zonisamide and it is considered unlikely that zonisamide has a dependence liability. Zonisamide also appears to lack potential for abuse.

## Environmental risk assessment

The ERA of zonisamide was performed based on the most recent draft CPMP Note for Guidance (24 July 2003). The Phase I assessment indicated that a Phase II assessment is needed. Phase II A studies to determine  the  PNEC  (predicted  no  effect  concentration)  value  and  fate  studies  have  been  performed, although not to the OECD standard. However, the justification for these studies was considered to be acceptable.  Based  on  the  default  Fpen  value  (1%)  the  PEC/PNEC  is  lower  than  1  (ratio=0.2).  It  is therefore concluded that the use of zonisamide does not pose a risk to the environment.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Pharmacodynamic  studies  have  demonstrated  that  zonisamide  can  reduce  the  extent  of induced  seizures. The mechanism of action remains unclear, although it appears to be similar to phenytoin, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, the main comparators.

Following oral dosing the drug is rapidly absorbed, widely distributed and metabolised, and excreted in the urine. Metabolites are similar across the species tested but vary in relative amount.  Foetal exposure is high, similar to that of the dam.

The main adverse observations following a single high dose of zonisamide appear to be linked to the CNS effects of the drug. In repeat dose toxicity, transient clinical signs of toxicity such as sedation and ataxia, which are in line with its pharmacological action, have been induced when zonisamide was administered as bolus doses (i.e.  gavage) at 200 mg/kg/day or greater; such effects were, however, not seen when higher  doses  (800  mg/kg/day)  were  administered  via  dietary  admixture,  suggesting  a  Cmax  basis  of these observations rather than overall exposure (AUC/Css). Adverse effects in CNS, kidney and liver were observed in animals at doses leaving no safety margin for human therapeutic use. Juvenile toxicity was only investigated in acute studies.

In  reproductive/developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rodents  and  dogs,  no  evidence  of  effects  on  fertility  of zonisamide were seen. Zonisamide was embryotoxic and teratogenic (reduced pup weight, increase in cardiac and major blood vessel defects, delayed ossification) and induced maternal toxicity at high doses. In monkeys zonisamide acted as an abortifacient.  The suggested NOAELs are 20 mg/kg in rats, 10 mg/kg in dogs and &lt;10 mg/kg in monkeys, all of which produce plasma levels within human efficacious levels. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the adverse effects observed in animals might also occur in humans. Pregnancy is  contra-indicated  and  potential  interference  between  zonisamide  and  the  chosen  method  of  avoiding pregnancy should be ruled out.

Based on in vitro and in vivo genotoxic tests, zonisamide is not considered to pose a genotoxic hazard for humans . The results of the two year studies in rodents suggest that zonisamide does not possess carcinogenic potential.

No antigenic potential was observed when tested in mice, guinea pigs and rabbits.

No environmental risk is anticipated from the use of zonisamide.

It is considered unlikely that zonisamide could have a dependence liability or potential for abuse.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  indication  originally  submitted  for    Zonegran  (zonisamide)  was  the  adjunctive  therapy  in  the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults and adolescents over 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years with epilepsy. The pharmaceutical form is a hard capsule for oral use containing 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg of zonisamide.

## Pharmacokinetics

38 pharmacokinetic studies were submitted. In addition, one population pharmacokinetic analysis was submitted, and 2 in vitro studies.

## · Methods

The  analysis  of  zonisamide  in  plasma  (urine  and  erythrocytes)  is  performed  by  validated  HPLC methods.  The  first  method  (Dainippon/WARS)  was  replaced  from  1988  by  a  new  HPLC  method (KCAS/AAI).

Pharmacokinetic  variables,  e.g.  AUC0-t,  AUCinf,  AUC τ ,  C max ,  C min ,  t max ,  Ct  and  t‰  were  calculated according to standard procedures.

For  statistical  analysis,  the  significance  level  used  in  most  trials  was  5%,  and  accordingly  95% confidence intervals were calculated. The 90% confidence intervals were calculated for bioequivalence trials and when testing for equivalence.

## · Absorption - Bioavailability

## Bioavailability

After oral administration, zonisamide is slowly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations 2.5 - 4.5 h after administration. Based upon excretion data in faeces, and plasma radioactivity after administration of 14 C labelled drug, the absolute bioavailability is considered to be close to 100%.

## Bioequivalence

The initial capsule formulation (the IND formulation) containing 100 mg zonisamide was used only in 4 biopharmaceutic  and  clinical  pharmacology  studies  conducted  prior  to  1984.  This  formulation  was compared  to  the  intended  formulation  for  marketing    (Market  formulation)  containing  also  100  mg zonisamide.

The  IND  formulation  proved  to  be  bioequivalent  with  the  100  mg  Market  formulation  .  (see  table below).

Table  PK  1 .  Pharmacokinetics  of  zonisamide  after  administration  of  the  100  mg  IND  capsule formulation and the 100 mg Market capsule formulation to healthy volunteers (fasting).

| n=17                                                 | 100 mg IND capsule   | 100 mg Market capsule   | ratio (90% CI)     |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| AUC inf ( µ g.h/ml) C max ( µ g/ml) t max (h) t‰ (h) | 71 ± 24              | 77 ± 20                 | 0.90 (0.84 - 0.96) |
|                                                      | 1.1 ± 0.6            | 1.0 ± 0.3               | 1.03 (0.89 - 1.17) |
|                                                      | 4 (1 - 12)           | 4 (1 - 12)              | - -                |
|                                                      | 54 ± 13              | 56 ± 12                 | - -                |

More recently, 25 and 50 mg strength capsules have been formulated. A further bioequivalence study showed that after once daily dosing, the 100 mg Market capsule formulation, the 25 mg Market capsule formulation (as 4x25 mg) and the 50 mg Market capsule formulation (as 2x 50 mg) were bioequivalent at steady state.

## Influence of food

Food  interaction  studies  have  shown  that  the  rate  and  extent  of  zonisamide  absorption  was  not influenced by a high fat breakfast, a standard breakfast or in case the dose was administered as sprinkle in apple sauce. Therefore zonisamide can be administered with and without food

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Distribution

Animal data indicate that zonisamide is widely distributed over the body, and that zonisamide crosses the  blood-brain barrier, and the placenta In addition, animal data indicate that zonisamide is excreted into mother milk, which is also confirmed in humans. Human data regarding penetration or distribution of zonisamide within the central nervous system is lacking. Animal studies of brain uptake suggest that zonisamide  is  well  distributed  to  the  brain  and  that  the  carrier  mechanism  is  probably  carbonic anhydrase elated.

In vitro and in vivo studies show that plasma protein binding is about 40 - 50% at clinically relevant plasma concentrations of 10 - 100 µg/ml. No interactions on drug-protein displacement are expected, based on in vitro studies with phenytoin, phenobarbital or sulthiame.

The volume of distribution (Vd/F) was estimated to be about 1.6 l/kg

A major distribution  compartment  of  zonisamide  are  the  erythrocytes.  The  binding  to erythrocytes is non  linear,  due  to  a  combined  saturable  binding  to  erythrocyte  carbonic  anhydrase  at  concentrations below 3 µg/ml, and to a non  saturable binding (passive diffusion) at higher concentrations. Consequently,  erythrocytes/plasma  ratio's  are  about  15  at  low  concentrations  and  about  3  at  higher concentrations. Possible displacement from the carbonic anhydrase binding site at erythrocytes by other sulphonamide  agents  is  not  expected  to  be  clinically  relevant  as  their  affinity  is  comparable  to zonisamide.

## · Elimination

## Metabolism-Excretion

In vitro studies using human  liver microsomes  indicate  that  zonisamide  is  metabolised to  2(sulphamoylacetyl)-phenol  (SMAP).  The metabolism  of  zonisamide to  SMAP was almost completely inhibited  by  anti-P450 3A4 antibody but not by anti-P450 2D6 antibody showing the involvement of cytochrome CYP3A4.

In  vivo,  metabolism  of  zonisamide  was  studied  after  administration  of  14C-labelled  zonisamide  (300 mg) to 6 healthy male volunteers. Pharmacokinetic variables obtained for zonisamide are shown in table below:

Table PK 4 . Pharmacokinetics of zonisamide after administration of 300 mg 14 C-zonisamide to healthy male volunteers.

| n=6                                                                                                               | zonisamide plasma, day 1                                            | zonisamide plasma, day 14                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| AUC 0-24h ( µ g.h/ml) AUC inf ( µ g.h/ml) C max ( µ g/ml) t max (h) Cl/F (ml/min) Clr (ml/min) t‰ (h) Ae 240h (%) | 60 ± 7 246 ± 67 3.2 ± 0.4 3.2 ± 1.3 22 ± 8 3.5 ± 1.2 56 ± 16 15 ± 3 | 393 ± 74 -- 20 ± 3 2.8 ± 1.3 13 ± 2 1.9 ± 0.6 58 ± 13 15 ± 4 |

Recovery data indicate that zonisamide is almost completely absorbed, without pre-systemic metabolism. Zonisamide is almost completely but slowly excreted into urine, mainly as metabolites and no metabolites could be detected in plasma. Recoveries of zonisamide and its metabolites over a 240 h collection time in urine was about 62% including two inactive metabolites (N-acetyl zonisamide (10 20%), and glucuronide conjugates of 2-(sulphamoylacetyl)-phenol (SMAP, 50 - 60%)and 3% in faeces.

The  elimination  half-life of about 60  h was  independent  of  dose  and  not  affected by  repeat administration. The total body clearance is about 20 ml/min after single dosing and about 11 ml/min

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

after multiple dosing. Renal clearance covered 15% of the total clearance, which was indicated by the excretion of only 14% of the dose as intact zonisamide in the urine.

Zonisamide is not subject to interconversion as zonisamide has no chiral centre.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

## Dose proportionality

AUC and Cmax values increased almost linear with dose after single dose over the dose range of 100 800  mg  and  after  multiple  dose  over  the  dose  range  of  100  -  400  mg  once  daily.  The  increase  was slightly more than expected on base of dosing, probably due to the saturable binding of zonisamide to erythrocytes.

In line with the almost linear pharmacokinetics, the total daily exposure was only 10% lower in case the total daily dose was administered as a single dose compared to twice daily, with about 10% lower Cmax values and 20% lower trough levels for the once daily treatment.

## Time dependency

Exposure at steady state is slightly greater than predicted from single dose data. The cause of this time dependency has not been identified but saturation of one or more metabolic pathways is the most likely explanation. Elimination half-life was independent of dose and not affected by repeated administration. Steady state was achieved by day 13.

## Intra- and inter-individual variability

Inter-individual variability in zonisamide pharmacokinetics (AUC, Cmax and Cl) is estimated to be 15 25%.  Intra-individual  variability  in  zonisamide  pharmacokinetics  was  not  evaluated,  however  taking into account the inter-individual variability, the intra-individual variability is considered less than 25%.

## · Special populations

## Impaired renal function

A clinical pharmacokinetic study of zonisamide in patients with varying degrees of renal function was performed. Patients received a single 300mg oral dose of zonisamide. Plasma and urine were assayed for  zonisamide  using  HPLC  procedure.  Mean  plasma  concentration-time  data  and  the  relationship between zonisamide total plasma clearance and creatinine clearance were measured.

In subjects with renal impairment receiving a single 300 mg dose, AUC rose by 36% and Cmax by 12%. In those with creatinine clearance of less than 20 mL/min, renal clearance was reduced by 35%.

Therefore, zonisamide  should  be  discontinued  in  patients  who  develop  acute  renal  failure or where a clinically significant sustained increase in serum creatinine is observed. Zonisamide should not be used in  patients  with  renal  failure,  as  there  has  been  insufficient  experience  concerning  drug  dosing  and toxicity.

## Impaired liver function

Pharmacokinetics  data  of  zonisamide  in  patients  with  an  impaired  liver  function  is  very  limited  and considered to be insufficient to support the use in this patient group.

The  SPC  states  that  the  use  of  zonisamide  in  hepatic  impaired  patients  have  not  been  adequately studied, and therefore the use of zonisamide in these patients is not recommended.

## Gender, weight, and target population (including population pharmacokinetics)

A prospectively planned population pharmacokinetic analysis of Study 302 was carried out; the primary objectives of which were to describe the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide from serum samples obtained at  steady  state  from  subjects  participating  in  this  study  and  to  identify  the  influence  of  demographic factors  and  concomitant  medication  with  other  anti-epileptic  drugs  on  zonisamide  pharmacokinetics. Zonisamide  concentration  data  were  obtained  from  208  subjects  (1023  samples,  mean  age  was  35.5 years, range 12-77 years), which reflect the fixed dose assessment phase.

Steady  state  zonisamide  concentration  data  were  used  for  non-linear  mixed  effects  modelling  by extended least squares regression using the NONMEM program with first order estimation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The population pharmacokinetic analysis did not reveal any unexpected issues.

Gender:  gender  did  not  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of  zonisamide  (after  incorporation  of  body weight into the model).

Weight: for each evaluated dose level, high total body weight was one of the combinations of subject factors producing the largest decrease in steady state concentration (up to 32% lower), relative to the reference subject. Although the magnitude of these increases could be clinically relevant (i.e. potential impact on safety), the fact that patients are typically titrated to an effective and tolerable dose reduces the  safety  concerns.  Furthermore,  the  relatively  small  magnitude  of  these  changes  is  unlikely  to  be clinically relevant (i.e. little or no expected impact on efficacy).

Target population: mean zonisamide steady state concentrations in subjects receiving zonisamide, 100, 300 or 500 mg  daily, concomitantly with CYP  3A4-inducing  anti-epileptic drugs (phenytoin, phenobarbital  and/or  carbamazepine)  were  35.7%,  18.0%  and  25.7%  lower,  respectively,  than  in subjects receiving zonisamide concomitantly with other (non-inducing) anti-epileptic drugs.

The mean observed steady state apparent oral clearance of zonisamide decreased approximately 37% with  an  increase  in  daily  zonisamide  dose  from  100  mg  to  500  mg,  both  in  subjects  receiving concomitant treatment with inducers of CYP 3A4 and in subjects receiving treatment with other antiepileptic  drugs.  However,  in  general,  only  slightly  non-linear  increases  in  steady  state  zonisamide concentrations were observed or predicted over the dose range evaluated.

## Elderly

The pharmacokinetics of  zonisamide  were  evaluated  a  study  in  subjects aged between 21 - 40 years (n=11)  and  subjects  aged  between  65  -  71  years  (n=11).  Subjects  received  a  single  300  mg  dose zonisamide. No clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics between young and elderly. As there is limited clinical information, the SPC states that elderly should be treated with caution.

## Children

No  specific  studies  were  carried  out  in  adolescents  patients  aged  12  -18  years.  Only  a  few  reports (literature, translated) were submitted dealing with pharmacokinetics in children. Thus in general data is limited. The data available indicate that adolescents aged 12 - 18 years, on daily dose add on therapy or receiving 6 mg/kg day, have comparable serum level/dose values compared with young subjects (aged &gt; 18 years).

Taking  into  account  that  the  dose  is  titrated  to  clinical  effect,  the  risk  of  eventual  differences  in pharmacokinetics may be limited. However, clinical safety and efficacy data should thoroughly support the use of zonisamide in adolescents (see clinical part).

## · Interaction studies

## In vitro

In vitro studies showed that zonisamide is a substrate for CYP3A4. The ability of zonisamide to inhibit 7 major cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 table PK 12), which mediate drug metabolism in humans, was investigated.

No  evidence  of  significant  inhibition  was  observed  for  the  cytochrome  P450  isoforms  CYP1A2  and CYP2D6. Zonisamide inhibited CYP2A6, 2C9, 2C19 and 2E1 in a concentration-dependent manner, but inhibition was less than 25% at a concentration of 42 µg/ml, a concentration which is 2-fold higher than clinical relevant zonisamide plasma concentrations. The Ki for inhibition of CYP3A4 appeared to be  ca.  1.1  µM  (230  µg/ml).  These  results  suggest  that  a  metabolically-based  clinical  interaction between zonisamide and some other drugs whose clearance is dependent upon one of the P450s tested is unlikely at therapeutic concentrations of zonisamide.

## In vivo

Zonisamide  (steady  state,  200  mg  twice  daily,  gradual  titrated  or  300  mg  for  phenobarbital)  did  not influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of  valproate  (a  CYP  2C9  inhibitor  enzyme  inhibitor),  lamotrigine  (a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

drug  mainly  metabolised  by  glucuronidation),  phenytoin,  carbamazepine,  and  phenobarbital  (enzyme inducers), and ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel, and ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone.

Zonisamide metabolism can be affected by the enzyme inducers (CYP3A4) phenytoin, carbamazepine, and  phenobarbital  which  increase  the  clearance  of zonisamide,  resulting  in  a  decrease in AUC (25 50%)  and  the  elimination  half-life  (up  to  50%).  Valproate  (at  steady  state)  apparently  increased zonisamide oral steady state clearance .

Consequently, if co-administration is necessary, the patient should be closely monitored and the dose of Zonegran and other CYP3A4 substrates adjusted as needed. This is stated in the SPC (4.5)

CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole (400 mg/day) or cimetidine (1200 mg/day) had no clinically relevant effects  on  the  single-dose  pharmacokinetics  of  zonisamide  given  to  healthy  subjects.  Therefore, modification of Zonegran dosing should not be necessary when co-administered with known CYP3A4 inhibitors.

## Overall conclusions on pharmacokinetics

The  absolute  bioavailability  of  zonisamide  is  estimated  to  be  approximately  100%,  and  C max values increased  almost  linear  with  dose  after  single  dose  over  the  dose  range  of  100  -  800  mg  and  after multiple dose over the dose range of 100 - 400 mg once daily. The increase at steady state was slightly more  than  expected  on  base  of  dosing,  probably  due  to  the  saturable  binding  of  zonisamide  to erythrocytes.  Peak  plasma  concentrations  were  reached  2.5 - 4.5 h after administration. Steady state was achieved within 13 days, and no unexpected accumulation occurs (once daily or twice daily dosing)

The capsule formulations used in the clinical trial program and intended for marketing are considered bioequivalent, based upon in vivo bioequivalence data.

In vitro protein binding studies using human plasma indicate that protein binding is about 40 - 50%. A major  distribution  compartment are  the  erythrocytes,  which  is  in  common  with  other  sulphonamides. Erythrocytes/plasma ratios are about 15 at low concentrations and about 3 at higher concentrations.

Zonisamide is metabolised partly by CYP3A4 (reductive cleavage), and also by N-acetyl-transferases and conjugation with glucuronic acid. 3% is excreted in faeces and about 62% in urine as zonisamide (20 - 30%), and two inactive metabolites (N-acetyl zonisamide (10 - 20%), and glucuronide conjugates of 2-(sulphamoylacetyl)-phenol (SMAP, 50 - 60%).

The total body clearance is about 20 ml/min after single dosing. The elimination half-life of about 60 h was independent of dose and not affected by repeat administration.

Zonisamide should not be used in patients with renal failure, as there has been insufficient experience concerning drug dosing and toxicity. Data in patients with an impaired liver function are very limited. Therefore the use of zonisamide in these patients is not recommended.

Limited data indicate that pharmacokinetics in adolescents aged between 12 - 18 years is comparable to adults. However, the numbers are too low to draw firm conclusions. No data are available in children aged &lt;12.

Concomitant use of CYP450 inducers, like carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital, decrease the exposure  to  zonisamide  (up  to  50%  as  shown  in  vivo)  due  to  an  increase  in  the  metabolism  of zonisamide.

## Pharmacodynamics

No pharmacodynamic studies in humans have been submitted. Only two published studies investigating the effects of zonisamide on cognitive function are available. (see clinical section on cognitive function)

## · Mechanism of action

Zonisamide is benzisoxazole derivative. It is an anti-epileptic medicine with weak carbonic anhydrase activity in-vitro .  It is chemically unrelated to other anti-epileptic agents.

The mechanism of action of zonisamide is not fully elucidated, but it appears to act on voltage-sensitive sodium and calcium channels, thereby disrupting synchronised neuronal firing, reducing the spread of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seizure  discharges  and  disrupting  subsequent  epileptic  activity.    Zonisamide  also  has  a  modulatory effect on GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The anticonvulsant activity of zonisamide has been evaluated in a variety of models, in several species with  induced  or  innate  seizures,  and  zonisamide  appears  to  act  as  a  broad-spectrum  anti-epileptic  in these  models.    Zonisamide  prevents  maximal  electroshock  seizures  and  restricts  seizure  spread, including the propagation of seizures from cortex to sub-cortical structures and suppresses epileptogenic focus activity. Unlike phenytoin and carbamazepine however, zonisamide acts preferentially on seizures originating in the cortex.

## Clinical efficacy

Four  placebo-controlled  studies  are  included  in  this  application  to  demonstrate  efficacy:  the  primary study (Study 302) the more recent, performed after seeking scientific advice, and three studies 922, 912 US, and 912 EUR which are considered to provide supporting rather  than  primary  data  because  the treatment duration at steady state of these studies was  shorter than required by  the current CPMP/EWP/566/98 guideline.

In the four studies, a total of 498 subjects received zonisamide and 350 subjects received placebo over a treatment  period  of  up  to  24 weeks,  excluding  down  titration  (a  period  of  up  to  18 weeks  at  steady state).

Five open-label extension (OLE) studies are provided to document long-term efficacy over a seven-year period  (including  base  study  period).  In  the  five  OLE  studies,  a  total  of  667 subjects  received zonisamide.  In addition several other uncontrolled studies were performed.

The  'All  Zonisamide  Population'  was  defined  as  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of zonisamide,  including  patients  randomised  to  placebo  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies  and who later switched to zonisamide.

Ten  epilepsy  studies  are  currently  ongoing  or  are  in  the  process  of  being  completed:  these  include  a long-term  extension  to  Study  302  (Study  353)  and  a  monotherapy study in newly diagnosed patients (Study 304).

## · Dose response studies

Study 922 assessed different zonisamide doses (100, 200, 400 mg/day), although the assessment periods were not consistent and of shorter duration than 12 weeks at steady state.  Subjects in earlier studies (912-US  and  912-EUR)  received  a  range  of  zonisamide  doses  (median  final  dose  400 mg/day),  but dose-response was not specifically assessed.

Dose-response was in fact addressed by Study 302, which assessed the efficacy and safety of a range of fixed  doses  (100,  300,  500 mg/day) at steady state over 18 weeks (following a titration period of six weeks). Use of a titration to fixed dose design was considered appropriate as zonisamide has a relatively long t‰.

Study 302 showed a dose-response relationship in terms of the median percentage reduction in seizure frequency from baseline for each seizure grouping in the primary efficacy population.

There was a statistically significant difference in median percentage reduction in seizure frequency from baseline  between  the  500  mg/day  group  and  placebo  for  each  seizure  grouping.    There  was  also  a statistically  significant  difference  between  the  300  mg/day  group  and  placebo  for  all  partial  and  all seizures.

Study 302 showed also a dose-response relationship in terms of the percentage of responders for each seizure grouping in the primary efficacy population (see table below).

A linear trend test of the percentage of responders (all seizures) across the three-zonisamide doses was performed  using  the  intended  to  treat  (ITT)  population.    This  analysis  showed  that  subjects  were 1.95 times as likely to show a response to treatment whilst receiving zonisamide 500 mg/day compared with  100 mg/day,  and  were  1.18  times  as  likely  to  show  a  response  whilst  receiving  zonisamide 300 mg/day compared with 100 mg/day.  The linear association between dose level and the percentage of responders was statistically significant (p=0.0357).

A linear trend analysis of the percentage of responders (all seizures) including the placebo group was also  performed  using  the  ITT  population.    Results  from  this  test  showed  that  the  odds  ratios  for response  compared  with  placebo  in  the  100 mg/day,  300 mg/day  and  500 mg/day  zonisamide  groups were  2.09,  2.46  and  4.07,  respectively.    The  observed  linear  trend  was  statistically  significant (p&lt;0.0001).

## · Main studies

The primary efficacy study in the development programme is study 302 that was designed to conform with CPMP  guidelines  as  well  as incorporating regulatory  advice  and  recommendations  from internationally recognised  guidelines  for  the  treatment  of  epilepsy,  in  particular  Draft  6  of  the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Epileptic Disorders.

However, it is noted that the analysis plan of study 302 does not fully adhere to the guidelines in respect of the recommendation to analyse partial seizures in terms of separate analyses of simple, complex and secondarily  generalised  seizures.  The  applicant  selected  the  reduction  in  complex  partial  seizures  as primary efficacy parameter as these seizure types were considered to be of primary concern, could be reliably  recorded  by  subjects/caregivers  and  were  of sufficient frequency to be analysed alone. Other seizure types were recorded and in all studies analysed by appropriate groupings of seizure types.

Studies  922,  912  US,  and  912  EUR  are  considered  to  provide  supporting  rather  than  primary  data because the treatment duration at steady state of these studies was shorter than required by the current CPMP/EWP/566/98 guideline.

## Methods

## · Study Participants

The  subject  population  in  the  four  placebo-controlled  studies  was  chosen  to  assess  the  efficacy  of zonisamide as adjunctive therapy in subjects with refractory partial epilepsy.

History  of  partial  seizures  was  defined  in  study  302  as  least  12  partial  seizures  during  the  12-week baseline period, as recorded in the daily seizure diary, with no more than a 3-week seizure free interval during this time. In studies 912-US and 912 EUR as at least four complex partial seizures per month over  the  four  months  preceding  the  study  and  no  more  than  eight  primary  or  secondary  generalised tonic, clonic or tonic-clonic seizures while awake during those four months.

Baseline  seizure  frequency  was  established  during  an  8-12-week  period,  depending  on  the  patient's seizure  frequency:  an  8-week  period  for  patients  who  had ≥ 15  seizures  in  the  first  4  weeks  or ≥ 30 seizures in the first 8 weeks and a 12-week period for patients who had fewer seizures.

Unsatisfactory  seizure  control  or  sub-optimal  treatment  was  either  due  to  poor  seizure  control  or unacceptable side effects. Only subjects with a documented history of partial seizures despite treatment with other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were included. The frequency of seizures was assessed during the  baseline  periods  of  12 weeks  during  which  only  the  concomitant  AED  regimen  was  used.  All subjects  were  refractory  to  previous  treatment  and  were  receiving  at  least  one,  and  up  to  three, concomitant AEDs at doses in the usual ranges for epilepsy treatment.

Exclusion criteria included mainly a history or evidence of a progressive central nervous system (CNS) disease  or  lesion  (all  studies),  progressive  encephalopathy  or  progressive  ophthalmologic  disease; patients with a history of absence seizures, myoclonic or atonic seizures or non-epileptic seizures, any clinically significant organic disease or laboratory abnormality.

## · Treatments

Following Screening (Week 0) and a 12 week prospective baseline phase (Weeks 1-12), subjects were randomised to receive one of four treatments - zonisamide 500 mg/day, 300 mg/day or 100 mg/day or placebo - in the ratio 2:1:1:2.

The design of this study is shown in the figure below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Objectives

The  efficacy  of  zonisamide  was  compared  with  placebo  and  assessed  by  measuring  the  median percentage reduction from baseline in seizure frequency, expressed as seizures per 28-day period and the percentage of subjects with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, expressed as seizures per 28-day period (responders).

Investigator and subject global assessments of improvement relative to baseline were also assessed.

Secondary objectives of Study 302 were to assess the dose-effect relationship of zonisamide, to evaluate the efficacy of total daily zonisamide does of 100mg and 300mg versus placebo; to evaluate the safety and tolerability of zonisamide 50mg/day (25mg twice daily) when used at the initiation of therapy (days 1-3); to assess investigator evaluation of subject's response and also patient's rating.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  a  comparison  of  change  in  seizure  frequency  from  baseline (expressed as seizures per 28 day period) between the 500 mg/day zonisamide and placebo groups and was assessed by:

- Median  percentage  changes  from  baseline  in  frequency  of  seizures  during  the  fixed  dose assessment phase (Weeks 19-36).
- Proportion  of  subjects  with ≥ 50% reduction  in  seizure  frequency  from  baseline  (responders) (Weeks 19-36).

Secondary efficacy variables were: median percentage change in seizure frequency from baseline in all partial seizures without secondary generalisation and all seizures; the percentage of subjects responding to  treatment  for  all  partial  seizures  and  all  seizures;  number  of  seizure-free  days  and  subject  and investigator Global Evaluations of Improvement.

Safety  evaluations  included  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  and  changes  in  laboratory evaluations, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, concomitant medications and electrocardiogram (ECG).

## · Sample size

Sample  size  was  based  on  the  proportion  of  responders  during  the  assessment  phase  in  the  primary efficacy analysis population.

## · Randomisation

An  unequal  randomisation  (2:1:1:2)  was  used  because  the  primary  analysis  of  interest  was  the comparison of the zonisamide 500 mg/day group with placebo

## · Blinding (masking)

Blinding was achieved by using a double dummy technique.

## · Statistical methods

Analyses were conducted in three of the following subject populations:for study 302:

Intent-to-treat (ITT ):  Randomised subjects who took at least one dose of study medication and that had some post-baseline partial seizure frequency data collected.

Modified intent-to-treat (MITT) studies 922, 912-US and EUR :  All ITT subjects who took at least one dose of study medication during the assessment phase (Weeks 8-12 in study 922; Weeks 5-12 in Studies 912-US and 912 EUR.

Primary efficacy analysis :  All ITT subjects with some partial seizure frequency data collected during the fixed-dose assessment phase (Weeks 19-36)

## Efficacy evaluable :

All ITT subjects who had an average of four seizures per month during the baseline phase and who took study medication for at least 10 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For Study 302, the efficacy analyses were conducted on the primary efficacy population and, for the three supporting studies the efficacy analyses were conducted on the MITT population.

1 Number  of  randomised  subjects  who  were  excluded  from  the  analysis  population.    Four  randomised subjects were excluded from the ITT population of Study 302; two did not receive any study medication and two did not have any post-baseline partial seizure frequency data.

2 For  Study  302,  the  principal  population  upon  which  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  was  the  primary efficacy  population,  not  the  MITT  population.ITT    Intent-to-treat.    MITT  Modified  intent-to-treat.    ZNS Zonisamide.

## Recruitment

In study 302 and including the 3 supportive studies, 444 subjects were screened and 93 patients failed screening;  351  patients  were  randomised;  321  patients  completed  titration;  82  were  terminated prematurely; 267 completed steady state and 243 entered the follow-up study.

It is of note that in study 302 the inclusion criteria is based upon all seizure types whereas the primary efficacy variable is based upon the seizure frequency of complex partial seizures.

It is noted that the preferred primary endpoint in the NfG on anti-epileptic agents is 50% responders.

## · Conduct of the study

Major  protocol  deviations  were  noted  in  1.8%  of  patients  administered  100mg/day;  21.8%  patients administered  300mg/day  and  25.4%  of  500mg/day  versus  8.3%  of  the  placebo group.  58.2%  of  the major deviations related to compliance (less than 80% compliance) and this occurred more frequently in the zonisamide groups.

## · Baseline data

Treatment groups were comparable for age, height, weight and race.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most commonly used antiepileptic drug (AED) at baseline and during the study was carbamazepine for all treatment groups.

The subject population in the placebo-controlled study is considered appropriate and representative of patients  with  partial  epilepsy  refractory  to  other  AEDs.  Despite  receiving  other  AEDs  before  study entry, subjects had a median baseline seizure frequency of greater than 9 seizures per 28 days.

## · Outcomes and estimation

The  median  percentage  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  from  baseline  in  this  study  was  compared between zonisamide and placebo using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model, using ranktransformed data containing the main effects of treatment and study centre.  Analyses commenced with the  500  mg/day  dose  group  and,  if  found  to  be  statistically  significant,  continued  in  a  step-down procedure comparing each active treatment group with placebo in turn.  No corrections were made for multiple statistical comparisons.

The results are summarised in the table below:

## · Ancillary analyses

## Seizure-Free Days

In the ITT population, in both the 300 mg/day and 500 mg/day zonisamide groups, the median number of  seizure-free  days  per  28  days  increased  by  2.8  days  and  3.0  days,  respectively  in  the  fixed-dose assessment phase compared with baseline.

## Clinical studies in special populations

There were no specific studies in the elderly or in adolescents or children although patients from these groups were recruited in study 302.

Use in patients with hepatic and renal impairment might be dealt with in the SPC. There were relatively few adolescents or elderly in study 302; caution could be advised in the elderly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Supportive studies

In order to have some indication of the maintenance of effect three open label studies (studies 920, 921, and 912-39 ) and five  open label extension studies (studies 922 ext, 912-US ext, 912-EUR ext, 921 ext, and 912-ext) are referred to by the applicant.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Zonisamide, in  comparison  with  placebo  in  study  302,  over  a  period  of  up to 24 weeks, statistically significantly  reduced  the  median frequency  of  complex  partial  seizures  at  500  mg/day.  The  effective dose range claimed in the SPC is 300 - 500 mg per day.

The reduction in complex partial seizure frequency was numerically greater at 300 mg/day compared with placebo but was not statistically significant.  The lack of statistical significance is probably due to a lack of power due to the limited number of patients with complex partial seizures due to an unlucky distribution of patients with simple and complex partial seizures in the 300 mg study arm. The median percentage change in seizure frequency in the 300 mg arm however, is twice of that under placebo and for the 100 mg arm. Moreover, if all partial seizures are considered, the dose response is clear-cut.

Zonisamide  demonstrated  a  responder  rate  (patients  with  a ≥ 50% reduction  in  seizure  frequency)  of over 50% for each seizure grouping at the 500 mg/day dose in study 302, compared with a placebo rate of around 20%. The percentage of responders showed an apparent dose-response relationship for each seizure grouping. An analysis of all seizures across all four-treatment groups (i.e., including placebo), showed a statistically significant dose-response relationship between increasing dose of zonisamide and proportion of responders (p &lt; 0.0001).

The improvement in number of seizure free days and global assessment raises doubt with respect to the clinical relevance of the observed effect.

There were however limited data in adolescents or in the elderly.

The  high  number  of  drop-outs  (30%-40%)  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  open  label  studies  raised concern with respect to the maintenance of effect .The applicant has reviewed the withdrawal rates in extension  studies  and  open  label  extension  studies  and  notes  that  withdrawal  rates  varied,  but  were usually higher with longer studies.  Some degree of lack of efficacy is not unexpected in a population with refractory disease.

The titration schedule initially recommended was not justified by the data. The applicant has proposed a titration schedule which is more consistent with that used in study 302, and where it differs from that used  in  study  302,  has  appropriately  justified  the  proposal  on  the  basis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data. Specific instructions are provided for patients with renal impairment or for patients who are not being administered concurrent CYP3A4 inducing agents. An adequate dose de-escalation is also provided.

Efficacy  in  secondary  generalised  seizures  was  not  evaluated  in  a  separate  pooled  analysis.  The applicant has presented data on seizures leading to secondary generalisation and secondary generalised seizures,  and  median  and  mean  percent  reductions  were  seen  for  the  300  and  500mg  doses.  The applicant acknowledges that the limited numbers make it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

The applicant has reviewed the withdrawal rates in extension studies and open label extension studies and notes that withdrawal rates varied, but were usually higher with longer studies.

The choice of complex partial seizures as primary endpoint in study 302 is uncommon. The applicant has provided the rationale for the primary endpoint and how it was defined as those subjects for whom a 50% or greater reduction in complex partial seizure frequency relative to baseline was demonstrated in the fixed dose assessment period. The applicant has also confirmed that the endpoint was defined in the original protocol and was not driven by a protocol amendment. However, inclusion criteria and endpoint should be consistent. Study 302 is affected by the inclusion of subject with no complex partial seizures who do not add to primary efficacy.

Concern  was  raised  as  to  whether  the  way  seizure  frequency  was  normalised  and  whether  different definitions  of  patient  populations  did  not  introduce,  at  least  partly,  artificial  results.  The  applicant indicates  that  missing  data  with  regard  to  seizures  were  imputed  from  the  up-titration  period.  An analysis was conducted with respect to the week 19-36 fixed dose period that does not impute missing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data and there were no significant differences in the results compared to those where missing data had been imputed.

The  definition  of  three  population  data  sets  ITT-,  Primary  Efficacy  Analysis  -,  and  the  efficacy evaluable - population) also raised concern with respect to the manner how missing values were dealt with.  The  applicant  performed  the  analysis  requested  by  the  CHMP  demonstrating  statistically significant reductions in all partial seizure frequency for the 300 and 500mg doses. For the responder analysis the P-values for both analyses for the 500mg/day versus placebo showed statistical significance p=&lt;0.0001.

The extension of the fixed dose period in study 302 from week 19-36 because of the number of subject dropouts  that  had  occur  prior  to  week  36,  raised  concern.  The  applicant  has  performed  the  analysis requested by CHMP and the results suggest that the inclusion of data from weeks 19 and 20 did not impact  the  statistical  significance  observed  in  the  percentage  change  from  baseline  for  all  partial seizures for any of the treatment groups in Study 302 for the ITT and ITT completer populations.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

In  clinical  studies,  1207 subjects  aged  12 years  or  more,  with  refractory  partial  epilepsy  received zonisamide  as  adjunctive  therapy.    Doses  ranged  from  &lt;100-&gt;600 mg/day;  744 subjects  received  a modal (most-frequently used) dose of zonisamide in the range &gt;200-500 mg/day.

The most frequent modal doses in the subjects who had received at least one dose of zonisamide were &gt;300-400 mg/day  (324/1207  [26.8%]  subjects)  and  &gt;400-500 mg/day  (283/1207  [23.4%]  subjects). Over half of the All Zonisamide population received a modal dose of zonisamide in the ranges &gt;200300, &gt;300-400 and &gt;400-500 mg/day.

Approximately 65% of the All Zonisamide population received treatment for a period of &gt;3-24 months. The most frequent dosing period was &gt;6-12 months.  Fewer than 9% of subjects received treatment for ≤ two months and approximately 7% of subjects received treatment for &gt;five years.

Overall exposure to zonisamide, irrespective of dose, was more than 1500 patient years.

In  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  the  zonisamide  and  placebo  groups  were  well  balanced in terms of demographic characteristics.  In each treatment group, there were slightly more males than females; the ratio  of  male  to  female  subjects  was  greater  in  the  zonisamide  group  compared  with  placebo.    The majority  of  subjects  were  aged  between  18 and  65 years  and  the  mean  age  at  screening  was approximately 35.5 years in each treatment group.  More than 90% of subjects in each of the treatment groups were White.

As in the placebo-controlled studies, the All Zonisamide population contained more males than females, more than 93% of subjects were aged between 18 and 65 years and more than 90% of subjects were White.  There  are limited data on use in adolescents (12-16 years), the elderly (over 65 years) and in non-Caucasians.

There  were  no  major  differences  in  demographic  characteristics  between  dose  groups  when  subjects were  categorised  according  to  their  most  frequently  used  (modal)  dose  except  that  the  highest  dose group had a higher proportion of males (72.9%).  This may reflect the generally greater body weight of males.

## Adverse events

In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any  event  reported  on  or  after  the  randomisation  date,  was  77.9%  with  zonisamide  and 67.7%  with placebo.    Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 61.0% of zonisamide subjects and 48.6% of placebo subjects. In the All Zonisamide population, the incidence of TEAEs was 89.1% of subjects.

For all doses combined, the highest incidence of TEAEs by body system was in the nervous system. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the zonisamide group were somnolence (16.1%), dizziness (15.5%) and  headache  (12.4%).    The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  in  the  placebo  group  were  headache

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(12.6%),  accidental  injury  (8.9%),  somnolence  and  dizziness  (8.3%  for  each  event).  Similar  findings were reported for the all zonisamide population

Analysis of adverse event incidence by dose group in the placebo-controlled studies and 'All Zonisamide' population showed a greater incidence with zonisamide  &gt;300-400 mg/day and &gt;400-500 mg/day than with lower doses. However, incidence increased further with higher doses.

In order to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed dosage regimen, the safety and tolerability of zonisamide were assessed separately in the dose-escalation phase and the steady-state phase.

The data suggest that adverse reactions occur more often in the dose escalation phase but less frequently if dose escalation is slower as in study 302 (see table below)

## Serious adverse events and deaths

## Placebo-Controlled Studies

In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of serious TEAEs was similar between the zonisamide group (4.8%) and the placebo group (4.6%).

The highest incidence of serious TEAEs by body system was in the nervous system for both treatment groups.  The most frequently reported serious TEAE was convulsion (reported as a TEAE) in both the zonisamide group (0.6%) and the placebo group (0.9%).

There were no reports of kidney calculus, irrespective of seriousness, in the placebo-controlled studies.

## All Zonisamide Population

The  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  All  Zonisamide  population  (19.0%)  than  in  the zonisamide  group  of  the  placebo-controlled  studies  (4.8%),  which  probably  reflects  the  much  longer treatment duration in the uncontrolled studies.

In  the  All  Zonisamide population, the highest incidence of serious TEAEs by body system was in the nervous  system.    The  most  frequently  reported  serious  TEAEs  were  convulsion  (4.6%)  and  kidney calculus (3.3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The serious TEAEs of convulsion and kidney calculus were considered to be treatment-related in 1.2% and 3.2% of subjects, respectively.

## Death

A total of 24 subjects died as a result of TEAEs: 3 placebo-treated subjects and no zonisamide-treated subjects in the placebo-controlled studies and 24 subjects in the All Zonisamide population. All of them were unrelated to the study treatment.

Serious  adverse  events  occurred  more  frequently  in  those  on  treatment.  Convulsions,  which  could represent a failure of treatment, are recorded both as serious adverse events and causes of death. Paranoid behaviour, suicidal behaviour and psychosis occurred in the All Zonisamide Group although only confusion is noted as an SAE in the placebo- controlled group.

A  total  of  19 subjects  died  as  a  result  of  TEAEs  after  receiving  treatment  with  zonisamide  and narratives are provide on these and a number of other deaths in a supplemental database. There were a number of falls, drowning and shootings which could have been accidental although it is not possible to rule out an effect from either the underlying condition or zonisamide.

## Laboratory findings

Zonisamide  does  not  appear  to  have  a clinically or  statistically  significant  effect  on  hepatic  function although there were individual cases of raised enzymes.

There  does  appear  to  be  an  effect  on  urea  and  creatinine,  which  is  consistent,  but  probably  not  of clinical significance.

There  is  no  evidence  from  clinical  studies  of  a  clinically  significant  adverse  effect  of  zonisamide  on clinical  chemistry  parameters  although  the  lowered  potassium  might  reflect  an  underlying  metabolic acidosis.

No clinically relevant haematological findings have been reported.

## Vital Signs

There was no clinically significant change in median systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure or heart rate in the zonisamide group or placebo group.

## ECGs

Zonisamide did not demonstrate any significant cardiovascular effects. In particular, the ECG data did not show any an increase in QT/QTc interval.

## Safety in special populations

There were no apparent differences in the incidence of TEAEs between adolescents, adults and elderly subjects.    However,  the  numbers  of  adolescent  and  elderly  subjects  were  low  (61 subjects  and 13 subjects, respectively).

The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  TEAE  was  similar  between  adolescents  (86.9%), adults (89.2%) and elderly subjects (92.3%).  Dizziness, infection and headache were among the most frequently reported TEAEs in each age group. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were  anorexia  (19.7%)  for  adolescents,  somnolence  (22.7%)  for  adults  and  confusion  (23.1%)  for elderly subjects.

The adolescent subgroup generally reported each TEAE at a similar or lower frequency compared with the adult subgroup, except for vomiting and rhinitis that were reported at a frequency ≥ 5.0% higher in the  adolescent  subgroup  compared  with  other  age  groups.  The  12-  16-year-old  group  had  higher incidences of emotional lability (11.5%), ataxia (13.1%), convulsion (14.8%), difficulty in concentrating, and in verbal expression (9.8%)

The elderly subgroup generally reported each TEAE at a similar or lower frequency compared with the adult subgroup.  However, headache, infection, pain, constipation, diarrhoea, confusion, insomnia and amblyopia were reported at a frequency ≥ 5.0% higher in the elderly subgroup compared with the adult subgroup.

Serious  TEAEs  were  reported  slightly  more  frequently  in  elderly  subjects  (23.1%)  compared  with adolescents (18.0%); 19.0% of adults reported serious TEAEs. However, no serious TEAEs in elderly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  were  considered  to  be  treatment-related,  compared  with  11.5%  of  adolescents  and  8.8%  of adult subjects.

In  summary,  data  on  tolerability  in  adolescents,  and  elderly  are  limited.  Adolescents  had  higher incidences  of  ataxia,  emotional  lability,  convulsion,  and  difficulties  with  concentrating  and  verbal ability.  There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  in  the  elderly  and  the  elderly  experienced  a higher incidence of insomnia and confusion.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Zonisamide does not  significantly  affect the pharmacokinetics of other AEDs (valproate, lamotrigine, phenytoin and carbamazepine).  However, AEDs that induce hepatic metabolising enzymes (phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) increase the clearance of zonisamide significantly.

The  CYP  inhibitor,  cimetidine,  does  not  significantly  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  zonisamide. Zonisamide  does  not  significantly  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ethinyloestradiol  or  norethindrone (norethisterone)  in  oral  contraceptives  or  substrates  of  CYP 2D6 (e.g., desipramine).  These data are reported in the SPC.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Withdrawals in both placebo- and zonisamide-treated groups in Study 302 were generally higher than other studies, possibly reflecting the longer treatment period (24 weeks) in this study.

In  all  studies,  the  percentage  of  subjects  withdrawing  from  study  treatment  was  greater  in  the zonisamide  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  groups  except  in  the 100mg/day  zonisamide  group  in Study 302, which had a lower withdrawal rate than placebo.

The incidence of withdrawal because of adverse events was greater in the 500 mg/day and 300 mg/day zonisamide groups of Study 302 and in the zonisamide groups of Studies 912-US and EUR, compared with the placebo groups.

Of the 108 zonisamide-treated subjects who withdrew from treatment, 63 (58.3%) withdrew because of adverse events.  Of the 46 placebo-treated subjects who withdrew from treatment, 17 (37.0%) withdrew because of adverse events.

## Placebo Controlled Studies

The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  zonisamide group  were  agitation/irritability  (2.8%),  dizziness  (2.6%)  and  anorexia (2.4%).    The  most frequently reported  treatment-related  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the  placebo  group  were  tiredness (1.4%),  dizziness  (1.1%)  and  somnolence  (0.9%).  Analysis  by  treatment  phase  showed  that  TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred more frequently with zonisamide than with placebo in each phase. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation with zonisamide were agitation/irritability  and  somnolence  (3.0%  for  each  event  in  placebo-controlled  studies).    In  the  All Zonisamide  population,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  24.6%  and  the  most frequently reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation were anorexia, agitation/irritability (3.1% each) and somnolence (3.0%).

2. The denominator is the number of subjects who ever received treatment at the indicated dose level during the double-blind period.  Subjects may be counted in more than one dose group.
3. Events with unknown zonisamide dose at onset are included only in the 'All Doses' column.

COSTART Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms.

In the All Zonisamide population, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 24.6%.  The highest incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation by body system was in the nervous system.  The most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  anorexia  and  agitation/irritability (3.1% for each event) and somnolence (3.0%).

As in the placebo-controlled studies, the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation were anorexia (3.0%), agitation/irritability (2.9%) and dizziness (2.7%). The incidence of  TEAEs leading to discontinuation did not increase with increasing duration of treatment, either for the percentage of subjects reporting any adverse event or any COSTART preferred term.

## Kidney Stones

Renal  calculus,  which  was  reported  only  in  the  All  Zonisamide  group,  does  appear  to  be  a  definite association  and  case  reports  suggest  that  this  may  be  associated  with  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibition producing alkaline urine.

As  renal  stones  were  considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  zonisamide,  renal  ultrasound  examinations were  performed  at  baseline  and during  treatment  in  several  studies  and  all  stones  found  on  the  renal ultrasounds  and  clinical  symptoms  of  renal  stones  in  these  studies  were  to  be  recorded  as  serious adverse events.

Of  the  59 reported  stones,  only  15 of  these  events  in  12 subjects  were  considered  to  be  symptomatic (diagnosis based on either passing a stone or clinical symptoms). At the time of the symptomatic event, six of the 12 subjects were receiving zonisamide 600-800 mg/day. The mean time following initiation of treatment to the first report of symptomatic stones was 22 months (range 3-69 months). Renal stones may be related to an effect on carbonic anhydrase.

## Oligohidrosis

The  primary  safety  database  was  searched  for  TEAEs  related  to  oligohidrosis  (dehydration  and  heat stroke).    These  events  were  reported  in  four  subjects  while  receiving  zonisamide.    Dehydration  was reported in three subjects; one of these events was reported as serious.  In addition, one subject had a non-serious heat stroke on Study Day 857 that was rated as mild in intensity.  None of the four subjects discontinued study drug because of these events. Oligohydrosis and renal stones may be related to an effect on carbonic anhydrase

## Cognitive Function

Patients withdrew from both placebo controlled and All zonisamide groups for difficulty in concentrating, difficulty with memory, somnolence, emotional lability, confusion and depression.

In  a  small  study  in  nine  patients,  at  mean  steady  state  plasma  concentrations  of  approximately 30 mcg/ml,  zonisamide  appeared  to  affect  specific  cognitive functions such  as  acquisition  and consolidation  of  new  information.    There  was  no  effect  on  previously  learned  material  such  as vocabulary and psychomotor performance.  Verbal learning was affected but visual-perceptual learning was not.  Clinical signs and symptoms of toxicity were not observed.

In  the  placebo  controlled  trials,  within  the  Nervous  System  body  system,  commonly  reported  events included  fatigue,  somnolence  and  tiredness;  somnolence  occurred  more  frequently  with  zonisamide (16.1%)  than  with  placebo  (8.3%).    There  were  reports  coded  as  agitation/irritability,  confusion, difficulty  concentrating and difficulty with memory.  All these occurred slightly more frequently with zonisamide than with placebo but the differences were less marked than for somnolence.

## Rash and hypersensitivity

A total of 30 subjects had TEAEs that met the search criteria for hypersensitivity.  Twenty subjects had an  allergic  reaction,  seven  had  urticaria  and  four  subjects  had  ulcerative  stomatitis.    One  of  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

urticarial events was considered serious (severe intensity); this event started on Study Day 2 and ended on Day 50.  The study drug was temporarily discontinued, but the subject did not discontinue treatment. One subject with a non-serious allergic reaction (mild intensity and possibly related to study drug) that started on Day 25 was discontinued from the study on Day 28 due to this adverse event.

A total of 101 subjects had TEAE that met the criteria for rash-like events. The occurrence of the rashlike events resulted in discontinuation of 10 of the other 98 subjects.

## Post marketing experience

From  approval  in  2000  until  March 2003,  subject  exposure  for  zonisamide  capsules  in  the  US  is estimated  to  be  59,667 patient-years  (total  prescriptions  per  year)  based  upon  retail  and  mail  order prescriptions.  Hospital patient data are not available and US exposure information is based upon US prescription  data  provided  by  Scott-Levin.    From  approval  (March 2000)  until  December  2002,  the number of unique subjects was estimated to be 37,276.

Based upon prescription data provided by Intercontinental Marketing Services  (IMS)  through Dainippon, cumulative Japanese zonisamide exposure is estimated to be 2,230,460 patient-years from approval in Japan in April 1989 until March 2003, which represents approximately 1,229,881 unique subjects.

In  total,  632 cases  containing  adverse  events  cases,  that  indicate  a  possible  relationship  between  the event  and  the  use  of  zonisamide,  were  identified  from  US  and  Japanese  post-marketing  sources.   Of these, 257 cases contained 602 SAEs.

Overall , based on the combined incidence of cases from the US and Japan, all events listed below have occurred in isolated cases (&lt;1:10000).

Neurological Events: Convulsion, grand mal convulsion, psychosis, hallucinations, confusion, somnolence, depression, thinking abnormal, amnesia, coma.

Gastrointestinal Events: Nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal disorder, diarrhoea, pancreatitis.

Haematologic Events: Agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, aplastic anaemia, pancytopenia, leucocytosis.

Hepatic Events: Liver damage, liver function tests abnormal.

Hypersensitivity  Reactions: Allergic  reactions,  including  rash,  pruritus,  Stevens  Johnson  Syndrome, erythema multiforme.

Renal Events: Urolithiasis, kidney calculus, urinary tract infection, hydronephrosis, urine abnormality, kidney failure.

Respiratory Events: Pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory disorder, dyspnoea

Skin and Appendages Events: Rash.

In addition, isolated cases of fever, metabolic acidosis, myasthenia, hypokalaemia, non-protein nitrogen increase, creatine phosphokinase increase, rhabdomyolysis, abnormal vision, lymphadenopathy, neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome,  oligohidrosis,  including  decreased  sweating  and  heat  stroke,  and SUDEP have been reported.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Data from clinical trials were supplemented with data from extensive post marketing experience in the United States and Japan. The safety profile of zonisamide is more or less the expected profile for an anti-epileptic given in the add-on setting and sulphonamides.

In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of TEAEs was 77.9% with zonisamide and 67.7% with placebo  whilst  treatment-related  TEAEs  occurred  in  61.0%  of  zonisamide  subjects  and  48.6%  of placebo subjects.  The incidence of TEAEs was greater with zonisamide than with placebo for both the dose-escalation phase and the steady-state treatment phase.  The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was higher in the dose-escalation phase than in the steady-state phase in both treatment groups.  In the All Zonisamide population, the incidence of TEAEs was 89.1% of subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of serious TEAEs was similar for the zonisamide group (4.8%) and the placebo group (4.6%) (placebo-controlled studies).  The incidence of serious TEAEs was higher in the All Zonisamide population  (19.0%)  reflecting  the  longer  treatment  duration  in  the  uncontrolled  studies.    The  most frequently  reported  serious  TEAEs  in  the  All  Zonisamide  population  were  convulsion  reported as an adverse  event  (4.6%)  and  kidney  calculus  (3.3%).    There  were  no  reports  of  kidney  calculus, irrespective of seriousness, in the placebo-controlled studies.

The high incidence of CNS events is not unexpected for anti-epileptics. There does however appear to be an association between zonisamide and the occurrence of kidney stones, dehydration and heat stroke. Zonisamide  may  also  lead  to  a  substantial  decrease  in  weight.  Clinically  significant  effects  on  blood pressure and ECG's were not observed.

Certain aspects of the safety profile appear to be related to the fact that it is a benzisoxazole derivative containing a sulphonamide group and is also a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Post marketing experience raised concern with respect to the occurrence of the Steven Johnson syndrome and other serious skin reactions,  heat  stroke,  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome,  rhabdomyolysis  and  kidney  failure.  These should be subject of continued pharmacovigilance activities.

Reports of skin rash and hypersensitivity may reflect a sulphonamide like effect.

Safety was not demonstrated in children, adolescents and the elderly. The small numbers of patients in these age-categories do not allow benefit risk assessment. Studies in children and adolescent are lacking and are to be part of an ongoing developmental plan for zonisamide.

With respect to elderly, special attention should be drawn to the impact of zonisamide on other CNS function especially sedation and cognition as elderly subjects are more sensitive to CNS adverse events. In order to establish the optimal dose in the elderly more safety data are required

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

In this application the main efficacy study (study 302) was designed and performed after the applicant had sought scientific advice from the CPMP. Other previously performed studies were supportive and the overall impression is that the dose used in these latter studies is in the lower effective dose range.

Safety data from clinical trials were supplemented with data from extensive post marketing experience in the United States and Japan. The safety profile of zonisamide is more or less the expected profile for an anti-epileptic given in the add-on setting.

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Pharmacodynamic  studies  have  demonstrated  that  zonisamide  can  reduce  the  extent  of induced  seizures. The mechanism of action remains unclear, although it appears to be similar to phenytoin, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, the main comparators.

Following oral dosing the drug is rapidly absorbed, widely distributed and metabolised, and excreted in the urine. Metabolites are similar across the species tested but vary in relative amount.  Foetal exposure is high, similar to that of the dam.

The main adverse observations following a single high dose of zonisamide appear to be linked to the CNS effects of the drug. In repeat dose toxicity, transient clinical signs of toxicity such as sedation and ataxia, which are in line with its pharmacological action, have been induced when zonisamide was administered as bolus doses (i.e.  gavage) at 200 mg/kg/day or greater; such effects were, however, not seen when higher  doses  (800  mg/kg/day)  were  administered  via  dietary  admixture,  suggesting  a  Cmax  basis  of these observations rather than overall exposure (AUC/Css). Adverse effects in CNS, kidney and liver were observed in animals at doses leaving no safety margin for human therapeutic use. Juvenile toxicity was only investigated in acute studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  reproductive/developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rodents  and  dogs,  no  evidence  of  effects  on  fertility  of zonisamide were seen. Zonisamide was embryotoxic and teratogenic (reduced pup weight, increase in cardiac and major blood vessel defects, delayed ossification) and induced maternal toxicity at high doses. In monkeys zonisamide acted as an abortifacient.  The suggested NOAELs are 20 mg/kg in rats, 10 mg/kg in dogs and &lt;10 mg/kg in monkeys, all of which produce plasma levels within human efficacious levels. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the adverse effects observed in animals might also occur in humans. Pregnancy is  contra-indicated  and  potential  interference  between  zonisamide  and  the  chosen  method  of  avoiding pregnancy should be ruled out.

Based on in  vitro and in vivo genotoxic tests, zonisamide is not considered to pose a genotoxic hazard for  humans.  The  results  of  the  two-year  studies  in  rodents  suggest  that  zonisamide  does  not  possess carcinogenic potential.

No antigenic potential was observed when tested in mice, guinea pigs and rabbits.

No environmental risk is anticipated from the use of zonisamide.

It is considered unlikely that zonisamide could have a dependence liability or potential for abuse.

## Efficacy

Zonisamide, in  comparison  with  placebo  in  study  302,  over  a  period  of  up to 24 weeks, statistically significantly  reduced  the  median frequency  of  complex  partial  seizures  at  500  mg/day.  The  effective dose range claimed is in the SPC (300 - 500 mg per day).

The reduction in complex partial seizure frequency was numerically greater at 300 mg/day compared with placebo but was not statistically significant. The median percentage change in seizure frequency in the 300 mg arm however, is twice of that under placebo and for the 100 mg arm. Moreover, if all partial seizures are considered, the dose response is clear-cut.

Zonisamide  demonstrated  a  responder  rate  (patients  with  a ≥ 50% reduction  in  seizure  frequency)  of over 50% for each seizure grouping at the 500 mg/day dose in study 302, compared with a placebo rate of around 20%. The percentage of responders showed an apparent dose-response relationship for each seizure grouping. An analysis of all seizures across all four-treatment groups (i.e., including placebo), showed a statistically significant dose-response relationship between increasing dose of zonisamide and proportion of responders (p &lt; 0.0001).

There were however limited data in adolescents or in the elderly.

The  high  number  of  drop-outs  (30%-40%)  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  in  the  open  label  studies  raised concern with respect to the maintenance of effect .The applicant has reviewed the withdrawal rates in extension  studies  and  open  label  extension  studies  and  notes  that  withdrawal  rates  varied,  but  were usually higher with longer studies.  Some degree of lack of efficacy is not unexpected in a population with refractory disease.

The titration schedule initially recommended was not justified by the data. The applicant has proposed a titration schedule which is more consistent with that used in study 302, and where it differs from that used  in  study  302,  has  appropriately  justified  the  proposal  on  the  basis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data. Specific instructions are provided for patients with renal impairment or for patients who are not being administered concurrent CYP3A4 inducing agents.  An adequate dose de-escalation is also provided.

Efficacy  in  secondary  generalised  seizures  was  not  evaluated  in  a  separate  pooled  analysis.  The applicant has presented data on seizures leading to secondary generalisation and secondary generalised seizures,  and  median  and  mean  percent  reductions  were  seen  for  the  300  and  500mg  doses.  The applicant acknowledges that the limited numbers make it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

The choice of complex partial seizures as primary endpoint in study 302 is uncommon. The applicant has provided the rationale for the primary endpoint and how it was defined as those subjects for whom a 50% or greater reduction in complex partial seizure frequency relative to baseline was demonstrated in the fixed dose assessment period. The applicant has also confirmed that the endpoint was defined in the original protocol and was not driven by a protocol amendment. However, inclusion criteria and endpoint

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

should be consistent. Study 302 is affected by the inclusion of subject with no complex partial seizures who do not add to primary efficacy.

Concern  was  raised  as  to  whether  the  way  seizure  frequency  was  normalised  and  whether  different definitions  of  patient  populations  did  not  introduce,  at  least  partly,  artificial  results.  The  applicant indicates  that  missing  data  with  regard  to  seizures  were  imputed  from  the  up-titration  period.  An analysis was conducted with respect to the week 19-36 fixed dose period that does not impute missing data and there were no significant differences in the results compared to those where missing data had been imputed.

The  definition  of  three  population  data  sets  ITT-,  Primary  Efficacy  Analysis  -,  and  the  efficacy evaluable - population) also raised concern with respect to the manner how missing values was dealt with.  The  applicant  has  performed  the  requested  analysis  that  demonstrates  statistically  significant reductions in all partial seizure frequency for the 300 and 500mg doses. For the responder analysis the P-values for both analyses for the 500mg/day versus placebo showed statistical significance p=&lt;0.0001.

The extension of the fixed dose period in study 302 from week 19-36 is agreed.

## Safety

The safety profile of zonisamide in adults is acceptable. The safety profile is more or less the expected profile for an anti-epileptic given in the add-on setting and sulphonamides.

In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of TEAEs was 77.9% with zonisamide and 67.7% with placebo  whilst  treatment-related  TEAEs  occurred  in  61.0%  of  zonisamide  subjects  and  48.6%  of placebo subjects.  The incidence of TEAEs was greater with zonisamide than with placebo for both the dose-escalation phase and the steady-state treatment phase.  The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was higher in the dose-escalation phase than in the steady-state phase in both treatment groups.  In the All Zonisamide population, the incidence of TEAEs was 89.1% of subjects.

The incidence of serious TEAEs was similar for the zonisamide group (4.8%) and the placebo group (4.6%) (placebo-controlled studies).  The incidence of serious TEAEs was higher in the All Zonisamide population  (19.0%)  reflecting  the  longer  treatment  duration  in  the  uncontrolled  studies.    The  most frequently  reported  serious  TEAEs  in  the  All  Zonisamide  population  were  convulsion  reported as an adverse  event  (4.6%)  and  kidney  calculus  (3.3%).    There  were  no  reports  of  kidney  calculus, irrespective of seriousness, in the placebo-controlled studies.

Safety in children, adolescents and the elderly could not be assessed due to insufficient data.

Certain aspects of the safety profile appear to be related to the fact that it is a benzisoxazole derivative containing a sulphonamide group and is also a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Post marketing experience raised concern with respect to the occurrence of the Steven Johnson syndrome and other serious skin reactions, heat stroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure.

## Benefit/risk assessment

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Zonisamide is of low acute oral toxicity (LD50 ≥ 1000 mg/kg) in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. The main  effects  are  CNS-related.  There  is  no  apparent  gender-related  difference.  Neonatal  rats  are  of increased sensitivity. In repeated dose studies, zonisamide induces adverse effects on the CNS, kidney and liver. Reproduction toxicology studies indicated that zonisamide has abortifacient and teratogenic potential. The safety margin for these effects is low to absent. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the adverse effects observed in animals might also occur in humans. Adverse eye effects were not observed in  the  repeated  dose  studies.  Zonisamide  does  not  possess  genotoxic  or  carcinogenic  potential.  No antigenic potential was observed when tested in mice, guinea pigs and rabbits. It is considered unlikely that  zonisamide contains  potential for dependence liability. Juvenile toxicity was not investigated. An expert report has been submitted on the environmental risk. The conclusion that there is no concern for environmental pollution is endorsed.

Zonisamide, in  comparison  with  placebo  in  study  302,  over  a  period  of  up to 24 weeks, statistically significantly  reduced  the  median frequency  of  complex  partial  seizures  at  500  mg/day.  The  effective dose range claimed is in the SPC (300 - 500 mg per day).

The reduction in complex partial seizure frequency was numerically greater at 300 mg/day compared with placebo but was not statistically significant. The median percentage change in seizure frequency in the 300 mg arm however, is twice of that under placebo and for the 100 mg arm. Moreover, if all partial seizures are considered, the dose response is clear-cut.

Zonisamide  demonstrated  a  responder  rate  (patients  with  a ≥ 50% reduction  in  seizure  frequency)  of over 50% for each seizure grouping at the 500 mg/day dose in study 302, compared with a placebo rate of around 20%. The percentage of responders showed an apparent dose-response relationship for each seizure grouping.

There is limited data in adolescents and elderly. Therefore the indication is restricted to adults.

The  applicant  has  proposed  a  titration  schedule  on  the  basis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data.  Specific instructions  are  provided  for  patients  with  renal  impairment  or  for  patients  who  are  not  being administered concurrent CYP3A5 inducing agents.  An adequate dose de-escalation is also provided.

Efficacy  in  secondary  generalised  seizures  was  not  evaluated  in  a  separate  pooled  analysis  and  the limited numbers make it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

In  clinical  safety,  the  high  incidence  of  CNS  events  is  not  unexpected  for  anti-epileptics.  There  does however  appear  to  be  an  association  between  zonisamide  and  the  occurrence  of  kidney  stones, dehydration and heat stroke. Zonisamide may also lead to weight loss. Clinically significant effects on blood pressure and ECG's were not observed.

Certain aspects of the safety profile appear to be related to the fact that zonisamide is a benzisoxazole derivative containing a sulphonamide group and is also a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Post marketing experience  raised  concern  with  respect  to  the  occurrence  of  the  Steven  Johnson  syndrome  and  other serious skin reactions, heat stroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure. The applicant committed in a letter of undertaking to ensure a close pharmacovigilance monitoring.

Safety was not demonstrated in children, adolescents and the elderly. The small numbers of patients in these age-categories do not allow benefit risk assessment. Studies in children and adolescent are lacking and are to be part of an ongoing developmental plan for zonisamide.

With respect to elderly, special attention should be drawn to the impact of zonisamide on other CNS function especially sedation and cognition as elderly subjects are more sensitive to CNS adverse events. In  order  to  establish  the  optimal  dose  in  the  elderly  more  safety  data  are  required.  A  post-marketing surveillance  focusing  on  the  CNS  effects  of  zonisamide  use  in  the  elderly  is  planned  as  a  follow-up measure.

Overall,  zonisamide  is  considered  to  have  a  positive  benefit  risk  ratio  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults with epilepsy.

## Recommendation

'Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Zonegran in the adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation
