| A31/0185 | Pursuant to Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC, Germany initiated a procedure on 6 July 2016 based on concerns resulting from the evaluation of data from pharmacovigilance activities. The PRAC was requested to assess the potential impact of the results of the SIPPET study (which concluded that recombinant factor VIII medicines had a higher incidence of inhibitor development than plasma-derived medicines), and to issue a recommendation as to whether the marketing authorisations of these products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. The EMA concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear and consistent evidence of a difference in the incidence of inhibitor development between the two classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from plasma and those made by recombinant DNA technology. Due to the different characteristics of individual products within the two classes, EMA concluded that the risk of inhibitor development Medicinal product | 14/09/2017 16/11/2017 SmPC and PL Please refer to the assessment report: human coagulation factor VIII - EMEA/H/A-31/1448 no longer |

The PRAC considered the publication of the results of the RODIN/PedNet study, the preliminary findings from the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance System (EUHASS) registry and all available data submitted from clinical trials, observational studies, published literature and quality data for Kogenate Bayer and Helixate NexGen with regards to its potential risk of inhibitor development in previously untreated patients (PUPs). The PRAC noted that the efficacy of Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen is not questioned and, on the basis of the available data, concluded that the current results do not confirm an increased risk of developing antibodies against Kogenate Bayer and Helixate NexGen when compared with other factor VIII products in PUPs with the bleeding disorder haemophilia A. The PRAC considered though that the frequency for inhibitor development in PUPs should be amended from 'common' to 'very common' in the section 4.8 of the SmPC and also recommended that the product information should be updated to reflect the most product   | no longer   |

Submission of the final study report of the Leopold I study and its extension. The study was a two-part, randomised, cross-over, open-label trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety profile of a novel formulation plasma protein-free recombinant FVIII in previously treated subjects with severe haemophilia A under prophylaxis therapy. The study compared the novel formulation with the existing one of Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen and was submitted under Art. 46 of the paediatric Regulation EC/1901/2006. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 21/11/2013 Medicinal product | n/a The MAH submitted paediatric data for the marketed product KOGENATE Bayer from the Leopold I study in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. The PK analyses included the determination of BAY 81-8973, an investigational product, and KOGENATE Bayer. A lower AUC and t1/2 was observed for both drugs as a result of a higher clearance in the paediatric population. Section 4.2 of the SmPC already contains information on long term prophylaxis against bleeding in younger patients with severe haemophilia A, where it is suggested to have shorter dose intervals or higher doses. This information is consistent with the PK results from the study. Safety and tolerability were consistent with the known profile. No new safety concerns were identified. No changes to the product information in relation to the data submitted were considered necessary. no longer |

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- | 20/09/2012         | 23/10/2012 | SmPC and PL longer | Following the review of complaints concerning the appearance of particulate matter present in the vial from the Bio-Set reconstitution device, the cause was identified as stemming from the sterile Bio-Set assembly or sterile rubber stopper particles which could occur during the coring process when the sterile Bio-Set needle 'cores' through the rubber stopper. The MAH implemented corrective actions through better wording in the SmPC and PL to reinforce the guidance on the preparation, reconstitution and appropriate filtering prior to administration of the product. authorised |

The following wording was agreed with the CHMP: \"In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days). Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors: Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU. The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days). The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range: 4-478). Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, |
