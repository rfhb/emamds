## ANNEX IV

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tremelimumab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on myelitis transverse, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and myelitis transverse is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing tremelimumab should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on rhabdomyolysis from the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and rhabdomyolysis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing tremelimumab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tremelimumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tremelimumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
