## I. INTRODUCTION

On 9 th December  2008  the  MAH  submitted  four  completed  paediatric  studies  relevant  to  Ambirix  and Twinrix Paediatric in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use.

A short critical expert overview was provided for each study.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies  do  not influence the  benefit  risk  for  Ambirix  or Twinrix Paediatric and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

The  assessor  agrees  that  the  MAH  has  fulfilled  Article  45  for  the  two  vaccines  as  a  result  of  this submission and that there are no implications for the prescribing information.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## II.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical studies

Ambirix is  the  exact  same  product  as  Twinrix  Adult  and  therefore  contains  twice  as  much  inactivated HAV (720  EL.U/ml  compared  to  360  EL.U/ml)  and  rHBsAg  (20  μg  rHBsAg  compared  to  10 µ g)  as Twinrix Paediatric.

Both products may be used to immunise children aged from 1-15 years against hepatitis A and B but offer the alternative of two doses of Ambirix administered at least 6 months apart versus a standard three-dose regimen of Twinrix Paediatric administered at 0, 1 and 6 months.

The  advantage  of  the  Twinrix  Paediatric  three-dose  regimen  is  that  a  higher  degree  of  protection (especially against hepatitis B) can be expected between months 1 and 6 compared to that between months 0  and  6-12  of  a  two-dose  Ambirix  regimen.  Therefore  the  choice  between  products  depends  on  how quickly it is desired to elicit a high level of immunity to both viruses. If there is no hurry then prescribers, parents and children may prefer the 2-dose Ambirix due to the lesser number of injections.

Due to the overlapping nature of these products and their relevance to the paediatric population the Rapporteur has chosen to include the four studies in a single assessment report.

## II.3 Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted reports for:

Ambirix:

Studies HAB-051, -052 and -053

## Twinrix Paediatric Study HAB-164 Ext 038 Year 10

## 2. Clinical studies

## HAB-051

The study was conducted in Taiwan in 1997-1998 and the study report is dated October 29 th 1998.

## · Objectives

## Primary Objective

To compare the immunogenicity of Ambirix administered alone with that of Havrix and Engerix B (both adult dose versions) when given concomitantly into opposite arms.

Secondary Objective

To evaluate the reactogenicity after each dose of Ambirix compared to co-administration of Havrix and Engerix B.

## · Study design

This was an open, randomised study in which 64 subjects were to receive Ambirix or Havrix + Engerix B with dosing at Month 0 and Month 6. Blood samples were obtained on the day of screening and at months 1, 6, and 7 for assay of anti-HAV and anti-HBsAg antibodies.

Approximately six hours post vaccination and in the morning for three subsequent days parents were to record general (systemic) and local injection site signs and symptoms,  including  axillary  body temperature.

## · Study population /Sample size

Subjects were to be between 1 and 11 years old and seronegative for anti-HAV and anti-HBs at screening.

The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  the  primary  serological  end-points  but  was  not  fixed  by  a statistical  method.  The  number  selected  was  considered  sufficient  to  draw  valid  clinical  conclusions. Results  of  similar  studies  showed  that  seroconversion  rates  after  Havrix  and  seroprotection  rates  after Engerix-B were both 95 %. With 50 completed and evaluable subjects by group, a power of 80 % and an alpha level of 5 % using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, a 25 % difference between the two groups could be detected for either the anti-HAV seroconversion rate or the anti-HBs seroprotection rate.

## · Treatments

Group 1 received Ambirix and Group 2 received full strength Havrix + Engerix B. Single lots were used.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Seroconversion rates for hepatitis A and seroprotection rates for hepatitis B
- -GMTs at month 7
- -Nature and incidence of the reactions after each dose administration.
- Statistical Methods

Two analyses were performed: ATP and ITT.

Seropositivity was defined as the appearance of antibodies ≥ 1 mIU/ml for anti -HBs and ≥33mIU/ml for anti-HAV. Seroprotection against HBV was defined as anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/ml.  The seroconversion and seroprotection rates were compared using Fisher's exact test. The corresponding GMTs were compared by the ANOVA one-way test or by a nonparametric test (Kruskal-Wallis test).

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

Two of the 64 volunteers enrolled were eliminated from the analysis of reactogenicity as one of the study vaccine doses was not administered. One subject was eliminated from the immunogenicity analysis as no blood sampling was done at month 7. Hence, 61 completed the study up to month 7.

## · Immunogenicity

## Hepatitis A

All subjects seroconverted after a single dose of vaccine except for one in the Ambirix group. All subjects were seropositive at Month 7 with comparable GMTs between vaccine groups. The increases in anti-HAV GMTs from month 1 to month 7 were 88.7% and 91.8%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatitis B

One month after the first dose &gt; 90% had already seroconverted and about 80% were seroprotected. At month 7, all subjects were seropositive, all except one was seroprotected and the GMTs were comparable.

## HAB-052

This study was also conducted in Taiwan but from 1996-1998 at a different site and in adolescents aged from  10-19  years  that  were  seronegative  for  anti-HAV  and  anti-HBs  at  screening.  The  study  report  is dated November 9 th 1998.

The study design was essentially the same as that for HAB-051 described above.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

Of the 103 enrolled four subjects were eliminated from the analysis of reactogenicity as a study vaccine dose was not administered. Three subjects were eliminated from the analysis of immunogenicity. Thus, 99 completed the study up to month 7 and 96 were assessed for immune responses.

## · Immunogenicity

## Hepatitis A response

At month 1 all except one subject in each group had already seroconverted.  All subjects were seropositive at  month  7  at  which  time  the  anti-HAV  GMT  in  the  Ambirix  group  was  more  than  twice  that  in  the concomitant HAV + HBV group and the 95% CI did not overlap. The increase in anti-HAV GMTs from month 1 to month 7 was 89.8 % for the Ambirix group and 87.2% for Group 2.

## Hepatitis B response

At  month  1,  61.2%  in  the  Ambirix  group  and  70.2%  in  the  concomitant  HAV  +  HBV  group  had seroconverted and about half the vaccinees in each group were seroprotected. At month 6, seropositivity had increased in both groups to 79.6% and 72.3% while seroprotection rates were 51.0% and 42.6%. At month 7 the seroprotection rate in the Ambirix group was 91.8% compared to 95.7% in the concomitant HAV + HBV group, yet the GMT was approximately 2 times higher in the Ambirix group. The increase in GMTs from month 1 to month 7 was 96.4% in the Ambirix group and 95.0% in the concomitant HAV + HBV group.

After  dose  1  and  dose  2,  the  concomitant  HAV+HBV  vaccine  group  had  a  higher  incidence  of  local symptoms. After all doses, soreness at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom (17% of Ambirix doses, 8.2% of Havrix and 27.6% of Engerix doses). One subject had a local injection site symptom of soreness that was of grade 3, which occurred at both the Havrix and Engerix sites following the first dose.

Headache  and  fatigue  were  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  symptoms.  The  investigator considered these general symptoms to be related or possibly related to the candidate vaccine in all cases reported. There were no incidences of malaise, nausea or vomiting following any of the doses.

After  dose  2,  one  subject  from  group  2  reported  fatigue  that  was  scored  as  grade  3  and  considered  as related or possibly related to vaccination.

The duration of most solicited symptoms was one to two days and all resolved within the four day followup period.

No unsolicited symptoms were reported in this study during the 30-day follow-up period. No SAEs were reported and no subjects from either group were reported to have received concomitant medications.

## HAB-053

Study  053  was  conducted  in  1997-1998  at  four  centres  -  two  in  Brazil,  one  in  Mexico  and  one  in Argentina. The study report is dated December 1999 but with an amendment made in June 2000 to correct the injection sites (right and left arms for Havrix and Engerix injections had been interposed) and to add that centres 1 and 2 (in Brazil) had been audited.

This  study  was  essentially  of  the  same  design  as  051  and  052  described  above.  However,  2:1 randomisation was used for Ambirix versus Havrix + Engerix and the study intended to enrol subjects from 5-18 years (the actual enrolment was from 4-20 years). Also, the final blood draw was at 6 weeks after the second dose rather than at Month 7 (although the tables still refer to Month 7).

All laboratory assays at the preliminary visit were done at the investigators' laboratories. RIA was used to test for HBsAg (Austria II - Abbott) and anti-HBc (Corab-Abbott). Anti-HAV was tested by Enzymun (Boerhinger Mannheim) and anti-HBs using the RIA of Ausab-Abbott. ALT and AST were measured with a Merck kit or a Beckman Instruments analyzer.

Samples  obtained  at  the  post-vaccination  visits  were  assayed  in  the  MAH's  laboratories  using  a Boerhinger Mannheim commercial kit for anti-HAV and the Ausab-Abbott kit for anti-HBs.

## · Immunogenicity

## Hepatitis A response

After the second doses of assigned vaccines all subjects in group 1 and all except one in group 2 were seropositive. The anti-HAV GMT for group 1 was significantly higher than that for group 2 (the 95% CI do not overlap). The results were comparable in all countries.

The second table below shows that in the age group of 4-11 years all subjects were seropositive after the second doses and the difference in GMTs was even more marked.

The third table shows the results for those aged 12-20 years, which were similar to the overall results.

At 2 months after the first dose &gt; 80% had seroconverted and around half were seroprotected. After the second assigned doses all subjects had seroconverted and almost all were seroprotected. The GMT was higher  in  group  1  but  the  95%  CI  overlapped  for  the  entire  study  population  results.  The  results  were comparable in all countries.

The results of intention-to-treat analysis of immunogenicity were consistent with those obtained from the analysis performed according to protocol.

## · Safety

Group  2  reported  a  higher  number  of  total  and  local  symptoms  (solicited/unsolicited  during  the  4-day follow-up period) than group 1 but the incidence of general symptoms (solicited/unsolicited) in the 4-day follow-up period was similar in the two groups. There was a decrease in incidence of local and general symptoms (solicited/unsolicited) with subsequent doses in both groups.

Soreness at injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in both groups. Only 2 solicited local symptoms of intensity grade 3 were reported. These two were cases of soreness at injection site  reported  by  subjects in  group  1.  All  solicited local  symptoms occurred within two days of vaccine administration and all resolved within the 4-day follow-up

Only 2 solicited general symptoms of intensity grade 3 were reported (both in group 1). These concerned cases  of  fatigue  and  malaise  following  vaccine  dose  2.  The  majority  of  solicited  general  symptoms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported occurred within two days of vaccine administration and all resolved within the 4-day follow-up period.

Overall 19 subjects (9 in group 1 and 10 in group 2) reported 24 unsolicited symptoms during the 30-day follow-up period after the vaccination. Also, 24 doses (12 per group) were followed by at least one report of unsolicited symptoms and 7 doses (3 in group 1, 4 in group 2) were followed by at least one unsolicited symptom determined by the investigator to be related/possibly related to the vaccination. No unsolicited symptoms of intensity grade 3 were reported. All the unsolicited symptoms reported resolved within the 30-day follow-up period after the vaccination.

There were 18 subjects (11 in group 1 and 7 in group 2) who received concomitant medication during the study period but no medication was given prophylactically in anticipation of reaction to vaccination.

One pregnancy was reported to occur at 5 months after the first dose of vaccination. This resulted in a healthy  child  and  no  complications  occurred  either  during  pregnancy  or  during  delivery.  The  study vaccination was discontinued.

One subject reported a SAE of fever and urticaria with onset 10 days after the first dose of vaccination. A diagnosis of allergic reaction was made but the investigator determined that the event was unrelated to study vaccination. This subject received the second dose of the vaccine and there were no SAEs following the second dose.

## HAB-164 = Ext of original study HAB-038 to Year 10

The first volunteer was enrolled in the primary study on 8 July 1994 and the last study visit in the primary study  was  28  March  1995.  The  long-term  follow-up  visits  at  Month  120  were  conducted  between  20 September 2004 and 18 October 2004. The study completion date was 6 May 2005. The study report is dated February 2006.

The original clinical study protocol 208127/044 (HAB-038) was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of two lots of Twinrix Paediatric (360/10) when administered according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule to healthy children between 6 and 15 years of age.

The original study protocol was amended three times to extend the serological follow up to 60, 90 and then 120 months.

Results  from  the  primary  study  had  shown  an  anti-HAV  seropositivity  rate  of  100%  and  anti-HBs seroprotection  rate  of  100%  at  Month  7.  Data  obtained  up  to  Month  90  had  shown  an  anti-HAV seropositivity rate of 100% and an anti-HBs seroprotection rate of 92.9% (for pooled groups).

## · Objectives

The objectives of the long-term follow-up study were:

- -To evaluate anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody persistence at Month 120 (i.e. Year 10) after the first dose of the primary series.
- -To evaluate immune memory in subjects who became seronegative for anti-HAV (&lt; 15 mIU/ml) or  had  anti-HBs  antibody  &lt;  10  mIU/ml  at  Month  120  by  administration  of  a  single  dose  of Twinrix Adult between 6 to 12 months after the Month 120 visit.

## · Study design

See the table below.

The primary study was a double-blind, randomised (to one of two vaccine lots), single centre study. The long-term follow-up at Month 120 was an open study with the same group allocation as in the primary study i.e.

- Group 1: had received vaccine lot HAB101C2 in the primary study
- Group 2: had received vaccine lot HAB102B2 in the primary study

## · Study population  and treatment

At Month 120 the single subject who had anti-HBs antibody concentrations &lt; 10 mIU/ml was offered and accepted a dose of Twinrix Adult and was followed up for safety.

Note: Please note that all the procedures marked by * were performed only for the subjects who had anti-HBs antibody concentrations &lt;10 mlU/ml.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

Up to Month 60, anti-HBs antibody concentrations were measured by Radioimmunoassay (AUSAB RIA Abbott)  with  an  assay  cut-off  of  1  mIU/ml  and  anti-  HAV  antibody  concentrations  were  measured  by ELISA [Enzymun (Boehringer Mannheim)] with an assay cut-off of 33 mIU/ml.

At Months 90 and 120 anti-HAV antibody was assayed using Enzygnost from Dade Behring with an assay cut-off of 15 mIU/ml and anti-HBs using AUSAB EIA from Abbott Laboratories with an assay cut-off at 3.3  mIU/ml. For bridging purposes the Month 60 samples were re-tested with the new EIA assay kits. Subjects with antibody concentrations above the assay cut-offs were considered seropositive.

## · Safety

In  the  retrospective  follow-up,  there  were  no  SAEs  or  pregnancies  reported  in  the  study  since  the  last study visit at Month 90.

The subject who received Twinrix Adult did not report any SAEs. The subject returned the diary card and did not report local or general solicited/unsolicited symptoms in the pre-defined follow-up period (Day 0 to Day 3 for solicited symptoms and Day 0 to Day 30 for unsolicited symptoms).

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  three  studies  with  Ambirix  were  all  comparisons  against  two  doses  of  adult  strength  Havrix  and Engerix co-administered at the same time points. The relevance of these comparisons to the EU is low since the choice for immunisation of children against both HAV and HBV would lie between three doses of Twinrix Paediatric or two doses of Ambirix (i.e. Twinrix Adult).

However, all  three  studies  indicated  that  two  doses  of  Ambirix  elicited  satisfactory  immune  responses after the second dose. In addition, the safety profile of Ambirix appeared to be at least as good as that of co-administration of adult strength Havrix and Engerix.

In the long-term follow-up of study 038 the interpretation of the 10-year data must be cautious due to the low numbers that returned. However, the fact that all were still seropositive for anti-HAV and all except one  was  seroprotected  against  HBV  in  this  population  that  had  been  aged  6-15  years  old  when  first vaccinated is in keeping with data from many other studies, including vaccines against HAV and/or HBV produced by other companies.

The  data  do  not  raise  any  concerns  and  do  not  require  any  changes  to  the  prescribing  information  for Ambirix or Twinrix Paediatric.
