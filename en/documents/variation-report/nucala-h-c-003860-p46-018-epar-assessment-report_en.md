## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report, dated 14 th  December 2023, for:

Study  204524,  entitled  Nucala  Subcutaneous  Injection  Special  Drug  Use  Investigation  (Long-Term) (Study on Bronchial Asthma).

## 2.3.2. Clinical Study 204524

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

The primary objective of this non-interventional study was to collect and assess information regarding the safety and effectiveness of the long-term use of mepolizumab for subcutaneous injection in Japanese patients with bronchial asthma in routine clinical practice.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design/objectives

The target population for this study was patients who had received a diagnosis of bronchial asthma (a refractory  asthma  whose  symptoms  are  inadequately  controlled  despite  receiving  standard  asthma medications), and who had not previously been treated/prescribed with Nucala.

This study involved a 'central enrollment method' with data entry into an electronic data capture (EDC) system and subject enrollment to be completed within 14 days from the initiation of Nucala treatment.

The observation period (Nucala treatment period) per subject was one year (52 weeks) from the initiation of Nucala treatment. In addition, the follow-up investigation was to be conducted for 2 years after the observation period (or after the discontinuation/termination of Nucala treatment in discontinued/terminated cases) to investigate for occurrences of malignant tumour.

As per the submitted Protocol Synopsis, the following details were to be ascertained at 'observation times':

- 1) Information regarding medical institutions
- 2) Patient characteristics (at the initiation of Nucala treatment)
3. Identification number, gender, year of birth, start date of Nucala administration, hospitalization status, reason for use, presence/absence and names of comorbidities (renal impairment, hepatic impairment, allergies, others), history of smoking. duration of asthma, pre-administration severity and type of asthma
- 3) Prior medications for bronchial asthma (during 4 weeks prior to the initiation of Nucala treatment)
5. 4:5 Administration status of Nucala Concomitant medications
6. 7 Blood test items
7. 6 Concomitant therapies for bronchial asthma (except for medications)
- 8) Exacerbation of asthma
- 9) Respiratory function test (peak expiratory flow: PEF)
- 10) Asthma control test (ACT)
- 11) Global assessment of effectiveness
- 12) Status (continuation/discontinuation) of Nucala treatment at the end of the observation period
- 13) Occurrence status of malignant tumor during 2 years after the observation period (follow-up investigation)
- 14) Pregnancy
- 15) Adverse events (AEs)

In this study, effectiveness was assessed by the investigators as either \"effective\" or \"not effective\" at Week 52 of Nucala treatment or at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination, based on the course of subjective symptoms, course of clinical symptoms, and other findings from the initiation of Nucala treatment to the end of the observation period. If effectiveness could not be determined for some reasons, it was assessed as \"indeterminable.\"

The  safety  assessments  were  a  collection  of  all  adverse  events  (serious  and  non-serious)  including deaths.  In  this  study,  \"hypersensitivity  reaction  including  anaphylaxis,\"  \"infections,\"  and  \"malignant tumour\" were classified as 'safety specifications and priority investigation matters'. Of note, as per the regulations of the PMDA, the Japanese competent authority, only adverse events which are considered to  be  related  to  study  treatment  are  required  to  be  reported  in  the  clinical  study  report.  Causality assessment between adverse events and the study drug was determined by treating physicians, and not the sponsor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study participants

The study included patients who had received a diagnosis of bronchial asthma (a refractory asthma whose symptoms were inadequately controlled despite receiving standard asthma medications), and who had not previously been treated/prescribed Nucala.

The study was open to adult and paediatric enrolment.

## Treatments

This  was  a  non-interventional  study  in  routine  clinical  practice  using  authorised  Nucala  medicinal products:

| Tradename                            | Nucala for s.c. injection 100 mg Nucala solution for s.c.injection100mgSyringe Nucala solution for s.c.injection100 mgPen   |

## Outcomes

## Effectiveness

Assessment  of  effectiveness  of  treatment  by  investigators:  As  either  \"effective\",  \"not  effective\"  or \"indeterminable' at Week 52 or at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination.

The  final  CSR  (Section  2.5)  provides  results  pertaining  to  the  measurement  of  other  effectiveness outcomes:

- 'exacerbation of bronchial asthma': Changes from baseline (\"during the 52 weeks before the initiation of Nucala treatment\") in the frequency of exacerbations after Nucala treatment (\"at Week 52 of treatment or at the time of treatment discontinuation\"
- 'respiratory function test/peak expiratory flow': The mean peak expiratory flow (PEF, L/min) \"at the initiation of Nucala treatment,\" \"at 12 weeks after the initiation of Nucala treatment (at Week 12 of treatment),\" \"at Week 24 of treatment,\" and \"at Week 52 of treatment\" or \"at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination\"]
- 'asthma control test': The mean asthma control test (ACT) 10) score \"at the initiation of Nucala treatment,\" \"at 12 weeks after the initiation of Nucala treatment (at Week 12 of treatment),\" \"at Week 24 of treatment,\" and \"at Week 52 of treatment\"

## Safety

Adverse  events  (their  type,  incidence,  time  to  onset,  relatedness  to  IP),  including  those  of  specific interest  in  the  study  (\"hypersensitivity  reaction  including  anaphylaxis,\"  \"infections,\"  and  \"malignant tumor').

Blood eosinophil count at prespecified timepoints were recorded; \"before treatment initiation (9 to 52 weeks before the initiation of Nucala treatment),\" \"at the time of treatment initiation (0 to 8 weeks before the initiation of Nucala treatment),\" \"at 12 weeks after the initiation of Nucala treatment (Week 12 of treatment),\" \"at Week 24 of treatment,\" and \"at Week 52 of treatment or at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination'.

Serum total IgE concentration (IU/mL) before Nucala treatment and the presence or absence of \"a history of omalizumab use\" was investigated in the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set. In addition, Serum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

total  IgE  levels  were  collected  prior  to  omalizumab  administration  or  at  1  year  or  later  after discontinuation of omalizumab treatment if there was a history of omalizumab use.

## Sample size

There was a target enrolment of 1000 patients.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was a non-interventional study in routine clinical practice.

## Statistical Methods

No statistical analysis plan or discussion of statistical methods was provided in the submission.

## CHMP comments

Study 204524 was an open label, non-interventional study that was designed to collect and assess safety and efficacy data from the long-term use of Nucala in Japanese clinical practice. Due to enrolment of paediatric patients in the study, the MAH was obliged, under Article 46 of Regulation 1901/2006, to submit the final clinical study report (CSR) and critical expert overview within 6 months of the completion of the study. The study was not part of a PIP.

No study protocol was provided by the applicant, and the final CSR was not written in accordance with ICH E3 Clinical Study Reports guidelines, making it difficult to evaluate certain aspects of study design (inclusion/exclusion criteria, schedule of assessments, handling patient withdrawals/dropouts etc), study conduct and statistical methods (definition of safety and effectiveness analysis sets, ADRs, responders etc) employed. Lack of such detail presents challenges in the interpretation of the robustness of data. Comparing  generated  data  to  other  studies  in  Nucala's  clinical  development  is  confounded  by  the differences in patient characteristics, study methods and study conditions between Study 204524 and previous studies.

That  said,  the  applicant  has  provided  this  Article  46  paediatric  study  submission  in  line  with  EMA guidance, and sufficient detail is present to allow for evaluation of data in the context of this submission type. A request for further documentation will not be pursued.

## Baseline data

Of  the  1027  patients  included  in  the  safety  analysis  set,  641  (62.4%)  were  female,  including  two pregnant women. The mean age was 62.7 ± 16.1 [(mean ± standard deviation (SD)] years, and 555 patients (54.0%) were \"≥65\" years of age. There were 11 paediatric patients (&lt;15 years) and 3 adolescents (15 to &lt;18 years) included in the safety analysis set. 14 patients less than 18 years were included in the effectiveness set. No children under 12 years of age were treated .

Nucala was administered for \"bronchial asthma\" in 1,024 patients (99.7%) and for \"other conditions\" in 3 patients (0.3%). The majority of patients, 995 (96.9%), had primary disease reported as 'severe persistent' or 'most severe persistent'. 656 (63.9%) patients had baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥ 150 cells/ μ L. Baseline blood eosinophil counts were not reported for 208 (20.3%) patients.

A summary of patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics for patients in both the safety analysis and effectiveness analysis sets, which were generally similar, are as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 1027 patients included in the safety analysis set, 616 (60.0%) had reported comorbidities; the most  common  (in  descending  order)  were  \"hypertension\"  (204;  19.9%),  \"gastroesophageal  reflux disease\" (102; 9.9%), \"osteoporosis\" 87 (87; 8.5%), \"diabetes mellitus\" (86; 8.4%), \"insomnia\" (86; 8.4%), and \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\" (73; 7.1%).

## CHMP comments

In the EU, Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and older. In Japan, Nucala is indicated for the treatment of bronchial  asthma  in  children  aged  six  years  or  above  and  in  adults  with  refractory  asthma  whose symptoms could not be controlled adequately with standard treatment. The differing indications between jurisdictions have contributed to differing patient characteristics between those enrolled in Study 204524 and pivotal studies submitted in support of the EU MA.

Generally, however, the majority of participants (n=995; 96.9%) enrolled in Study 204524 had severe disease;  \"severe  persistent  asthma\"  in  688  patients  (67.0%),  followed  by  \"most  severe  persistent asthma\"  in  307  patients  (29.9%).  The  most  commonly  used  prior  medications  of  participants  were \"inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2 -agonist combination products\" in 922 patients (89.8%), and \"Oral corticosteroids\" had been used as prior medications in 353 patients (34.4%).

In addition, the majority of patients 656 (63.9%) enrolled in Study 204524 had baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥150 cells/μ L. Of note, all patients in the pivotal phase III studies (MEA115588 and MEA115575) supporting EU Nucala's severe eosinophilic asthma indication (in adults and paediatrics over 12 years of age) had peripheral blood eosinophil levels greater than or equal to 150 cells/ μ L at initiation of treatment or greater than or equal to 300 cells/ μ L within the past 12 months. Baseline blood eosinophil counts were not reported for 208 (20.3%) patients in Study 204524.

Although differing patient characteristics present challenges in comparing outcomes from Study 204524 to other (including pivotal) clinical studies supporting Nucala's EU clinical development, the applicant has provided  an  adequate  qualitative  comparative  analysis  under  individual  safety  and  effectiveness subheadings in the final CSR.

Of the 1027 patients included in the safety analysis set, the mean age was 62.7 ± 16.1 [(mean ± standard deviation (SD)] years, and 555 patients (54.0%) were \"≥65\" years of age. There were 11

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

paediatric patients (less than 15 years of age) and 3 adolescents (from 15 to less than 18 years of age). 14 patients less than 18 years of age were included in the effectiveness set.

The MAH is asked to provide summaries of baseline characteristics and prior medications for the 11 paediatric and 3 adolescent patients enrolled in the study (OC).

## Patient exposure

In the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set, 99.9% (1026/1027) of participants received at least one monthly dose of mepolizumab 100 mg. Mean ± SD of total number of doses was 9.4±5.2. Mean ± SD of duration of administration of the drug [days] was 272.6±163.0.

Among the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set, Nucala treatment was \"ongoing\" in 559 patients (54.4%) and had been \"discontinued/terminated\" in 468 patients (45.6%) at the end of the observation period. The reasons for treatment discontinuation included \"factors associated with effectiveness\" in 146 patients,  \"patient's  inconvenience  other  than  the  abovementioned\"  in  115  patients,  and  \"financial reasons\" in 59 patients (reasons for treatment discontinuation: duplicates included).

The extent of patient exposure and reasons for discontinuation in the observation period, by safety analysis and effectiveness analysis sets, are provided in the table below.

## CHMP comments

A total of 1,027 patients were included in the safety analysis. Whilst the safety analysis set is not formally defined in the submission, it is presumed by the assessor, based on available data, that it included those that were enrolled in the study, according to the referenced implementation guideline, and received at least  one  full  or  partial  dose  of  mepolizumab.  Among  these  1,027  patients,  Nucala  treatment  was \"ongoing\" in 559 patients (54.4%) and had been \"discontinued/terminated\" in 468 patients (45.6%) at the end of the 52-week observation period. The most common cited reasons for discontinuation were 'factors associated with effectiveness' (n=146; 14.2%), 'patients inconvenience other than the above

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mentioned' (n=115; 11.2%), 'financial reasons\" (n=56; 5.7%), and 'onset of adverse events\" (n=54; 5.3%).

The MAH is asked to provide summaries of patient exposure and reasons for discontinuation for the 11 paediatric and 3 adolecent patients enrolled in the study. (OC)

## Efficacy results

## Primary effectiveness outcome

Among the 959 patients in the effectiveness analysis set, the rate of responders was reported as 90.3% (866/959 patients).

## Paediatric effectiveness data

Of the 959 patients treated with Nucala in the effectiveness analysis set, 11 were paediatric patients (under 15 years of age), and the rate of responders in the paediatric (&lt; 15 years) patients was 81.8% (9/11 patients). No patients under 12 years of age were treated. Although the rate of non-responders in children (under 15 years of age) was slightly higher than that in the overall population, \"age\" was not detected as a factor affecting efficacy. No information on effectiveness of adolescent population was reported in the clinical study report as the 3 adolescent participants were included in the adult population effectiveness calculations.

## Factors affecting effectiveness.

Multivariate analysis was performed for the effectiveness based on patient characteristics to identify factors for which the adjusted odds ratio met the criteria \"the asymptotic 95% confidence interval does not cross 1 and the point estimate exceeds 2 or is less than 0.5\"; i.e., factors meeting the criteria were defined as factors affecting the effectiveness. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated using the following factors: \"gender,\" \"categorized age 1 [years],\" \"smoking history,\" \"the primary disease (disease duration [years]),\"  \"comorbidities,\"  \"comorbidity  (renal  impairment),\"  \"comorbidity  (hepatic  impairment),\" \"comorbidities (allergies),\" \"comorbidities (other conditions),\" \"blood eosinophil count (at the initiation of Nucala treatment) [/ μ L],\" \"prior medications for bronchial asthma,\" \"concomitant medications,\" and \"concomitant therapies (other than drug therapy) for bronchial asthma.\" Based on the analysis results, no factors meeting the criteria were detected.

The above variables were selected by Stepwise method (significance level 0.3: score chi-square was used in the step of placing factors in the model, and Wald chi-square was used in the step of excluding variables). The model variable \"comorbidities\" and \"blood eosinophil count (at the initiation of Nucala treatment) [/ μ L]\" were selected. According to the analysis results, \"comorbidities\" and \"blood eosinophil count (at the initiation of Nucala treatment) [/ μ L]\" did not meet the above criteria.

A  summary  of  results  from  effectiveness  analysis,  including  factors  affecting  effectiveness,  is  given below:

## Other effectiveness outcomes

## Exacerbation of bronchial asthma

The table below shows changes from baseline (\"during the 52 weeks before the initiation of Nucala treatment\")  to  after  Nucala  treatment  (\"at  Week  52  of  treatment  or  at  the  time  of  treatment discontinuation\") in the 959 patients in the effectiveness analysis set for the frequency of all bronchial asthma exacerbations, for exacerbations requiring hospitalization, for exacerbations requiring emergency department visits, for exacerbations requiring the use of systemic corticosteroid, and for exacerbations requiring hospitalization (number of days of hospitalization). Decreasing incidence rates were observed for all types of exacerbations from baseline to Week 52 of Nucala treatment (or at time of discontinuation).

Respiratory function test (Peak Expiratory Flow)

The table below shows the mean peak expiratory flow (PEF, L/min) \"at the initiation of Nucala treatment,\" \"at  12  weeks  after  the  initiation  of  Nucala  treatment  (at  Week  12  of  treatment),\"  \"at  Week  24  of treatment,\" and \"at Week 52 of treatment\" or \"at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination\" in the 959 patients in the effectiveness analysis set. Among patients for whom PEF measurements were performed, the mean PEF ± standard deviation (SD) at each time point was as follows: 304.4 ± 146.8 at the initiation of Nucala treatment (120 patients: n = 120), 333.7 ± 150.5 at Week 12 (n = 78), 334.2 ± 138.7 at Week 24 (n = 51), and 358.9 ± 129.8 at Week 52 (n = 45) or 349.5 ± 134.7 at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination (n = 43).

## Asthma Control Test (ACT)

The  table  below  shows  the  mean  asthma  control  test  (ACT)  10)  score  \"at  the  initiation  of  Nucala treatment,\" \"at 12 weeks after the initiation of Nucala treatment (at Week 12 of treatment),\" \"at Week 24 of treatment,\" and \"at Week 52 of treatment\" in the 959 patients in the effectiveness analysis set. Among patients for whom ACT score measurements were performed, the mean ACT score ± SD at each time point was as follows: 16.2 ± 4.9 at the initiation of Nucala treatment (n = 352), 20.5 ± 4.3 at Week 12 (n = 317), 20.9 ± 4.2 at Week 24 (n = 261), and 21.4 ± 4.0 at Week 52 (n = 221). The mean ACT score was 16.2 ± 4.9 at the initiation of Nucala treatment (at baseline), indicating \"poor control,\" while it was 20.5 ± 4.3 at Week 12, indicating \"well control.\" ACT scores at Weeks 24 and 52 also indicated \"well  control\";  i.e.,  this  favorable  condition  \"well  control\"  was  maintained  throughout  the  treatment period. After the initiation of Nucala treatment, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of at least a 3-point increase from baseline in the ACT score 11) was achieved in 208 patients (65.6%) at Week 12, in 180 patients (69.0%) at Week 24, and in 163 patients (73.8%) at Week 52.

## CHMP comments

Of  the  959  patients  in  the  effectiveness  analysis  set,  the  rate  of  responders,  those  in  whom  the investigator deemed the treatment 'effective' after 52 weeks of treatment or at the time of treatment

As of September 27, 2023

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuation/termination, was reported as 90.3% (866/959 patients). Based on multivariate analysis of 13 variables (including age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, blood eosinophil count at initiation of Nucala treatment), no factors met the defined criteria to be considered to have affected effectiveness.

The rate of responders in the paediatric patients was 81.8% (9/11 patients), slightly higher than that in the  overall  population,  but  \"age\"  was  not  determined  to  be  a  factor  affecting  effectiveness.  No information on effectiveness in the adolescent population was reported in the clinical study report as the 3 adolescent participants were included in the adult population effectiveness calculations.

Other  effectiveness  measures,  including  change  in  the  overall  frequency  of  exacerbations  and  the frequency of specific types of exacerbations (e.g., those requiring hospitalisation, systemic corticosteroids etc) showed decreasing incidence rates from baseline to Week 52 of Nucala treatment (or at time of discontinuation). Notwithstanding the differences between patient characteristics, study design and  study  conditions,  the  extent  of  improvement  of  asthma  exacerbations  in  Study  204524  were considered to be similar to those observed for Study MEA115588, the pre-approval, global, phase III study conducted in patients with severe asthma (including 50 Japanese patients).

Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and asthma control test (ACT) showed improvements in respiratory function and asthma control with Nucala at pre-defined times points during the 52-week observational part of the study.

Whilst acknowledging uncertainties (including definition of responder, correlation between relatively high rate of discontinuation/termination reported due to 'factors associated with effectiveness' and the overall primary effectiveness outcome) pertaining to study design and conduct, Study 204524 has shown Nucala to be an effective treatment in adult and paediatric (from 12 years) Japanese patients when used in routine clinical practice for the treatment of bronchial asthma as determined by treating physicians during a 52-week observational study period. The primary effectiveness results were supported by additional effectiveness  results,  including  reduced  frequency  of  asthma  exacerbations  with  time  on  Nucala treatment. These results are in line with those previously reported for mepolizumab.

As no new significant efficacy information has been generated as a result of this study, no update to the product information is necessary from an efficacy perspective.

As only 14 paediatric and adolescent patients (from 12 years to less than 18 years) were enrolled in this study, and data from the 3 adolescent patients (from 15 years to less than 18 years) were included in the adult population effectiveness calculations, the overall data generated are insufficient to make any comment on the efficacy of mepolizumab in this population, and no change to the product information is  warranted.  Nevertheless,  additional  data  summaries  restricted  to  the  paediatric  and  adolescent patients are requested for completeness. (OC)

## Safety results

## Adverse drug reactions

As per the regulations of the Japanese PMDA, only adverse events which are considered to be related to study treatment are required to be reported in the clinical study report, i.e. adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Causality assessment between adverse events and the study drug was determined by treating physicians, and not the sponsor.

ADRs occurred in 42 (4.1%) of the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set. The incidence rates of ADRs by system organ class (SOC) were \"respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\" 1.2% (12/1,027 patients), followed by \"skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\" 1.0% (10/1,027). The most frequently

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported ADRs (in descending order) included \"asthma\" 0.7% (7/1,027 patients), \"chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis\" 0.4% (4/1,027), and \"urticaria\" 0.4% (4/1,027).

To investigate factors affecting the onset of ADRs based on patient characteristics, multivariate analysis was  performed  to  identify  factors  for  which  the  adjusted  odds  ratio/risk  ratio  met  the  criteria  \"the asymptotic 95% confidence interval does not cross 1 and the point estimate exceeds 2 or is less than 0.5\"; i.e., factors meeting the criteria were defined as factors affecting the onset of ADRs. Based on the analysis results, no factors meeting the criteria were detected.

The time from the initiation of Nucala treatment to the onset of ADRs was examined for every type of ADRs reported in 42 of the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set. No trend toward an increased incidence with long-term treatment was observed.

## Serious adverse drug reactions

There were 9 (0.9%) reported serious ADRs. The types of ADRs included \"asthma\" with an incidence of 0.2% (2/1,027 patients) and 'Chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis', 'Angioedema', 'Condition aggravated', \"pneumonia\",  \"myasthenia  gravis\",  \"gastric  cancer\",  'Intraductal  papillary  mucinous  carcinoma  of pancreas', 'Optic neuropathy' and 'Vertigo positional' with an incidence of 0.1% (1/1,027).

The outcome of three of these serious ADRs (\"pneumonia\" in one patient, \"gastric cancer\" in one, and \"asthma\"  in  one)  was  reported  as  death.  The  outcome  of  all  other  serious  ADRs  was  reported  as \"recovering\" and \"recovered\".

Of  those  serious  ADRs  with  a  reported  outcome  of  death,  \"gastric  cancer\"  developed  after  the discontinuation  of  Nucala  treatment  (17  Apr  2018,  drug  was  discontinued  (85  days  of  treatment); adverse drug reaction occurred on 31 Oct 2019) and, as per CSR, it was difficult to ascertain any causal relationship with the drug.

'Pneumonia' and 'asthma' causal relationship with Nucala is not excluded but the details, including the clinical  courses  resulting  in  fatalities,  have  not  been  obtained.  Therefore,  it  was  difficult  to  further evaluate causal relationship with the drug.

A summary of ADRs is given in the table below:

## Paediatric safety data

There were no ADRs reported in this study for the 11 paediatric patients (under 15 years of age) Given the 3 participants aged between 15 and 18 years were included in the adult population it was not possible to ascertain whether ADRs were reported by them during the study period.

A review of the adverse event line listings revealed that five adverse events (AEs) were reported during the study for paediatric and adolescent participants. These AEs were not considered related to study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  by  the  investigator  and  therefore  not  classified  by  the  Investigator  as  ADRs.  These  are summarised below:

'Asof September 27,2023

MedDRA/J (26.0)

One serious event of anaphylactic reaction was reported in a participant. The participant had a known history of milk allergy and was reported to have developed an anaphylactic reaction after accidentally consuming a cake that contained milk. The event was reported as recovered on the same day. The Investigator considered that the event of anaphylaxis had no causal relationship with mepolizumab.

## Safety Specifications and Priority Investigation Matters

Hypersensitivity such as anaphylaxis: Of the 1027 patients in safety analysis set, the incidence rates of ADRs related to hypersensitivity such as anaphylaxis was 1.2% (12/1027). The type of ADRs include \"urticaria'  0.4%  6  (4/1027),  'rash'  0.2%  (2/1027),  'angioedema'  0.1%  (1/1027),  'eczema'  0.1% (1/1027), and  'chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis'  0.4%  (4/1027).  'Angioedema'  and  'chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis' were reported as serious ADRs. The outcomes of each ADR were reported as 'recovered' and 'recovering' respectively.

Infections: Of the 1027 patients in safety analysis set, the incidence rates of ADRs related to 'Infections' was  0.3%  (3/1027).  The  type  of  ADRs  include  'bronchitis,'  'nasopharyngitis',  'pharyngitis'  and 'pneumonia' in 0.1% (1/1027) each. Of these, one ('pneumonia') was serious, and the outcome was fatal. A causal relationship was not denied by the investigator. However, it was difficult to determine the relationship with Nucala because a detailed description of the course leading to death was not available.

Malignant tumor: The occurrence status of ADRs related to \"malignant tumor\" was investigated until 3 years  after  the  initiation  of  Nucala  treatment.  Malignant  tumor  related  ADRs  occurred  in  2  patients (0.2%): \"gastric cancer\" in one (0.1%) and \"intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma of pancreas\" in one (0.1%). Both events were serious. \"Gastric cancer\" was found to have developed in one patient at 675 days after the initiation of Nucala treatment, and this event resulted in the outcome \"fatal\". \"Gastric cancer\" developed after the discontinuation of Nucala treatment (17 Apr 2018, drug was discontinued (85 days of treatment); adverse drug reaction occurred on 31 Oct 2019) and, as per CSR, it was difficult to ascertain any causal relationship with the drug.

\"Intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma of pancreas\" was found to have developed at 304 days after the initiation of Nucala treatment, and the outcome was \"recovered.\"

## Other safety results

Blood eosinophil count: Among the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set for whom blood eosinophil counts  were  performed  \"before  treatment  initiation  (9  to  52  weeks  before  the  initiation  of  Nucala treatment),\" \"at the time of treatment initiation (0 to 8 weeks before the initiation of Nucala treatment),\" \"at 12 weeks after the initiation of Nucala treatment (Week 12 of treatment),\" \"at Week 24 of treatment,\" and \"at Week 52 of treatment or at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination', a decreasing trend in blood eosinophil count was observed from \"Week 12 of Nucala treatment\" onwards, and this trend was maintained until \"Week 52 of treatment or the time of treatment discontinuation/termination.\"

Serum Total IgE Level: Serum total IgE concentration (IU/mL) before Nucala treatment and the presence or absence of \"a history of omalizumab use\" was investigated in the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set. In addition, Serum total IgE levels were collected prior to omalizumab administration or at 1 year or later after discontinuation of omalizumab treatment if there was a history of omalizumab use. The patients \"with\" a history of omalizumab use were 15.2% (156/1027) and those \"without\" a history of omalizumab use were 84.8% (871/1027). The mean serum total IgE level ± SD in the patients \"with\" omalizumab use tended to be higher than in the patients \"without.\" Analysis of ADRs by omalizumab status showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ADRs between both sets of patients.

## CHMP comments

In line with Japanese regulations, only those adverse events considered related to the investigational product (IP) were required to be reported in the CSR.

ADRs occurred in 42 of the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set, with the most frequently reported under the preferred term (PT) asthma, chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis and urticaria. The incidence of ADRs was 4.1% (42/1,027 patients) and for serious ADRs was 0.9% (9/1027). Of the reported serious ADRs, only PT asthma was reported in more than 1 patient. Whilst direct comparison with safety data reported in pivotal studies is confounded by differences in patient characteristics, study methods, and other study conditions, overall, the incidence of ADRs in Study 204524 was lower than pivotal placebocontrolled studies. No new safety concerns were noted.

Separate  reporting  and  discussion  of  ADRs  of  special  interest  ('Safety  Specifications  and  Priority Investigation  Matters'), hypersensitivity  such  as  anaphylaxis , infection and malignant  tumour were provided.  Although  reporting  of  individual  case  studies  was  limited  with  unclear  reporting  of  event timelines (for 'gastric cancer'), no new safety concerns were identified. Of note, 'Systemic Reactions including anaphylaxis' and 'Alterations in immune response (malignancies)' continue to be monitored under important identified risks and important potential risks, respectively, in the current RMP for Nucala.

Among the patients in the safety analysis set, for whom blood eosinophil counts were performed, a decreasing trend in blood eosinophil count with time on treatment, consistent with that expected for Nucala, was observed.

Overall, the safety results from this study are in line with the known safety profile of mepolizumab. No new safety issues were identified as a result of this clinical trial such as to warrant a change in the safety information in the product information.

From a paediatric perspective, only 14 paediatric and adolescent patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 11 patients were aged from 12 to less than 15 years of age, and adverse event line listings were available. Of the 5 adverse events reported for these patients, 3 were for PT asthma, 2 were considered serious (asthma and anaphylactic reaction). None were considered by the investigator to be related to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the IP. The 3 participants aged from 15 to less than 18 years were included in the adult population, and no individualised adverse event line listings were reported for this group. The MAH is, however, requested to confirm the number of ADRs (if any) reported for the 3 adolescent patients. (OC)

Overall, the data generated with respect to paediatric and adolescents patients is insufficient to allow any meaningful comment on the safety profile of the product in this population, and no update to product information is warranted.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study 204524 was an open label, non-interventional study that was designed to collect and assess safety and efficacy data from the long-term use of Nucala in Japanese clinical practice. Due to enrollment of paediatric patients in the study, the MAH was obliged, under Article 46 of Regulation 1901/2006, to submit the final clinical study report (CSR) and critical expert overview within 6 months of the completion of the study. The study was not part of a PIP. There were 11 paediatric patients (less than 15 years of age) and 3 adolescents (from 15 to less than 18 years of age).

Lack  of  detail  in  the  submission  pertaining  to  study  design  and  conduct  presents  challenges  to  the interpretation of the robustness of data generated. Comparing data to other studies in Nucala's clinical development  is  confounded  by  the  differences  in  patient  characteristics,  study  methods  and  study conditions between Study 204524 and other studies. That said, where possible, the applicant provided an adequate qualitative comparative analysis under pertinent safety and effectiveness subheadings in the final CSR.

## Effectiveness/Efficacy

Of  the  959  patients  in  the  effectiveness  analysis  set,  the  rate  of  responders,  those  in  whom  the investigator deemed the treatment 'effective' after 52 weeks of treatment or at the time of treatment discontinuation/termination, was reported as 90.3% (866/959 patients). Based on multivariate analysis of 13 variables (including age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, blood eosinophil count at initiation of Nucala treatment), no factors met the defined criteria to be considered to have affected effectiveness.

The rate of responders in the paediatric (&lt; 15 years) patients was 81.8% (9/11 patients), slightly higher than that in the overall population, but \"age\" was not determined to be a factor affecting effectiveness. No information on effectiveness in the adolescent population was reported in the clinical study report as the 3 adolescent participants were included in the adult population effectiveness calculations.

Other  effectiveness  measures,  including  change  in  the  overall  frequency  of  exacerbations  and  the frequency of specific types of exacerbations (e.g., those requiring hospitalisation, systemic corticosteroids etc) showed decreasing incidence rates from baseline to Week 52 of Nucala treatment (or at time of discontinuation). Notwithstanding the differences between patient characteristics, study design and  study  conditions,  the  extent  of  improvement  of  asthma  exacerbations  in  Study  204524  were considered to be similar to those observed for Study MEA115588, the pre-approval, global, phase III study conducted in patients with severe asthma (including 50 Japanese patients).

Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and asthma control test (ACT) showed improvements in respiratory function and asthma control with Nucala at pre-defined times points during the 52-week observational part of the study.

Whilst acknowledging uncertainties pertaining to study design and conduct, Study 204524 has shown Nucala to be an effective treatment in adult and paediatric (from 12 years) Japanese patients when used

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in routine clinical practice for the treatment of bronchial asthma as determined by treating physicians during  a  52-week  observational  study  period.  The  primary  effectiveness  results  were  supported  by additional  effectiveness  results,  including  reduced  frequency  of  asthma  exacerbations  with  time  on Nucala treatment. These results are in line with those previously reported for mepolizumab.

As no new significant efficacy information has been generated as a result of this study, no update to the product information is necessary from an efficacy perspective.

## Effectiveness/efficacy and paediatric population

As only 14 paediatric and adolescent patients (from 12 years to less than 18 years) were enrolled in this study, and data from the 3 adolescent patients (from 15 years to less than 18 years) were included in the adult population effectiveness calculations, the overall data generated are insufficient to make any comment on the efficacy of mepolizumab in this population, and no change to the product information is warranted.

## Safety

In line with Japanese regulations, only those adverse events considered related to the investigational product (IP) were required to be reported in the CSR.

ADRs occurred in 42 of the 1,027 patients in the safety analysis set, with the most frequently reported under the PT asthma, chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis and urticaria. The incidence of ADRs was 4.1% (42/1,027 patients) and for serious ADRs was 0.9% (9/1027). Of the reported serious ADRs, only the PT asthma was reported in more than 1 patient. Whilst direct comparison with safety data reported in pivotal studies is confounded by differences in patient characteristics, study methods, and other study conditions, overall, the incidence of ADRs in Study 204524 was lower than pivotal placebo-controlled studies. No new safety concerns were noted.

Separate  reporting  and  discussion  of  ADRs  of  special  interest  ('Safety  Specifications  and  Priority Investigation  Matters'), hypersensitivity  such  as  anaphylaxis , infection and malignant  tumour were provided.  No  new  safety  concerns  were  identified.  'Systemic  Reactions  including  anaphylaxis'  and 'Alterations in immune response (malignancies)' continued to be monitored under important identified risks and important potential risks, respectively, in the current RMP for Nucala.

Overall, the safety results from this study are in line with the known safety profile of mepolizumab. No new safety issues were identified as a result of this clinical trial such as to warrant a change in the safety information in the product information.

## Safety and paediatric population

From a paediatric perspective, for the 11 patients aged from 12 to less than 15 years of age, adverse event line listings were available. Of the 5 adverse events reported for these patients, 3 were for PT asthma, 2 were considered serious (asthma and anaphylactic reaction). None were considered by the investigator to be related to the IP. Safety data for adolescents were included in the adult population.

Overall, the data generated with respect to paediatric and adolescents patients is insufficient to allow any meaningful comment on the safety profile of the product in this population, and no update to product information is warranted.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The applicant has presented data on the effectiveness and safety of mepolizumab generated from a noninterventional study of the long-term use of mepolizumab in Japanese patients in routine clinical practice. Notwithstanding the uncertainties pertaining to the submitted dataset and the challenges in comparing these data to those generated by other clinical studies in Nucala's clinical development, no new safety and efficacy data have been generated by Study 204524 that warrant a change to the authorised product information. Data are consistent with those previously reported for mepolizumab.

Additional data summaries for paediatric/adolescents patients (&lt; 18 years) included in the study were requested for completeness prior to making a final recommendation on this procedure (see sections 4 and 5). These did not impact the overall conclusion that no new data have been generated by this study that  warrants  update  to  product  information  or  raises  concerns  regarding  the  benefit  risk  profile  of Nucala. The MAH is considered to have fulfilled its obligations in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, and this post-authorisation measure is considered fulfilled.

## 5. MAH responses to request for supplementary information

## Question 1

The MAH is asked to provide summaries of baseline characteristics and prior medications for the 11 paediatric and 3 adolescent patients enrolled in the study.

## Summary of applicant's response

Characteristics of the 14 patients included in the safety analysis are shown in Table 1 (Annex 1). There were 8 (57%) \"male\" patients. Nucala was administered for \"bronchial asthma\" in all patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The disease duration was \"Over 10\" years in 7 patients (50%), and \"5 ≦ to ≦ 10\" years in 7 patients (50%). The most common severity of asthma prior to Nucala administration was \"most severe persistent asthma \"in 11 patients (79%), followed by \"severe persistent asthma\" in 3 patients (21%). Type of asthma was \"atopic asthma\" in all patients.

All patients were \"with\" comorbidities including allergies. The names of comorbidities refer to Table 1 (Annex 1).

Prior  medications  other  than  Nucala  are  shown  in  Table  1  (Annex  1).  All  patients  used  \"inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2 -agonist combination products\" as prior medications. Two patients (14%) used \"Oral corticosteroids\" as prior medications.

## CHMP assessment of response

The MAH provided a summary of baseline characteristics of all paediatric/adolescent study participants, provided as Annex 1 to this report. Baseline disease characteristics were broadly in line with those reported for the general study population, consistent with severe persistent bronchial asthma, with all participants having undergone prior treatment with inhaled steroids/long acting β2 agonist combinations. The treated paediatric population was in keeping with that targeted by the authorised indication of Nucala in Japan.

## Response accepted

## Question 2

The MAH is asked to provide summaries of patient exposure and reasons for discontinuation for the 11 paediatric and 3 adolescent patients enrolled in the study.

## Summary of applicant's response

Daily dose for all patients at the start of administration was 100 mg. Table 2 (Annex 2), shows the administration status of Nucala for the 14 patients.

Nucala treatment was \"Continuation\" in 4 patients (29%) and \"Discontinued \" in 10 patients (71%) at the end of the observation period.

The reasons for treatment discontinuation included \"factors associated with effectiveness\" in 7 patients, \"Economic  reasons\"  in  1  patient,  and  \"Other  reasons  in  the  doctor's  judgment\"  in  2  patients.  It  is important  to  note  that  \"factors  associated  with  effectiveness\"  could  also  be  \"discontinuation  due  to ineffectiveness\"  or  \"discontinuation  due  to  enough  efficacy\".  Of  the  7  patients  who  discontinued  for \"factors associated with effectiveness\", 3 patients were judged to have been effective.

## CHMP assessment of response

Patient exposure and reasons for discontinuation specific to the paediatric/adolescent population were provided (provided as Annex 2 to this report). As per the authorised posology of Nucala in Japan, all participants from 12 years of age received mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. At the end of the 52-week observational period (or at the time of treatment discontinuation/ termination), a higher rate of discontinuation was observed for the paediatric participants (7/11; 63.6%) and the adolescent participants (3/3; 100%) when compared to the general study population (468/1027; 45.6%). As per the general study population, 'factors due to effectiveness' was the most commonly cited reason for discontinuation. Not all participants who discontinued for this reason were considered to have received 'not effective' treatment. Due to the small number of paediatric/adolescent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants enrolled, the study design, and reporting thereof, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from these data.

## Response accepted

## Question 3

With respect to effectiveness, the MAH is requested to provide additional data summaries restricted to the paediatric and adolescent patients.

## Summary of applicant's response

In this study, effectiveness was comprehensively assessed by the investigators as either \"effective\" or \"not effective\" at Week 52 of Nucala treatment or at the time of treatment discontinuation/ termination, based on all effectiveness items measured and any other feedback obtained from the participant obtained at  each  study  visit.  As  a  results,  the  responders  were  71.4%  (10/14  patients:  11  paediatric  and  3 adolescent) in the effectiveness analysis set.

## CHMP assessment of response

Data  summaries  pertaining  to  effectiveness  outcomes  in  the  paediatric/adolescent  population  were provided (Annex 2 to this report). In the effectiveness analysis set, a lower level of response was reported for the paediatric/adolescent population (10/14; 71.4%) when compared to the general study population (866/959;  90.3%).  Within  the  former,  the  rate  of  responders  in  the  paediatric  (under  15  years) participants was 81.8% (9/11 participants) and 33.3% (1/3 participants) in the adolescents (over 15 and  under  18  years).  Again,  the  overall  data  generated  are  insufficient  to  allow  for  meaningful conclusions to be drawn on the efficacy of mepolizumab in this population.

## Response accepted

## Question 4

The MAH is requested to confirm the number of ADRs (if any) reported for the 3 adolescent patients.

## Summary of applicant's response

The MAH confirms there were no ADRs reported for the 3 adolescent patients for the duration for the study.

## CHMP assessment of response

No ADRs were reported for the (3) adolescent participants.

## Response accepted
