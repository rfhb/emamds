## 1. Introduction

This  variation  application  was  submitted  to  request  the  extension  of  the  acute  coronary  syndrome (ACS) indication as follows:

- 'Patients with ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction. In this population, clopidogrel reduces the risk of all cause mortality.'

Clopidogrel  efficacy  in  ACS  patients  with  STEMI  was  evaluated  in  two  double-blind  studies [EFC5133 (CLARITY- TIMI 28) and EFC7018 (COMMIT/ CCS-2)], in which patients were treated with ASA and other concomitant medications including fibrinolytics and anticoagulants.

## 2. Clinical aspects

Rationale for the proposed change

ACS  is  defined  as  any  clinical  syndrome  of  acute  and  prolonged  myocardial  ischaemia  related  to coronary  artery  disease  (CAD)  and  comprises  unstable  angina  (UA),  non-ST  segment  elevation myocardial  infarction  (NSTEMI),  and  ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI). ACS is a significant public health concern; in the US alone, the estimated incidence of ACS is 942,000 cases per year. The estimated incidence of MI is 565,000 new attacks and 300,000 recurrent attacks per year, and in 2003 the estimated hospitalisation for acute MI was 767,000 patients. The average age of patients having a first heart attack is 65.8 years for men and 70.4 years for women. International data  are  available  from  the  GRACE  registry  [(Global  Registry  of  Acute  Coronary  Events)  from  14 Western countries], which suggests a 34% rate of STEMI among patients who present with ACS, with a hospital death rate of 7.8%. According to the NRMI registry (US National Registry of Myocardial Infarction),  the  mortality  rate  for  patients  with  STEMI  has  declined  between  1990  and  2002,  but remains  substantial:  4.3%  and  4.4%  in  patients  receiving  fibrinolytics  or  primary  percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), respectively.

In  more  recent  years,  with  an  aging  worldwide  population  and  an  increase  of  co-morbid  factors (obesity,  smoking),  little  headway  has  been  made  in  terms  of  reducing  morbidity  and  mortality  in patients diagnosed with STEMI. Furthermore, despite the existence of effective therapies for STEMI, such  as  pharmacological  therapy  with  ASA  and  fibrinolytics  associated  with  a  reduction  of  risk factors, new therapies capable of preventing such events are needed.

Analysis of data submitted

This extension of indication is based on two new studies:

- -EFC5133 [CLARITY-TIMI 28, Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion TherapY-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction - 28]
- -EFC7018 [COMMIT/CCS- 2, Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial/Second Chinese Cardiac Study]

The Clinical Study Reports state that both trials were conducted according to GCP.

The individual study design and efficacy results are presented followed by a common safety section covering the safety findings for both trials.

## EFC5133 (CLARITY-TIMI 28)

This was a Phase III, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 parallel group study of clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg/day) versus placebo in patients with STEMI treated with ASA and fibrinolytic therapy. The study was conducted at 319 active sites in 23 countries, including Europe, US, Canada, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective was to demonstrate that, in patients with STEMI treated with background ASA and initial fibrinolytic therapy, clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg/day) reduced the proportion of patients who had an occluded infarct-related artery (IRA) [defined as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0 or 1] on the predischarge angiogram or who died or had a recurrent MI by the time of start of coronary angiography (between 48 and 192 hours after the start of blinded study drug), compared with placebo. For patients who did not undergo angiography, death or recurrent MI by Day 8 or by hospital discharge, whichever came first, was used.

The following inclusion criteria were applied: i) patients aged 18 - 75 years, ii) planned fibrinolytic therapy, ASA (150 to 325 mg on the first day and 75 to 162 mg daily thereafter) and, when clinically appropriate, heparin [unfractionated heparin (UFH) and/or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)], iii)  onset  of  ischaemic  discomfort  or  equivalent  at  rest  occurring  from  6  -  12  hours  prior  to randomisation, iv) symptoms of prolonged (&gt;20 minutes) ischaemic discomfort at rest associated with ECG  evidence  of  new  ST  segment  elevation ≥ 0.10  mV  (80  msec  after  the  J  point)  in  at  least  2 contiguous limb leads or ≥ 0.20  mV in at least  2  contiguous  precordial  (chest)  leads,  or  left  bundle branch block (LBBB) not known to be old.

Regarding use of concomitant therapy , use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (eg, abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban) was permitted only after the initial coronary angiogram was performed. Use of open-label ADP  antagonists (clopidogrel  or  ticlopidine)  was  prohibited  except  following  coronary  stenting. Patients who  underwent coronary stenting at the time of their diagnostic angiogram were recommended to receive open-label clopidogrel after the diagnostic angiogram (loading dose of 300 mg followed by 75 mg daily). All patients receiving a fibrin-specific fibrinolytic (i.e., alteplase, RPA, or TNK) were to be treated with a body weight-based heparin regimen.

Patients were to be randomised within 12 hours of the onset of STEMI symptoms to receive either clopidogrel  or  placebo  up  to  and  including  the  day  of  angiography  or  Day  8  or  hospital  discharge, whichever came first. Patients were scheduled to undergo angiography 48 - 192 hours (2-8 days) after the start of study drug treatment. Patients were also to receive fibrinolytic therapy.

Regarding endpoints ,  the  primary  efficacy  assessment  was  based  on  the  composite  endpoint  of  an occluded IRA (TIMI flow grade 0 or 1) on the pre-discharge angiogram, or death or recurrent MI by the time of start of angiography or Day 8 or hospital discharge, whichever came first.

Secondary  efficacy  assessments  were  based  on  the  following  endpoints  analysed  in  a  hierarchical order: an early electrocardiographic endpoint (degree of ST segment resolution at 180 minutes after first  dose  of  study  drug); a  late  angiographic endpoint (occluded IRA on pre-discharge angiogram);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and a clinical endpoint [composite outcome of death, recurrent MI, or recurrent myocardial ischemia (severe  or  leading  to  revascularisation)  by  the  time  of  start  of  angiography  or  Day  8  or  hospital discharge, whichever came first].

Other  efficacy  endpoints  involved  comparisons  between  treatment  groups  in  the  occurrence  of  the following clinical efficacy endpoints by the time of the start of coronary angiography (or Day 8 or hospital discharge, whichever came first) and by Day 30: death; cardiovascular death; recurrent MI; recurrent myocardial ischemia; severe recurrent myocardial ischemia; recurrent myocardial ischemia leading  to  revascularisation;  composite  endpoint  of  death  or  recurrent  MI;  composite  endpoint  of death, recurrent MI, or severe recurrent myocardial ischemia; composite endpoint of death, recurrent MI, or recurrent myocardial ischemia leading to revascularisation; severe congestive heart failure; and cardiogenic shock. The other efficacy assessments in angiographic endpoints (eg, epicardial flow) are presented in the clinical study report.

Coronary  angiography was  to  be  performed  during  the  index  hospitalisation  between  48  and  192 hours  (2-8  days)  after  the  start  of  blinded  study  drug  to  determine  late  patency  of  the  IRA. Angiography before 48 hours was permissible only if medically indicated [eg, cardiogenic shock or persistent haemodynamic instability; clear evidence of failed reperfusion (persistent severe chest pain and  &lt;50%  resolution  of  ST  segment  elevation);  or  recurrent  ischaemia  documented  by  recurrent ischaemic chest pain and ECG changes]. Patients could have been transferred to a tertiary care hospital for  the  procedure  if  necessary.  Angiographic  data  were  sent  to  the  TIMI  Angiographic  Core Laboratory for analysis. The TIMI Flow Grade (TFG) was defined as follows:

- Grade 0: No perfusion. No antegrade flow beyond the point of occlusion;
- Grade 1: Penetration without perfusion. Contrast material passes beyond the area of obstruction but fails to opacify the entire coronary bed distal to the obstruction for the duration of the cineangiographic filming sequence;
- Grade  2:  Partial  perfusion.  Contrast  material  passes  across  the  obstruction  and  opacifies  the coronary bed distal to the obstruction. However, the rate of entry of contrast material into the vessel  distal  to  the  obstruction  or  its  rate  of  clearance  from  the  distal  bed  (or  both)  are perceptibly slower than its flow into or clearance from comparable areas not perfused by the previously occluded vessel (eg, opposite coronary artery or the coronary bed proximal to the obstruction). This category is subdivided into:
- Grade 2.0: TIMI 2 slow flow, dye markedly delayed in opacifying distal vasculature;
- Grade 2.5: TIMI 2 fast flow, dye minimally delayed in opacifying distal vasculature.
- Grade 3: Complete perfusion. Antegrade flow into the bed distal to the obstruction occurs as promptly as antegrade flow into the bed proximal to the obstruction, and clearance of contrast material  from  the  involved  bed  is  as  rapid  as  clearance  from  an  uninvolved  bed  in  the  same vessel or the opposite artery.

Three 12-lead ECGs were to be performed: at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 90 and 180 minutes after administration of the first dose of blinded study drug. These study ECGs were sent to the TIMI ECG  Core  Laboratory  for  analysis.  Blood  samples  for  analysis  of  CK-MB  and/or  troponin  were collected 5 times over the 48 hours after initiation of fibrinolysis (ie, approximately every 8 hours). Additional  samples  for  analysis  of  CK-MB  and/or  troponin  were  obtained  at  approximate  8-hour intervals for 24 hours post-revascularisation in patients who underwent revascularisation (ie, PCI or CABG), or at approximate 8-hour intervals for 24 hours following onset of symptoms for patients in whom recurrent ischaemia or reinfarction was suspected.

The following outcome events were recorded at scheduled times during the study:

## Death

Death  was  defined  as  all-cause  mortality,  and  was  classified  as  either  cardiovascular  or  noncardiovascular. All deaths were assumed to be cardiovascular in nature unless a non-cardiovascular cause was clearly provided.

· Cardiovascular :  cardiac  deaths  (eg,  cardiogenic  shock,  arrhythmia/sudden  death,  cardiac  rupture) and other cardiovascular deaths (stroke, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm or dissection);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Non-cardiovascular :  all  deaths  due  to  a  clearly  documented  non-cardiovascular  cause,  such  as respiratory failure (excluding cardiogenic pulmonary oedema), haemorrhage (other than intracranial), infections/sepsis, neoplasm, and trauma (including suicide and homicide).

## Recurrent myocardial infarction

Recurrent MI was defined using an adaptation of the standard ACC definition. In order to meet criteria as an endpoint in this trial, an MI must have been distinct from the qualifying event (ie, must represent reinfarction).

As per the ESC/ACC guidelines:

-  ST  depression in leads V1-V3 was considered equivalent to ST elevation if the recurrent MI was suspected to be true posterior in location;
- Abnormal Q waves were defined as Q waves in ≥ 2 contiguous leads that were ≥ 1 mm in depth and of any duration in leads V1-V3, and ≥ 30 msec in duration in leads I, II, aVL, aVF, and V4-V6;
- R wave ≥ 40 msec in lead V1 or ≥ 50 msec in lead V2 was considered equivalent to abnormal Q waves if MI was suspected to be true posterior in location.

Safety  assessments included  all  reported  bleeding-related  events  (classified  into  Major,  Minor  and Minimal), intracraneal bleeding (ICH), stroke, thrombocytopenia, AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs.

Regarding  the  efficacy  analyses,  the  primary  endpoint  was  analysed  using  a  logistic  regression analysis  with  terms  included  for  treatment  group,  type  of  fibrinolytic  (fibrin-specific,  nonfibrinspecific, or none), type of anticoagulant used up to 2 hours post-randomisation (UFH, LMWH, both, or none), and infarct location (anterior, non-anterior). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)  were  presented.  Three  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  and  consisted  of  excluding  all covariates  other  than  treatment  group  from  the  logistic  regression  model,  including  Investigatorassessed  MIs  in  the  composite  endpoint  rather  than  Clinical  Events  Committee  (CEC)-adjudicated MIs,  and  excluding  patients  who  did  not  receive  initial  fibrinolytic  therapy.  Hypothesis  tests  were performed using 2-sided tests at the 5% significance level, unless otherwise stated.

The  secondary  ECG  endpoint  was  analysed  using  an  ANCOVA  model  that  included  baseline  STsegment  deviation  as  the  covariate  and  factors  for  treatment,  type  of  fibrinolytic  used,  type  of anticoagulant  first  used,  and  index  infarct  location.  The  other  2  secondary  endpoints  and  the  other efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  using  a  model  similar  to  the  one  used  for  the  primary  efficacy analysis.

The rates of the primary efficacy endpoint were calculated for different subgroups, and ORs with 95% CIs  were  computed  for  the  treatment  effect  (overall  and  by  subgroup).  Treatment-by-subgroup interactions were investigated by fitting a logistic regression model with factors for treatment group, subgroup, type of fibrinolytic,  type  of  anticoagulant  used  up  to  2  hours  post-randomization,  infarct location, and treatment-by subgroup interaction. To avoid confounding, for the subgroup analysis of primary anticoagulant used, the factor for anticoagulant used up to 2 hours post-randomisation was dropped from the model.

As  regards sample  size ,  the  study  was  powered  to  detect  a  5%  absolute  reduction  (24%  relative reduction, from 21% to 16%) in the rate of the combined endpoint. Due to a concern, at the beginning of enrolment, that the projected event rate might be lower than originally predicted, the sample size for the trial was increased from 2,200 to 3,000 patients. Then as the trial continued, the observed blinded event rate was still lower than planned and the sample size was increased from 3,000 to 3,500 patients. This  increased  sample  size  provided  95%  power  to  detect  a  4.6%  absolute  reduction  (24%  relative reduction, from 19% to 14.4%) in the rate of the primary endpoint between clopidogrel and placebo using a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.

The  study  populations  in  the  placebo  and  treatment  groups  were  comparable.  The  overall  study populations in CLARITY and COMMIT were not too dissimilar, although in CLARITY there were more men, the patients were younger and the Killip class was lower, representing a generally lower risk patient population.

The  placebo  and  clopidogrel-treated  populations  were  also  comparable  in  terms  of  cardiovascular medical history prior to the qualifying event.

Primary Efficacy analysis

The results for the primary endpoint are presented below.

Clopidogrel  produced  a  statistically  significant  reduction  of  36%  in  the  odds  of  occurrence  of  the primary  endpoint,  compared  with  placebo,  [262  (15.0%)  with  clopidogrel  vs.  377  (21.7%)  with placebo; p = 0.00000036]. As seen from the table below, the statistical significance is driven by the effect on occluded Infarct Related Arteries, which is a surrogate endpoint.

Clopidogrel treatment also resulted in significantly lower odds ratio of an occluded IRA on the predischarge angiogram compared with placebo treatment [192 (11.7%) vs 301 (18.4%), respectively], supporting  the  favourable  primary  efficacy  endpoint  results.  The  occurrence  of  recurrent  MI  was numerically  lower  in  the  clopidogrel  arm  but  the  number  of  deaths  was  numerically  higher  with clopidogrel.

- p-value to be interpreted following the hierarchical procedure described in Section 9.7.1.9 of EFC5133 (CLARITY-TIMI 28) report.

For patients who did not undergo angiography, Day 8 or hospital discharge, whichever came first, was used.

No statistically significant difference was observed between clopidogrel and placebo in the composite of  'death,  recurrent  MI  or  recurrent  myocardial  ischaemia  by  the  time  of  the  start  of  predischarge angiography' or in ST-segment resolution, which is known to be an important prognostic parameter. Further to a request from CHMP, the Applicant clarified that 180 min ECGs were available for only 60% of the population; 684/1752 (39.0%) clopidogrel patients and 718/1739 (41.3%) placebo patients were not included in this analysis because their ECGs were either not assessed, not collected within the protocol allowed timeframe, or not interpretable because of poor quality. Moreover, the Applicant argues that clopidogrel produced a statistically significant benefit on the composite primary endpoint (p &lt;0.001) even in patients with no apparent ST segment resolution at 180 minutes - see table below

With background ASA and initial fibrinolytic therapy.

Among all other efficacy endpoints evaluated, the reduction in recurrent MI (4.1% with clopidogrel vs. 5.9% with placebo; p = 0.018) and the composite endpoint of 'death, recurrent MI, or myocardial ischaemia leading to revascularisation (11.8% vs 14.1%, p = 0.034) up to Day 30' were statistically significant in favour of clopidogrel.

Clopidogrel treatment (+ background ASA and initial fibrinolytic therapy) improved all angiographic measurements compared with placebo treatment (+ background ASA and initial fibrinolytic therapy).

A number of  points  were  raised  by  the  CHMP  in  respect  of  the  CLARITY  trial.  The  major  point relates to  the low  level  of  risk  of  the  studied  population ,  possibly rendering  this  population unrepresentative  of  the  general  STEMI  population.  The  Applicant  argues  that  when  comparing  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TIMI  risk  score,  which  measures  the  mortality  risk  for  an  individual  STEMI  patient,  between CLARITY and other studies  in  STEMI  patients  such  as  the  recently  performed  GUSTO  V  and  In TIME-II studies the distribution of risk is almost identical among these 3 studies. Furthermore, the mortality in CLARITY at Day 30 was 4.6% in the clopidogrel group vs 4.5 % in the placebo group, which is not much lower than that recently reported in a meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials (conducted between January 1990 and December 2004) in STEMI patients treated with abciximab versus control, where  30-day  mortality  was  5.2%  and  5.5%,  respectively.  Another  meta-analysis  of  randomised STEMI trials evaluated LMWH vs UFH and demonstrated again that the 30-day mortality rate [5.6% in LMWH patients vs 6.0% in UFH patients] was within the same range as observed in CLARITY. Comparable 30-day mortality results were observed in GUSTO V, where the level of baseline risk was similar  to  the  observed  risk  in  CLARITY.  Finally,  when  looking  at  general  clinical  practice  across Europe, the Euro Heart Survey Programme of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) reported on 7769  consecutive  patients  with  established  coronary  artery  disease  between  2001  and  2002  in  130 hospitals  across  31  countries.  The  results  were  stratified  by  treatment  option  and  type  of  diagnosis. The STEMI cohort in this group showed a similar risk of 30-day mortality (5%) as seen in CLARITY.

The CHMP agrees that the additional data suggest that the risk of the population included is low but not too dissimilar to what has been recorded in other recent studies.

The second point raised  related  to  the  exclusion  of  certain  patient  populations  from  the  CLARITY trial,  notably  the  elderly  and  low  body-weight  patients,  and  whether  these  patients  should  receive clopidogrel  in  combination  with  full-dose  fibrinolytic  therapy  and  ASA,  given  their  higher  risk  of bleeding. The Applicant states that 11% of patients in the COMMIT trial were 75 years of age or older and  that  in  view  of  the  much  higher  absolute  risk  of  reaching  the  composite  endpoint  of  'death, reinfarction or stroke' in patients &gt;75 years (19.3%) than in younger patients (5.4% for &lt;60 years), the similar  proportional  risk  reduction  with  clopidogrel  across  different  age  groups  translated  into substantially  larger  absolute  benefits  in  older  patients  (30  fewer  events  per  1000  treated  vs  4  per 1000).  Regarding  body-weight,  this  exclusion  criterion  is  linked  to  the  labelling  of  a  concomitant medication (heparin). Nonetheless, although no information on body mass index (BMI) was collected in COMMIT, other studies in China show that the mean BMI in Chinese patients is generally lower than  that  in  the  Western  population,  suggesting  that  COMMIT  has  provided  evidence  of  benefit  in lower body-weight patients.

The CHMP agrees with the Applicant's argumentation that there is no reason to exclude the elderly (&gt;75) or low body-weight patients from the population likely to benefit from clopidogrel treatment.

## EFC7018 (COMMIT/CCS- 2)

This was a Phase III, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with suspected acute MI (AMI) conducted at 1,250 active sites in China. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the addition of clopidogrel to ASA for up to 4 weeks in hospital after suspected AMI can reduce mortality and the risk of major vascular events compared with ASA alone.

All patients received daily ASA (162 mg). Each patient was randomised in a 2x2 factorial design (see Figure 9.1) to receive 75 mg clopidogrel once daily or placebo, and metoprolol or placebo, up to 4 weeks in hospital or death or hospital discharge, whichever came first. Patients were to be enrolled within 24 hours of onset of the symptoms of suspected MI with documented electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities  [ie,  ST  elevation/depression  or  bundle  branch  block  (BBB)].  The  clopidogrel  75  mg once  daily  regimen  was  selected  because  it  was  the  effective  dose  that  had  demonstrated  superior efficacy to ASA in atherosclerotic patients at risk. Although the CURE trial, conducted in NSTEMI ACS patients, demonstrated a sustained incremental benefit of clopidogrel 75 mg/day preceded by a 300  mg  loading  dose  on  top  of  standard  therapy  including  ASA,  at  the  time  of  publication  of  the CURE  results,  around  15,000  patients  had  been  included  in  the  COMMIT  trial.  Thus,  the  study continued without an initial loading dose of clopidogrel.

Regarding inclusion  criteria ,  patients,  both  high  and  low  risk,  were  eligible  if,  in  the  view  of  the responsible  physician:  i)  there  were  signs  or  symptoms  of  suspected  AMI  [with  definite  ECG

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

abnormalities: ST elevation/depression or BBB], and ii) the onset of these symptoms was within 24 hours;  and  iii)  there  were  no  clear  contraindications  to  any  one  of  the  trial  treatments:  ASA, clopidogrel or metoprolol (and there were no clear indications for either clopidogrel or metoprolol).

The primary  efficacy  assessment was  based  on  two  co-primary  endpoints  occurring  by  Day  28  or hospital discharge, whichever came first:

- (i) the combined endpoint of 'death, reinfarction or stroke'
- (ii) death from any cause.

Other pre-specified efficacy endpoints included: i) any re-infarction (classified as fatal and nonfatal); ii) any stroke [classified as ischaemic or not; with and without computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmation; with and without residual handicap]; iii) other major clinical events in hospital during the scheduled treatment period that were explicitly recorded (ie, cardiogenic shock, heart failure requiring persistent treatment, presumed cardiac rupture, ventricular fibrillation/other cardiac arrest).

As regards the efficacy analyses ,  although patients were randomised among 4 treatment groups, the analyses for clopidogrel involved 2-way comparisons of clopidogrel (+ ASA) versus placebo (+ ASA). Outcomes  among  all  patients  allocated  active  clopidogrel  were  compared  with  those  among  all patients allocated placebo clopidogrel, even though half patients of both groups received metoprolol and half did not. This design was used for efficiency in testing the two hypotheses of interest, one involving clopidogrel and the other involving metoprolol. The design is most powerful if the treatment effect is the same regardless of the presence of the other drug (ie, no interaction). A test for interaction was performed for the coprimary combined endpoint. All analyses were based on the allocated study treatment, irrespective of adherence, and thus included all randomised patients (ITT analysis).

The  relative  efficacy  of  clopidogrel  versus  placebo  was  assessed  for  each  primary  endpoint  by comparing the  survival  curves  for  the  2  treatments  using  a  log-rank  test  (primary  test  of  treatment effect). These analyses were based on the time to the first event during the scheduled treatment period in hospital. The treatment effect (95% CI) was presented as both the OR (clopidogrel vs placebo) and the  absolute  benefit/1000  (placebo  minus  clopidogrel).  For  other  endpoints  where  the  timing  of  an event was not collected/used, the analyses were based on ordinary OR calculations. Events occurring from  randomisation  to  death  in  hospital,  first  discharge  from  hospital,  or  Day  28  (ie,  during  the scheduled  trial  treatment  period),  whichever  came  first,  were  included  in  the  analyses.  When  the timing  of  an  event  was  unknown  for  a  patient,  then  it  was  assumed  to  have  occurred  as  early  as possible, given other known dates for the patient including date of randomisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  adjustment  for  multiple  comparisons  was  made  to  the  p-value  calculation  for  the  combined primary outcome. However, if the overall p-value was more extreme for death than for the composite outcome, then only the p-value for the composite endpoint would be used in assessing the statistical significance of the effects on mortality. Hypothesis tests were performed using 2-sided tests (p &lt;0.05 significance).  The  principal  subsidiary  comparisons  were  of  the  efficacy  of  clopidogrel  on  the coprimary outcomes during the following post-randomisation periods: Days 0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, and 8-28.

The following drug-demographics and drug-baseline characteristics interaction analyses were conducted  to  estimate  the  effect  on  the  combined  coprimary  endpoint  within  selected  subgroups defined by individual baseline characteristics and to test for possible heterogeneity/trend:

- -Protocol-specified: Sex (male, female); age at entry (&lt;60, 60-69, 70+); hours since symptom onset (&lt;6, 6 to &lt;13, 13 to 24); SBP (&lt;120, 120-139, 140-159, 160+ mm Hg); HR (&lt;70, 70-89, 90-109, 110+ bpm); fibrinolytic agent given before randomisation (yes, no); prognostic index (good, average, poor); metoprolol allocation (yes, no).
- -Non-prespecified: Killip class (I, II/III); previous MI (yes, no); history of hypertension (yes, no); baseline ECG change [BBB, ST elevation, ST depression]; infarct location (anterior, other); prior ASA (yes, no); prior beta-blocker (yes, no).

The sample  size determination  was  based  on  the  rates  of  death,  non-fatal  MI,  and  non-fatal  stroke observed in the first Chinese Cardiac Study (CCS-1). It was assumed for COMMIT/CCS-2 that with 20,000 to 40,000 patients there would be a 98% chance of achieving a conventionally significant result for the combined efficacy endpoint. To reduce the risk of a false negative mortality result, an upper limit of 40,000 patients for the study was initially recommended by the co-chairman of the Steering Committee and the Principal Investigator. During the course of the study, however, tracking of the blinded  event  rates  revealed  a  lower  in-hospital  mortality  rate  than  was  originally  assumed  (8%  as opposed to 10%). This resulted in a revised recommendation to recruit as many as 48,000 patients, given that in order to have at least 95% statistical power to detect a 10% relative risk reduction with a two sided p-value &lt;0.05, it was considered necessary to recruit at least 45 000 patients.

* All treated patients received daily ASA (162 mg).

Based on log-rank test.

b The difference between the composite endpoint and the sum of death + nonfatal re-MI + nonfatal stroke indicates that 9 patients (2 clopidogrel and 7 placebo) suffered both a nonfatal stroke and a nonfatal re-MI.

- Nonfatal re-MI and nonfatal stroke exclude patients who died (of any cause). SE=standarderror;re-MI=reinfarction.

Clopidogrel in combination with ASA significantly reduced by 9% the relative risk of the combination of  'death,  re-infarction  or  stroke'  [2,121  (9.2%)  in  the  clopidogrel  group  vs  2,310  (10.1%)  in  the placebo group; p = 0.002] and by 7% the relative risk of death from any cause [1,726 (7.5%) vs 1,845 (8.1%); p = 0.03]. In absolute terms, clopidogrel + ASA was associated with 9 fewer patients with death, reinfarction or stroke and with 5 fewer patients dying per 1000 allocated treatment.

This clinical benefit of clopidogrel in combination with ASA on both co-primary endpoints appeared to  emerge  rapidly  from  Day  0  (an  average  of  12  hours),  despite  the  lack  of  a  loading  dose. Furthermore,  the  benefit  was  independent  of  the  patients'  characteristics  at  baseline  and  prior  and concomitant treatments the patients received.

The results for the other two subcomponents of the primary endpoint are shown below.

## Subgroup Analyses

The  results  of  the  composite  endpoint  of  'death,  reinfarction  or  stroke'  according  to  the  different protocol-specified subgroups are presented below in Figure (1.) 2. Some of these results were queried by CHMP, notably the finding that the positive effect of clopidogrel on the primary endpoint loses its significance  when  the  patient  group  is  restricted  to  those  patients  who  received  metoprolol.  The CHMP believes  that  this  raises  important  questions  on  the  external  validity  of  this  Chinese  study, given  that beta-blockers are  currently  standard  treatment  in  the  EU.  The  Applicant  argues  that  the general principle in assessing the statistical relevance of any subgroup analyses findings is not whether the effect in a particular subgroup is statistically significant, but rather whether it differs significantly from  the  overall  effects  observed  for  the  whole  study  population.  Given  the  lack  of  statistical heterogeneity of the risk reduction (RR) in different circumstances (p=0.1 for metoprolol), it would be statistically inappropriate to consider results in isolation within any particular subgroup. In particular, the  formal  statistical  test  indicated  that  the  RR  with  clopidogrel  among  those  randomly  allocated metoprolol in this 2x2 factorial design did not differ significantly from the RR with clopidogrel among those  not  allocated  metoprolol.  Hence,  the  Applicant  concludes  that  the  benefit  of  clopidogrel  is largely independent of whether or not beta-blockers are part of the background therapy.

Another finding is that the relative RR with clopidogrel appeared to be greater when treatment was initiated  early  (&lt;12h)  after  symptom  onset.  A  similar  trend  was  noted  for  mortality,  but  not  for reinfarction.  However,  given  the  number  of  subgroups  examined  and  the  lack  of  significance  after correction  for  multiple  comparisons,  this  apparent  trend  should  be  interpreted  cautiously.  No  such time-dependent effect on reinfarction or mortality was found in the large ISIS-2 trial of ASA in acute MI,  nor  is  it  consistent  with  the  beneficial  effect  of  long-term  antiplatelet  therapy  following  MI. Furthermore, it is recognised in international guidelines for STEMI, and as stated in a recent statement from  the  ESC,  that  reperfusion  therapy  has  a  greater  benefit  when  started  soon  after  the  start  of symptoms, and if possible within the first 12 hours. Thus, not surprisingly, the benefit of clopidogrel was greater  for  patients  who  are  treated  early,  but  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  about  whether  this benefit  would  be  lost  in  patients  with  an  onset  of  symptoms  &gt;13  hours  prior  to  the  initiation  of treatment. In order to emphasise that the benefit is greater when clopidogrel is started early from the symptoms, the posology section of the SPC will specify to start as early as possible after symptoms.

Regarding the use of thrombolytics , the Applicant maintains that the results were consistent whether or not they were used [8.8% vs 9.9% in the clopidogrel and placebo groups, respectively, in patients who received  fibrinolytic  agents  [Relative  risk  reduction  (RRR)=11%],  and  9.7%  vs  10.3%  in  the clopidogrel  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  in  patients  who  did  not  receive  fibrinolytic  agents [RRR=6%]; p value for interaction =0.4].

## Relevance of the Chinese clinical setting to Western clinical practice

This was one of the main points challenged by the CHMP. In particular, the CHMP queried the use of baseline  comedication  (e.g.  beta-blockers)  and  access  to  reperfusion  therapy  (thrombolytics  and PTCA),  and  hospital  facilities  for  the  Chinese  population.  The  Applicant  argued  that  baseline characteristics  of  patients  included  in  COMMIT  did  not  differ  substantially  from  data  reported  for Western patients, in international registries (GRACE registry) or in clinical studies (ASSENT-3), with the  majority  of  patients  being  male  and  with  a  mean  age  of  61-64  years  [Table  $$].  Moreover, international registries, such as GRACE or CRUSADE in NSTEMI patients, have demonstrated that medical practice variability among major geographic regions (e.g. China and Europe) are smaller than the variability among  hospitals within a single geographical region. Regarding concomitant medications recommended in STEMI patients, their use was similar between the 2 treatment groups in both COMMIT and CLARITY, and patients received therapy usually recommended in patients with STEMI  for  whom  pharmacological  reperfusion  is  planned.  In  both  studies,  the  anticoagulant  was mainly heparin and the use of ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and calcium antagonists was similar and quite similar  to  the  reported  use  in  the  GRACE  registry.  Overall,  according  to  the  Applicant,  the concomitant drugs used in COMMIT reflect the current guidelines and were identical to those used in Western studies such as ASSENT-3 or in a Western registry (GRACE).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  Applicant  argues  that  both  COMMIT  and  CLARITY  are  complementary,  and  although CLARITY was not powered to look at clinical endpoints, additional analyses of the clinical endpoints at Day 30 with regard to PCI, lytics and lipid lowering agents were performed (see table 1.4 below). In order to facilitate the comparison with the COMMIT study, the composite endpoint of 'cardiovascular death, recurrent MI or stroke' was analysed, as well as the composite endpoint of 'death, recurrent MI or stroke' [identical to the one studied in the COMMIT study], by use of PCI, type of thrombolytic used (fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific) and the use or not of statin.

CV=cardiovascular

These  data  show  a  consistent  trend  towards  a  clinical  benefit  for  clopidogrel  versus  placebo independent of the type of fibrinolytic used and whether or not a statin was used. The CHMP did note that  this  post-hoc  analysis  shows  a  positive  benefit  of  clopidogrel  in  those  patients  who  underwent subsequent PCI, although post-hoc analysis findings should always be interpreted with caution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  was  no  systematic  collection  of  information  on  the use  of  PCI or  lipid  lowering  agents  in COMMIT. According  to  an  epidemiological  study  conducted  in  China,  48.9%  of  STEMI  patients received  PCI  as  reperfusion  therapy,  which  does  not  differ  from  what  is  observed  in  Western countries. A study recently published, evaluating the impact on medical practice of the first guidelines for  the  management  of  AMI  patients  issued  in  China  in  2001,  showed  that  PCI  was  undertaken  in 35.8% of patients compared to 21.7% before publication of the guidelines. Over a period of the 3years from 1999 to 2001, the Chinese registry showed that stents were implanted in 81% of the PCI procedures  performed,  which  is  similar  to  the  rate  observed  in  Western  countries.  Data  from  the literature also show that the use of lipid lowering agents in China is 72.5%-93.0%, is not too different to that recorded in CLARITY (63% of patients received statins.)

Although, COMMIT data did not document the specific characteristics of the population living close to  the  hospital  sites ,  the  mean  duration  of  time  from  symptoms  to  randomisation  or  initiation  of treatment are not different from that observed in Western countries. Of note as shown by the European task  force,  19%  of  the  European  countries  contributing  into  this  evaluation  of  practice  do  not  have access to primary PCI and about 39 % of patients do not even receive pharmacological or mechanical reperfusion therapy.

Thus, the Applicant maintains that the population included in COMMIT is a not a selected population and it closely resembles what is observed in Western countries.

The CHMP acknowledges there are disparities in the treatment of STEMI patients across the EU but does not entirely  agree  with  the  Applicant.  Indeed,  the  low  use  of  background  beta-blockers  in  the COMMIT population (currently standard treatment in the EU STEMI population) and the much higher mortality rate observed in COMMIT (8.1 % in the placebo group) compared to the rate observed in CLARITY (&lt;5% at Day 30) suggest significant differences in background clinical care justifying great caution  in  the  extrapolation  of  the  COMMIT  results  to  the  European  STEMI  population.  For  this reason, this trial has been considered as 'supportive' in this application to extend the ACS indication.

## Clinical Safety [CLARITY &amp; COMMIT]

A total of 49,343 patients were randomised in the 2 studies: 24,713 patients were randomly assigned to receive  clopidogrel  (of  these,  1752  were  allocated  to  receive  a  300  mg  loading  dose)  and  24,630 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo.

Patient disposition in the CLARITY trial is summarised in Figure 1

- With background ASA and initial fibrinolytic therapy; 4 patients randomized to the clopidogrel group and 8 patients randomized to the placebo group received incorrect study drug. For the efficacy analyses, these patients were included in the randomized group.
- Patients who prematurely discontinued study drug were classified as discontinuing for \"administrative\" reasons when drug was stopped for reasons other than adverse events or withdrawal of consent. For example, study staff forgot to give the medication or the patient was transferred to another hospital for the angiogram, and the study drug was not given after transfer.
- Includes one death reported &gt;30 days after randomization (Day 37).

A  total  of  3,491  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  either  clopidogrel  (1,752)  or  placebo (1,739).  Of  these,  3,452  (98.9%)  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug.  Most  treated patients  (94.0%)  completed  the  study  drug  treatments.  Overall,  3.9%  of  patients  prematurely discontinued treatment, with no difference between the 2 treatment groups. The main reason for study drug discontinuation was AEs/SAEs in both treatment groups (2.0% of patients with clopidogrel and 1.8% of patients with placebo).

Patient disposition in the COMMIT trial is summarised in Figure 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 2 Summary of patient disposition (COMMIT)

<!-- image -->

A total of 45,852 patients were randomly assigned to receive either clopidogrel (22,961) or placebo (22,891). Of these, 45,627 (99.5%) received at least one dose of study drug. The vast majority of the randomised  patients  (92.6%)  completed  the  study  drug  treatments.  Overall,  6.9%  of  patients prematurely discontinued the study drug treatment, with no difference between the 2 treatment groups. The main reasons for study drug discontinuation were angioplasty (3.0% with clopidogrel and 3.1% with placebo) and AEs (2.4% with clopidogrel and 2.2% with placebo) in both treatment groups.

## Duration of exposure

In CLARITY, the mean duration of treatment was similar for both treatment groups (clopidogrel 4.5 days and placebo 4.4 days).

In COMMIT, the vast majority of the patients [92.5% (21,241 patients) in the clopidogrel group and 92.7% (21 210 patients)  in  the  placebo  group]  completed  the  study  drug  treatment  as  planned.  No exposure  information  is  available  for  approximately  7%  of  patients  who  prematurely  discontinued treatment. Thus, extent of exposure was estimated by the summary of duration of hospitalisation. For patients discharged or still hospitalised at 28 days (21,235 in the clopidogrel group and 21,046 in the placebo group), the estimated mean duration was 14.9 days in each group.

The CHMP noted that the  mean treatment  duration  was  only  15  days  and  the  maximum  treatment duration was 1 month. It is regrettable that there are no data for a longer period of time, making it difficult to determine the optimal treatment duration. The Applicant discussed this point, emphasising that the long-term benefit of clopidogrel alone in MI patients has been already assessed in the CAPRIE study. Consequently, it has been decided to add the following sentence under the section 4.2 of the SPC:

' The benefit of the combination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks has not been studied '.

The incidence of the primary safety endpoint, adjudicated major bleeding (MB), observed during the treatment  period  in CLARITY was  low  and  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  Fatal  bleeding  was experienced by 13/1733 (0.8%) and 10/1719 (0.6%) patients in the clopidogrel and placebo groups, respectively.

The incidence of adjudicated TIMI major bleeding from the time of first dose of study drug up to the end  of  follow-up  was  low  and  similar  for  the  clopidogrel  and  placebo  groups  (1.9%  and  1.7%, respectively).

with background ASA and initial fibrinolytic therapy.

However, the number of patients with any bleeding was clearly increased  in  the  clopidogrel  group (17.4% vs 12.9% p&lt;0.001) and has been reflected in the SPC.

The overall rate of non-cerebral MB (transfused or fatal) or cerebral bleeding (main safety endpoint) in COMMIT was  low  and  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  In  particular,  no  excess  in  cerebral bleeding, non-cerebral MB, fatal, or non-fatal MB was observed with clopidogrel + ASA during the scheduled  treatment  period.  Clopidogrel  +  ASA  was  associated  with  a  small,  but  statistically significant excess of non-MB and this has been reflected in the SPC.

Deaths and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

## -CLARITY

The total number of deaths recorded during the study was 80 (4.6% of 1752 patients) with clopidogrel and  80  (4.6%  of  1739  patients)  with  placebo.  The  overall  incidence  of  patients  with  treatmentemergent SAEs with an outcome of death up to the end of follow-up was similar in both treatment groups.  Cardiac  failure  was  the  most  commonly  reported  treatment-emergent  SAE  associated  with death for both treatment groups. Bleeding events reported as the primary cause of death occurred in 13 (0.8%) clopidogrel patients and 10 (0.6%) placebo patients.

The incidence of SAEs did not differ between the treatment groups during the treatment period. In both groups, the most frequent treatment-emergent SAE was angina pectoris .

No  SAEs  were  reported  during  the  study.  As  per  protocol  definition,  only  SAEs  that  were  both unexpected (unexpected AEs were defined as those that would not be expected among patients given antiplatelet therapy or a beta-blocker for suspected MI) and believed with a reasonable probability to be due to study treatment were to be reported.

## Other Adverse Events (AEs)

## -CLARITY

There was no difference between groups in the rate of patients experiencing treatment emergent AEs presented  by  System  Organ  Class.  Treatment-emergent  AEs  with  an  incidence &gt; 2.5% were mainly related  to  the  underlying  cardiovascular  conditions.  Except  for  MI,  which  was  more  frequent  with placebo, the rates of AEs by Preferred Term were similar between the 2 treatment groups.

## -COMMIT

There was no difference in the overall incidence of 'volunteered' AEs between the treatment groups during the scheduled treatment period. The incidence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was also similar in each treatment group.

## Safety in special populations

In  CLARITY, there was no apparent increase in the  risk  of  adjudicated  TIMI  major  bleeding  with clopidogrel in any of the prespecified demographic or other subgroups analysed [infarct location, age, gender, weight, race, and location of patient (ambulance/mobile care unit versus hospital) at the time of randomisation.

In COMMIT, the relative rate of major non-cerebral or cerebral bleeding with clopidogrel compared with  placebo  was  independent  of  age  and  gender.  In  particular,  no  excess  of  such  bleeding  was observed with clopidogrel among the 11,934 patients aged 70 years or older.

## Drug interactions

In CLARITY, there was no apparent increase in the risk of adjudicated TIMI MB with clopidogrel in any of the subgroups prespecified according to the type of fibrinolytic agent, the type of anticoagulant used up to 2 hours post-randomisation, or the primary anticoagulant used.

In  COMMIT  there  was  no  excess  of  major  non-cerebral  or  cerebral  bleeding  with  clopidogrel, compared with placebo, in patients who received fibrinolytic therapy prior to randomisation compared to those who did not.

## Discussion

## Efficacy

The two placebo-controlled trials supporting the indication of clopidrogel in STEMI are methodologically sound, are well designed and appear to be well conducted.

The main objective in CLARITY was to evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose+75 mg daily) in STEMI on the top of a background of standard treatment that include ASA, thrombolysis and  heparin.  Clopidogrel  produced  a  statistically  significant  reduction  of  36%  in  the  odds  of occurrence of the primary endpoint, namely \"an occluded Infarct Related Arteries (IRA), or death or recurrent MI'. However, it should be highlighted that the the statistical significance was driven by the effect on the IRA, considered a surrogate endpoint, as the trial was not powered to look at hard clinical endpoints. Regarding secondary endpoints, the reduction in recurrent MI and the composite endpoint of 'death, recurrent MI, or myocardial ischaemia leading to revascularisation up to Day 30' were also statistically  significant  in  favour  of  clopidogrel.  The  two  main  weaknesses  debated  by  CHMP  (see results section) relate to the lack of positive results in the main hard outcomes established as primary endpoints  in  the  study  (e.g.  death,  recurrent  MI)  and  the  surprisingly  low  event  rate  in  the  trial population, making it a very low risk population (30-day mortality was &lt;5%, the lowest in all STEMI trials as pointed out in the New England Journal of Medicine).

COMMIT was a megatrial with nearly 50,000 patients carried out in China to determine whether the addition of clopidogrel to ASA for up to 4 weeks in hospital after suspected AMI reduced mortality and the risk of major vascular events (reinfarction or stroke) compared with ASA alone. Clopidogrel + ASA  significantly  reduced  by  9%  the  relative  risk  of  the  combination  of  'death,  re-infarction  or stroke' and by 7% the relative risk of death from any cause. In absolute terms, clopidogrel + ASA was associated with 9 fewer patients with 'death, reinfarction or stroke' and with 5 fewer patients dying per 1000 allocated treatment. The main issues highlighted by CHMP (see results section) pertain to the differences  in  background  clinical  care,  mostly  in  the  low  use  of  beta-blockers  and  thrombolytic perfusion,  and  the  much  higher  mortality  rate  (8.1  %  in  the  placebo  group)  compared  to  the  rate observed  in  CLARITY,  leading  to  significant  concern  on  the  appropriateness  of  extrapolating  the COMMIT results to the European STEMI population.

The CHMP acknowledges the differences in design and outcomes in the two trials and agrees that they could be regarded as complementary. Indeed, while CLARITY showed positive results on a surrogate endpoint  (angiographic  patency)  in  a  population  representative  of  the  EU  STEMI  clinical  setting, albeit at low risk, COMMIT showed positive results on hard, established endpoints but in a population regarded as considerably less pertinent to EU patients. Thus, to a certain extent these 2 trials validate each other since the results in hard outcomes observed in COMMIT reassure the Committee regarding the angiographic patency results in CLARITY, and the population studied in CLARITY, despite its lower  than  average  risk,  is  more  representative  of  the  target  population.  Overall,  the  CHMP  was reassured  by  the  fact  that  the  results  for  all  major  endpoints  and  subgroup  analyses  are  either favourable to clopidogrel or show a favourable trend, ruling out any heterogeneity.

The main issue discussed  by CHMP relates to which of the two trials  should be regarded as  more representative or 'pivotal', in order to define the wording of the indication to be granted. Despite the huge  weight  of  the  surrogate  endpoint  in  CLARITY,  it  was  decided  to  consider  this  trial  as  more important  given  the  similarity  of  the  trial  population  to  the  EU  STEMI  clinical  setting  and  the concerns raised in this respect with the COMMIT trial, which was finally considered as 'supportive' in  this  application.  Hence,  the  approved  indication  reflects  the  population  studied  in  CLARITY, namely patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy.

The  specific  claim  of  'reduction  in  mortality'  in  the  indication  requested  by  the  Applicant  is  not acceptable.  In  CLARITY,  the  absolute  difference  was  only  0.4%  in  favour  of  placebo  when  the primary endpoint was taken into account, whereas the total number of deaths during the study was similar. In COMMIT, a significant effect was seen, but its clinical relevance is questionable, taking into  account  the  small  difference  in  absolute  numbers  and  the  loss  of  significance  of  the  combined endpoint in those patients taking metoprolol, which is current standard treatment. Moreover, the SPC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

guideline states that specific clinical outcomes achieved should not be mentioned under the indication section (4.1), but rather in section 5.1.

The dose regimen was different in the CLARITY and COMMIT trials, given that a loading dose was not  administered  to  patients  in  COMMIT.  Consequently,  the  CHMP  discussed  whether  the  loading dose offers any advantage given the results obtained in the two trials. The explanations for the lack of a  loading  dose  in  COMMIT  offered  by  the  Applicant  are  reasonable.  Considering  that  the  CHMP finally  regarded  CLARITY  as  the  more  representative  trial  in  this  patient  population,  it  has  been decided to support the treatment protocol followed in CLARITY and thus recommend in section 4.2 of the SPC the use of a loading dose, except in patients &gt;75 yrs, as they are at a higher risk of bleeding and were also excluded from CLARITY. Moreover, there are no safety data on clopidogrel therapy in elderly patients receiving lytic therapy with a loading dose.

The mean treatment duration in COMMIT was only 15 days and the maximum treatment duration was 1 month. It is regrettable that there are no data for a longer period of time as it makes it difficult to determine the optimal treatment duration. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the demonstration of efficacy of the combination of clopidogrel and ASA limited to 4 weeks should be reflected in section 4.2 of the SPC.

## Safety

The well-established safety profile of clopidrogel is not challenged by the data provided in these 2 new trials.  In  CLARITY,  the  incidences  of  major  bleeding  were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  and consistent  across  patient  subgroups  defined  by  patient  characteristics  or  concomitant  therapy.  The incidences  of  fatal  bleeding  and  intracranial  haemorrhage  were  low  and  similar  in  both  treatment groups.  The  significant  overall  increase  in  bleeding  in  the  clopidrogel  group  has  been  reflected  in section 4.8 of the SPC.

Limited safety information was gathered in COMMIT due to its massive size of almost 50,000 pts. The  overall  rate  of  non-cerebral  major  bleeding  or  cerebral  bleeding  was  low  and  similar  in  both groups. No untoward safety findings were reported.

## Conclusions and Benefit/Risk Assessment

The  Applicant  has  provided  two  placebo-controlled  randomised  controlled  trials  to  support  a  new indication for clopidrogel in STEMI. Despite the weaknesses identified by CHMP, the difference in the design and outcomes between the two trials makes them, to a certain extent, complementary. The results for all major endpoints and subgroup analyses are either favourable to clopidogrel or show a favourable  trend,  ruling  out  any  heterogeneity,  which  is  reassuring.  Given  the  differences  in background clinical care (low use of beta-blockers and thrombolytic perfusion) and the high mortality rate,  leading  to  concerns  regarding  the  relevance  of  the  Chinese  population  studied  in  COMMIT to European STEMI population, the CHMP has opted to consider CLARITY as the more relevant trial, despite  the  fact  that  the  results  in  the  primary  endpoint  were  mainly  related  to  a  reduction  in  a surrogate endpoint. This is counterbalanced by the positive findings on hard endpoints reported in the COMMIT. Therefore, the approved indication reflects the population treated in CLARITY.

The safety  profile  established  for  clopidrogel  is  not  challenged  by  the  data  provided  by  the  2  new trials. It is acknowledged that COMMIT is a huge trial with almost 50,000 patients enrolled.
