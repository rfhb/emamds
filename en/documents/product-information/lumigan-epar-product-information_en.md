## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One ml of solution contains 0.1 mg bimatoprost.

Excipient with known effect

One ml of solution contains 0.2 mg benzalkonium chloride.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Eye drops, solution (eye drops)

Colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in adults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The dose should not exceed once daily, as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at baseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution had no adverse effect on liver function over 24 months.

## Method of administration

If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml is contraindicated in patients who have had a suspected previous adverse reaction to benzalkonium chloride that has led to discontinuation.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Ocular

Before treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP) and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during treatment with LUMIGAN. Some of these changes may be permanent, and may lead to impaired field of vision and differences in appearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated (see section 4.8).

Cystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100) following treatment with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. Therefore, LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule).

There have been rare spontaneous reports of reactivation of previous corneal infiltrates or ocular infections with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis.

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, inflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma.

## Skin

There is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in contact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it running onto the cheek or other skin areas.

## Respiratory

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function. While there is limited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of exacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post-marketing experience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or compromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution.

## Cardiovascular

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or uncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of bradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood pressure.

## Other information

In studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been shown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may decrease the IOP-lowering effect (see section 4.5). Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin analogues should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure.

LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride (200 ppm), which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Eye irritation and discolouration of the soft contact lenses may also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occur because of the presence of benzalkonium chloride. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration.

Benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml contains 200 ppm benzalkonium chloride (four times the concentration in bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops), it should be used with caution in dry eye patients, in patients where the cornea may be compromised and in patients taking multiple BAK-containing eye drops. In addition, monitoring is required with prolonged use in such patients.

There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent ocular disease. Patients with a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface are at greater risk of developing bacterial keratitis.

Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or surrounding structures, to avoid eye injury and contamination of the solution.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

No interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely low (less than 0.2 ng/ml) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, and no effects on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies.

In clinical studies, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution was used concomitantly with a number of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions.

Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.

There is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be reduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin analogues (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).

LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular treatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In a 12-month Phase III clinical study approximately 38 % of patients treated with LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution experienced adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and of a non-inflammatory nature) occurring in 29 % of patients. Approximately 4 % of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the 12-month study.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild and none was serious:

Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000); very rare (&lt;1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse reactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP)

Prostaglandin analogues including LUMIGAN can induce periorbital lipodystrophic changes which can lead to deepening of the eyelid sulcus, ptosis, enophthalmos, eyelid retraction, involution of dermatochalasis and inferior scleral show. Changes are typically mild, can occur as early as one month after initiation of treatment with LUMIGAN, and may cause impaired field of vision even in the absence of patient recognition. PAP is also associated with periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discoloration and hypertrichosis. All changes have been noted to be partially or fully reversible upon discontinuation or switch to alternative treatments.

## Iris hyperpigmentation

Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased iris pigmentation are not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts become more brownish. Neither naevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by the treatment. At 12 months, the incidence of iris hyperpigmentation with bimatoprost 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution was 0.5%. At 12 months, the incidence with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution was 1.5% (see section 4.8 Table 2) and did not increase following 3 years treatment.

In clinical studies, over 1 800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml. On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml usage, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were:

- growth of eyelashes in up to 45 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 7 % at 2 years and 2 % at 3 years
- conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature) in up to 44 % in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13 % at 2 years and 12 % at 3 years
- ocular pruritus in up to 14 % of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 3 % at 2 years and 0 % at 3 years. Less than 9 % of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient discontinuations being 3 % at both 2 and 3 years.

Additional adverse reactions reported with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml are presented in Table 2. The table also includes those adverse reactions which occurred with both formulations but at a different frequency. Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none was serious: With each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Adverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops

Cases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate containing eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported, and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration.

If overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN is accidentally ingested, the following information may be useful: in two-week oral rat and mouse studies, doses up to 100 mg/kg/day did not produce any toxicity. This dose expressed as mg/m 2 is at least 210 times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, solution in a 10 kg child.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals - antiglaucoma preparations and miotics prostaglandin analogues - bimatoprost - ATC code: S01EE03.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first administration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of effect is maintained for at least 24 hours.

Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to prostaglandin F2  (PGF2  ), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.

## Clinical efficacy

During a 12-month pivotal study in adults with LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops, the mean diurnal IOP values measured at any visit over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 1.1 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 17.7 mmHg.

LUMIGAN 0.1 mg/ml eye drops contains BAK in a concentration of 200 ppm.

Limited experience is available with the use of LUMIGAN in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy.

No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been established.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro . After ocular administration in adults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once daily ocular administration of one drop of 0.3 mg/ml bimatoprost to both eyes for two weeks, blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 ng · hr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady bimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing.

## Distribution

Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in humans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88 %.

## Biotransformation

Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67 % of an intravenous dose administered to healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25 % of the dose was excreted via the faeces. The elimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the total blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg.

## Characteristics in elderly patients

After twice daily dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution, the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 ng · hr/ml bimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng · hr/ml in young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of  0.3 mg/ml daily for 1 year had an increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown.

Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.

Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the intended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the dose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times higher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity caused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at  0.3 mg/kg/day (at least 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not affected.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One ml of solution contains 0.3 mg bimatoprost.

## Excipient with known effect

One ml of solution contains 0.05 mg benzalkonium chloride.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Eye drops, solution (eye drops)

Colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in adults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The dose should not exceed once daily as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at baseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution had no adverse effect on liver function over 24 months.

## Method of administration

If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml is contraindicated in patients who have had a suspected previous adverse reaction to benzalkonium chloride that has led to discontinuation.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Ocular

Before treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP) and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during treatment with LUMIGAN. Some of these changes may be permanent, and may lead to impaired field of vision and differences in appearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated (see section 4.8).

Cystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100) following treatment with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops. Therefore, LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule).

There have been rare spontaneous reports of reactivation of previous corneal infiltrates or ocular infections with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis.

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, inflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma.

## Skin

There is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in contact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it running onto the cheek or other skin areas.

## Respiratory

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function. While there is limited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of exacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post-marketing experience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or compromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution.

## Cardiovascular

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or uncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of bradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood pressure.

## Other information

In studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been shown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may decrease the IOP-lowering effect (see section 4.5). Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin analogues should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure.

Bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Eye irritation and discolouration of the soft contact lenses may also occur because of the presence of benzalkonium chloride. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since LUMIGAN contains benzalkonium chloride, monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye patients or where the cornea is compromised.

There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent ocular disease. Patients with a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface are at greater risk of developing bacterial keratitis.

Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or surrounding structures, to avoid eye injury and contamination of the solution.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

No interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely low (less than 0.2 ng/ml) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, and no effects on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies.

In clinical studies, LUMIGAN was used concomitantly with a number of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions.

Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.

There is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be reduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin analogues (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).

LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular treatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In clinical studies, over 1 800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution usage, the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were: growth of eyelashes in up to 45% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 7% at 2 years and 2% at 3 years, conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a noninflammatory nature) in up to 44% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13% at 2 years and 12% at 3 years and ocular pruritus in up to 14% of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 3% at 2 years and 0% at 3 years. Less than 9% of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient discontinuations being 3% at both 2 and 3 years.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none was serious:

Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000); very rare (&lt;1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse reactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP)

Prostaglandin analogues including LUMIGAN can induce periorbital lipodystrophic changes which can lead to deepening of the eyelid sulcus, ptosis, enophthalmos, eyelid retraction, involution of dermatochalasis and inferior scleral show. Changes are typically mild, can occur as early as one month after initiation of treatment with LUMIGAN, and may cause impaired field of vision even in the absence of patient recognition. PAP is also associated with periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discoloration and hypertrichosis. All changes have been noted to be partially or fully reversible upon discontinuation or switch to alternative treatments.

## Iris hyperpigmentation

Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased iris pigmentation are not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts become more brownish. Neither naevi nor freckles of the iris appears to be affected by the treatment. At 12 months, the incidence of iris pigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml was 1.5% (see section 4.8) and did not increase following 3 years treatment.

## Adverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops

Cases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate containing eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported, and is unlikely to occur after ocular administration.

If overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN is accidentally ingested, the following information may be useful: in two-week oral rat and mouse studies, doses up to 100 mg/kg/day did not produce any toxicity. This dose expressed as mg/m 2 is at least 70-times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution in a 10 kg child.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals - antiglaucoma preparations and miotics prostaglandin analogues - bimatoprost - ATC code: S01EE03.

## Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first administration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of effect is maintained for at least 24 hours.

Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to prostaglandin F2  (PGF2  ), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.

## Clinical efficacy

During 12 months' monotherapy treatment with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml in adults, versus timolol, mean change from baseline in morning (08:00) intraocular pressure ranged from -7.9 to -8.8 mm Hg. At any visit, the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0 mmHg.

In a 6-month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml versus latanoprost, a statistically superior reduction in morning mean IOP (ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for bimatoprost versus -6.0 to -7.2 mmHg for latanoprost) was observed at all visits throughout the study. Conjunctival hyperaemia, growth of eyelashes, and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher with bimatoprost than with latanoprost, however, the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low with no statistically significant difference.

Compared to treatment with beta-blocker alone, adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml lowered mean morning (08:00) intraocular pressure by -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg.

Limited experience is available with the use of LUMIGAN in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy.

No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been established.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro . After ocular administration in adults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once daily ocular administration of one drop of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml to both eyes for two weeks, blood

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 ng · hr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady bimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing.

## Distribution

Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in humans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88%.

## Biotransformation

Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites.

## Elimination

Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67% of an intravenous dose administered to healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25% of the dose was excreted via the faeces. The elimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the total blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg.

## Characteristics in elderly patients

After twice daily dosing of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml, the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 ng · hr/ml bimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng · hr/ml in young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of  0.3 mg/ml daily for 1 year had an increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects have been observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown.

Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.

Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the intended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the dose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times higher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity caused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at  0.3 mg/kg/day (at least 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not affected.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution, in single-dose container

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One ml of solution contains 0.3 mg bimatoprost.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Eye drops, solution, in single-dose container.

Colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in adults (as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily, administered in the evening. The dose should not exceed once daily as more frequent administration may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect.

For single use only, one container is sufficient to treat both eyes. Any unused solution should be discarded immediately after use.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients. In patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin at baseline, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops (multi-dose formulation), solution had no adverse effect on liver function over 24 months.

## Method of administration

If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Ocular

Before treatment is initiated, patients should be informed of the possibility of prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP) and increased iris pigmentation, since these have been observed during treatment with LUMIGAN. Some of these changes may be permanent, and may lead to impaired field of vision and differences in appearance between the eyes when only one eye is treated (see section 4.8).

Cystoid macular oedema has been uncommonly reported (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100) following treatment with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops (multi-dose formulation). Therefore, LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e.g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule).

There have been rare spontaneous reports of reactivation of previous corneal infiltrates or ocular infections with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution (multi-dose formulation). LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of significant ocular viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex) or uveitis/iritis.

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with inflammatory ocular conditions, neovascular, inflammatory, angle-closure glaucoma, congenital glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma.

## Skin

There is a potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LUMIGAN solution comes repeatedly in contact with the skin surface. Thus, it is important to apply LUMIGAN as instructed and avoid it running onto the cheek or other skin areas.

## Respiratory

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with compromised respiratory function. While there is limited information available on patients with a history of asthma or COPD, there have been reports of exacerbation of asthma, dyspnoea and COPD, as well as reports of asthma, in post-marketing experience. The frequency of these symptoms is not known. Patients with COPD, asthma or compromised respiratory function due to other conditions should be treated with caution.

## Cardiovascular

LUMIGAN has not been studied in patients with heart block more severe than first degree or uncontrolled congestive heart failure. There have been a limited number of spontaneous reports of bradycardia or hypotension with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution (multi-dose formulation). LUMIGAN should be used with caution in patients predisposed to low heart rate or low blood pressure.

## Other information

In studies of bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, it has been shown that the more frequent exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may decrease the IOP-lowering effect (see section 4.5). Patients using LUMIGAN with other prostaglandin analogues should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure.

LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose has not been studied in patients wearing contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

No interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely low (less than 0.2 ng/mL) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution (multi-dose formulation). Bimatoprost is biotransformed by any of multiple enzymes and pathways, and no effects on hepatic drug metabolising enzymes were observed in preclinical studies.

In clinical studies, LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) was used concomitantly with a number of different ophthalmic beta-blocking agents without evidence of interactions.

Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta-blockers has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.

There is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of prostaglandin analogues (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be reduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other prostaglandin analogues (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of bimatoprost in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at high maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).

LUMIGAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether bimatoprost is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of bimatoprost in breast milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue from LUMIGAN therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of bimatoprost on human fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

LUMIGAN has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. As with any ocular treatment, if transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

In a 3 month clinical study, approximately 29% of patients treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL singledose experienced adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were conjuctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and of a non-inflammatory nature) occurring in 24% of patients, and eye pruritis occurring in 4% of patients. Approximately 0.7% of patients in the LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose group discontinued due to any adverse event in the 3 month study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml single-dose or in the post-marketing period. Most were ocular, mild and none was serious:

Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000); very rare (&lt;1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data) adverse reactions are presented according to System Organ Class in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Prostaglandin analogue periorbitopathy (PAP)

Prostaglandin analogues including LUMIGAN can induce periorbital lipodystrophic changes which can lead to deepening of the eyelid sulcus, ptosis, enophthalmos, eyelid retraction, involution of dermatochalasis and inferior scleral show. Changes are typically mild, can occur as early as one month after initiation of treatment with LUMIGAN, and may cause impaired field of vision even in the absence of patient recognition. PAP is also associated with periocular skin hyperpigmentation or discoloration and hypertrichosis. All changes have been noted to be partially or fully reversible upon discontinuation or switch to alternative treatments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Iris hyperpigmentation

Increased iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased iris pigmentation are not known. Iris colour changes seen with ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts become more brownish. Neither naevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by the treatment. At 3 months, the incidence of iris hyperpigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL single-dose was 0.3%. At 12 months, the incidence of iris pigmentation with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) was 1.5% (see section 4.8) and did not increase following 3 years treatment.

In clinical studies, over 1 800 patients have been treated with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml (multi-dose formulation). On combining the data from phase III monotherapy and adjunctive LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml (multi-dose formulation) usage, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were:

- growth of eyelashes in up to 45% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 7% at 2 years and 2% at 3 years
- conjunctival hyperaemia (mostly trace to mild and thought to be of a non-inflammatory nature) in up to 44% in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 13% at 2 years and 12% at 3 years
- ocular pruritus in up to 14% of patients in the first year with the incidence of new reports decreasing to 3% at 2 years and 0% at 3 years.

Less than 9% of patients discontinued due to any adverse event in the first year with the incidence of additional patient discontinuations being 3% at both 2 and 3 years.

Table 2 lists adverse reactions that were seen in a 12-month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation), but were reported at a higher frequency than with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (single-dose). Most were ocular, mild to moderate, and none were serious.

## Adverse reactions reported in phosphate containing eye drops

Cases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate containing eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No information is available on overdose in humans; overdose is unlikely to occur after ocular administration.

If overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. If LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose is accidentally ingested, the following information may be useful: In short term oral (by gavage) mouse and rat studies, doses up to 100 mg/kg/day of bimatoprost did not produce any toxicity. This dose is at least 22 times higher than an accidental dose of the entire content of a pack of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose (30 x 0.4 mL single-dose containers; 12 mL) in a 10 kg child.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals - antiglaucoma preparations and miotics prostaglandin analogues - bimatoprost - ATC code: S01EE03.

## Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in humans is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outflow. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first administration and maximum effect is reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours. The duration of effect is maintained for at least 24 hours.

Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent. It is a synthetic prostamide, structurally related to prostaglandin F2  (PGF2  ), that does not act through any known prostaglandin receptors. Bimatoprost selectively mimics the effects of newly discovered biosynthesised substances called prostamides. The prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.

## Clinical efficacy

A 12 week (double-masked, randomized, parallel group) clinical study compared the efficacy and safety of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation). LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose achieved non-inferior IOP-lowering efficacy to LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) for worse eye IOP change from baseline in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL single-dose also achieved equivalent IOP-lowering efficacy with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/mL (multi-dose formulation) in average eye IOP at each follow-up timepoint at weeks 2, 6 and 12.

During 12 months' monotherapy treatment with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml (multi-dose formulation) in adults, versus timolol, mean change from baseline in morning (08:00) intraocular pressure ranged from -7.9 to -8.8 mmHg. At any visit, the mean diurnal IOP values measured over the 12-month study period differed by no more than 1.3 mmHg throughout the day and were never greater than 18.0 mmHg.

In a 6-month clinical study with LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml (multi-dose formulation), versus latanoprost, a statistically superior reduction in morning mean IOP (ranging from -7.6 to -8.2 mmHg for bimatoprost versus -6.0 to -7.2 mmHg for latanoprost) was observed at all visits throughout the study. Conjunctival hyperaemia, growth of eyelashes, and eye pruritus were statistically significantly higher with bimatoprost than with latanoprost, however, the discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low with no statistically significant difference.

Compared to treatment with beta-blocker alone, adjunctive therapy with beta-blocker and LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml (multi-dose formulation) lowered mean morning (08:00) intraocular pressure by -6.5 to -8.1 mmHg.

Limited experience is available in patients with open-angle glaucoma with pseudoexfoliative and pigmentary glaucoma, and chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy.

No clinically relevant effects on heart rate and blood pressure have been observed in clinical trials.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Bimatoprost penetrates the human cornea and sclera well in vitro . After ocular administration in adults, the systemic exposure of bimatoprost is very low with no accumulation over time. After once daily ocular administration of one drop of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml to both eyes for two weeks, blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and declined to below the lower limit of detection (0.025 ng/ml) within 1.5 hours after dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC 0-24hrs values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0.08 ng/ml and 0.09 ng · hr/ml respectively, indicating that a steady bimatoprost concentration was reached during the first week of ocular dosing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues and the systemic volume of distribution in humans at steady-state was 0.67 l/kg. In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma. The plasma protein binding of bimatoprost is approximately 88%.

## Biotransformation

Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing. Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites.

## Elimination

Bimatoprost is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, up to 67% of an intravenous dose administered to healthy adult volunteers was excreted in the urine, 25% of the dose was excreted via the faeces. The elimination half-life, determined after intravenous administration, was approximately 45 minutes; the total blood clearance was 1.5 l/hr/kg.

## Characteristics in elderly patients

After twice daily dosing of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg/ml, the mean AUC0-24hr value of 0.0634 ng · hr/ml bimatoprost in the elderly (subjects 65 years or older) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng · hr/ml in young healthy adults. However, this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing. There was no accumulation of bimatoprost in the blood over time and the safety profile was similar in elderly and young patients.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

Monkeys administered ocular bimatoprost concentrations of  0.3 mg/ml daily for 1 year had an increase in iris pigmentation and reversible dose-related periocular effects characterised by a prominent upper and/or lower sulcus and widening of the palpebral fissure. The increased iris pigmentation appears to be caused by increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes and not by an increase in melanocyte number. No functional or microscopic changes related to the periocular effects were observed, and the mechanism of action for the periocular changes is unknown.

Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.

Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in rats up to doses of 0.6 mg/kg/day (at least 103-times the intended human exposure). In embryo/foetal developmental studies abortion, but no developmental effects were seen in mice and rats at doses that were at least 860-times or 1700-times higher than the dose in humans, respectively. These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times higher, respectively, than the intended human exposure. In rat peri/postnatal studies, maternal toxicity caused reduced gestation time, foetal death, and decreased pup body weights at  0.3 mg/kg/day (at least 41-times the intended human exposure). Neurobehavioural functions of offspring were not affected.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet :

1. What LUMIGAN is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN
3. How to use LUMIGAN
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store LUMIGAN
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What LUMIGAN is and what it is used for

LUMIGAN is an antiglaucoma preparation. It belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides.

LUMIGAN eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye. This medicine may be used on its own or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure.

Your eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly enough, the pressure inside the eye builds up. This medicine works by increasing the amount of liquid that is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. If the high pressure is not reduced, it could lead to a disease called glaucoma and eventually damage your sight.

## 2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN

## Do not use LUMIGAN:

- if you are allergic to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you have had to stop using eye drops in the past because of a side effect of the preservative benzalkonium chloride.

## Warnings and precautions:

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you use LUMIGAN if:

- You have any breathing problems
- You have liver or kidney problems
- You have had a cataract surgery in the past
- You have dry eye
- You have or have had any problems with your cornea (front transparent part of the eye)
- You wear contact lenses (see 'Lumigan contains benzalkonium chloride')
- You have or have had low blood pressure or low heart rate
- You have had a viral infection or inflammation of the eye

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During treatment, LUMIGAN may cause a loss of fat around the eye, which may cause your eyelid crease to deepen, your eye to appear sunken (enophthalmos), your upper eyelid to droop (ptosis), the skin around your eye to tighten (involution of dermatochalasis) and the lower white part of your eye to become more visible (inferior scleral show). The changes are typically mild, but if pronounced, they can affect your field of vision. The changes may disappear if you stop taking LUMIGAN. LUMIGAN may also cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too. The colour of your iris may also go darker. These changes may be permanent. The changes may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye.

## Children and adolescents

LUMIGAN has not been tested in children under the age of 18 and therefore should not be used by patients under 18 years.

## Other medicines and LUMIGAN

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.

LUMIGAN may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you are taking LUMIGAN.

## Driving and using machines

Your sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN. You should not drive or use machines until your sight is clear again.

## LUMIGAN contains benzalkonium chloride

This medicine contains 0.6 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 3 ml of solution which is equivalent to 0.2 mg/ml.

Do not use the drops when you are wearing your lenses. A preservative in LUMIGAN, benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and wait 15 minutes after using the drops before you put your lenses back in. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor.

## 3. How to use LUMIGAN

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

LUMIGAN should only be applied to the eye. The recommended dose is one drop of LUMIGAN in the evening, once daily in each eye that needs treatment.

If you use LUMIGAN with another eye medicine, wait at least five minutes between using LUMIGAN and the other eye medicine.

Do not use more than once a day as the effectiveness of treatment may be reduced.

## Instructions for use:

You must not use the bottle if the tamper-proof seal on the bottle neck is broken before you first use it.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Wash your hands. Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling.
2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid until there is a small pocket.
3. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze it to release one drop into each eye that needs treatment.
4. Let go of the lower lid, and close your eye for 30 seconds.

Wipe off any excess that runs down the cheek.

If a drop misses your eye, try again.

To help prevent infections and avoid eye injury, do not let the tip of the bottle touch your eye or anything else. Put the cap back on and close the bottle straight after you have used it.

## If you use more LUMIGAN than you should

If you use more LUMIGAN than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your next dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

## If you forget to use LUMIGAN

If you forget to use LUMIGAN, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular routine. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop using LUMIGAN

LUMIGAN should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using LUMIGAN the pressure inside your eye may go up, therefore talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

## 1. What LUMIGAN single-dose is and what it is used for

LUMIGAN single-dose is an antiglaucoma preparation. It belongs to a group of medicines called prostamides.

LUMIGAN single-dose eye drops are used to reduce high pressure in the eye. This medicine may be used on its own or with other drops called beta-blockers which also reduce pressure.

Your eye contains a clear, watery liquid that feeds the inside of the eye. Liquid is constantly being drained out of the eye and new liquid is made to replace this. If the liquid cannot drain out quickly enough, the pressure inside the eye builds up. This medicine works by increasing the amount of liquid that is drained. This reduces the pressure inside the eye. If the high pressure is not reduced, it could lead to a disease called glaucoma and eventually damage your sight.

This medicine does not contain a preservative.

## 2. What you need to know before you use LUMIGAN single-dose

## Do not use LUMIGAN

- If you are allergic to bimatoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to you doctor or pharmacist before you use LUMIGAN single-dose if:

- You have any breathing problems
- You have liver or kidney problems
- You have had a cataract surgery in the past
- You have or have had low blood pressure or low heart rate
- You have had a viral infection or inflammation of the eye

During treatment, LUMIGAN may cause a loss of fat around the eye, which may cause your eyelid crease to deepen, your eye to appear sunken (enophthalmos), your upper eyelid to droop (ptosis), the skin around your eye to tighten (involution of dermatochalasis) and the lower white part of your eye to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

become more visible (inferior scleral show). The changes are typically mild, but if pronounced, they can affect your field of vision. The changes may disappear if you stop taking LUMIGAN. LUMIGAN single-dose may also cause your eyelashes to darken and grow, and cause the skin around the eyelid to darken too. The colour of your iris may also go darker. These changes may be permanent. The changes may be more noticeable if you are only treating one eye.

## Children and adolescents

LUMIGAN single-dose has not been tested in children under the age of 18 and therefore should not be used by patients under 18 years.

## Other medicines and LUMIGAN

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

LUMIGAN single-dose may get into breast milk so you should not breast-feed while you are taking this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

Your sight may become blurred for a short time just after using LUMIGAN single-dose. You should not drive or use machines until your sight is clear again.

## 3. How to use LUMIGAN single-dose

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

The recommended dose is one drop once daily, in the evening, once daily in each eye that needs treatment. LUMIGAN single-dose should only be applied to the eye.

If you use LUMIGAN single-dose with another eye medicine, wait at least 5 minutes between using LUMIGAN single-dose and the other eye medicine.

Do not use more than once a day as the effectiveness of treatment may be reduced.

Wash your hands before use. Make sure that the single-dose container is intact before use. The solution should be used immediately after opening. To avoid contamination, do not let the open-end of the single-dose container touch your eye or anything else.

<!-- image -->

1. Take one single-dose container from the pouch and hold it upright (with the cap pointing upwards) and twist-off the cap.
2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid to form a pocket. Turn the single-dose container upside down and squeeze it to release 1 drop into the affected eye(s).
3. Throw away the single-dose container after you have used it, even if there is some solution left.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-

Wipe off any excess that runs down the cheek.

If you wear contact lenses, take your lenses out before using this medicine. Wait 15 minutes after using the drops, and before you put your lenses back in.

## If you use more LUMIGAN than you should

If you use more of this medicine than you should, it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. Put your next dose in at the usual time. If you are worried, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

## If you forget to use LUMIGAN

If you forget to use this medicine, use a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular routine. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop using LUMIGAN

LUMIGAN single-dose should be used every day to work properly. If you stop using LUMIGAN single-dose the pressure inside your eye may go up, therefore talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment.

If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
