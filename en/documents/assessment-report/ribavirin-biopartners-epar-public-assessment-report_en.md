## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Ribavirin BioPartners. 200 mg film-coated tablets is a medicinal product containing ribavirin as an active  substance.  The  application  for  200  mg  tablets  was  submitted  under  the  Article  10(1)  of Directive 2001/83/EC i.e. generic application referring to a reference medicinal product.

<!-- image -->

Ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analogue that is active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses. There  are  numbers  of  proposed  mechanisms  of  action  for  ribavirin.  These  include  indirect  effects such as inhibition of inosine monophosphate and immunomodulatory effects and direct effects such as polymerase inhibition and interference with viral RNA capping. Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity in vitro against  respiratory  syncytial  virus  and in  vivo in  infected  cotton  rats  when administered intraperitoneally or by aerosol. Pharmacokinetic properties as well as clinical efficacy and safety are documented for the reference medicinal product Rebetol. Two single dose bioequivalence studies with Ribavirin BioPartners and with the reference product Rebetol were submitted to support the application. The  indication  proposed  for  Ribavirin  BioPartners  is  the  same  as  authorised  for  the  reference medicinal product Rebetol. Rebetol is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and must only be  used  as  part  of  a  combination  regimen  with  peginterferon  alfa-2b  (adults)  or  interferon  alfa-2b (adults and children of 3-years of age or older). There is no safety or efficacy information on the use of  Rebetol  with  other  forms  of  interferon  (i.e.,  not  alfa-2b),  or  on  the  use  of  Rebetol  with peginterferon alfa-2b in children or adolescents. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Ribavirin  BioPartners  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  ribavirin  as  active  substance. Only one strength of 200mg has been developed. Other ingredients are defined in the SPC, section 6.1.:  microcrystalline  cellulose,  povidone,  crospovidone,  anhydrous  colloidal  silica,  magnesium stearate, hypromellose titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol. The  film-coated  tablets  are  packed  in  PVC/PVDC/Alu  blister  strips.  The  blisters  are  packed  in cardboard carton. Active Substance The chemical name of ribavirin is 1β -D-Ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide corresponding to the chemical formula C8H12N4O5 and molecular mass 244.21 g/mol.

It  appears as a colorless powder that is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol and very slightly soluble in dichloromethane.

Ribavirin  has  four  asymmetric  centers  giving  16  potential  isomers;  the  active  substance  used  is enantiomerically pure.

The substance shows polymorphism, one polymorphic form is consistently formed during the active substance production and used in the manufacture of the finished product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The compound is well known and a monograph is published in the Ph.Eur.

A valid certificate of suitability to the Ribavirin Ph. Eur. Monograph has been submitted as part of this  application.  The  information  provided  regarding  the  manufacturing  process,  the  specifications and stability of the active substance was assessed and approved by the European Directorate for the Quality  of  Medicines  (EDQM).  Satisfactory  quality  of  the  active  substance  is  ensured  through  the CEP.

Stability results support the proposed retest period of 5 years when the active substance is stored in the proposed container closure system. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical Development The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to formulate an immediate release solid dosage form containing 200mg of ribavirin per film-coated tablet and being bioequivalent to the reference product, Rebetol. All excipients used in Ribavirin BioPartners are commonly used in pharmaceutical oral dosage form. For the tablet core, microcrystalline cellulose is used as a filler, crospovidone as a disintegrant, povidone as a binder, anhydrous colloidal silica as a flow promoter and magnesium stearate is utilised as  a  lubricant.  The  film-coat  is  composed  of  hypromellose  as  a  film-forming  agent,  polyethylene glycol as a plasticizer and titanium dioxide as a colorant. All excipients comply with PhEur monographs. No materials of human or animal origin are used in the synthesis of the drug substance or in the manufacture of the drug product. No  formal  compatibility  studies  between  the  excipients  and  the  API  are  provided.    However,  the stability  data  generated  is  considered  as  a  satisfactory  indication  of  the  compatibility  of  the formulation. The  qualitative  composition  of  Ribavirin  BioPartners  film-coated  tablets  is  different  from  the reference  product.  Dissolution  studies  and  comparative  dissolution  profiles  with  the  reference medicinal product have been provided and the dissolution characteristics are considered comparable. The finished product will be packaged in PVC/PVDC/Aluminium blister strips which comply with the PhEur monographs and the EU food stuffs regulations. · Manufacture of the Product The manufacturing process is a standard wet granulation method followed by coating. The different steps are: granulation, wet sieving, drying, dry sieving, final blending, compression and the coating process.  Adequate  In-Process  controls  have  been  set  up  and  a  detailed  description  along  with  the process flow scheme has been provided. There are two possible manufacturers for the finished product: both have the same responsibilities and follow the same manufacturing process. For one manufacturing site, the process validation was performed on batches with different batch sizes including one production scale batch. For the other site, a validation protocol has been provided and the validation study results will be submitted prior to the  commercialisation  of  the  product.  The  validation  results  presented  show  that  the  film-coated tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the  agreed  finished  product  specification which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

## · Product Specification

The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include tests for description, uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying, hardness (Ph. Eur.), disintegration (Ph.Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC) and microbial limit test (Ph.Eur.). The analytical methods have been adequately described and validated where appropriate. The same methods  are  used  at  both  sites.  The  HPLC  method  for  assay  has  been  validated  for  specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness.

The impurity profiles of both drug substance and medicinal product are compliant with the Ph. Eur. Monograph  and  ICH  guidance  and  are  acceptable.  The  SPC  is  in  line  with  that  of  the  authorised reference product.

The comparative impurities profile was performed between Ribavirin BioPartners film-coated tablets and the reference medicinal product. Impurity profile was found to be satisfactory. Batch analysis data was provided on one production scale batch and two validation scale batches for the first site and on one validation scale batch for the second site. The data shows compliance with the proposed specification limits for both sites. · Stability of the Product Batches manufactured for validation purposes have been placed on stability in the container closure system  proposed  for  use  in  the  commercial  product.  Stability  studies  were  carried  out  under  ICH conditions: 25°C±2°C/ 60 % ±5 %RH (long term) and 40°C ± 2°C / 75 % ± 5 % RH (accelerated). The two pilot scale batches and the production scale batch have been exposed to long term storage conditions for 60 months. At accelerated conditions six months data are available for all batches. Observed physical and chemical changes were small, and not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when used according to the directions in the SPC. Based on the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC are acceptable. Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues, which have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve them as Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame. 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects The  applicant provided an acceptable summary  of  the pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and toxicology of ribavirin based on published literature as well as reference books and information from databases.  No further  non-clinical  studies  are  required  and  the  applicant  has  justified why no such data were provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  lack  of  a  formal  environmental  risk  assessment  was  justified  by  the  assumption  that  the introduction of the generic product would lead to interchange with the prescription of other ribavirin products marketed in Europe, which is unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales  volumes  for  all  ribavirin  containing  products.  Therefore  the  exposure  of  the  environment  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ribavirin  is  unlikely  to  increase  from  use  of  the  generic  product.  This  justification  was  considered acceptable.

This  application  concerns  a  generic  medicinal  product  that  contains  a  single  strength  of  200  mg ribavirin in a film-coated tablet. The proposed SPC of the generic product is in line with the one for the reference product. To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant had conducted two  single  dose  bioequivalence  studies  with  parallel  design,  one  under  fasting  the  other  under  fed conditions. These studies were pivotal for the assessment. Scientific advice was sought for the development programme. For the clinical assessment the Note for Guidance on Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in its current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) are of particular relevance. GCP All  studies  were  complying  with  GCP,  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant  has  provided  a statement to the effect that clinical trial BP-IFN-RIB-001 was partly conducted outside the community and was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Clinical studies To  support  the  application,  the  applicant  has  submitted  two  bioequivalence  studies  in  healthy volunteers.

Expiry date:

The  subjects  were  hospitalised  before  each  administration,  at  least  10  hours  prior  to  dosing.  They remained in the clinical unit under permanent medical and nursing supervision for 12 hours after each administration. The subjects left the unit at + 12 h once their venous catheters had been removed and returned the following days for the blood sampling. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two dosing sequences. The subjects were fasted at least for 10 h before the study medication administration and for + 4 h p.a., except for water that could be taken ad libitum from + 2 h p.a. They were given a breakfast at + 4 h p.a., around 12 p.m. The lunch was due to be served at + 7 h p.a. and the afternoon snack at + 10 h p.a. The meals and the caloric intake were similar in both periods. Any additional food or drink intake was prohibited, with the exception of water that could be freely taken from 2 hours after study medication administration. The  volunteers  came  in  from  3.00  p.m.  on  the  day  before  administration  (day  -1),  staying  in  the hospital  until  8.00  p.m.  of  the  second  day  (+  12  h  p.a.).  Upon  arrival,  a  basal  blood  sampling  was made to conduct the complete analysis of haematology, clinical chemistry, and toxicology. A urine sample was also taken. In addition, a physical examination was made and blood pressure, cardiac rate, respiratory rate, temperature and body weight were determined. Blood  sampling  for  determination  of  ribavirin  levels  was  done  under  basal  conditions  (prior  to administration of study medication) and at following times over 96 h p.a : 0.5, 1, 1.15, 1.30, 1,45, 2, 2.30, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h p.a. The washout period between the two treatments was at least 21 days. The  clinical  part  of  the  study,  the  bioanalytical  analyses  as  well  as  the  statistical  analyses  were performed by contract research organisations. The  study  protocol  and  consent  form  were  reviewed  and  approved  (with  revisions)  by  an  ethics review board.

## POPULATION(S) STUDIED

36 healthy male volunteers were enrolled in the study. One subject dropped out before period 1 and was replaced. Two subjects dropped out after period 1 and were also replaced. 36 subjects completed both  study  periods  and  were  included  in  the  statistical  analysis.  The  participants  had  to  be  nonsmokers or smokers of less than 10 cigarettes per day, aged between 18 and 50 years, and had to have a body mass index (BMI) within 19-27 kg/m 2 .  The mean demographic data for all enrolled subjects are presented in Table 2. The mean age of subjects was 25.67 years, with the range of 19 to 37 years. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were presented and were acceptable for the product and for this type of study.

|      |   Age (years) |   Height (cm) |   Weight (kg) |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Min  |         19    |      1.88     |       57      |

| SD   |          4.6  |      0.005924 |        8.1061 |

Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  acceptable  for  the  product  and  for  this  type  of  study.  The volunteers had committed themselves not to take any food or beverages during the trial that could interfere  with  the  study  outcome.  This  specifically  applied  to  alcoholic  drinks  as  well  as  to  cola, caffeine  or  other  xanthine-containing  drinks.  They  had  also  committed  themselves  to  abstain  from strong physical exercise and strenuous sports activities for the entire study period, starting two days prior  to  the  first  hospitalization  and  finishing  after  the  end  of  study.  It  was  not  allowed  to  drive vehicles during the active periods. 36 subjects completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Table 2 Summary of mean demographic data for enrolled subjects (N = 39) ANALYTICAL METHODS The analysis was performed using a LC/MS/MS method. The analytical method was considered adequately validated. PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES Pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  ribavirin  plasma  concentration  were  calculated.  The  following pharmacokinetic parameters for ribavirin concentrations were calculated: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ , extrapolated area (%), terminal elimination rate constant λ z,  and half-life of drug elimination during the terminal phase (t1/2 ). The main pharmacokinetic variables studied were AUC0-ct, AUC0-∞ , Cmax and tmax of ribavirin. The parameters were derived individually for each subject from the ribavirin concentration in plasma. A  non  compartmental  method  was  used  for  the  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  The  arithmetic  means, medians,  minimum,  and  maximum  values,  geometric  mean  =  exp  (mean[ln  data]),  standard deviations, and coefficients of variations for all parameters were calculated. STATISTICAL METHODS Medicinal product no longer authorised

The comparison of the pharmacokinetics of the two formulations was achieved using a bioequivalence test.

The statistical analysis was based on the 90% confidence intervals for the mean ratio test/reference of the following parameters: AUC0-ct, AUC0-∞ ,  Cmax.  This analysis was done with log-transformed data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  method  is  equivalent  to  the  double  t-test  procedure  with  a  statistical  signification  of  a  5% assuming a H0 of no equivalence. The confidence intervals calculation was based in the residual error of the ANOVA.

The ANOVA included all the variation sources (sequence, period and treatment) that could affect the response. tmax comparison was done using a non-parametric statistical method. The 90% confidence interval  of  the  ratio  test/reference  was  calculated  by  means  of  the  Hauschke  method,  which  is insensitive to putative period effects.

According to the current European Guidelines of bioequivalence, the theoretical ranges of acceptability can be considered as well established for AUC within 0.80 to 1.25. However, for some parameters, as for Cmax, wider ranges than the standard 0.80- to 1.25 can be justified prospectively. In this study, according to the usual pattern of administration, as well the wide therapeutic range, it was considered as reasonable to pre-establish the acceptability ranges as follows: · Ln AUC: 20% [80% - 125%] · Ln Cmax: 30% [70% - 143%] · t max : 30% [70% - 130%] In any case the significance level considered was ≤ 5% (probability of α error of 0.05) · Results 36 out of 39 subjects completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Three subjects were excluded during the conduct of the trial due to the following reasons: -One subject dropped-out before the first treatment period due to hypertension and was replaced; -One  subject  dropped-out  after  the  first  treatment  period  due  to  tonsils  hypertrophy  and  was replaced; -One  subject  dropped-out  after  the  first  treatment  period  due  to  thrombocytopenia  and  was replaced. Subjects who replaced the drop-outs kept the random sequence of their precedents. Protocol deviations that occurred during the conduct of this study were judged by the investigators not to have any significant impact on the accuracy of the study results. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the 36 subjects who were included in the analysis are presented in Table 3. The results of the statistical analysis for log-transformed data are displayed in Table 4. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  washout  period  between  the  two  study  periods  was  21  days,  none  of  the  pre-dose  samples contained  detectable  levels  of  ribavirin.  The  length  of  washout  period  was  long  enough  for  the analytical method used (50 µg/ml). 12 subjects and 11 subjects, after the administration of test and reference product respectively, had the area extrapolated &gt;20% of the AUC total. Ribavirin is highly soluble and is absorbed quickly with tmax  around 1 to 2 h. Ribavirin accumulates in red blood cells (60:1 compared with plasma), and extremely long elimination is attributable to the redistribution from the cellular compartment. On these grounds it can be concluded that the blood collections time (96 h) was sufficient to entirely cover the absorption phase.

AUC0-∞ Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity AUC0-t Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to t hours Cmax Maximum plasma concentration t max Time for maximum concentration * Arithmetic mean ** Standard deviation Table 4 Statistical analysis of study BP-RIB-001 (log transformed data) * 90% confidence intervals based on log transformed values. The 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric means of AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax and tmax (logtransformed data) were within the limits of 80% to 125%. For 23 cases (12 test and 11 reference curves; 32%), AUC extrapolated was higher than the normally accepted 20% of total AUC. Therefore, AUC0-∞ cannot be considered as a reliable parameter for the main analysis. However, most pharmacokinetic curves (55/72, 76.4%; 23 cases for the test and 22 for the  reference  formulation)  showed  below  limit  of  quantification  values  at  the  final  point  of measurement  (96  h)  indicating  that  both  the  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞ are  equivalent  for  most  of  the subjects. Thus, based on these results and according to the protocol, AUC0-t was taken instead of the AUC0-∞ as the main parameter. Bioequivalence  criteria  of  the  two  products  under  fasting  conditions  were  within  the  standard bioequivalence criteria 0.8-1.25. The 600mg dose (3x200mg tablet) was selected for the bioequivalence  study  on  the  grounds  that  the  600mg  represents  the  dose  used  in  clinical  practice. Ribavirin has a linear pharmacokinetics and is highly soluble; hence the 600mg dose is acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 5 Summary of study BP-RIB-004 Pharmacokinetics · Methods STUDY DESIGN Study BP-RIB-004 was an open label, randomised, two-period, single dose crossover bioequivalence study conducted in healthy, adult subjects under fed conditions. The  subjects  were  hospitalised  on  the  evening  before  each  administration.  They  remained  in  the clinical unit under permanent medical and nursing supervision for 24 hours after each administration. The subjects left the centre after withdrawal of the 24 h blood sample. All following activities were performed on an ambulatory basis. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two dosing sequences. In  the  morning  of  Day  1  of  each  study  period,  after  a  10-hour  overnight  fast,  subjects  received  a standardised  high-calorie  high-fat  breakfast.  Subjects  completed  the  meal  within  25  minutes. Investigational product was administered with a total of 200 ml of non-carbonated mineral water 30 minutes after the start of the meal. Within 2 hours after drug administration, only the water supplied with  the  drug  was  permitted.  Approximately  four  (4)  hours  after  drug  administration,  a  lunch  was served. Blood sampling for determination of ribavirin levels was done at the following times over 96 h p.a : 0 (prior to administration), 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h p.a. The washout period between the two treatments was 21 days. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  clinical  part  of  the  study,  the  bioanalytical  analyses  as  well  as  the  statistical  analyses  were performed by contract research organisations.

Statistical  analyses  were  performed  for  ribavirin  plasma  concentration  data.  Analyses  of  variance (ANOVA) were performed on the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ , and Cmax. The ANOVA model contained fixed effects for sequence, period, and treatment and a random effect for subject within sequence. Each ANOVA included a calculation of least-squares means, the difference between formulation means, and the standard error associated with this difference. Ratios of least-squares means and 90% confidence intervals for the difference between formulation least-squares  means  were  calculated  for  the  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞ ,  and  Cmax  using  lntransformed data · Results 48 out of 48 subjects completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.  Protocol  deviations  that  occurred  during  the  conduct  of  this  study  were  judged  by  the investigators not to have any significant impact on the accuracy of the study results. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the 48 subjects who were included in the analysis are presented in Table 7. Table 7 Pharmacokinetic parameters of study BP-RIB-0041 (non-transformed values) * = median (range) reported rather than geometric mean (geometric CV%). At 96 hours after post-dose, all study subjects had detectable ribavirin concentrations. Table 8 Statistical analysis of study BP-RIB-004 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The Cmax and the AUC0-t meet the standard criteria for bioequivalence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  sampling  time  in this study was  sufficiently long (96 h, all subjects  had  measurable concentrations  at  96  h)  and  therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  the  AUCt  covered  adequately  the absorption phase and AUCt equals AUC0-96h. According to the CHMP guideline on the investigation of bioavailability &amp; bioequivalence, for drugs with a long half-life, a bioequivalence can be estimated using truncated AUC, as long as the total blood collection period is justified and if the absorption process  is  complete.  It  is  well  known  that  ribavirin  has  a  very  large  volume  of  distribution  and accumulates significantly in red blood cells (60:1 compared with plasma). Due to re-distribution from the  cellular  compartment,  ribavirin  has  a  long  elimination  half-life  (80  h).  Hence,  AUC 0-t is  an appropriate parameter to conclude bioequivalence.

Safety data 27  adverse  events  were  recorded  mild  to  moderate  in  nature,  headache  was  the  most  commonly reported adverse event. Two subjects experienced adverse events after both treatments. Most adverse events (18) were evaluated as drug-related. After the most frequent adverse event (headache), further adverse events were general disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders, eye disorders and injury. Most  adverse  events  were  mild  in  intensity.  Two  severe  adverse  events  (headache  and  vomiting) occurred during treatment. No serious adverse events occurred in the study.  Conclusions Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Ribavirin BioPartners is considered bioequivalent with Rebetol.

## Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic data have been provided by the applicant. These data are not required for this particular application.

## Additional data

The  applicant  also  provided  results  of  two  further  BE  studies  with  the  US  reference  product.  In addition, one multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel group efficacy and safety study in patients with chronic hepatitis C of genotype 2 and/or 3 was also conducted with the test product. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance  PSUR The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product.  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.  Risk Management Plan The application for a generic medicinal product is based on a reference product for which no safety concern  requiring  specific risk minimisation  activities has been  identified. Therefore,  a risk management plan was not considered necessary for this generic medicinal product. However, in case additional  risk  minimisation  measures  should  be  identified  for  the  reference  product,  the  applicant will have to provide an EU RMP. · User consultation The results of a user consultation of the Package leaflet have been provided and the qualitative and qualitative evaluation was considered acceptable. Discussion on Clinical aspects Two bioequivalence studies were conducted to support this generic application. One single-dose twoperiod crossover study under fasting and one under fed condition with the test and the EU reference product were submitted. The bioequivalence study under fed conditions is considered as pivotal for this application since, according to the SmPC of the reference product Rebetol, ribavirin should be administered with food.

In  the  fed  study,  a  carryover  from  period 1 to period 2 occurred with a washout period of 21 days between the study periods. It is well known that ribavirin has a very large volume of distribution and accumulates significantly in the red blood cells (60:1 compared with plasma). Due to re-distribution from  the  cellular  compartment,  ribavirin  has  a  long  elimination  half-life  (80  h).  This  explains  the significant carryover observed in period 2.

The Applicant submitted pre-dose concentrations and percentages for Cmax in period 2 for all subjects by treatment. All subjects, except one, had ribavirin plasma concentrations in period 2 below 5% of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cmax. Statistical analysis was conducted for Cmax and AUCt using data for all subjects with pre-dose concentrations below 5% of Cmax. Bioequivalence was demonstrated. Hence, the extent of carryover observed in period 2 was within the acceptable range.

The  sampling  time  in this study was  sufficiently long (96 h, all subjects  had  measurable concentrations  at  96  h)  and  therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  the  AUCt  adequately  covered  the absorption  phase  and  that  AUCt  equals  AUC0-96h.  According  to  the  CHMP  guideline  on  the investigation of bioavailability &amp; bioequivalence, for drugs with a long half-life, a bioequivalence can be estimated using truncated AUC, as long as the total blood collection period is justified and if the absorption process is complete. It is well known that ribavirin has a very large volume of distribution and accumulates significantly in red blood cells (60:1 compared with plasma). Due to re-distribution from the cellular compartment, ribavirin has a long elimination half-life (80 h). Hence, AUC0-t is an appropriate parameter to conclude bioequivalence.

Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus decision that the benefit/risk  ratio  of  Ribavirin  BioPartners  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  C  as  part  of  a combination regimen with peginterferon alfa-2b (adults) or interferon alfa-2b (adults, children over the age of 3 and adolescents) was favourable and therefore recommended granting of the marketing authorisation.

Bioequivalence  was  demonstrated  after  a  single  dose  administration.  The  pharmacokinetics  of ribavirin  is  linear  after  single  dose  administration.  Ribavirin  accumulates  with  a  ratio  of  6:1  after multiple versus single dose administration due to very slow elimination. No saturation in elimination mechanisms  or  absorption  has  been  described,  indicating  that  the  kinetics  is  time-  and  doseindependent. Hence, the single dose design is acceptable. The bioequivalence conclusion was based on the Cmax and AUC0-96, which is appropriate. The test product in the bioequivalence study is identical to the product for which the marketing authorisation is applied for. The size of the biobatch was adequate. 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment The application contains adequate quality data. From a nonclinical perspective the applicant provided an adequate summary of the current scientific knowledge related to ribavirin, compared the impurity profiles of the test and reference products, and adequately justified the absence of an environmental risk assessment. Therefore no further non-clinical data are warranted. With regard to the clinical data, an appropriate summary of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy  and  safety  of  ribavirin  for  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  C  was  provided.  Basis  of  this application were two single dose bioequivalence studies between the test product (200 mg strength) and  the  reference  product,  one  in  fasting,  the  other  in  fed  conditions,  the  latter  being  considered pivotal.  The  overall  design  of  these  studies  as  well  as  the  bioanalytical  methods  are  considered adequate.  The  statistical  analysis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data  from  these  studies  showed  that  the target  parameters  AUC0-96  h  and  Cmax  were  within  the  acceptance  limits  of  0.8-1.25.  Therefore, bioequivalence has been shown. Overall, a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. Recommendation Medicinal product no longer authorised
