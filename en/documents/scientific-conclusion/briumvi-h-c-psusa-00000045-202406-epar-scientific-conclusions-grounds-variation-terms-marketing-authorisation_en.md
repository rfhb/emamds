## Scientific conclusions

Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  ublituximab,  the  scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In  view  of  available  data  on  encephalitis/meningitis/meningoencephalitis  from  clinical  trial(s)  and spontaneous reports including in seven cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between ublituximab and encephalitis/meningitis/meningoencephalitis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing ublituximab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ublituximab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ublituximab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
