## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The applicant submitted a risk management plan. The CHMP considered that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. However, the applicant is asked to provide an updated Risk Management Plan taken into account the comments raised during the assessment, at the time of the first PSUR.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Since this application is an informed consent of the FOSAVANCE application, the CHMP considered that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  ADROVANCE  (70  mg  alendronic  acid  as  alendronate  sodium trihydrate and  /70 micrograms colecalciferol) tablet given once weekly was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D insufficiency. ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.'
