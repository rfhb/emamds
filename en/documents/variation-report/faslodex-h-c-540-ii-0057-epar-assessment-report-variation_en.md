## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, AstraZeneca UK Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 2 November 2016 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include the treatment of postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior endocrine therapy for Faslodex. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated in order to update the safety and pharmacodynamics information. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce clarifications in the SmPC and Annex II.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Not applicable.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 22 November 2012 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/868022/2011). The Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.

## Disease or condition

Breast  cancer  is  the  most  common  type  of  cancer  and  a  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  among women in the US and Europe. Approximately 246,660 new cases of breast cancer are predicted this year in the US (14.6% of all new cancers) and it is estimated that the disease will contribute to 40,450 deaths (ACS 2016). In Europe 92,300 deaths due to breast cancer are predicted for 2016 (Malvezzi et al 2016).

Although  treatable,  metastatic  breast  cancer  remains  an  incurable  disease  with  a  median  overall survival of 2-3 years and a 5-year survival of only 25% (ESMO Advanced Breast Cancer Guideline).

## Management

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment of breast cancer is determined by the extent of the disease. Early or localized breast cancer is  treated  by  a  combination  of  surgery  and  radiotherapy.  Adjuvant  systemic  therapy,  consisting  of chemotherapy  and/or  endocrine  therapy,  in  tumours  deemed  hormone  responsive,  can  prolong  the disease-free interval and improve overall survival. However, approximately 30% to 40% of patients with early breast cancer will ultimately relapse, with either local recurrence or distant metastases, and require further systemic treatment for advanced disease.

Current treatment guidelines emphasise the preferential use of endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, and recommend that chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance (Cardoso et al 2014). The choice of first-line endocrine therapy for HR+ advanced breast cancer depends on the type and length of therapy received in the adjuvant setting (if any). The endocrine therapy options include, but are not limited to, selective  estrogen  receptor  modulators  (SERM;  e.g.  tamoxifen),  estrogen  receptor  antagonists  (e.g. fulvestrant),  selective  non-steroidal  aromatase  inhibitors  (NSAI;  e.g.  anastrozole  and  letrozole)  and steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane). These agents may be given in first, second or later lines  of  therapy  for  advanced  breast  cancer  (ESMO  Guideline;  NCCN  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  in Oncology). Fulvestrant is currently authorised for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  in  postmenopausal  women  with  disease  relapse  on  or  after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen therapy (see Faslodex SmPC).

Clinical practice guidelines also refer to palbociclib, a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, that has recently been approved as an add-on to endocrine therapy (see Ibrance SmPC). Combination of exemestane with everolimus is also an option in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease  after  recurrence  or  progression  following  a  non-steroidal  aromatase  inhibitor  (see  Afinitor SmPC).

Primary or acquired resistance to initial endocrine therapy ultimately results in disease progression in a large proportion of breast cancers. To overcome this initial resistance, sequential endocrine therapies are used in the advanced disease setting (NCCN 2016; Rugo et al 2016; Cardoso et al 2014).

## About the product

Fulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. Fulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. The mechanism of action is associated with downregulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. Clinical studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant significantly downregulates ER protein in ER positive tumours compared with placebo. There was also a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic estrogen agonist effects.

Faslodex  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  women  with  estrogen  receptor  positive, locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  for  disease  relapse  on  or  after  adjuvant  anti-estrogen therapy, or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen.

The recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given two weeks after the initial dose.

## Type of application and aspects on development

The applied indication was (new text underlined):

'Faslodex is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women:

- not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- for with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen endocrine therapy, or disease progression on endocrine therapy with an anti-estrogen.'

The application for the new indication (endocrine naïve patients) is based on data from two studies:

- a  supportive  Phase  2  study  (Study  D6995C00006):  open-label  study  of  fulvestrant  500  mg versus  anastrozole  1  mg  in  205  women  with  advanced  disease  previously  untreated  with endocrine therapy or at least a year after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy (FIRST)
- a pivotal Phase 3 study (Study D699BC00001): Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 462 women with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously been treated with any hormonal therapy (FALCON)

Endocrine therapy naïve patients include those who have progressed after the management of early disease that did not include adjuvant endocrine therapy, or patients who may present for the first time with advanced disease.

The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 22 November 2012 on clinical aspects (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/868022/2011) concerning the study population, double-blind design and PFS as primary endpoint.

The proposal to modify 'anti-estrogen' to 'endocrine' in the second line indication was based on a justification based on changes in treatment guidelines and clinical practice, results from the China CONFIRM study, the final overall survival (OS) analysis of the CONFIRM study and published literature, to supplement existing clinical data from CONFIRM, FINDER1 and FINDER2 in patients who have progressed following an AI.

The recommended indication is:

Faslodex is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women (new text underlined):

- not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or
- for with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy, or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen therapy.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application apart from the ERA (see section 2.2.1), which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An updated ERA was provided with this procedure.

As an oestrogen receptor antagonist, the mechanism of action of fulvestrant has potential to affect reproduction in aquatic species. In addition, the octanol:water partition coefficient (Log Pow) is &gt;4.5. Therefore, although the refined PECsurface water (0.00046 μg/L) is well below the Phase I action limit of 0.01 μg/L, a tailored Phase II assessment has been performed to address the potential mode of action and bioaccumulation concerns.

In the Tier A assessment the toxicity of fulvestrant to aquatic and groundwater species as well as micro-organisms were assessed. The PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water and groundwater were below 1 and for microorganisms below 0.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fulvestrant cannot be considered readily biodegradable, is poorly water soluble and has been shown to adsorb to physical surfaces. The potential for exposure of the terrestrial environment, via sludge application to land, could not be excluded. However, the STP simulation test showed that fulvestrant is expected to fully degrade and is unlikely to be present in the sewage sludge applied to land. Therefore, an assessment of the degradation rate in soil is not necessary as exposure of the terrestrial environment is considered to be negligible, and a worst case risk assessment assuming no degradation identified no terrestrial risks.

In the aquatic environment, fulvestrant, and its degradation products, are anticipated to partition into aquatic sediments and undergo significant degradation. As such fulvestrant is not anticipated to be persistent.

In Tier B, the toxicity of fulvestrant to sediment dwelling and terrestrial species was assessed. The PEC/PNEC ratios for sediment and the terrestrial environment were below 1. The octanol-water partition coefficient, Log Pow, is &gt; 4.5, however the measured assessment of bioaccumulation potential in fish, BCF &lt;357, demonstrates that fulvestrant is not bioaccumulative.

In conclusion, the risk to the environment as a consequence of the use of fulvestrant is low.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data has been submitted with this application which is considered acceptable. The MAH has submitted an ERA and it was considered acceptable. Based on the data submitted in this application, the new indication may lead to an increase in the environmental exposure of fulvestrant. However, considering the available ERA data submitted, fulvestrant is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The risk to the environment as a consequence of the intended new use of fulvestrant is low. No subsequent changes to the SmPC have been proposed.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main study

## Phase III Study D699BC00001 (FALCON)

## Methods

Study FALCON was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre, phase III study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of fulvestrant 500 mg with anastrozole 1 mg as hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously been treated with any hormonal therapy.

## Study participants

The  study  was  performed  at  175  centres  in  20  countries:  Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,  China,  Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and United States (US).

## Treatments

Fulvestrant 500 mg, administered as two intramuscular injections, on Days 0, 14 (±3), 28 (±3) and every 28 (±3 days) thereafter.

Anastrozole 1 mg, administered orally as a single tablet, once daily

Treatment continued until objective disease progression unless any of the criteria for treatment discontinuation were met first.

In order to support the double-blind, double-dummy design of this trial, each patient received both study treatments, 1 being placebo:

· Patients randomised to receive fulvestrant also received placebo to match the anastrozole schedule (tablets, once daily)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Patients randomised to receive anastrozole also received placebo to match the fulvestrant schedule (injections on Days 0, 14 [±3], 28 [±3] and every 28 [±3] days thereafter).

## Objectives

## Primary:

To demonstrate the superior progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.

## Secondary:

- To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.
- To compare the objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and the expected duration of response (EDoR) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.
- To compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR), the duration of clinical benefit (DoCB) and the expected duration of clinical benefit (EDoCB) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.
- To compare the quality of life (QoL) of patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg versus patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.
- To compare the safety and tolerability of fulvestrant 500 mg treatment versus that of anastrozole 1 mg treatment.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint: Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomisation until objective disease progression (assessed locally by each investigator, as defined by RECIST 1.1), surgery or radiotherapy to manage worsening of disease, or death by any cause in the absence of progression.

Key secondary endpoint: Overall Survival (OS) defined as Time from randomisation until death by any cause; Overall response rate (ORR) defined as the percentage of subjects with an objective response (CR or PR) with measurable disease during the study.

Other secondary endpoints (not protected for multiplicity): Duration of response, clinical benefit rate (CBR= CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks), duration of clinical benefit (DoCB); expected duration of response (EDoR), expected duration of clinical benefit (EDoCB), Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL).

## Sample size

Approximately 450 eligible women were planned to be randomised 1:1 to fulvestrant (N=225) or anastrozole (N=225) in this study. The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint of PFS, which was to be analysed when approximately 306 PFS events had occurred. If the true PFS hazard ratio (HR) for the comparison of fulvestrant vs. anastrozole was 0.69 (likely to correspond to a 45% prolongation of PFS) the study had 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference for PFS with a one-sided type 1 error of 2.5% (two-sided 5%). Assuming the median PFS on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

anastrozole is 13 months, a PFS HR of 0.69 may translate to a median PFS of 18.8 months on fulvestrant. The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant is PFS HR=0.80 (which translates to approximately a 3.3-month median difference, assuming proportional hazards and an exponential distribution).

## Randomisation

Patients were randomised strictly sequentially, as patients were eligible for randomisation, to fulvestrant or anastrozole using a randomisation ratio 1:1.

Patients were stratified at randomisation based on whether they have:

1. locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
2. received prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer or not
3. measurable or non-measurable disease.

## Blinding (masking)

Double-blind, double-dummy.

## Statistical methods

Analysis sets defined were Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Safety analysis set. Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT analysis set, which included all randomised patients and compared the treatment groups on the basis of randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of randomised treatment, including patients who received only placebo (and no active treatment).

The overall one-sided type I error rate used was 2.5% (two-sided 5%). Only if the primary endpoint (PFS) is significant, the key secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) were to be tested. A multiple testing procedure to strongly control type-I error at the overall alpha level was implemented, and used to test the key secondary endpoints with an alpha-exhaustive recycling strategy (Burman et al 2009). With this approach, the endpoints of OS and ORR are tested in a pre-defined order using a weighted proportion of alpha (such that initially α =2% is allocated to OS, and α = 0.5% is allocated to ORR) and alpha that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is recycled to the secondary endpoint not yet rejected. Other secondary endpoints were not included in the multiple testing procedure.

PFS and ORR were to be analysed at one time-point only, when approximately 306 progression events have occurred. The date of data cut-off was 11 April 2016.

An interim analysis of OS was conducted at the same time as the primary analysis of PFS. A more mature OS analysis was planned at a later time-point when it is estimated that 50% of patients will have died. After this point, the patient's treatment will be unblinded. The false positive rate will be controlled amongst the two OS analyses by using the Lan DeMets (Lan and DeMets 1983) spending function that approximates an O'Brien Fleming approach. It was estimated in the sample size calculation that, in case that 0.7 of the full death information would be available (i.e., 159/225 deaths) at the time of the interim OS analysis, the 1-sided significance level to be applied for the OS interim analysis would be 0.0054. If the interim OS is statistically significant, then ORR will be assessed using

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

α =0.025 (i.e., the full 2% of alpha used in the OS analysis will be recycled to ORR). If the interim OS is not statistically significant, then ORR will be assessed using α =0.005.

Methods of analysis of the primary endpoint (PFS) and the key secondary endpoints (OS and ORR) are presented in the table below.

| Progression free survival (PFS) | Stratified log-rank test (Primary analysis) with factors for prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (yes/no) and measurable disease at baseline (yes/no) was used to analyze the effect of treatment with fulvestrant 500 mg vs. anastrozole 1 mg. Additional stratification factor (i.e. prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease) was pre-planned to be included in the analysis, but removed due to very low patient numbers (including zero cell) in some of the individual strata. Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS and time to censoring were presented by treatment group. Sensitivity analyses Re-run of the primary analysis on the RECIST1.1 defined disease progression or death from any cause. Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment and baseline prognostic covariates including all three randomization stratification factors, receptor status, use of bisphosphonates/denosumab as concomitant medication at baseline, geographic region, prior systemic oestrogen containing hormone replacement therapy, and visceral disease. Re-run of the primary analysis based on the midpoints of the time between progression detected and the previous visit. Re-run of the primary analysis whereby patients are censored at the time they discontinue treatment and/or receive subsequent therapies prior to disease progression. Subgroup analysis was performed for subgroups defined by the covariates, using an unstratified log-rank test including randomized treatment as the only factor. A global interaction test was performed to test if overall the treatment benefit was consistent across the covariates. This was done by fitting a Cox model with treatment and the covariates, and comparing that (at the 10% level) with the model with treatment, the covariates and the factor-by-covariate interactions. The subgroups, which are also stratification factors, are defined using relevant data in the database, and not the strata according to IVRS. |

## Recruitment

The first patient enrolled in the study on 17 October 2012 and the last patient enrolled on 11 July 2014.

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol Amendment

There was 1 protocol amendment to the original CSP with minor changes that was made at the time recruitment started.

Changes to planned analyses:

- Pre-unblinding changes to the planned analyses, as described in the CSP and/or in the original SAP (Edition 1, dated 28 June 2012), were as follows:
- Inclusion  of  more  geographic  regions  for  subgroup  analysis  of  PFS  and  more  levels  of geographic region in the covariate used for the Cox regression sensitivity analysis of PFS.
- Inclusion of visceral disease (yes/no) for subgroup analysis of PFS and as a covariate used for the Cox regression sensitivity analysis of PFS.
- Expanded the bisphosphonate use at baseline subgroup to include denosumab use.
- Inclusion of subgroup analysis and Cox regression sensitivity analysis for OS.
- Adjustment to the analysis method for PFS by subgroup to an unstratified log-rank test.
- Inclusion of rules for the removal of 1 stratification factor from the analysis models for log-rank and logistic regression due to small sub-strata.
- Removal of the inferential statistical analysis for other significant AEs of interest (pre-specified AEs).

There was 1 post-unblinding change to the planned analyses, which was as follows:

- Inclusion of an additional sensitivity analysis of PFS, which fitted stratification factors derived from the eCRF data (rather than the IVRS system).

Post-hoc sensitivity analyses performed by:

- fitting stratification factors derived from electronic case report form data (rather than on the IVRS system), in order to investigate any effect of mis-stratification on the primary endpoint of the study, and
- including all 3 randomisation stratification factors (i.e., adding locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer) in the primary statistical model.

In addition, analyses have been performed to explore if any potential bias was introduced by censoring that is both related to outcome and imbalanced between the treatment arms. Multiple imputation was performed using a Cox model to impute event times in subjects who were censored early (i.e., at more than 12 weeks before the data cut-off for the primary analysis). Imputations were performed in such way that:

- the hazard for progression increases after censoring in both arms, suggesting the censoring was related to outcome and was not at random, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- the hazard increases following censoring in the fulvestrant arm only.

## Protocol deviations

A larger proportion of patients in the fulvestrant arm had at least 1 important protocol deviation compared with the anastrozole arm (45.2% vs 33.6%).

A higher proportions of patients in the fulvestrant arm than in the anastrozole arm were randomised using an incorrect stratification factor (i.e., mis-stratification in 20.0% vs 16.8% of patients) and RECIST timing (14.8% vs 9.5% of patients), respectively.

Mis-stratification was driven by the prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease stratum: overall, 47 (10.2%) patients were assigned as having received prior chemotherapy of these, the vast majority (45) were actually recorded as having prior chemotherapy for early disease (neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant) on the eCRF.  A further 4 (0.9%) patients were assigned as having received no prior chemotherapy on the IVRS system, but reported as having received prior chemotherapy on the eCRF.

Although patients were mis-stratified slightly more frequently in the fulvestrant arm (20.0%) relative to the anastrozole arm (16.8%), the incidence of discordance between those data captured on the IVRS system at randomisation and those captured on the eCRF was similar in both treatment arms across all 3 stratification factors.

## Baseline data

Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 36-90) (see Table 5).

The analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test with factors for prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (yes or no) and measurable disease at baseline (yes or no).

The overall type-I error rate was 2.5% (1-sided).  A 1-sided 2.5% significance level can also be considered equivalent to a 2-sided 5% significance level (where the treatment effect is in favour of fulvestrant).  In order to aid interpretation of results, 2-sided p-values are used to describe statistical significance.

## Secondary endpoints

## Overall survival

At the time of the PFS analysis 142 deaths were reported (i.e., 142/231 = 0.6147 of the full death information); therefore, the 1-sided significance level applied for the interim OS analysis was 0.301%.

## Duration of Response

Median DoR was longer in the fulvestrant arm (20.0 months; 25th percentile [Q25] 10.6 months; 75th percentile [Q75] not calculable) compared with the anastrozole arm (13.2 months [Q25, Q75: 8.3, 24.7 months]).

## Health Related Quality of Life

Compliance with patient-reported outcomes instruments (FACT-B) was high while on treatment (approximately 85% to 95% over time, in the study overall) and was broadly comparable between treatment arms.  However, compliance post treatment (with or without progression) was poor.

Mean (standard deviation [SDev]) values for FACT-B total score were high and comparable between the fulvestrant and anastrozole treatment arms at baseline (102.2 [16.93] and 101.1 [16.84], respectively).  Mean FACT-B total score over time was similar in both treatment arms and remained high while on treatment.

A Kaplan-Meier analysis of the time to deterioration in FACT-B total score is presented below.

## Supportive study

## Phase II Study D6995C00006 (FIRST)

## Methods

This was a randomised, Open-Label, Parallel-Group, Multi-centre, Phase II Study to Compare the Efficacy and Tolerability of Fulvestrant 500 mg with Anastrozole 1 mg as First Line Hormonal Treatment for Postmenopausal Women with Hormone Receptor Positive Advanced Breast Cancer.

## Study participants

This study was conducted at 62 centres in 9 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Poland, Spain, UK, and the USA). The first patient was enrolled on 06 February 2006 and the last on 11 July 2007. The data cut-off date for primary analyses was 10 January 2008. After the data cut-off (DCO) for the primary analysis, all remaining patients, regardless of whether they were still receiving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomised treatment, were to enter the follow-up phase and were to be followed as per standard clinical practice.

## The main inclusion criteria for the study were following:

- Written informed consent had to be obtained and documented.
- Histological/cytological confirmation of breast cancer.
- Documented  positive  hormone  receptor  status  (ER+ve  and/or  PgR+ve)  of  primary  or metastatic tumour tissue, according to the local laboratory parameters.
- Patients  with  metastatic  or  locally  advanced  disease  not  amenable  to  therapy  with  curative intent:
- o Who  had  never  had  hormonal  treatment  for  loco-regionally  advanced  or  metastatic disease and
- o For patients who had received previous adjuvant or neo-adjuvant hormonal treatment, this must have been completed more than 12 months prior to randomisation. Adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment may have included more than one hormonal agent.
- Patients fulfilling one of the following criteria:
- o the presence of measurable disease as per RECIST, defined as at least one lesion that could  be  accurately  measured  in  at  least  one  dimension  (longest  diameter  to  be recorded)  as ≥ 20  mm  with  conventional  techniques  or  as ≥ 10  mm  with  spiral computed tomography (CT) scan.
- o In the absence of measurable disease (by RECIST), the presence of at least one bone lesion with a lytic component, which had not been previously irradiated.
- Women defined as postmenopausal according to 1 or more of the following:
- o aged ≥ 60 years
- o age ≥ 45 years with amenorrhoea for at least 12 months with an intact uterus
- o having undergone a bilateral oophorectomy
- o follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol levels in the postmenopausal range, utilising ranges from the local laboratory facility.
- World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status 0, 1 or 2

## The main exclusion criteria for the study were following:

- The  presence  of  life-threatening  metastatic  visceral  disease,  defined  as  extensive  hepatic involvement,  any  degree  of  brain  or  leptomeningeal  involvement  (past  or  present),  or symptomatic  pulmonary  lymphangitic  spread.  Patients  with  discrete  pulmonary  parenchymal metastases were eligible, provided their respiratory function was not significantly compromised as a result of disease.
- Previous systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer.
- Treatment with a non-approved or experimental drug within 4 weeks before randomisation.
- Current  or  prior  malignancy  within  the  previous  3  years  (other  than  breast  cancer  or adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in-situ carcinoma of the cervix).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Significantly altered laboratory values within 3 weeks of randomisation:
- o platelets &lt;100 x 10 9 / L:
- o total  bilirubin  &gt;1.5  x  ULN  (Upper  Limit  of  Normal  Range,  patients  with  confirmed Gilbert's syndrome were still eligible be included in the study), or
- o ALT or AST &gt;2.5 x ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases or &gt;5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases.
- History of:
- o bleeding  diathesis  ( i.e. ,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  [DIC],  clotting  factor deficiency), or
- o long-term anticoagulant therapy.
- History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of fulvestrant, AIs or castor oil.
- Any severe concomitant condition which made it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the trial protocol, e.g. , uncontrolled cardiac disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

## Treatment

Fulvestrant (FASLODEX) 500 mg was administered as two 5 ml intramuscular injections on Days 0, 14 (±3), 28 (±3) and every 28 (±3) days thereafter with time windows extending to ±7 days after 24 weeks.

Anastrozole (ARIMIDEX) 1 mg was administered orally as a single daily tablet.

Treatment continued until disease progression as per RECIST, unless any of the criteria for treatment discontinuation were met first.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the CBR in patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg with the CBR in patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary end-point was clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the % of patients in the Full analysis set with clinical benefit, where clinical benefit is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) ≥ 24 weeks, defined by modified RECIST.

Secondary  endpoints  included  overall  response  rate  (ORR),  Time  to  progression  (TTP),  Duration  of Response (DoR), Duration of clinical benefit DoCB, and OS.

PFS was in this study called TTP, but all events of death, irrespective of causality, were counted as events. 'TTP' according to the study definition, is therefore called PFS.

## Sample size

The clinical benefit rate for anastrozole in hormone receptor positive patients is estimated as 60% from previous  studies  of  anastrozole  in  the  current  patient  population.  One-hundred  randomised  patients per treatment group were required to give 80% power to rule out an absolute deficiency of 20% in clinical  benefit  rate  for  fulvestrant  500  mg; i.e. ,  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  to  exclude  a  20% deficiency.

The data cut-off for primary analysis was 10 January 2008.

Time to death is defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause.Patients who are not known to have died (including those who have been lost to follow-up with no information on survival) have been night-censored at the date last known alive. For patients who have a last contact date after the data cut-off, their date last known to be alive has been right-censored at the date of data cut-off.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The application for  the  new  indication  (endocrine  naïve  patients)  is  based on  data  from  one  pivotal study (FALCON) and one supportive study (FIRST).

The pivotal study FALCON was a double blind study conducted in the target population for the proposed new indication and the overall design is considered adequate. The chosen randomisation stratification factors are considered to be important prognostic covariates. The statistical methods described are endorsed. Exclusion of the stratification factor 'prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease' was justified by very low patient numbers (including zero cell) in some of the individual strata.

Important protocol deviations were common, but mis-stratification did not result in imbalances of importance. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the stratification factors recorded on the eCRF rather than on the IVRS system and showed an HR for PFS consistent with the primary endpoint. No information is available on the root cause of the errors in the stratification procedure which affected as many as 85 subjects. Nevertheless, these deviations are considered unlikely to affect the robustness of the study.

With regards to baseline characteristics in study FALCON, about 30% of patients had received no prior endocrine therapy despite being diagnosed &gt;1 year prior to study enrolment which is unexpected. Otherwise, baseline characteristics essentially look as expected. There were some differences noted with regards to baseline demographic and tumour characteristics. Notably, a larger proportion of patients in the fulvestrant arm than in the anastrozole arm had visceral disease (58.7% vs. 51.3%). A slightly larger proportion of patients in the fulvestrant arm had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy compared with the anastrozole arm (15.2% and 11.6%, respectively). These small differences are not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

meaningful and baseline and tumour characteristics are considered balanced between the two treatment arms.

Although the median time from completion of final chemotherapy to randomisation was longer in the fulvestrant arm (12.8 months; range: 1 to 283 months) than in the anastrozole arm (5.7 months; range: 1 to 207 months), other summary statistics were broadly comparable. Furthermore, a box and whisker plot of time from completion of chemotherapy to randomisation showed no clear evidence that the patients receiving chemotherapy on the fulvestrant 500 mg arm completed earlier than those on the anastrozole 1 mg arm (data not shown). Therefore these imbalances might be due to chance.

Study FIRST was an open label, anastrozole comparative exploratory study. The study was conducted open-label  with  investigator  assessed  PFS  complemented  with  independent  review.  HER2  positive patients could be enrolled (20%) and patients could have received (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy (25%). Approximately 27% of patients in the fulvestrant arm and 22% in the anastrozole arm had received  prior  'endocrine therapy'  which  was  completed  at  least 12  months prior  to  randomization, i.e.,  were  not  'endocrine  naïve'  patients.  Nearly  all  of  them  had  received  tamoxifen  (28  patients  in fulvestrant arm and 22 patients in anastrozole arm) and one subject in each arm had received prior anastrozole.

This phase II study is considered to provide reasonably strong supportive evidence to FALCON for the applied first line indication. At the time of the primary data cut-off, 36% of patients had progressed. A follow-up analysis was performed when approximately 75% of patients had failed therapy to provide a more complete assessment. The results of secondary analysis for TTP adjusted for baseline covariates were consistent with the main unadjusted analysis of TTP. This suggested that the imbalance between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with visceral disease at baseline in FIRST did not impact the efficacy findings.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In study FALCON, more progression events occurred in the anastrozole arm (166 patients [71.6%]) than in the fulvestrant arm (143 patients [62.2%], 2-sided p=0.0486). At an event rate of 60% to 70%, the PFS HR of 0.797 (95% CI 0.637 to 0.999) is likely to be stable. The median difference, 3 months, appears to reflect the HR and is considered non-trivial. Fulvestrant was statistically borderline superior to anastrozole.

A number of sensitivity analyses were undertaken, all showing borderline 'positive/negative significance', the 'worst' being p=0.06 (using stratification derived from CRF), the 'best' a Cox proportional hazard being p=0.03. The results of the sensitivity analyses support the primary PFS result and its robustness.

Overall, the results indicate a more favourable outcome with fulvestrant compared to anastrozole in ER+, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine therapy, and support the currently applied indication. Consistent results were observed across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. Many of the subgroups analysed were small in size and consequently resulted in wide confidence intervals. However, in patients with visceral disease at baseline, the benefit of fulvestrant over anastrozole was not evident, with median PFS 13.8 months vs. 15.9 months (HR 0.993). The subgroup results have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Approximately 10% of the patients did not have complete data for the primary endpoint of PFS. A greater proportion of patients were censored for progression at &gt;12 weeks before data cut-off in the fulvestrant arm compared with the anastrozole arm (27 [11.7%] patients vs. 20 [8.6%] patients, respectively). The MAH performed a range of analyses to explore the sensitivity of results to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

standard non-informative censoring assumption underlying time to event analyses. Baseline characteristics were compared between early and late censored patients and patients who had censoring assumption and assess the impact on treatment effect estimates. Overall, it is considered unlikely that the reasons for early censoring differ between the arms, resulting in a biased PFS result.

In support of the extension of the existing second line indication to AI-resistant patients (i.e. from relapse or progression on anti-oestrogen therapy to relapse or progression on endocrine therapy), the MAH submitted a justification based on changes in treatment guidelines and clinical practice, results from the China CONFIRM study, the final overall survival (OS) analysis of the CONFIRM study and published literature, to supplement existing clinical data from CONFIRM, FINDER1 and FINDER2 in been assessed previously in attempt to extend the current indication to AI-resistant patients in 2010. In this type II variation in 2010 (EMEA/H/C/540/II/0018), based on the CONFIRM study, the MAH sought for extension of the indication for disease relapse or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. At the time the CHMP concluded that a favourable benefit - risk balance had not been convincingly demonstrated for fulvestrant 500 mg in patients resistant to aromatase inhibitors. As part of the current application, the MAH has not provided any new data in with an aromatase inhibitor. Neither the FALCON nor the FIRST studies include clinical data on these patients. Overall, the level of evidence available regarding the efficacy of fulvestrant in aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistant postmenopausal ER+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients is not considered sufficient to support and extension of the second line indication.

progressed, and modelling was conducted to impute progression times which relax the non-informative In terms of ORR and CBR, rather similar results to anastrozole were observed between fulvestrant and anastrozole. Due to the similarity in ORR, duration of response is considered informative (Median DOR 20 months and 13.2 months in the fulvestrant arm and anastrozole arm respectively). These observations i.e. similar ORR and difference in PFS are compatible with delayed resistance development and is mechanistically plausible as fulvestrant has been reported to be less affected by activating ER mutations (Fribbens et al 2016; Spoerke et al 2016; Toy et al 2016), but serum samples were not collected on study for analyses of activating ER mutations. OS results are immature. Regarding QoL data, data after progression are sparse, reducing the possibility to detect symptomatic differences related to progression, but in principle the curves mimic PFS curves. The HR for time to deterioration favoured Faslodex (0.84, p=0.16 not protected from multiplicity). Overall, available FACT-B data do not indicate any differences in tolerability between fulvestrant and anastrozole. Results from the FALCON study are supported by the results of study FIRST which met its primary noninferiority objective in terms of Clinical Benefit response (CBR). The primary efficacy results of clinical benefit ratio (CBR) from the FAS and PP populations supported the non-inferiority of fulvestrant compared to anastrozole in treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer. The results (CBR of 72.5% in fulvestrant group vs 67% in the anastrozole group) are considered supportive for the applied indication. After exclusion of patients that were endocrine therapy naïve, the results remained stable and compatible with statistical borderline superiority to anastrozole in terms of PFS and OS. The results in the subgroup of FIRST constructed in order to reflect the target population in FALCON were similar to the ITT population, but more favourable compared with FALCON. In the subgroup analysis of OS, a tendency towards fulvestrant having greater benefit in patients without visceral disease vs. those with visceral disease was observed, which is in line with observations in the FALCON study. patients who have progressed following an AI. Out of the trials, CONFIRM, FINDER1 and FINDER2 have postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer for disease relapse on or after adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, or disease progression on therapy

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Faslodex showed an improvement in PFS and duration of response as compared to anastrazole in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (confirmed by histology), who had not previously been treated with any hormonal therapy. The results from the exploratory phase II FIRST study are consistent with the results from the Phase III FALCON study and support the new first line indication. The SmPC has been updated in section 5.1 with efficacy data in the first line indication.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Faslodex (fulvestrant) was approved in EU in 2004 for the treatment of breast cancer after failure on anti-oestrogen therapy. Apart from anti-oestrogen effects, the safety profile includes injection site reaction, hepatic events, rash and hypersensitivity reactions.

## Patient exposure

FALCON included safety data from 228 patients treated with fulvestrant 500 mg (median exposure: 14.8 months) and 232 patients treated with anastrozole 1 mg (median exposure: 13.8 months).  In addition to this, 101 patients were treated with fulvestrant 500 mg in FIRST (median exposure at the primary data cut-off: 9.2 months).

As of 25 April 2016, it is estimated that &gt;3500 subjects have been exposed to fulvestrant in clinical trials.  In the post-marketing setting there are 344,450 patient years of exposure for the 250 mg dose and 211,462 patient years for the 500 mg dose globally.

In the FALCON study, the number of patients who reported an adverse reaction of joint and musculoskeletal pain was 65 (31.2%) and 48 (24.1%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, respectively. Of the 65 patients in the Faslodex arm, 40% (26/65) of patients reported joint and musculoskeletal pain within the first month of treatment, and 66.2% (43/65) of patients within the first 3 months of treatment. No patients reported events that were CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 or that required a dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinued treatment due to these adverse reactions.

## Overdose

## Adverse drug reactions

The frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were calculated based on the Faslodex 500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of studies that compared Faslodex 500 mg with Faslodex 250 mg [CONFIRM (Study D6997C00002), FINDER 1 (Study D6997C00004), FINDER 2 (Study D6997C00006), and NEWEST (Study D6997C00003) studies], or from FALCON (Study D699BC00001) alone that compared Faslodex 500 mg with anastrozole 1 mg. Where frequencies differ between the pooled safety analysis and FALCON, the highest frequency is presented. The frequencies in the following table were based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator assessment of causality.

a  The event was not observed in major clinical studies (CONFIRM, FINDER 1, FINDER 2, NEWEST). The frequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate. This is calculated as 3/560 (where 560 is the number of patients in the major clinical studies), which equates to a frequency category of 'uncommon'.

b  The event was not observed in FALCON, incidence is therefore presented for pooled safety analyses of major clinical studies that compared FASLODEX 500mg with FASLODEX 250mg (CONFIRM, FINDER 1, FINDER 2, NEWEST).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety of fulvestrant in clinical use has been investigated in clinical trials as well as in the postmarketing experience (344450 patient years of fulvestrant 250 mg/month and 211462 patient years of fulvestrant 500 mg/month exposure). The data submitted includes a further 281 + 77 patient years of fulvestrant 500 mg/month exposure.

The incidence of AEs was not significantly different between the two treatment arms in both studies. In the FALCON study there were more patients with treatment related AEs in the fulvestrant arm compared to the anastrozole arm (39.9% [91/228] vs. 32.8% [76/232], respectively). In the FIRST study there were more patients reporting an AE of CTC Grade 3 or higher in the fulvestrant arm compared to the anastrozole arm (17.8% [18/101] vs. 10.7% [11/103], respectively).

In FIRST study, bone pain, nausea, constipation, vomiting, and hypertension were more common in patients  receiving  fulvestrant  while  there  were  more  cases  of  hot  flushes  and  myalgia  in  the anastrozole group.

There were more cases of back pain, myalgia, and pain in extremity in patients receiving fulvestrant in FALCON  while  hypertension  and  anaemia  were  reported  more  frequently  from  patients  taking anastrozole. In FIRST study hypertension was more common in the fulvestrant group and myalgia in the anastrozole group.

Whether there is an increase in arthralgia and related events or not related to fulvestrant was discussed in the past. At the time partly conflicting data led to these events not being categorised as adverse reaction. It is well known that anastrozole is associated with these events and the numerical increase makes it clear that it should be reflected in the SmPC also for fulvestrant. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to include information about joint and musculoskeletal pain.

Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  were  more  common  in  the  fulvestrant  group  compared  to anastrozole group. The difference was driven mainly by rash, alopecia, dry skin, and erythema.

Only single cases of death not caused by progression of breast cancer were reported for patients receiving either fulvestrant or anastrozole. Overall, mortality rate was lower in the fulvestrant group compared to anastrozole group (29.4% vs. 32.3% at the DLP of FALCON).

Serious adverse events involving patients in the fulvestrant group are known from earlier clinical use and not unexpected.

Haematological abnormalities as well as hepatic enzyme and bilirubin elevations were reported at similar rates from both treatment arms in FALCON. Anaemia was more common in patients taking anastrozole. No changes to the SmPC are required with regards to the laboratory parameter abnormalities.

More patients discontinued fulvestrant. Nevertheless discontinuation rates were observed at an acceptable level.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cases of overdose reported in patients taking FASLODEX was identified as a subject for review while analysing FALCON data (one case of overdose was reported, not associated with any other AEs). AstraZeneca global database retrieved 48 cases of overdose in which majority of events were inconsistent with the signal being evaluated, had limited information and had no adverse event associated with it. Section 4.9 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that there are isolated reports of overdose with Faslodex in humans. If overdose occurs, symptomatic supportive treatment is recommended.

The RMP is considered adequate and no new safety concerns were included. However missing information 'Use during pregnancy and lactation' and 'Use in women of childbearing potential' were merged into 'Reprotoxicity (fertility, pregnancy and lactation)' and upgraded to important potential risk based on available data.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The overall safety has remained unchanged and there were no new safety signals raised from the two studies presented. Joint and musculoskeletal pain are relatively well known adverse drug reactions of anti-oestrogen therapy and the SmPC has been updated to reflect these. The frequency category of several adverse drug reactions has also been updated in line with the incidence reported in the pooled dataset and FALCON study (see SmPC section 4.8).

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8, 4.9, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Additional minor changes were made to sections 4.4, 5.2 and 5.3. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The disease treated is estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine therapy.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Current treatment guidelines emphasise the preferential use of endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, and recommend that chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance (Cardoso et al 2014).

The choice of first-line endocrine therapy for HR+ advanced breast cancer depends on the type and length of therapy received in the adjuvant setting (if any). The endocrine therapy options include, but are not limited to, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM; e.g. tamoxifen), estrogen receptor antagonists (e.g. fulvestrant), selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI; e.g. anastrozole and letrozole) and steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane) (ESMO Guideline; NCCN Breast Cancer, Version 2.2017). These agents may be given in first, second or later lines of therapy for advanced breast cancer (ESMO Guideline; NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology). Fulvestrant is currently authorised for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen therapy. Combination therapies with other agents are also therapeutic options such as exemestane with everolimus, palbociclib with fulvestrant/an aromatase inhibitor (NCCN, Breast Cancer, Version 2.2017).

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The application for the new indication in endocrine naïve patients is based on data from two studies:

- a  supportive  Phase  2  study  (Study  D6995C00006):  open-label  study  of  fulvestrant  500  mg versus  anastrozole  1  mg  in  205  women  with  advanced  disease  previously  untreated  with endocrine therapy or at least a year after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy (FIRST)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- a pivotal Phase 3 study (Study D699BC00001): Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in 462 women with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously been treated with any hormonal therapy (FALCON)

## 3.2. Favourable effects

Study FALCON (n=230 + 232) showed borderline significant superiority in terms of PFS (HR 0.797, p=0.0486, sensitivity analyses 0.03 - 0.06, medians 16.6 months vs. 13.8 months). The odds ratio for ORR is close to 1 which indicated similarity between the treatments. OS data are immature at event rates of about 30% (HR 0.875). Median DoR was longer in the fulvestrant arm (20.0 months) compared with the anastrozole arm (13.2 months). The overall data are compatible with a possible delay in the development of resistance of response compared with anastrozole.

The FIRST study (n=102 + 103) met its primary non-inferiority objective in terms of Clinical Benefit response (CBR): CBR of 72.5% in fulvestrant group vs 67% in the anastrozole group; Odds ratio 1.302

(0.717, 2.380), p-value: 0.386. This was supported by the secondary endpoints PFS (HR 0.7, p=0.01) and OS (HR 0.7, p=0.04, medians 54 vs. 48 m.). ORR similar and data are again compatible with delayed development of secondary resistance compared with anastrozole.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

In the FALCON study, the superiority of Faslodex over AI seemed to be lost in the subgroup of patients with ER+ breast cancer with visceral metastases (PFS HR 0.99). No satisfactory explanation has been identified and the results in these subgroups have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

The objectives of FALCON did not include cross-over and PFS2 data were not collected. Thus the possible importance of the sequence of therapy cannot be assessed.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

Fulvestrant has been approved for 12 years and the safety is considered reasonably well described. No new ADRs were observed in the clinical studies submitted with the application. The most common adverse drug reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, hot flushes, nausea, elevated hepatic enzymes, rash, joint and musculoskeletal pain, asthenia, and injection site reactions. In FALCON, the expected increase in joint and musculoskeletal pain was confirmed and the SmPC has been updated accordingly.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

There were no new uncertainties about the unfavourable effects.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The prolonged PFS of approximately 3 months observed in the FALCON (and FIRST) study is of a magnitude that is considered meaningful.

The safety of fulvestrant has not changed and the ADRs are as expected and can be managed successfully by the recommendations in the SmPC and by PhV monitoring.  The SmPC has been updated with the new ADR frequencies.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Overall, the benefits of fulvestrant outweigh the risks in the treatment of postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior endocrine therapy.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Regarding  the  extension  of  the  currently  approved  indication  (second  line  after  'anti-oestrogen therapy' to be extended to second line after 'endocrine therapy'), the MAH has submitted insufficient evidence  to  change  the  conclusions  from  the  previous  variation  (EMEA/H/C/540/II/0018),  and therefore  the  proposed  extension  of  the  already  approved  indication  is  not  considered  sufficiently justified.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Faslodex is positive in the treatment of postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior endocrine therapy.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:
