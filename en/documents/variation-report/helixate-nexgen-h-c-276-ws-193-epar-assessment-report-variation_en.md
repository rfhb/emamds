## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

KOGENATE Bayer/Kogenate FS and Helixate NexGen/Helixate FS products consist of a recombinant human factor VIII (FVIII, INN: octocog alfa), which is derived from a cloned human FVIII gene

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

transfected into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The product is formulated with sucrose as a stabilizer.

Marketing authorization of KOGENATE / Kogenate FS in the EU was first granted in August 2000. Bayer Healthcare is the license holder for rFVIII distributed by CSL Behring under the main brand Helixate, which is identical with KOGENATE / Kogenate FS.

The currently approved therapeutic indications in EU for Kogenate/Helixate are:

-  Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.

Bleeding episodes in patients with FVIII inhibitors is currently managed at the discretion of the treating physician. In most cases, the treatment depends on one hand on the in vitro potency of the inhibitors, which is reported as the number of Bethesda units (BU) per millilitre of plasma and on another side on the titer of inhibitors ( high titer [peak titer &gt;5 BU) or low titer [peak titer ≤ 5 BU)]. High-responding inhibitors have been shown to elicit a quick, strong immune response while low-responding inhibitors produced a slower, weaker response 1  . If the inhibitor titer is low, administration of additional FVIII doses may neutralize the inhibitor and allow continued clinically effective therapy. If the inhibitor titer is high, use of bypassing agents, such as activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) should be considered 2 . The current Type II variation proposes to extend the indication for Kogenate/Helixate to the treatment of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors by Immune Tolerance induction (ITI). Information on paediatric requirements The application did not fall within the scope of Article 8 of the paediatric regulation. 2.2. Non clinical aspects The applicant did not submit non-clinical study reports in support of the proposed indication of ITI. 2.3.

About two thirds of the patients (n=21, 65.6%) received a high-dose therapy ( ≥ 85 IU/kg per exposure day), 11 patients (34.4%) received a in A total of 32 male subjects suffering from severe hemophilia A were included in the analysis. Med start of ITI treatment was 2.0 years low-dose therapy. The starting dosage per exposure day ranged from 38 to 250 IU/kg. The initial frequency of recombinant FVIII formulated with sucrose (rFVIII-FS) infusions was 3 times per week 53.1% of patients and daily in 34.4%. Three patients (9.4%) received rFVIII-FS every other day and one patient 3 times per day (3.1%) in the first three days. For the individual patients widely disparate dosing regimens were used.

U compared to 443,000 IU for patients on low-dose therapy. The The patients completed ITI after a median duration of 1.8 years (mean 1.8 ± 1.1 years, range 39 days to 4.5 years) receiving a median of 1,021,000 IU rFVIII (mean 1,236,880 ± 1,072,031 IU, range 46,500 to 4,012,000 IU). The median consumption of rFVIII-FS in the subgroup of patients on highdose therapy was 1,068,000 I maximum treatment dose per exposure day ranged from 50 to 364 IU/kg for all patients.

## Ancillary analyses

## IN FACT France (KG0801FR)

A total of 22 male subjects suffering from severe or moderate hemophilia A were included in the analysis. Median age at which the inhibitor was first detected was 1.5 years (mean 7.0 ± 11.8 years), median age at start of ITI treatment was 3.0 years (mean 10.6 ± 15.2 years).

Medicinal product no longer authorised

About two thirds of the patients (n=15, 68.2%) received a high-dose therapy ( ≥ 85 IU/kg per exposure day), 7 patients (31.8%) received a low-dose therapy.

The patients completed ITI after a median duration of 1.4 years (mean 1.6 ± 1.0 years, range 108 days to 3.6 years) receiving a median of 1,489,750 IU rFVIII-FS (mean 2,007,707 ± 1,692,490 IU, range 162,000 to 6,114,000 IU).

As assessed by the attending physician, ITI was successful in 13 patients (59.1%), partially successful in 3 patients (13.6%) and failed in 6 patients (27.3%). In 2 patients the criteria for 'success' were a negative inhibitor assay, a normal recovery and a normal FVIII half-life. In 8 patients a negative

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inhibitor assay and normal FVIII recovery were used to define 'success'. In 3 patients a negative inhibitor assay was the only documented criterion.

Evaluation of success rates by subgroups of patients showed differences with regard to peak titers before start of ITI and titers at start of ITI: The success rate increased to 83.3% for a subgroup of 6 patients with a peak inhibitor titer &gt; 5 and &lt; 10 BU before start of ITI.

All 16 patients completing ITI successfully or partially successfully continued KOGENATE Bayer/FS or Helixate NexGen therapy as prophylactic treatment. In three patients with outcome partial success a recurrence of inhibitor after end of ITI until enrollment was observed.

International ITI Study (13862): Prospective, randomized, unblinded, international trial comparing two FVIII dosing regimens for ITI: low-dose (50 IU/kg three times weekly) versus highdose (200 IU/kg daily).

Methods An investigator-initiated, open, prospective study, conducted between July 2002 and November 2009 at 90 centers in 17 American, European, and Asian countries. Study Participants Criteria for inclusion -Severe hemophilia A (FVIIIC &lt;0.01 IU/ml) -Patients ≤ 7 years of age at start of ITI -Maximum historical inhibitor of between 5 BU and 200 BU -Inhibitor titer was to be &lt;10 BU at the start of ITI -Inhibitor had to be present for ≤ 24 months Criteria for exclusion -Previous attempt of ITI Treatments Test drugs investigated in this multicenter international study included recombinant and plasma derived Factor VIII products from numerous manufacturers; however, for the purposes of this report, only the data from those patients who received Kogenate/Helixate are included in the analyses of efficacy and safety. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Dose Low dose: 50 IU/kg rFVIII 3 times weekly OR High dose: 200 IU/kg rFVIII daily IV.

## Duration of treatment

Minimum 9 months and maximum 33 months of ITI therapy, plus 12 months of prophylactic treatment.

ITI treatment was to continue without any change in product-type until the inhibitor had disappeared and the patient met the criteria for either successful or partial tolerization or until the patient had fulfilled the criteria for treatment failure. The maximum specified duration of ITI treatment was 33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

months. If ITI was successful, the dose of FVIII was reduced to a regular prophylactic dose-level. Prophylaxis was continued for 12 months following the completion of ITI and patients were monitored for signs of relapse.

## Objectives

- -To compare the efficacy, response time, morbidity and economics of a high-dose and a lowdose immune-tolerance protocol
- -To identify predictors of successful ITI

## Outcomes/endpoints

- Study data to be collected included demographic information; details of FVIII administered for ITI; treatment for intercurrent bleeding; and inhibitor titers, FVIII recovery, and FVIII half-life determinations. Data reflecting concomitant therapy capable of affecting the immune system, intravenous catheter insertions, and infections and non-catheter related infections was also collected. The number of hospital in-patient days during the study and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded as well. For the purposes of this report, only data collected for those patients who received treatment with Kogenate/Helixate is presented. Criteria for evaluation efficacy / clinical pharmacology Extensive efficacy analyses were planned for the main study protocol; however, only limited data were available for the patients who received treatment with Kogenate/Helixate. Treatment outcome was measured by the following criteria:  Success was defined as the abolition of the inhibitor (&lt;0.6 BU using the Bethesda Assay or &lt;0.3 BU using the Nijmegen modification) within 33 months of ITI as defined by a FVIII recovery ≥ 66% of expected and half-life ≥ 6h, and measured after a 72-hour treatment-free washout period.  Treatment failure was defined as the failure to fulfill the criteria for full or partial success within 33 months. OR Following the first 3 months of treatment and prior to completing 33 months of ITI, failure to achieve an ongoing ≥ 20% reduction in inhibitor titer, during each interim non-overlapping, 6-month period of ITI in the absence of documented infection. This implies that 9 months was the minimum treatment period and 33 months the maximum possible duration of unsuccessful ITI. OR Withdrawal from the study for any other reason . Medicinal product no longer authorised

A post-hoc analysis of efficacy was also performed for those patients who received sufficient ITI (defined as at least 9 months of ITI therapy, without the requirement for 12-month prophylaxis).

The post-hoc analysis of success used the following criteria:

-  Most stringent: Sustained negative inhibitor AND recovery ≥ 66% AND half-life ≥ 6h (including patients who did not have a complete subsequent 12 month prophylactic phase)
-  Moderately stringent: Sustained negative inhibitor AND recovery ≥ 66% (including patients who did not have a complete subsequent 12 month prophylactic phase)
-  Least stringent: Sustained negative inhibitor (including patients who did not have a complete subsequent 12 month prophylactic phase)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety was assessed based upon the nature and frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs), coded using the MedDRA 14.0 dictionary. Non-serious adverse events were not recorded.

## Sample size

Power calculations were performed using the software package nQuery Advisor using assumptions based on the published literature. The time required to achieve tolerance was the main outcome measure examined. If the sample size in each group was approximately 75, a 0.05 significance level two-sided log rank test for equality of survival curves would have a theoretical 80% power to detect a difference between the 2 treatment arms if 80% of the high-dose group and 50% of the low-dose group achieved tolerance after 9 months ITI (a constant hazard ratio of about 3.00). This calculation assumes no dropouts before 9 months.

A separate statistical analysis plan was prepared for the subset of the main data presented in this report. For the n=39 patients who received treatment with Kogenate/Helixate the primary analysis of efficacy (treatment outcome) was based upon the valid per protocol patient population (n=13; protocol driven-analysis). An additional analysis of outcome was also performed for the full subset (n=39). Further, a post-hoc analysis of treatment outcome was performed for the n=35 patients who received sufficient ITI.

The estimate of sample size allowed for the small loss of statistical power incurred by 2 planned interim analyses. For the purposes of this report, only those patients who received treatment with Kogenate FS/KOGENATE Bayer or Helixate FS/Helixate NexGen (n=39) were to be assessed for efficacy and safety parameters. All presentations of data for this subset of patients were to be descriptive in nature. No power calculations were performed. 75 patients per treatment group were planned for the full study. Randomisation Patients were randomized to either the low-dose arm or the high-dose ITI treatment. Blinding (masking) This was an open label trial. Statistical methods For the main study analysis, response times were to be analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, with allowance made for center effects (clustering). Alternatively, \"success\" (a binary outcome assessed at the end of the study period) was to be analysed using multiple logistic regression (again allowing for clustering of data). Two interim analyses were planned. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Recruitment

The study centers that provided treatment to the subset of patients whose data was analyzed for this report comprised a subset of centers from a multicenter international study (International ITI Study).

## Conduct of the study

An interim analysis of the data collected in the International ITI study was performed in 2008. The International ITI Study was terminated early due to significantly higher rates of bleeding with low-dose versus high-dose ITI both early and late in the course of treatment.

Following enrollment, patients were treated using bypass therapy on demand, until their inhibitor titer fell below 10 BU/ml. The inhibitor titer was monitored monthly during this period.

## Baseline data

A summary of demographic and baseline characteristics is shown in Table 7. All 39 patients were male. The median age of patients was 22.0 months (range 10-59 months). Inhibitor titers at the time of study entry ranged from 1.0 to 69.0 BU (mean 6.9 BU [SD=10.5 BU]).

Of the 35 patients who had a sufficient duration of ITI therapy (9-33 months) to assess failure irrespective of completion of the prophylaxis period, 24 (69%) had a successful response as determined by a sustained negative inhibitor test. Eighteen (51%) of patients achieved a successful response based upon a sustained negative inhibitor test plus normalized FVII recovery. Eleven (31%) of patients met all 3 success criteria.

Discussion of efficacy The IN FACT study is a retrospective collection of data from an observation period November 2001 to November 2009. The participating haemophilia centers in 5 countries documented all haemophilia A patients who had developed inhibitors against Factor VIII and who were treated with Kogenate/Helixate for immune tolerance induction. Dose and frequency of FVIII administration were at the discretion of the attending physician. The data presented in Table 5, the success rate of ITI treatment with octocog alfa was 93.3% when the inhibitor titer was between 5 and 10 BU at the start of ITI compared to 47.1 % when inhibitor titer was ≥ 10 BU at start of ITI. This data support the current wording in the SmPC in section 4.2 '…… If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer. However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity. In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered…..'.

The International ITI study was a prospective, randomised study two dose regimens for the treatment of ITI. The study was terminated prematurely due to a higher number of bleeding events in the lowdose group compared to the high-dose group. The data presented in Table 9 showed that the success

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rates for the 13 (33.3%) patients who completed the study according to the protocol were 50% (4/8 patients) for patients in the low-dose group and 40% (2/5 patients) for patients in the high-dose group. The overall success rate was 46.2%.

Due to the small number of patients in both studies and the kind of study design, the data was not considered reliable to evaluate the factors influencing ITI success. Moreover, the doses of octocog alfa administered in the individual studies ranged widely and thus no conclusions can be drawn regarding an optimized treatment regimen for ITI. A literature review reported inconclusive data with regard to influencing factors, optimal dosing regimen and ITI treatment duration as well. Therefore, treatment decisions will still be at the discretion of the treating physician, as stated in the current SmPC.

For the IN FACT French cohort with modified inclusion/exclusion criteria, the only treatment-emergent AE reported in more than 1 patient was device-related infection, which was reported in 2/8 (25.0%) patients. No information on non-serious AEs was available for the subset of 39 Kogenate Bayer patients in the International ITI study.

In the IN FACT study, treatment-emergent 72 AEs were documented in 23 (71.9%) of the 32 patients who received Kogenate Bayer during ITI. A further 14 AEs were documented in 5 of the 8 patients in the French cohort with modified inclusion/exclusion criteria. For the IN FACT international cohort, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent AE was devicerelated infection, which was reported in 6 (18.8%) patients. AEs of gastroenteritis, traumatic brain injury, and hemarthrosis were each reported in 3 patients. Several of the events that were reported in only 1 or 2 patients, such as bronchitis, ear infection, pneumonia, tonsillitis, varicella, nasopharyngitis, fall, contusion, traumatic fracture, and traumatic hemorrhage, which are either common childhood events or known events in this population.

Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events were reported in both the IN FACT and International ITI studies. In the IN FACT international cohort, 35 SAEs were reported in 14/32 (43.8%) patients. The most frequently reported SAEs were device related infection in 4 (12.5%) patients, traumatic brain injury in 3 (9.4%) patients, and staphylococcal sepsis, post procedural haemorrhage, and haemarthrosis, each in 2 (6.3%) patients. The majority of SAEs were serious because of the requirement for or prolongation of hospitalization. In the IN FACT French cohort with modified inclusion/exclusion criteria, 11 SAEs were reported in 4/8 (50.0%) patients. The only SAE reported in more than 1 patient was device related infection, in 2 (25.0%) patients. The profile of SAEs was similar to that for all AEs as the majority (11 of 14) of AEs reported were considered serious. In the International ITI study, 44 SAEs were reported in 18 (46.2%) of the 39 Kogenate Bayer-treated patients. 23 SAEs were reported in the low-dose group and 21 SAEs were reported in the high-dose group. More than half of the SAEs were catheter-related SAEs; catheter-related SAEs were reported in 9 of the 18 patients for whom SAEs were reported. Adverse event data from the supportive studies from the literature did not reveal any additional safety issues for the use of Kogenate Bayer for ITI.

## Literature review

The most common AEs observed in patients undergoing ITI are catheter related. Infections are the most frequent complications associated with the use of central venous lines in hemophilia patients. Several retrospective studies that include data from a substantial number of patients have reported approximately 0.2-0.3 infections per 1000 catheter-days (mainly Port-A-Cath). Some studies have shown a much higher frequency of infections, 1-2/1000 catheter-days 4 . As ITI typically requires daily (or 3 times weekly/every other day) infusions, the frequency of infection is higher in ITI patients compared with those who do not develop an inhibitor 5, 6, 7, 8 .

## 2.5.1. Discussion on safety

There were no new drug adverse reactions found in either of the studies. Catheter-related infections, which lead to hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, were the most commonly reported serious adverse events reported in the literature, in the  IN FACT study and in the International ITI study. Catheter-related SAEs were not related to octocog alfa itself but were reported in 6/32 (18.8%) patients in the international IN FACT study, in 2/8 (25%) patients in the French cohort of IN FACT, and in 9/39 (23.1%) patients in the International ITI study in the group treated with octocog alfa. A warning statement concerning the occurrence of catheter-related complications was approved in the type II safety variation EMEA/H/C/WS00198.

## 2.6. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed after some minor modifications: Section 5.1 of the SmPC: […] Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) Data on Immune Tolerance Induction have been collected in patients with haemophilia A who had developed inhibitors to FVIII. A retrospective review has been done on 40 patients, and 39 patients were included in a prospective investigator-initiated clinical study. Data show that Helixate NexGen has been used to induce immune tolerance. In patients where immune tolerance was achieved the bleedings could be prevented or controlled with Kogenate/Helixate NexGen again, and the patient could continue with prophylactic treatment as maintenance therapy. […] Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template v8.0. 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance The MAH has submitted two studies, one retrospective study (IN FACT) and a prospective, randomised International ITI study analysing the subset of patients that used Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen. These  studies  reflect  the  current  clinical  use  of  octocog  alfa  but  do  not  provide  relevant  new information supporting the indication on ITI. It was acknowledged that although high doses of octocog alfa  have  been  used  for  more  than  30  years  in  the  treatment  of  haemophiliacs  with  inhibitors,  the current approach was to treat inhibitors on an individual basis as there is no approved regimen. The international ITI study was designed to provide the efficacy data and guidance on a treatment for ITI. Unfortunately  the  study  was  terminated  prematurely.  Thus,  CHMP  noted  that  there  was  still uncertainty  on  certain  aspects  of  octocog  alfa  administration  for  the  ITI  indication  such  as  no established dose recommendation, choice of dose regimen depending on inhibitor titer, schedule of ITI with or without bypassing agents or immunosuppressive therapy, duration of ITI treatment, definition of success and rate of recurrence.  Therefore, the CHMP was of the opinion that there were not enough robust clinical data in the studies submitted to support the indication and that the benefit-risk balance for the applied indication 'Treatment of haemophilia A patients with inhibitors by Immune Tolerance Induction  (ITI)'  was  negative.  However,  it  was  agreed  that  information  on  the  major  results  of  the studies and on ITI treatment could be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variation accepted   |                                                                                                                      | Type   |

| C.I.6.a              | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add information on study results from the INFACT and the International ITI study concerning the use of octocog alfa in immune tolerance induction. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.0.

The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 5. EPAR changes The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows: Scope Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add information on study results from the INFACT and the International ITI study concerning the use of octocog alfa in immune tolerance induction. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.0. Summary The applicant applied for new indication for immune tolerance induction (ITI). The CHMP considered that benefit-risk was negative for the new indication. However, it was agreed to include information on the study results of the INFACT study and the International ITI study in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised
