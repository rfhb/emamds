The review of data presented in the PSUR for Xiapex, covering the period from 28 February 2018 to 27 February 2019, identified post-marketing and literature case reports of finger necrosis and/or amputation and of finger fractures in patients with Dupuytren's contracture treated with collagenase clostridium histolyticum. Taking into account the plausibility of the mechanism of collagenase clostridium histolyticum and the subsequent manipulation procedure in patients with Dupuytren's contracture, the PRAC considers that the product information for Xiapex should be updated to include a warning with regards to finger necrosis resulting in some cases in finger amputation and a warning with regards to finger fracture should be included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Reduced peripheral circulation may be one contributing factor for finger necrosis. For patients with an increased risk of fracture, e.g. patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis, special caution is needed during the manipulation procedure. The section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated to include the adverse reactions 'digital necrosis' and 'digital fracture' with a frequency 'not known'. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

In addition, based on the review of post marketing case reports of penile fracture in patients with Peyronie's disease, the PRAC considers that the product information for Xiapex should be updated to include a new wording for section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PIL to increase the minimum time span between injection and resumption of sexual activity to at least 4 weeks and to be cautious when resuming sexual activity.
