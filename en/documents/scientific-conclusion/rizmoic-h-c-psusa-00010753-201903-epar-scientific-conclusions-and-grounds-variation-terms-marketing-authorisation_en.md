## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for naldemedine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The MAH identified nine cases of gastrointestinal perforation in their global database. Two of the nine cases have been classified as cases of interest by the MAH, one of which they consider 'possibly related' and other 'probably related'. Both of these cases were fatal. Two of the nine cases were excluded by the MAH because they were not considered valid, and in the remaining five cases the MAH excluded a causal relationship in addition to the reporter. Whilst the more limited information provided in these five cases is acknowledged the assessor considers that the potential role of Naldemedine cannot be excluded in all of these.

None of the identified cases are without significant confounding factors and the difficulties in definitively determining causality are acknowledged. Nevertheless, given the times to onset and the mechanism of action of Naldemedine which leads to an increase in the propulsive contractions of the intestinal muscle it is considered that Naldemedine could plausibly have contributed to perforation events in these patients who were already at increased risk due to the presence of additional risk factors including underlying disease and concomitant treatments.

Overall,  whilst  the  limitations  in  the  evidence  base  solely  for  Naldemedine  are  acknowledged  it  is considered  that  supporting  information  is  also  provided  by  other  agents  in  the  class  which  are mechanistically indistinguishable from Naldemedine and which have similar effects on the GI tract. It is therefore  considered  that  the  presented  cases  are  sufficient  to  support  an  update  to  the  product information to both section 4.4 and 4.8. The agreed update is aligned with the wording reflected in the product informations for methylnaltrexone and naloxegol. Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in post-marketing setting, including fatal cases, when naldemedine was used in patients who were at an increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation. Naldemedine must not be used in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients at increased risk of recurrent obstruction, due to the potential for gastrointestinal perforation. Gastrointestinal perforation is added a new adverse reaction with a frequency 'Not known'. The package leaflet is updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for naldemedine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing naldemedine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
