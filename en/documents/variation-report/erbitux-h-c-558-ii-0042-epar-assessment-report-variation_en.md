## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Cetuximab  is  a  chimeric  monoclonal  Immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  antibody  directed  against  the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR signaling pathways are involved in the control of cell survival, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell migration and cellular invasion/metastasis. Cetuximab  binds  to  the  EGFR  with  an  affinity  higher  than  that  of  endogenous  ligands.  Cetuximab blocks binding of endogenous EGFR ligands resulting in inhibition of the function of the receptor and induces the internalization of EGFR, which can lead to down-regulation of the receptor. Cetuximab also targets  cytotoxic  immune  effector  cells  towards EGFR-expressing  tumour  cells  (antibody  dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).

Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  EGFR-expressing,  KRAS  (Kirsten  rat  sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer:

 in combination with chemotherapy

 as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy, and who are intolerant to irinotecan.

Erbitux is also indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck:

 in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease

 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease.

In all indications, Erbitux is administered once a week as intravenous infusion at a maximum rate of 10 mg/min. The initial dose is 400 mg/m 2 , and all subsequent weekly doses are 250 mg/m 2 .

This variation application was submitted by the MAH on the recommendation of the CHMP in follow-up to  the  assessment  of  Follow-UP  Measure  044  (FUM  044)  and  the  ensuing  additional  Follow-Up Measures  (FU2  044.1  and  FU2  044.2).  Follow-Up  Measure  044  was  initiated  by  the  CHMP  in September 2009 together with FUM 029 for Vectibix, triggered by findings in a panitumumab (Vectibix) add-on  to  FOLFOX4  (folinic  acid,  5-fluorouracil,  oxaliplatin)  study  showing  a  negative  impact  on Progression-Free  Survival  (PFS)  in  patients  with  metastatic  colerectal  cancer  (mCRC)  tumours harbouring activating KRAS mutations further to similar earlier findings for cetuximab, also in an mCRC add-on to FOLFOX4 study (OPUS). Assessments followed with the aim to understand the underlying mechanisms  behind  these  findings  and  also  aiming  at  risk  reduction.  In  the  course  of  these assessments,  data  suggesting  lack  of  efficacy  of  cetuximab  were  reported  in  combinations  of cetuximab with oxaliplatin - fluoropyrimidine regimens (COIN, submitted and assessed) and with the Nordic FLOX (fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin) regimen (NORDIC VII, only high level data available).

With this variation application the MAH proposed changes to sections 4.1, 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on the results of the COIN study. The CHMP considered that the mCRC indication in combination with  chemotherapy  should  be  restricted.  A  new  variation  will  be  submitted  when  the  clinical  study report of the NORDIC VII trial becomes available with the intention to update the SmPC based on the results of this trial and to reassess the benefit-risk balance of the restricted indication.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

The initial indication granted for cetuximab was in mCRC as add-on to irinotecan in patients previously exposed to  oxaliplatin  and  with  irinotecan  refractory  mCRC  based  on  a  study  (BOND)  showing  that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

irinotecan + cetuximab was more effective than cetuximab alone [cetuximab Overall Response Rate (ORR) 11%, cetuximab + irinotecan 23%]. No KRAS mutation data are available from this trial.

The  initial  Erbitux  mCRC  indication  was  extended  to  treatment  of  patients  in  combination  with chemotherapy or as single agent (after oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy) with variation EMEA/H/C/000558/II/0020 (EC Decision 7 July 2008). Support for the monotherapy indication came primarily from the following trial:

CA225025 (NCIC): randomised, controlled  phase  III  study  of  cetuximab  as  single  agent  in  patients who had failed currently available standard chemotherapy regimens

As the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens for mCRC are combinations of fluoropyrimidines with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan, the indication in combination with chemotherapy was supported by the following studies:

EMR 62 202-013 (CRYSTAL): randomised, controlled phase III study of cetuximab in combination with FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC previously untreated for metastatic disease

EMR  62  202-047  (OPUS):  randomised,  controlled  phase  II  study  of  cetuximab  in  combination  with FOLFOX versus FOLFOX in patients with mCRC previously untreated for metastatic disease

CA225006  (EMR  62  202-025  or  EPIC):  randomised,  controlled  phase  III  study  of  cetuximab  in combination  with  standard  irinotecan  versus  irinotecan  in  patients  who  had  failed  oxaliplatin-based therapy for metastatic disease

Updated PFS and Overall Survival (OS) data from CRYSTAL, OPUS and NCIC and updated analyses based on KRAS status from all four studies were included in the Erbitux Product information (PI) with variation EMEA/H/C/000558/II/0035 (EC Decision 28 July 2010). Additional PI changes included in this variation were the following: the requirement for determination of the tumour's KRAS mutation status prior  to  initiating  cetuximab  treatment  was  worded  more  explicitly,  a  warning  about  cardiovascular events  was  introduced  and  the  warning  of  increased  toxicity  in  combination  with  5-fluorouracil  was extended to all fluoropyrimidines.

The  data  and  analyses  that  resulted  in  these  additional  safety  changes  and  the  analyses  based  on KRAS  status  had  been  requested  by  the  CHMP  as  FUM  044.  This  was  requested  following  the observation  that  the  combination  of  cetuximab  with  FOLFOX4  in  the  OPUS  trial  impacted  results negatively in patients with mutant KRAS tumour status [OS HR: 1.290 (95% CI: 0.873, 1.906), PFS HR 1.720 (95% CI: 1.104, 2.679), ORR HR 0.459 (95% CI; 0.228, 0.924) favouring FOLFOX4 alone (over the cetuximab/FOLFOX4 combination)]. Similar results had been reported in a panitumumab trial in  combination  with  FOLFOX4.  In  the  course  of  the  assessment  of  FUM  044  and  further  to  CHMP requests for supplementary information (FU2 044.1, FU2 044.2 and the current variation application), the MAH submitted the results of an investigator sponsored trial, the COIN trial.

## COIN

The  COIN  (COntinuous  chemotherapy  plus  cetuximab  or  INtermittent  chemotherapy)  study  was  an open-label, multicentre, 3-arm, randomised (1:1:1), controlled, investigator-initiated phase III, firstline  trial  that  was  sponsored  by  the  UK  Medical  Research  Council  (MRC)  with  centres  in  the  United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

## Methods

## Treatments

The study comprised the following three arms:

- Arm A: Oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine (OxFp) continuous chemotherapy in one of two regimens:
-  OxMdG ( Ox aliplatin M odified d e G ramont: this regimen is similar to FOLFOX4, repeated every 2 weeks, IV): combination of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m² over 2 h), L-folinic acid (175 mg over 2 h), and bolus 5-FU (400 mg/m²) followed by a 46-h infusion of 5-FU (2400 mg/m²)
-  XELOX  (capecitabine  ( XEL oda)  + Ox aliplatin,  repeated  every  3  weeks):  combination  of  IV oxaliplatin (130 mg/m² over 2 h, day 1) and oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m² twice a day [b.i.d.] on days 1 to 14 of each cycle)
- Arm B: continuous OxFp chemotherapy plus cetuximab administered as follows:

Chemotherapy was administered as described for Arm A in combination with infusions of cetuximab given once a week (first infusion 400 mg/m² over 2 h, subsequent infusions 250 mg/m² over 1 h). Cetuximab could be continued if chemotherapy was stopped due to toxicity or patient choice but was to be discontinued on evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

-  Arm  C:  intermittent  OxFp  chemotherapy  was  administered  as  described  in  Arm  A  for  12  weeks followed by monitoring only until disease progression. Upon progression, treatment was restarted for a new period of 12 weeks. This arm will not be further described and discussed as not being pertinent to cetuximab.

## Objectives

The study intended to compare the efficacy and safety of continuous vs intermittent oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in first  line  treatment  of  mCRC  and  to  investigate  the  add-on  effect  of  cetuximab  to continuous chemotherapy. Continuous chemotherapy was administered in cycles without interruption until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or following patient choice. Intermittent chemotherapy  was  administered  in  cycles  for  a  total  of  12  weeks  followed  by  patient  monitoring. Treatment was restarted for another 12 weeks upon progression of disease.

## Endpoints

The primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS) defined as the interval from randomisation to death from any cause. Patients still alive at data cut-off were censored at the date last seen.

Secondary  endpoints  included  response  and  Progression-Free  Survival  (PFS)  defined  as  the  interval from  randomisation  to  first  evidence  of  progression  or  death  from  any  cause.  Surviving  patients without progression were to be censored at the date they were last seen.

Tumour assessments were made based on radiological  scans  that  were  scheduled  every  12  weeks. Tumour response was assessed by the investigators according to RECIST without central confirmation.

## Results

## Conduct of the study

There were two major protocol amendments:

1) An interim safety analysis resulted in an amendment to the protocol. Patients in Arm B receiving XELOX (1000 mg/m² b.i.d.) plus cetuximab had significantly higher rates of grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea than those in other treatment groups: cetuximab + XELOX 30% vs XELOX 17% (p &lt;0.001) vs, cetuximab + OxMdG 20%.

The starting dose of capecitabine for patients in Arm B only was reduced from 1000 mg/m² b.i.d. to 850  mg/m² b.i.d.  In  Arm  A,  the  capecitabine  dose  remained  unchanged  at  1000  mg/m²  b.i.d.  The amendment was implemented after 1775 (73%) patients had been randomised to all arms.

2) The primary endpoint was changed to address the new  findings concerning cetuximab, demonstrating KRAS mutations to be a negative predictor of cetuximab efficacy: OS was ascertained separately in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours and in patients with mutant KRAS tumours.

## Numbers analysed

815 patients were randomised to Arm A (279 to OxMdG and 536 to XELOX) and 815 patients were randomised to Arm B. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population thus comprised 1630 patients.

## Ancillary analyses

In  the  course  of  the  assessment  of  FU2  044.2  and  this  variation  application,  the  MAH  submitted  a number of requested ancillary analyses on data from the COIN trial. More specifically, they submitted upon CHMP request subgroup analyses in the ITT, wild-type and mutant KRAS tumour patients, as well as a distribution of events of death and progression in the PFS subgroup analyses (data not shown).

Moreover, and similar to what was mentioned for the COIN trial above, the MAH submitted upon CHMP request for all trials subgroup analyses in the ITT, wild-type and mutant KRAS tumour patients, as well as a distribution of events of death and progression in the PFS subgroup analyses (data not shown). Results of PFS and OS by age group and KRAS tumour status in the combination with chemotherapy trials (COIN, CRYSTAL and OPUS), with the exception of the EPIC trial in which KRAS mutation status was little determined, are given in the following table.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

## COIN

Overall,  the  COIN  study  was  adequately  designed.  ORR  and  Progressive  Disease  (PD)  were  defined based on investigators' assessment only, but the primary endpoint was OS. Tumour assessment by scans  was  undertaken  every  12  weeks  (in  MAH  sponsored  studies  every  8  week).  The  very  late amendment with respect to dose reduction of capecitabine is of note, as it was the result of interim safety analyses showing an increased frequency of diarrhoea with the XELOX+cetuximab combination indicative  of  a  potential  negative  toxicity  interaction  of  cetuximab  with  XELOX  and  possibly  partly explaining the deviation in results between OxMdG and XELOX discussed below.

The  study  population  appears  typical  for  studies  in  this  field,  but  the  proportions  of  patients  with synchronous metastasis and 'liver and others' metastatic sites appear high. There are no likely relevant imbalances between treatment arms. In contrast to MAH sponsored studies, life expectancy of at least 12 weeks was not an inclusion criterion and prior adjuvant therapy could have been administered if completed &gt; 1 month prior to enrolment (&gt; 6 months in MAH sponsored studies).

No trend towards an overall survival benefit was detected. The observed median survival was rather short for a first-line CRC study, about 1.5 year. Of importance, compared to prior results showing a negative effect of cetuximab add-on to FOLFOX4 in terms of PFS and OS (see OPUS trial in tables 8 and 9), no negative effect was observed in case of KRAS mutation positive tumours (XELOX HR: 0.97, OxMdG HR: 0.99). However, in the XELOX group, there was an early separation in favour of the control followed by cross-over favouring the cetuximab arm (lower left panel of figure 2). This could be related to early treatment-related 'toxic' deaths.

A borderline significant  PFS  benefit  for  add-on  cetuximab  was  observed  only  in  the  OxMdG  arm.  Of note,  a  difference  was  observed  only  after  the  median  (upper  right  panel  of  figure  4).  In  OPUS,  a negative effect of cetuximab as add-on to FOLFOX4 was seen in patients with KRAS mutant positive tumours  (PFS  HR  1.7).  This  was  also  seen  in  patients  &lt;65  years  of  age  and  in  good  performance status, indicating that toxicity is less likely to be the main driver behind the negative results. Of note, similar results were found in a panitumumab trial when panitumumab was given as add-on to FOLFOX4 (PFS  HR  1.3)  and  in  the  CAIRO  2  trial,  where  cetuximab  was  added  to  a  bevacizumab  and  XELOX regimen. This apparent negative dynamic interaction between FOLFOX4 and anti-EGFR antibodies was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not confirmed in the COIN trial between cetuximab and OxMdG (similar to FOLFOX4, PFS HR 1.04) or XELOX (PFS 1.08). An possible explanation could be that the COIN study lacked assay sensitivity to show differences in terms of both negative add-on effects (mutant KRAS tumour patients) and positive add-on effects (wild type KRAS tumour patients).

With  respect  to  ORR,  borderline  significant  favourable  effects  were  observed  in  the  wild  type  KRAS tumour population and of similar magnitude irrespectively of background chemotherapy. In the KRAS mutation positive tumour population no favourable difference in ORR was observed.

In terms of safety, add-on cetuximab resulted in relevant increases in grade  3 diarrhoea (both arms), hand-foot syndrome (XELOX), rash (both arms), lethargy (both arms) and anorexia (OxMdG). A lower frequency of neuropathy was reported in the OxMdG arm after cetuximab add-on.

## Pooled analyses of Erbitux mCRC trials and discussion of indication

The monotherapy indication in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who are intolerant to irinotecan is not questioned. Cetuximab has shown clinically meaningful activity in terms of OS benefit as last-line therapy in patients with KRAS wild type tumours (NCIC trial).

The indication in combination with irinotecan-based regimens is not questioned either, as cetuximab add-on  to  FOLFIRI  (folinic  acid,  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan)  in  the  first  line  has  shown  a  meaningful prolongation of PFS and OS in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours, while no difference was seen in patients with mutant KRAS tumours (CRYSTAL trial). With regard to cetuximab add-on to irinotecan in irinotecan-naïve  and  oxaliplatin-exposed  patients  (second  line,  EPIC  trial),  KRAS  mutation  data  are considered non interpretable due to the low percentage (23%) of KRAS status ascertainment (compare patient numbers for the EPIC trial in the ITT, wt and mt KRAS tumour patients in tables 8 and 9). The study did not meet its primary endpoint (OS), but cetuximab showed a positive PFS effect in the full study  population  (HR  0.7,  investigator  assessment).  Finally,  in  patients  exposed  to  oxaliplatin  and refractory to irinotecan, cetuximab add-on to irinotecan showed an ORR of 23% vs. 11% on cetuximab alone, median PFS 4.1 vs. 1.5 months, p&lt;0.001. Thus cetuximab appeared to reverse resistance to irinotecan  which  is  from  a  mechanistic  perspective  a  very  interesting  finding.  As  cetuximab  in monotherapy  in  a  similar  population  has  shown  a  survival  benefit  over  best  supportive  care,  these results  are  also  considered  clinically  relevant.  No  KRAS  mutation  data  are  available  from  this  trial (BOND).

With regard to the indication in combination with oxaliplatin-based regimens, in three (COIN, CAIRO2, NORDIC  VII)  out  of  four  (add.  OPUS)  studies  with  oxaliplatin-containing  chemotherapy  regimens, including  one  add-on  to  a  bevacizumab  containing  regimen  (CAIRO2)  and  the  not  yet  assessed NORDIC  VII  trial,  of  which  high  level  data  have  nevertheless  been  reported,  there  was  no  add-on activity of cetuximab in terms of time-related endpoints in KRAS wild type tumours. Only in OPUS was there a positive effect in PFS, but not OS, in patients with wild-type tumours.

In two of these trials (OPUS, CAIRO2) a negative add-on effect on PFS and OS was seen in case of mutant KRAS tumours. In addition, similar findings were reported in a panitumumab add-on to FOLFOX trial (PRIME). At least for the OPUS trial, toxicity appears highly unlikely to be the major cause for this apparent negative add-on effect on mutant KRAS tumours and similar findings have not been reported for  any  irinotecan-containing  regimen.  The  most  likely  cause  is  thus  a  negative  dynamic  interaction between anti-EGFR antibodies and oxaliplatin in KRAS-mutated tumours. An unexpected relationship between percentage of EGFR positive tumour cells and negative add-on activity of cetuximab has been observed (see table 11), but otherwise no possible explanation to the negative add-on effect has been identified.

Among the fully assessed trials, conflicting  results have  thus  been  reported  for  OPUS  and  COIN:  in OPUS, a clinically  relevant  add-on  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  was  shown  in  wild  type  tumours,  while  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

negative effect was seen in KRAS mutated tumours. In COIN, a statistically marginalpositive effect was observed as add-on to the OxMdG regimen in wild type tumours and no negative effects were detected in  KRAS  mutated  tumours,  a  fact  probably  indicative  of  lack  of  assay  sensitivity.  To  what  extent tumour burden and other baseline factors contribute to this cannot be determined, but it should be noticed that age above 65 is predictive of less add-on activity of cetuximab (see table 10).

## 1.3. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following change to the mCRC indication (new text underlined):

Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer

-  in combination with chemotherapy (for details on certain regimens, see section 5.1),
-  as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who are intolerant to irinotecan.

The  CHMP  considered  that  a  restriction  to  the  indication  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  was necessary and the finally agreed wording is as follows (new text underlined):

Erbitux  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer

-  in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy or FOLFOX4 (for details, see section 5.1),
-  as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who are intolerant to irinotecan.

The warning on cardiovascular disorders in SmPC section 4.4 was updated based on the cross-study subgroup analyses indicating potential negative effects in PFS and OS in patients older than 65 years or  with  poor  performance  status.  These  effects  had  previously  (see  Variation  EMEA/H/C/000558/ II/0035, EC Decision 28 July 2010) been associated with cardiovascular disorders, although no causal relationship with cetuximab could be established. Moreover, the warning against use in patients with unknown KRAS tumour status in section 4.4 of the SmPC and the related information in section 5.1 were expanded based on the updated information available. Finally, information on the interaction with the XELOX combination was added in section 4.5 of the SmPC.Finally, the CHMP requested the MAH to submit the results of the NORDIC VII study as soon as possible with the aim to reassess the benefit risk  of  the  updated  mCRC  indication  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  light  of  these  data.  A condition was agreed to be added in Annex II requiring the submission of the NORDIC VII study data as soon as made available.

## 1.4. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

As  add-on  to  irinotecan  containing  regimens,  cetuximab  has  shown  a  positive  effect  in  terms  of increased ORR and PFS and in the first line trial as add-on to FOLFIRI a favourable effect on OS has been shown. In the EPIC trial  (second  line  post-oxaliplatin  and  as  add-on  to  FOLFIRI),  designed  to demonstrate a survival benefit, a beneficial effect in terms of OS could not be shown, but a positive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effect in terms of PFS was shown in the overall population, while efficacy in relation to tumour KRAS status could not be properly assessed due to the small number of patients with KRAS evaluation. In the last line setting (BOND trial), a meaningful prolongation in PFS was observed with the combination of  cetuximab  and  irinotecan,  compared  with  cetuximab  alone,  in  patients  that  were  refractory  to irinotecan. Overall, the findings in trials with irinotecan based regimens are considered consistent and favourable.

Overall, the findings in trials with irinotecan based regimens are considered consistent and favourable. However,  in  patients  with  metastatic,  KRAS  wild-type  colorectal  cancer,  the  current  indication  'in combination with chemotherapy' is too general based on current knowledge. In CAIRO2, an add-on to XELOX + bevacizumab study, no positive effects in terms of time-related endpoints was demonstrated. In this trial, clearly negative effects in patients with KRAS mutation positive tumours were seen; hence the assay sensitivity is not questioned. A restriction of the combination of cetuximab with oxaliplatinbased regimens is thus warranted. With respect to such regimens and as discussed above, there is one trial  with  favourable  results  (OPUS)  in  KRAS  wild-type  tumours.  In  this  trial  cetuximab  was administered as add-on to the FOLFOX4 regimen. This is the only combination among oxaliplatin-based regimens which is still considered to be associated with a positive benefit/risk balance based on the currently  available  information.  However,  the  MAH  will  submit  the  results  of  the  NORDIC  VII  trial (combination with the Nordic FLOX regimen) as soon as made available with a view to reassessing the benefit-risk balance of the restricted indication.
