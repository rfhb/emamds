## Introduction

Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody containing human peptide  sequences  that  binds  to  human  Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  (TNF)  alpha  and  neutralises  the biological  function  of  TNF α by  blocking  its  interaction  with  the  p55  and  p75  cell  surface  TNF α receptors.

Adalimumab is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD) and psoriasis (PsO).

The  initial  PsA  indication  was  approved  in  2005  through  variation  II.22  (Commission  decision  of 1 August  2005). To  support  the  initial  application  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH) submitted  two  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  clinical  studies  (M02-518  and  M02-570)  and  an  interim report of the open-label long-term extension study (M02-537).

In  the  present  variation  application,  the  MAH  applied  for  an  extension  of  the  PsA  indication  for adalimumab to include reduction of the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and improvement of physical function.

To  support  the  joint  damage  claim  the  MAH  submitted  X-ray  data,  from  the  previously  submitted study M02-518 and the long-term extension study M02-537.  The claim of improved physical function was based on data from studies M02-518 and M02-570. With the submission of the final clinical study report (CSR) for Study M02-537, the MAH also fulfilled the outstanding follow up measure (FUM) No 25.

PsA  is  a  chronic,  inflammatory,  usually  rheumatoid  factor  (RF)-negative  arthritis  associated  with psoriasis. According to European  (EU) guidance for treating PsA, psoriasis is prevalent in 1% to 3% of  the  population.  Estimates  of  those  psoriasis  patients  who  develop  PsA  vary  widely  (6%-42%). Affecting men and women equally, PsA typically appears between the ages of 30 and 50 years. PsA usually  involves  multiple  peripheral  joints,  the  axial  skeleton,  sacroiliac  joints,  fingernails,  and entheses.  The  presentation  of  PsA  has  been  categorized  into  5  overlapping  clinical  patterns,  which include  oligoarthritis,  polyarthritis,  arthritis  of  distal  interphalangeal  (DIP)  joints,  spondylitis,  and arthritis mutilans. More than one-half of the patients with PsA may have evidence of erosions on Xrays, and up to 40% of the patients may develop severe, erosive arthropathy.

PsA has some similar symptoms to RA, including joint pain and destruction and fatigue. PsA can be distinguished from RA by one or more factors (e.g. presence of psoriasis; seronegative for RF (&gt; 80% of  patients);  patterns  of  joint  involvement  including  asymmetry,  distal  interphalangeal  disease,  and spinal  disease;  dactylitis;  enthesitis),  but  overall  PsA  and  RA  are  closely  related  diseases.  Most treatments used are similar.

The MAH proposed to amend the text of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) sections 4.1, and 5.1, and to update the package leaflet (PL) accordingly. Minor changes were proposed to sections 4.2 and 4.8.

## Clinical aspects 1

## Clinical efficacy

## Main studies

Adalimumab was studied in two controlled clinical studies (M02-518 and M02-570) in subjects with active  PsA.  Both  were  double-blind  studies  with  a  1:1  randomisation  of  adalimumab  40  mg  every other  week  (eow)  versus  placebo.  Subjects  who  completed  Study  M02-570  (12  weeks  duration)  or

1 A  summary of the details of the studies referred in this section is presented in the Clinical efficacy section. This report addresses the data submitted for the proposed change to the indication and other product information wording changes. For more detailed information on the initial trials please refer to the scientific discussion published at http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/humira/EMEA-H-481-II-22-AR.pdf.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

M02-518 (24 weeks duration) and who met the inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in M02537, a multicentre, open-label long-term extension study.

Study M02-518 was 24 weeks in duration. It was required that subjects had inadequate non steroid anti-inflammatory  drug  (NSAID)  response  and  subjects  were  stratified  by  methotrexate  (MTX)  use and extent of Ps (&gt; 3% body surface area [BSA] or &lt; 3% BSA) at baseline. There were 313 subjects included.

Study M02-570 was 12 weeks in duration and included 100 subjects. It was required that subjects had inadequate response to DMARD therapy, and subjects were stratified by DMARD use at baseline.

Study  M02-537  was  conducted  to  study  the  long-term  safety,  efficacy,  and  pharmacokinetic  (PK), including  immunogenicity,  of  repeated  administration  of  40  mg  adalimumab  eow  (or  40  mg adalimumab weekly for subjects who met criteria for dose escalation). Subjects were treated for up to 120 weeks or until adalimumab was commercially available for PsA in the subject's study participation country  (whichever  was  later).  Beginning  at  week  12,  subjects  who  failed  to  respond  (defined  as failure to demonstrate ≤ 20% decrease from baseline in both swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count; TJC) were allowed to increase their dose of adalimumab to 40 mg weekly.

## Methods

## Subject Population

In studies M02-518 and M02-570, the main inclusion criteria were similar but with some differences, as described below:

- Diagnosis  of  PsA  and  with  moderate  to  severe  activity  defined  by ≥ 3  swollen  joints  and ≥ 3 tender or painful joints.
- Concurrent/history of inadequate response to DMARD (study 570).
- Corticosteroid dose ≤ 10 mg/day and stable since 4 weeks, was allowed.
- Inadequate response/intolerant to NSAIDs (study 518).
- Allowed  to  be  on  MTX  since  minimum  3  months  and  stable ≤ 30  mg/week  since  4 weeks (study 570).
- Allowed to be on MTX/DMARD (except cyclosporine/tacrolimus) and as above (study 518).
- Presence of active/documented history of cutaneous chronique plaque psoriasis lesions.

Exclusion criteria included general contraindications for anti-TNF therapy and previous treatment with other anti-TNF/biologics.

For inclusion in M02-537, the subject should have completed Study M02-518 or M02-570.

## Efficacy Variables

In Studies M02-570 and M02-518, the primary efficacy variable was ACR20 2 response at week 12. An additional  primary  efficacy  variable  in  Study  M02 -518  was  the  inhibition  of  disease  progression assessed by modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) on X-rays of the hands and feet at week 24. mTSS ranged from 0 - 570 and included the JSN score (48 sites [0 - 4 for each site] for a range of 0 - 192) plus the erosion score (54 sites [0 - 7 for each site] for a range of 0 - 378). A lower score indicated a better result. An increase was defined as a change of &gt; 0.5 of mTSS. The primary X-ray endpoint; the comparison of change in mTSS of adalimumab treated subjects at week 48 with the change in mTSS of  placebo  treated  subjects  at  week  24;  was  defined  upon  consultation  with  the  FDA.  Since  all placebo-treated subjects switched to open-label adalimumab at the week 24 Visit, no comparison to placebo could be made at week 48.

Several  additional  endpoints  were  evaluated,  such  as  the  HAQ -DI  (disability  index  of  the  health assessment questionnaire), SF-36 PCS and MCS (the 36 question short-form health survey physical and  mental  component  summaries),  ACR50/70,  PsARC  (psoriatic  arthritis  response  criteria),  and

2 The ACR response criteria were developed for RA. The ACR20 criteria is defined as a ≥ 20% reduction in the tender joint count, a ≥ 20% reduction in the swollen joint count and a ≥ 20% reduction in 3 of 5 additional measures: a) patient assessment of pain, b) patient global assessment of disease activity, c) physician global assessment of disease activity, d) disability index of the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and, e) acute phase reactant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

FACIT (functional  assessment  of  chronic  illness  therapy)  Fatigue  Scale.  In  subjects  with  psoriasis involvement  at enrolment the PGA  (physician's global assessment for psoriasis),  and  DLQI (dermatology life quality index) were also assessed.

## M02-537 full analysis set

The  full  analysis  set  was  the  primary  analysis  population  for  baseline  and  long-term  efficacy parameters  (with  the  exception  of  X-ray  endpoints,  see  below)  and  consisted  of  all  subjects  who received at least one adalimumab injection in Study M02-518, M02-570, or M02-537. The M02-537 full  analysis  set  consisted  of  395  subjects:  382  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  adalimumab injection in Study M02-537 and 13 subjects who received adalimumab in Study M02-570 or M02-518 but did not enter M02-537.

## X-ray analysis sets

Only data from subjects in Study M02-518 were used for analyses of X-rays. Baseline X-ray data were defined  as  an  X-ray  performed  &lt;56  days  after  the  first  study  drug  injection  in  M02-518.  In  study M02-537, X-rays were analysed at weeks 24, 72, and 120. Two analysis sets were used.

M02-537  week  48  X-ray  analysis  set:  The  week  48  X-ray  analysis  set  included  subjects  who  had baseline and week 24 X-ray data with &gt; 50% assessments made, and received at least one injection of adalimumab in Study M02-537. This data set included 133 subjects on adalimumab and 141 subjects on placebo in Study M02-518.

M02-537 week 144 X-ray analysis set: The M02 537 week 144 X-ray analysis set included all subjects in the week 48 X-ray analysis set, who had a value at week 48 and a X-ray at week 96 or week 144 with &gt; 50% assessments read for all time points. For subjects with a missing mTSS at week 144, the mTSS at week 96 was used. This dataset included 115 subjects on adalimumab and 128 subjects on placebo in Study M02-518.

Subgroup  analyses  for  mTSS  were  performed  for  a  number  of  subgroups,  including  symmetric polyarthritis.

## Baseline disease characteristics

The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  PsA  subjects  were  representative  of  patients  with moderately to severely active PsA. Demographic and baseline characteristics for the M02-537 week 48 X-ray analysis set and M02-537 week 144 X-ray analysis set showed no meaningful differences from the characteristics of the M02-537 full analysis set (N = 395). A summary of the baseline mTSS for the M02-537 week 48 X-ray analysis set is presented in Table 1 below.

Table 1. Baseline Modified Total Sharp Score (M02-537 week 48 X-ray Analysis Set)

| baseline Modified Total Sharp Score   | Placebo eow N = 141   | Adalimumab 40 mg eow N = 133   |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mean ± SD                             | 21.2 ± 37.92          | 22.2 ± 44.15                   |
| Median (range)                        | 6.0 (0.0 - 216.8)     | 7.0 (0.0 - 358.8)              |

## Statistical Methods

The statistical methods in general were considered acceptable.

The primary analysis of the mTSS was the comparison of the change from baseline to week 48 in the adalimumab group and the change from baseline to week 24 in the placebo group. This analysis was a superiority test. The primary analysis was performed on the M02 -537 week 48 X-ray analysis set.

## Results

## X-ray analyses

Adalimumab-treated subjects had statistically significantly less progression in mTSS from baseline to week  48  compared  to  placebo-treated  subjects  from  baseline  to  week  24  (0.0  vs.  0.8,  p&lt;0.001)  as shown in the Table 2 below (results are shown in bold, underlined).

a. Subjects received adalimumab 40 mg eow starting at week 24.

- b. For subjects who were randomized to placebo at baseline and do not have a mTSS at week 48, the change from baseline to week 48 is imputed as the change from baseline to week 24 and the change from week 24 to week 48 is imputed as zero.  There are no subjects from the adalimumab group with imputed values.
- c. For change from week 24 to week 48, baseline = week 24.

In subjects treated with placebo, 29% had an increase in mTSS from baseline to week 24 compared to 10% of  adalimumab-treated  subjects.  For  subjects  originally  randomised  to  receive  adalimumab  in Study M02-518, 12% had an increase in mTSS from baseline to week 48.

The changes from baseline in both the erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores demonstrated that  adalimumab-treated  subjects  had  statistically  significantly  less  progression  in  Sharp  Score components from baseline to week 48 compared to placebo-treated subjects from baseline to week 24 (p=0.002 for JSN, p&lt;0.001 for erosion).

## Long-term efficacy

Subjects with no progression from baseline to week 48 were evaluated at week 144 to determine the proportion of subjects that continued to show no progression as defined by a decrease or no change in mTSS. Of the 102 subjects that showed no progression through week 48, a total of 86 (84.3%) subjects continued to show no progression from week 48 to week 144. In Table 3 below, a summary of mean changes in mTSS up to week 144 is shown for subjects with and without progression from baseline to week  24.  Table  4  shows  the  number  of  subjects  who  progressed,  or  did  not  progress  during  the complete study period.

## Subgroups analyses

The MAH undertook a number of subgroup analyses for the mTSS endpoint, including age, race, sex, body  weight,  site,  duration  of  PsA  quartiles,  various  baseline  parameters  (e.g.  MTX  use,  RF,  CRP HAQ -DI, TJC, SJC, mTSS, ACR20 responses at various time points and in subjects with symmetric polyarthritis  and  for  subjects  who  completed  Study  M02-537).  In  general,  all  subgroups  showed similar clinical effects following treatment with adalimumab, including the subjects with symmetric polyarthritis.

## Physical function

The MAH basis the claim of 'improved physical function' on analyses in study M02-518 of changes from baseline to week 12 and week 24 of various patient reported outcomes, such HAQ-DI and SF-36. These two were proposed to be included into the SPC, and are therefore described in further detail below. Maintenance of improvement of physical function was analysed in the open label extension study  M02-537.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  24  weeks  data  had  been  assessed  previously,  with  the consequent update of section 5.1 of the SPC with the following statement: 'Humira treated patients demonstrated improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36), from base-line to week 24.'

## Results from Study M02-518

There was a statistically significant difference in mean change in HAQ-DI as well as for SF-36 PCS in adalimumab-treated  subjects  in  Study  M02-518  compared  to  placebo  at  both  weeks  12  and  24.  At week 24, changes in HAQ-DI scores from baseline were of -0.1 ± 0.42 for placebo and -0.4 ± 0.49 for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adalimumab, and for SF36 PCS 1.5 ± 9.72 for placebo and 9.3 ± 10.03 for adalimumab. For SF-36 MCS no statistically significant difference between treatment groups was seen at either time point.

For the mean change in HAQ-DI, a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.30 between adalimumab  and  placebo  was  seen  at  weeks  12  and  24.  For  PsA,  a  MCID  for  SF-36  was  not established, but a general MCID of 3 to 5 points was determined, and was achieved for the SF-36-PCS component at weeks 12 and 24.

## Open Label extension

From  week  4  and  onwards,  up  to  week  144,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI  was -0.4 + 0.45/0.50, among the subjects who remained in the study (week 12 n=142; week 144 n=108). At week 12, 51% achieved a MCID of 0.30, and at week 144, 52% achieved this result.

For  SF-36,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI  ranged  from  9.2  +  9.97  (week  24)  to 12.2 + 9.91  (week  48),  among  the  subjects  who  remained  in  the  study  (week  12  n=136;  week  144 n=102).

ACR response: The MAH proposed to update section 5.1 of the SPC to reflect that ACR responses were maintained in the open-label extension study for up to 136 weeks . Table 5 shows a summary of the ACR 20/50 and 70 results during the open label extension study M02-537.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  proportion  of  patients  had  an  ACR  20  response  at  week  136;  namely  99  of  133  subjects  who remained in the study week 136, or 99 of the 363 patients who were in the study at the 12 week time point. These figures point to the drop out rate in the trial. Additionally, measures of physical function and quality of life remained improved in a proportion of subjects during the open label study period.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The MAH applied to change the existing PsA indication to add that adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function.

Data on physical function were assessed previously in variation II.22, and this was reflected in the SPC,  section  5.1.  The  data  showed  that  treatment  with  adalimumab  resulted  in  improved  physical function,  measured  by  various  patient  reported  outcomes,  including  HAQ-DI  and  the  physical component of SF-36. Overall, these data support a revision of the indication as applied for, to align the indication for Humira with that of other anti-TNF agents.

The joint damage claim is based on newly submitted X-ray data from study M02-518 and the longterm  extension  study  M02-537.  The  effect  of  adalimumab  on  progression  of  joint  damage  was assessed using the mTSS, which was considered as an acceptable parameter for assessment of X-ray data, but which is difficult to apply in a general clinical setting. The definition of an increase of the score (&gt; 0.5 change) was agreed. The primary X-ray analysis was undertaken by comparing 24 weeks placebo results with 48 weeks results for adalimumab. This analysis was agreed with given the nature of the endpoint; i.e. progression of joint damage. It was shown that adalimumab-treated subjects had statistically  significantly  less  progression  in  mTSS  from  baseline  to  week  48  compared  to  placebotreated subjects from baseline to week 24 (0.0 vs. 0.8, p&lt;0.001).

The magnitude of the natural progression during the study period was considered as one important factor  when  assessing  whether  the  active  treatment  reduces  the  progression  of  joint  damage.  There were 24 weeks placebo data available from approximately 144 subjects. Although the placebo period was short for the assessment of progression of joint damage, 29% of patients showed an increase of the mTSS (i.e., change of mTSS &gt; 0.5). The CHMP therefore concluded that the population in the trial was relevant for studying effects on structural damage. In the adalimumab group, 10 -12 % had an increased mTSS at weeks 24 and 48, respectively. These data support that adalimumab reduces the rate of progression of joint damage measured by X-ray, even if the evaluation period was short.

However, maintenance of reduced progression of joint damage was considered difficult to assess, due to the short placebo controlled period (24 weeks) and poor knowledge about the natural progression rate in PsA. The open label study results showed that rather few subjects on adalimumab progressed at all during the 144 weeks treatment period; 21 % had in increased mTSS from baseline to week 144. This is  less  than  the  number  of  placebo  subjects  who  had  an  increased  mTSS  during  the  24  weeks placebo period (29%). Although these data support a reduced progression rate following adalimumab treatment  during  at  least  a  2  years  period,  the  magnitude  of  effect  is  difficult  to  assess,  since  it  is unknown whether there is a linear joint damage progression rate; i.e. if the placebo patients would have continued with the same rate during a longer period. It was also unknown how many additional subjects in the placebo group who would have progressed during a 2 years period. Furthermore, the CHMP considered that it is unclear if this effect is relevant for all subtypes of PsA.

The  CHMP  considered  that  support  can  be  gained  from  RA,  where  more  knowledge  about  joint damage progression is  available.  Symmetric  PsA  shows  greatest  resemblance  with  RA.  Experience from other  anti-TNF  agents  supports  an  effect  in  subjects  with  symmetrical  disease,  while  relevant effects in subjects with asymmetrical disease have been less convincing.

The MAH undertook subgroup analyses, in subjects with symmetric polyarthritis, which support an effect in this subgroup. The CHMP considered that, given the support from RA, other anti-TNF-agents and  the  subgroup  analyses  submitted  by  the  MAH,  an  indication  of  treatment  of  subjects  with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease could be agreed.

## Clinical safety

The  safety  of  adalimumab  was  determined  through  evaluation  of  AEs  (adverse  events),  clinical laboratory  evaluations,  physical  examinations,  and  vital  signs.  In  addition,  TNF -inhibitor  related AEs of interest were evaluated: infections, serious infections, malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis  (TB),  demyelinating  disorders,  lupus -like  syndrome,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF), allergic reactions, injection site reactions, haematologic events, and hepatic events.

## Patient exposure

All subjects who received at least one adalimumab injection in Study M02-570, M02-518, or M02-537 were included in the M02-537 safety analysis set. For analyses of laboratory parameters and vital sign parameters,  subjects  who  were  missing  an  evaluation  were  excluded  from  the  analysis  of  that particular  parameter/visit.  There  were  395  subjects  who  had  received  adalimumab.  The  mean treatment duration was 808 ± 286 days (+ SD); the median (range) was 875 (15-1290) days. There were 342 (87%) who had &gt; 60 weeks treatment, 318 (81%) who had &gt; 104 weeks treatment and 84 (21%) who had &gt; 152 weeks treatment.

There  was  also  one  M02-537  dose  escalation  analysis  set,  which  included  all  subjects  who  were classified as undergoing dose escalation. The subjects increased their dose of adalimumab to 40 mg weekly. This dataset included 71 subjects. In the dose escalation subset, the median (range) of days on weekly treatments was 713 days (15 to 841 days), the mean (SD) exposure was 559 (251) days.

## Adverse events

## Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug

Thirty-eight subjects (9.6%) discontinued due to an AE during adalimumab treatment either in Study M02 518 (6) or Study M02 570 (1) or Study M02 537 (31). Of the 38 subjects who withdrew because of  AEs,  4  did  so  following  dose  escalation.  Of  the  395  study  subjects,  21  (5.3%)  experienced 23 treatment emergent AEs resulting in the discontinuation of study drug judged by the Investigator to be possibly or probably drug related.

Severe AEs were reported in 80 subjects (20.3% of all 395 subjects reporting at least one AE). The most commonly reported severe AEs were all reported by &lt; 1% of subjects (myocardial infarction and psoriatic arthropathy each reported by 4 subjects, 1.0%). Table 6 shows an overview of adverse events in the safety analysis set.

## Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths

## Deaths

A  total  of  three  deaths  were  reported  during  Study  M02-537.    One  death  occurred  outside  of  the reporting period and was not considered treatment-emergent.  Two of the deaths were the result of treatment-emergent  AEs;  lobar  pneumonia  and  sepsis  in  one  case,  and  sepsis  and  acute  pulmonary edema for the other.

## SAEs

SAEs were reported by 74 (18.7%) subjects. Among those, 18 (4.6%) subjects experienced SAEs that were  at  least  possibly  related  to  study  drug  (Table  7).  Of  the  subjects  who  experienced  SAEs, 12 experienced their SAE following dose escalation.

## Treatment-emergent infectious adverse events

The number and percent of subjects who reported treatment emergent infectious AEs (both non serious and serious) occurring in &gt; 2% of subjects was presented. A total of 272 subjects (68.9%) reported at least  one  infectious  AE.  The  most  commonly  reported  infectious  AEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract infection  (104/395,  26.3%),  nasopharyngitis  (68/395,  17.2%),  sinusitis  (39/395,  9.9%),  influenza (29/395, 7.3%), bronchitis (27/395, 6.8%), herpes simplex (20/395, 5.1%), and urinary tract infection (20/395, 5.1%). All other infectious AEs were reported by &lt; 5% of subjects.

Of the 395 subjects, 21 (5.3%) reported a serious infectious AE. Twelve (3.0%) were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug, including abdominal wall abscess, urinary  tract  infection,  lobar  pneumonia  and  sepsis  syndrome,  extradural  abscess  and  intervertebral discitis, peritoneal tuberculosis, pacterial pericarditis, meningitis viral, pyelonephritis and diverticulitis

## Opportunistic Infections (Excluding TB)

Four subjects (1.0%) reported treatment emergent opportunistic infections (excluding TB), in all cases oral or oesophageal candidiasis. One (0.3%) of the 395 subjects reported TB.

## Malignancies

Overall, ten malignancies were reported in nine subjects (basal cell carcinoma (n=3), neuroendocrine carcinoma  of  the  skin,  B-cell  small  lymphocytic  lymphoma,  prostate  cancer  (n=2),  follicle  centre lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma). One subject (518-2706) reported a malignancy (B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma) that was considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator.

The CHMP noted that squamous cell carcinoma has been included into the SPC, section 4.8 as a rare event. Furthermore, non-melanoma skin cancers (including both squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell  carcinoma)  are  mentioned  specifically  in  section  4.8,  with  higher  frequencies  observed  in adalimumab groups than in the placebo groups during the controlled portions of clinical trials.

## Injection Site Reactions

Of  the  395  subjects,  54  (13.7%)  subjects  reported  treatment-emergent  injection  site  reactions (including injection site: bruising, erythema, haemorrhage, irritation, pain, pruritus, reaction, and rash) most of which were mild and assessed by the Investigator as probably related to study drug.

## Other events:

No subjects with treatment-emergent central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease, lupus/lupus-like syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF) or immunologic reactions were observed.

## Laboratory findings

Small  mean  increases  in  hemoglobin;  hematocrit  and  red  blood  cells  (RBC)  were  observed  at  all evaluation  time  points.  Mean  white  blood  cells  (WBC)  values  decreased  during  treatment  with adalimumab  ranging  from  0.84 x10 3 / µ l  at  week  12  to  1.24 x10 3 / µ l  at  week 136.  Mean  changes  in WBC  differential  counts  showed  small  decreases  in  neutrophil  counts  and  small  increases  in lymphocyte  counts  at  all  time  points.  Mean  platelet  counts  decreased  at  all  time  points.  Changes observed are consistent and similar to subjects treated with adalimumab as previously seen in other studies. There were no clinically meaningful mean changes of clinical chemistry parameters or urineanalyses over 136 weeks.

## Intrinsic and extrinsic factors

Although  a  few  statistically  significant  differences  were  detected,  analyses  of  the  most  commonlyreported treatment-emergent AEs (i.e., those reported by &gt; 5% of subjects in the safety analysis set) by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intrinsic factors did not indicate any clinically relevant differences for males vs. females, subjects &lt; 65 years vs. those &gt;65 years, Caucasians vs . non-Caucasians, or subjects with &lt; 10 years of PsA vs . those with &gt;10 years of PsA.

Analyses  of  the  most  commonly-reported  treatment-emergent  AEs  (i.e.,  those  reported  by  &gt;5%  of subjects  in  the  All  Studies  grouping)  by  extrinsic  factors  did  not  indicate  any  clinically  relevant differences  for  subjects  with  DMARD  use  at  baseline  vs . those  without  and  subjects  with  oral corticosteroid use at baseline vs. those without.

## Safety in special populations

## Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

Overall, four subjects became pregnant during this study. Two (0.5%) subjects were pregnant during the course of the study. One subject experienced an ectopic pregnancy and one subject chose to have an  elective  abortion.  Both  were  reported  as  SAEs.  Two  subjects  reported  pregnancies  following completion of open-label adalimumab treatment (day 511 [62 days post-treatment] and day 449 [70 days post-treatment], respectively). Both delivered healthy babies.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH submitted long-term extension data from the open label study M02-537, which included data up to and beyond 2 years of treatment of PsA patients with adalimumab. The already established safety profile of adalimumab is confirmed. Infections, including some serious and severe, occurred in association  with  adalimumab  treatment,  and  there  was  one  case  of  TB.  Malignancies  (n=10)  were reported in 9 subjects,  and further support the need for continued long-term follow up. There were 71 patients  who  dose  escalated  to  40  mg  ew  during  the  study  period.  Although  the  safety  data presentation  in  subjects  who  dose-escalated  was  brief  in  the  report,  no  further  information  was requested, since the available data are limited and the higher dose is not approved for use in PsA. To conclude, there were no new safety signals identified.

## Risk management plan

The CHMP considered that there was no need for an update of the RMP for this variation.

## Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment

Humira was approved for the use in PsA in August 2005 (variation 22), with the following indication: 'Humira is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response  to  previous  disease-modifying  anti  rheumatic  drug  therapy  has  been  inadequate.'  In  the present  variation  application  the  MAH  proposed  to  change  the  current  indication  to  add  that adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function.

## Benefit

Data on physical function have been assessed previously, and were included in the SPC, section 5.1. Data  showed  that  treatment  with  adalimumab  resulted  in  improved  physical  function,  measured  by various patient reported outcomes. The joint damage claim was based on newly submitted X-ray data from  study  M02-518  and  the  long-term  extension  study  M02-537.  The  effect  of  adalimumab  on progression  of  joint  damage  was  assessed  using  the  mTSS.  It  was  shown  that  adalimumab-treated subjects had statistically significantly less progression in mTSS from baseline to week 48 compared to placebo-treated subjects from baseline to week 24 (0.0 vs. 0.8, p&lt;0.001).

However, maintenance of reduced progression of joint damage was considered difficult to assess, due to the short placebo controlled period and poor knowledge about the natural progression rate in PsA. As symmetric PsA somewhat resembles RA, and based on experience from other anti-TNF agents and the  subgroup analyses provided by the MAH, the CHMP considered that an effect in subjects with symmetrical  disease  could  be  agreed,  while  relevant  effects  in  subjects  with  asymmetrical  disease were less convincing.

## Risk

Based on the submitted data, the safety profile of adalimumab was confirmed. Overall, there were no new safety signals identified in this material.

To  conclude,  there  is  support  for  that  adalimumab  treatment  reduced  the  rate  of  joint  damage progression  in  PsA.  Thus,  the  proposed  revised  indication  is  accepted,  with  the  patient  population specified to those having polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease.

The benefit / risk balance remains positive.

## CONCLUSION

On 13 December 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the SPC and PL.
