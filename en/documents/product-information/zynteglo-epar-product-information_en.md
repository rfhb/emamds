Medicinal product no longer authorised ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Zynteglo 1.2-20 × 10 6 cells/mL dispersion for infusion.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Medicinal product no longer authorised 2.1 General description Zynteglo (betibeglogene autotemcel) is a genetically modified autologous CD34 + cell enriched population that contains haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transduced with lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding the β A-T87Q -globin gene. 2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition The finished product is composed of one or more infusion bags which contain a dispersion of 1.2-20 × 10 6 cells/mL suspended in cryopreservative solution. Each infusion bag contains approximately 20 mL of Zynteglo. The quantitative information regarding strength, CD34 + cells, and dose for the medicinal product is provided in the Lot Information Sheet. The Lot Information Sheet is included inside the lid of the cryoshipper used to transport Zynteglo. Excipient with known effect Each dose contains 391-1564 mg sodium. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Dispersion for infusion. A clear to slightly cloudy, colourless to yellow or pink dispersion. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indication

Zynteglo is indicated for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia (TDT) who do not have a β 0 /β 0  genotype, for whom haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate but a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related HSC donor is not available (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Zynteglo must be administered in a qualified treatment centre by a physician(s) with experience in HSC transplantation and in the treatment of patients with TDT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients are expected to enrol in a registry and will be followed in the registry in order to better understand the long-term safety and efficacy of Zynteglo.

## Posology

The minimum recommended dose of Zynteglo is 5.0 × 10 6  CD34 +  cells/kg. In clinical studies doses up to 20 × 10 6  CD34 +  cells/kg have been administered. The minimum recommended dose is the same for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older.

Zynteglo is intended for autologous use (see section 4.4) and should only be administered once.

## Mobilisation and apheresis

## Zynteglo administration

Medicinal product no longer authorised Patients are required to undergo HSC mobilisation followed by apheresis to obtain CD34 + which will be used for medicinal product manufacturing (see section 5.1 for a description of the mobilisation regimen used in clinical studies). The minimum target number of CD34 +  cells to be collected is 12 × 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg. If the minimum dose of Zynteglo of 5.0 × 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg is not met after initial medicinal product manufacturing, the patient may undergo one or more additional cycles of mobilisation and apheresis, separated by at least 14 days, in order to obtain more cells for additional manufacture. A back-up collection of CD34 + stem cells of ≥1.5 × 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg (if collected by apheresis) or &gt;1.0 × 10 8 TNC/kg (if collected by bone marrow harvest) is required. These cells must be collected from the patient and be cryopreserved prior to myeloablative conditioning and infusion with Zynteglo. The back-up collection may be needed for rescue treatment if there is: 1) compromise of Zynteglo after initiation of myeloablative conditioning and before Zynteglo infusion, 2) primary engraftment failure, or 3) loss of engraftment after infusion with Zynteglo (see section 4.4). Pre-treatment conditioning The treating physician should confirm that HSC transplantation is appropriate for the patient before myeloablative conditioning is initiated (see section 4.4). Full myeloablative conditioning must be administered before infusion of Zynteglo (see section 5.1 for a description of the myeloablative regimen used in clinical studies). It is recommended that patients maintain haemoglobin (Hb) ≥11 g/dL for at least 30 days prior to mobilisation and during myeloablative conditioning. Iron chelation should be stopped at least 7 days prior to myeloablative conditioning. Prophylaxis for hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is recommended. Prophylaxis for seizures should be considered (see section 5.1 for a description of the prophylaxis regimen used in clinical studies). Myeloablative conditioning should not begin until the complete set of infusion bag(s) constituting the dose of Zynteglo has been received and stored at the administration site, and the availability of the back-up collection is confirmed.

See Method of Administration below and section 6.6 for details on Zynteglo administration and handling.

## After Zynteglo administration

Any blood products required within the first 3 months after Zynteglo infusion should be irradiated.

Restarting iron chelation after Zynteglo infusion may be necessary and should be based on clinical practice (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). Phlebotomy can be used in lieu of iron chelation, when appropriate.

## Special populations

## Elderly

Zynteglo has not been studied in patients &gt;65 years of age. HSC transplantation must be appropriate for a patient with TDT to be treated with Zynteglo (see section 4.4). No dose adjustment is required.

## Renal impairment

Zynteglo has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Patients should be assessed for renal impairment defined as creatinine clearance ≤70 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to ensure HSC transplantation is appropriate. No dose adjustment is required.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Hepatic impairment Zynteglo has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients should be assessed for hepatic impairment to ensure HSC transplantation is appropriate (see section 4.4.). No dose adjustment is required. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Zynteglo in children &lt;12 years of age have not yet been established. Patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) Zynteglo has not been studied in patients with HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1, or HTLV-2. A negative serology test for HIV is necessary to ensure acceptance of apheresis material for Zynteglo manufacturing. Apheresis material from patients with a positive test for HIV will not be accepted for Zynteglo manufacturing. Method of administration Zynteglo is for intravenous use only (see section 6.6 for full details on the administration process). After completion of the 4-day course of myeloablative conditioning, there must be a minimum of 48 hours of washout before Zynteglo infusion. Before infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient's identity matches the unique patient information on the Zynteglo infusion bag(s). The total number of infusion bags to be administered should also be confirmed with the Lot Information Sheet (see section 4.4). Zynteglo infusion should be completed as soon as possible and no more than 4 hours after thawing. Each infusion bag should be administered in less than 30 minutes. In the event that more than one infusion bag is provided, all infusion bags must be administered. The entire volume of each infusion bag should be infused. Standard procedures for patient management after HSC transplantation should be followed after Zynteglo infusion.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6).

Previous treatment with HSC gene therapy.

Contraindications to the mobilisation agents and the myeloablative conditioning agent must be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

The traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. To ensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient should be kept for a period of 30 years.

## General

Warnings and precautions of the mobilisation agents and the myeloablative conditioning agent must be considered.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Patients treated with Zynteglo should not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation at any time in the future. This information is provided in the Patient Alert Card which must be given to the patient after treatment. Zynteglo is intended solely for autologous use and must not be administered to other patients. Confirm that the patient's identity matches the unique patient identification information on the Zynteglo infusion bag(s) and metal cassette(s). Do not infuse Zynteglo if the information on the patient specific label on the infusion bag(s) or metal cassette(s) do not match the intended patient. Risks associated with TDT and iron overload Patients with TDT experience iron overload due to chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions that can lead to end organ damage. HSC transplantation with myeloablative conditioning is not appropriate for patients with TDT who have evidence of severely elevated iron in the heart i.e., patients with cardiac T2* &lt;10 msec by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI of the liver should be performed on all patients prior to myeloablative conditioning. It is recommended that patients with MRI results demonstrating liver iron content ≥15 mg/g undergo liver biopsy for further evaluation. If the liver biopsy demonstrates bridging fibrosis, cirrhosis, or active hepatitis, HSC transplantation with myeloablative conditioning is not appropriate. Risk of insertional oncogenesis No cases of myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma have been reported in clinical studies with Zynteglo in patients with TDT. There are no reports of LVV-mediated insertional mutagenesis resulting in oncogenesis after treatment with Zynteglo. Nevertheless, there is a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma after treatment with Zynteglo. Patients should be monitored at least annually for myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma (including with a complete blood count) for 15 years post treatment with Zynteglo. If myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma is detected in any patient who received Zynteglo, blood samples should be collected for integration site analysis. Serological testing

All patients should be tested for HIV-1/2 prior to mobilisation and apheresis to ensure acceptance of the apheresis material for Zynteglo manufacturing (see section 4.2).

## Interference with serology testing

It is important to note that patients who have received Zynteglo are likely to test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV due to LVV provirus insertion, resulting in a false positive test for HIV. Therefore, patients who have received Zynteglo should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Engraftment failure as measured by neutrophil engraftment

Treatment with Zynteglo involves the infusion and engraftment of CD34 +  HSCs that have been genetically modified ex vivo with a LVV. In clinical trials, no patients failed to engraft bone marrow, as measured by neutrophil engraftment (N=45). Neutrophil engraftment occurred on median (min, max) Day 21.0 (13, 38) after medicinal product infusion. Failure of neutrophil engraftment is a short-term but potentially severe risk, defined as failure to achieve 3 consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥500 cells/µL obtained on different days by Day 43 after infusion of Zynteglo. Patients who experience neutrophil engraftment failure should receive rescue treatment with the back-up collection (see section 4.2).

## Delayed platelet engraftment

Medicinal product no longer authorised Platelet engraftment is defined as 3 consecutive platelet values ≥20 × 10 9 /L obtained on different days after Zynteglo infusion, with no platelet transfusions administered for 7 days immediately preceding and during the evaluation period. Patients with TDT treated with Zynteglo who achieved platelet engraftment had a median (min, max) platelet engraftment on Day 42.0 (19, 191) in clinical trials (N=45). No correlation was observed between incidence of bleeding and delayed platelet engraftment. Patients should be made aware of the risk of bleeding until platelet recovery has been achieved. Patients should be monitored for thrombocytopenia and bleeding according to standard guidelines. Platelet counts should be monitored according to medical judgment until platelet engraftment and platelet recovery are achieved. Blood cell count determination and other appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms suggestive of bleeding arise. Anti-retroviral and hydroxyurea use Patients should not take anti-retroviral medications or hydroxyurea from at least one month prior to mobilisation until at least 7 days after Zynteglo infusion (see section 4.5). If a patient requires anti-retrovirals for HIV prophylaxis, Zynteglo treatment, including mobilisation and apheresis of CD34 +  cells through Zynteglo infusion, should be delayed until an HIV infection could be adequately ruled out according to local guidance for HIV testing. Sodium content This medicinal product contains 391-1564 mg sodium per dose equivalent to 20 to 78% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Patients should not take anti-retroviral medicinal products or hydroxyurea from at least one month prior to mobilisation until at least 7 days after Zynteglo infusion (see section 4.4). Drug-drug interactions between iron chelators and the myeloablative conditioning agent must be considered. Iron chelators should be discontinued 7 days prior to initiation of conditioning. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the iron chelator and the myeloablative conditioning agent must be consulted for the recommendations regarding co-administration with CYP3A substrates.

Some iron chelators are myelosuppressive. After Zynteglo infusion, avoid use of these iron chelators for 6 months. If iron chelation is needed, consider administration of non-myelosuppressive iron chelators (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Zynteglo is not expected to interact with the hepatic cytochrome P-450 family of enzymes or drug transporters.

There is no clinical experience with the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients treated with Zynteglo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Zynteglo treatment has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females

There are insufficient exposure data to provide a precise recommendation on duration of contraception following treatment with Zynteglo. Women of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child must use a reliable method of contraception (intra-uterine device or combination of hormonal and barrier contraception) from start of mobilisation through at least 6 months after administration of Zynteglo. Consult the SmPC of the myeloablative conditioning agent for information on the need for effective contraception in patients who undergo conditioning.

Zynteglo has no influence on the ability to drive or use machines.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Pregnancy A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilisation and re-confirmed prior to conditioning procedures and before medicinal product administration. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with Zynteglo were not performed. Zynteglo must not be used during pregnancy because of myeloablative conditioning (see section 4.3). It is unknown whether Zynteglo transduced cells have the potential to be transferred in utero to a foetus. There is no opportunity for germline transmission of the β A-T87Q -globin gene after treatment with Zynteglo, therefore the likelihood that an offspring would have general somatic expression of the β A-T87Q -globin gene is considered negligible. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether Zynteglo is excreted in human milk. The effect of administration of Zynteglo to mothers on their breast-fed children has not been studied. Zynteglo must not be administered to women who are breast-feeding. Fertility There are no data on the effects of Zynteglo on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. Data are available on the risk of infertility with myeloablative conditioning. It is therefore advised to cryopreserve semen or ova before treatment if possible. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

The effect of the mobilisation agents and the myeloablative conditioning agent on the ability to drive or use machines must be considered.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of Zynteglo was evaluated in 45 patients with TDT. The only serious adverse reaction attributed to Zynteglo was thrombocytopenia (2.2%). Given the small patient population and size of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cohorts, adverse reactions in the table below do not provide a complete perspective on the nature and frequency of these events.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency convention. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), and common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Tables 1, 2, and 3 are lists of adverse reactions attributed to mobilisation/apheresis, myeloablative conditioning, and Zynteglo, respectively, experienced by patients with TDT in clinical trials with Zynteglo.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Table 3 Adverse reactions attributed to Zynteglo Description of selected adverse reactions Bleeding

Bleeding is a potential complication of thrombocytopenia subsequent to myeloablative conditioning and treatment with Zynteglo. The majority of all reported bleeding events were nonserious. A risk of bleeding exists before platelet engraftment and may continue after platelet engraftment in patients who have continued thrombocytopenia.

Following platelet engraftment, all patients maintained platelet levels of ≥20 × 10 9 /L. Median (min, max) times to unsupported platelet counts of ≥50 × 10 9 /L  and ≥100 × 10 9 /L were 51 (20, 268) days (N=45) and 63.5 (20, 1231) days (N=42), respectively (see section 4.4 for guidance on platelet monitoring and management).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic veno-occlusive disease

Serious events of hepatic VOD occurred in 11.1% of patients following myeloablative conditioning; 80% of these patients did not receive prophylaxis for VOD. All patients who experienced VOD received treatment with defibrotide and recovered. Patients with TDT may be at an increased risk of VOD following myeloablative conditioning compared with other patient populations.

## Infusion related reactions to Zynteglo

Pre-medication for infusion reactions was managed at physician discretion. Infusion related reactions to Zynteglo were observed in 13.3% of patients and occurred on the day of Zynteglo infusion. All reactions resolved and the majority were mild. Events included abdominal pain, dyspnoea, hot flush, and non-cardiac chest pain in 11.1%, 2.2%, 2.2%, and 2.2% of patients, respectively.

Zynteglo adds functional copies of a modified β-globin gene into the patients' HSCs through transduction of autologous CD34 + cells with BB305 LVV, thereby addressing the underlying genetic cause of the disease. After Zynteglo infusion, transduced CD34 +  HSCs engraft in the bone marrow and differentiate to produce RBCs containing biologically active β A-T87Q -globin (a modified β-globin protein) that will combine with α-globin to produce functional Hb containing β A-T87Q -globin (HbA T87Q ). β A-T87Q -globin can be quantified relative to other globin species in peripheral blood using high performance liquid chromatography. β A-T87Q -globin expression is designed to correct the β/α-globin imbalance in erythroid cells of patients with TDT and has the potential to increase total Hb to normal levels and eliminate dependence on chronic RBC transfusions. Following successful engraftment and achievement of transfusion independence, the effects of the product are expected to be life-long.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Paediatric population According to available data, the frequency, type, and severity of adverse reactions in adolescents 12-17 years of age are similar to adults with the exception that VOD and pyrexia occurred more frequently in adolescents. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No data from clinical studies are available regarding overdose of Zynteglo. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, ATC code: B06AX02 Mechanism of action

## Pharmacodynamic effects

All patients with TDT with a non-β 0 /β 0 genotype who received Zynteglo with at least 3 months of follow-up produced HbA T87Q  (N=10, HGB-204; N=4, HGB-205; N=15, HGB-207; N=3, HGB-212). For patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, HbA T87Q generally increased steadily after Zynteglo infusion and stabilised by approximately Month 6. Patients had a Month 6 median (min, max) HbA T87Q

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 4.901 (1.03, 9.59) g/dL in the Phase 1/2 studies (N=14, HGB-204 and HGB-205) and 9.409 (3.35, 10.60) g/dL in ongoing Phase 3 studies (N=16, HGB-207 and HGB-212).

HbA T87Q  remained generally stable through Month 24 with a median (min, max) of 6.444 (1.10, 10.13) g/dL in the completed Phase 1/2 studies (N=14, HGB-204 and HGB-205) and 8.766 (0.89, 11.40) g/dL in the ongoing Phase 3 studies (N=3, HGB-207). HbA T87Q continued to be stable at last follow-up through Month 60, demonstrating stable integration of the β A-T87Q -globin gene into long-term HSCs and stable expression of the β A-T87Q -globin gene in cells of the erythroid lineage.

Adolescents were excluded from Phase 3 studies if they had a known and available HLA-matched related HSC donor. The median (min, max) age in the studies was 19.0 (12, 34) years, 56.3% were females, 59.4% were Asian, and 40.6% White/Caucasian. All patients had a Karnofsky/Lansky performance score ≥80 and the majority (18/32, 56.3%) had a performance score of 100 at baseline. Cardiac T2* at baseline was &gt;20 msec. The median (min, max) serum ferritin at baseline was 3778.7 (784, 22517) pmol/L and median (min, max) liver iron concentration was 6.75 (1.0, 41.0) mg/g (N=10, HGB-204; N=4, HGB-205; N=15, HGB-207; N=3, HGB-212).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Efficacy was based on 32 adult and adolescent patients with TDT and a non-β 0 /β 0 genotype treated with Zynteglo (N=10, HGB-204; N=4, HGB-205; N=15, HGB-207; N=3, HGB-212) (see Table 4). A few patients have been included in the clinical studies with genotypes characterised by low endogenous β-globin production phenotypically similar to patients with a β 0 /β 0 genotype, such as patients homozygous for IVS-I-110 or IVS-I-5. Table 4 Baseline characteristics for non-β 0 /β 0  patients with TDT ≥12 years of age treated with Zynteglo (Studies HGB-204, HGB-205, HGB-207, HGB-212, LTF-303) *Age range is not provided to protect patient identity. Transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia (TDT) Patients were considered to be transfusion-dependent if they had a history of transfusions of at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or with ≥8 transfusions of RBCs per year in the 2 years preceding enrolment. In the clinical studies, patients received a median (min, max) RBC transfusion volume of 175.74 (138.8, 251.3) mL/kg/year and a median (min, max) number of 14.75 (10.0, 39.5) RBC transfusions per year.

## Mobilisation and apheresis

All patients were administered G-CSF and plerixafor to mobilise stem cells prior to the apheresis procedure. The planned dose of G-CSF was 10 µg/kg/day in patients with a spleen, and 5 µg/kg/day in patients without a spleen, given on Days 1 through 5 of mobilisation in the morning. The planned dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of plerixafor was 0.24 mg/kg/day, given on Days 4 and 5 of mobilisation in the evening. If a third day of collection was needed, plerixafor and G-CSF dosing was extended to Day 6. The dose of G-CSF was decreased by half if white blood cell (WBC) count was &gt;100 × 10 9 /L prior to the day of apheresis. For most patients, the minimum number of CD34 +  cells to manufacture Zynteglo was collected with 1 cycle of mobilisation and apheresis.

## Pre-treatment conditioning

All patients received full myeloablative conditioning with busulfan prior to treatment with Zynteglo. The planned dose of busulfan was 3.2 mg/kg/day for patients ≥18 years as a 3-hour IV infusion daily for 4 days with a recommended target AUC0-24h of 3800-4500 µM*min. The planned dose of busulfan was 0.8 mg/kg for patients 12-17 years of age as a 2-hour IV infusion every 6 hours for a total of 16 doses with a recommended target of AUC0-6h of 950-1125 µM*min. The busulfan SmPC was used for information on appropriate method for determination of patient weight-based dosing. Busulfan dose adjustments were made as needed based on pharmacokinetic monitoring.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The median (min, max) busulfan dose was 3.50 (2.5, 5.0) mg/kg/day (N=32). AUC0-24h was measured during Day 1 and informed the dose for Day 3; the median (min, max) estimated daily AUC was 4394.5 (3030, 9087) μM*min (N=32). All patients with non-β 0 /β 0 genotypes received anti-seizure prophylaxis with agents other than phenytoin prior to initiating busulfan. Phenytoin was not used for anti-seizure prophylaxis because of its well understood induction of glutathione-S-transferase and cytochrome P450 and resultant increased clearance of busulfan, and because of the widespread availability of effective anti-seizure medications that do not affect busulfan metabolism. In HGB-207 and HGB-212 prophylaxis for VOD/hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was required per institutional practice with ursodeoxycholic acid or defibrotide. Zynteglo administration All patients were administered Zynteglo with a median (min, max) dose of 7.80 × 10 6 (5.0, 19.4) CD34 + cells/kg as an intravenous infusion (N=32). After Zynteglo administration A total of 31.1% of patients (14/45; HGB-204, HGB-205, HGB-207, HGB-212) received G-CSF within 21 days after Zynteglo infusion. However, G-CSF use was not recommended for 21 days after Zynteglo infusion in Phase 3 studies. Studies HGB-204 and HGB-205 HGB-204 and HGB-205 were Phase 1/2 open-label, single-arm 24-month studies that included 22 patients with TDT treated with Zynteglo (N=18, HGB-204; N=4, HGB-205), of whom 14 had a non-β 0 /β 0  genotype (N=10, HGB-204; N=4, HGB-205) and 8 had a β 0 /β 0  genotype in HGB-204. All patients completed HGB-204 and HGB-205 and enrolled for long-term follow-up in the LTF-303 study. The median (min, max) duration of follow-up of patients with a non-β 0 /β 0  genotype was 44.63 (35.8, 61.3) months. All patients remain alive at last follow-up.

The primary endpoint was transfusion independence (TI) by Month 24, defined as a weighted average Hb ≥9 g/dL without any RBC transfusions for a continuous period of ≥12 months at any time during the study after infusion of Zynteglo. Of the patients with a non-β 0 /β 0  genotype, 11/14 (78.6%, 95% CI 49.2%-95.3%) achieved TI by Month 24 (Table 5). Among these 11 patients, the median (min, max) weighted average Hb during TI was 10.51 (9.3, 13.3) g/dL (Table 5).

All patients who have achieved TI at any time have maintained TI at Month 36 with a min, max duration of TI of 28.3+, 57.6+ months (N=11). The median (min, max) time to last RBC transfusion was 0.46 (0.2, 5.8) months following Zynteglo infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the 3 patients who did not achieve TI, reductions of 100%, 86.9% and 26.8% in transfusion volume requirements and of 100%, 85.3% and 20.7% in transfusion frequency were observed between Month 6 through Month 24 visit when compared to their pre-study levels of RBC transfusions. Reductions in volume and frequency were maintained at last follow-up in LTF-303.

The median (min, max) total Hb at Month 6 for patients who had not received a transfusion for the prior 60 days was 10.60 (7.6, 13.4) g/dL (N=11). Total Hb remained stable at Month 24 with a median (min, max) of 10.60 (8.8, 13.7) g/dL (N=12) and at Month 36 with a median (min, max) of 10.60 (7.8, 13.5) g/dL (N=13).

Medicinal product no longer authorised After Zynteglo infusion, patient iron chelation was managed at physician discretion. Of the 14 non-β 0/ β 0  patients treated in HGB-204 and HGB-205 that completed Month 6, 9 patients (64.3%) reported ongoing chelation use at last follow-up. The remaining 5 patients (35.7%) had stopped iron chelation, of whom 4 patients (28.6%) have stopped chelation for at least 6 months with median (min, max) time from stopping chelation to last follow-up of 26.40 (11.5, 42.2) months for these 4 patients. Additionally, of the 14 treated patients, 3 patients in HGB-205 (21.4%) received phlebotomy to remove iron. For the 11 patients that achieved TI, 4 patients (36.4%) stopped chelation for at least 6 months and 3 patients (27.3%) received phlebotomy. At 48 months after infusion of Zynteglo for patients who achieved TI, the median reduction (min, max) in serum ferritin levels from baseline was 70.00% (39.2, 84.8) (N=5, HGB-204; N=2, HGB-205). The median reduction in liver iron content from baseline was 62.50%, ranging from an 83.3% reduction to a 269.2% increase (N=5, HGB-204; N=2, HGB-205). Studies HGB-207 and HGB-212 HGB-207 and HGB-212 are ongoing Phase 3 open-label, single-arm 24-month studies that are planned to include approximately 39 adults, adolescents, and children with TDT (N=23, HGB-207; N=16, HGB-212), of whom 29 have a non-β 0 /β 0  genotype (N=23, HGB-207; N=6, HGB-212) and 10 have a β 0 /β 0  genotype in HGB-212. These studies are conducted with improved transduction compared to Phase 1/2 studies, resulting in increased average number of functional copies of the transgene (β A-T87Q -globin) integrated in the autologous CD34 + cells. Eighteen adults and adolescents with TDT with a non-β 0 /β 0 genotype have been treated with Zynteglo in Phase 3 studies (N=15, HGB-207; N=3, HGB-212) and their median (min, max) duration of follow-up was 15.92 (5.6, 26.3) months. All patients remain alive at last follow-up. The primary endpoint was transfusion independence (TI) by Month 24, defined as a weighted average Hb ≥9 g/dL without any RBC transfusions for a continuous period of ≥12 months at any time during the study after infusion of Zynteglo. Ten patients are evaluable for assessment of TI. Of these, 9/10 (90.0%, 95% CI 55.5-99.7%) achieved TI at last follow-up. Among these 9 patients, the median (min, max) weighted average Hb during TI was 12.22 (11.4, 12.8) g/dL (Table 5). All patients who have achieved TI have maintained TI with a min, max duration of TI of 12.1+, 21.3+ months (N=9). The median (min, max) time to last RBC transfusion was 1.08 (0.5, 2.2) months following Zynteglo infusion.

For the only patient who did not achieve TI, a reduction of 51.5% in transfusion volume requirements and a reduction of 43.4% in transfusion frequency were observed from Month 12 to Month 24 when compared to their pre-study levels of RBC transfusions.

The median (min, max) total Hb at Month 6 for patients who had not received a transfusion for the prior 60 days was 11.85 (8.4, 13.3) g/dL (N=18). Total Hb remained stable at Month 24 with a median (min, max) of 12.85 (12.5, 13.2) g/dL (N=2).

After Zynteglo infusion, patient iron chelation was managed at physician discretion. Of the 18 non-β 0 /β 0  patients treated in HGB-207 and HGB-212 that completed Month 6, 5 patients (27.8%) reported ongoing chelation use at last follow-up. The remaining 13 patients (72.2%) had stopped iron

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chelation, of whom 9 patients (50.0%) have stopped chelation for at least 6 months with median (min, max) time from stopping chelation to last follow-up of 16.89 (6.9, 25.4) months for these 9 patients. Additionally, of the 18 treated patients, 5 patients in HGB-207 (27.8%) received phlebotomy to remove iron. For the 9 patients that achieved TI, 6 patients (66.7%) stopped chelation for at least 6 months and 2 patients (22.2%) received phlebotomy.

Exploratory analyses were performed to evaluate resolution of dyserythropoiesis, the fundamental pathophysiological characteristic of TDT, in the bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsies taken before treatment were consistent with a diagnosis of TDT, including a low myeloid/erythroid ratio (N=15, HGB-207; N=3, HGB-212), reflective of erythroid hyperplasia. For 9 patients who achieved TI and had a Month 12 bone marrow assessment, myeloid/erythroid ratios increased from a median (min, max) of 0.2 (0.1 to 0.7) at baseline to a median (min, max) of 0.83 (0.6 to 1.9) at Month 12 after Zynteglo infusion, suggesting that Zynteglo improves erythropoiesis in patients with TDT.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Zynteglo is an autologous gene therapy medicinal product consisting of autologous cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo . The nature of Zynteglo is such that conventional studies on pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are not applicable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Conventional mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted.

The pharmacology, toxicology and genotoxicity of the BB305 LVV used for transduction in the manufacture of Zynteglo were evaluated in vitro and in vivo . An in vitro immortalisation (IVIM) assay conducted with BB305 LVV-transduced mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs) showed minimal mutagenic potential (Fitness Score ≈ 0.1 × 10 -4 ). Insertion site analysis (ISA) of pre-transplantation transduced mouse BMCs and human CD34 +  HSCs showed no enrichment for insertion in or near cancer-related genes. A pharmacology, biodistribution, toxicity and genotoxicity study was conducted in a mouse model of β-thalassaemia. In this study, there was no evidence of toxicity, genotoxicity or oncogenesis (tumorigenicity) related to BB305 LVV integration, and no toxicity related to production of β A-T87Q -globin. ISA of post-transplantation BMCs demonstrated no preferred integration in the proximity of or within genes associated clinically (for gamma retroviral vectors) with either clonal dominance or leukaemia, and no evidence of clonal dominance was observed. Additional studies with human CD34 +  HSCs administered to immunodeficient, myeloablated mice demonstrated no toxicity, tumorigenicity or genotoxicity.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient or carer Zynteglo 1.2-20 × 10 6

## cells/mL dispersion for infusion betibeglogene autotemcel

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

Medicinal product no longer authorised You will be given a Patient Alert Card which contains important safety information that you need to know about your treatment with Zynteglo. You should carry the Patient Alert Card with you at all times and show it to your doctor or nurse when you see them or if you are admitted to the hospital. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. -Read the Patient Alert Card carefully and follow the instructions on it. What is in this leaflet 1. What Zynteglo is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you are given Zynteglo 3. How Zynteglo is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Zynteglo 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Zynteglo is and what it is used for Zynteglo is used to treat a serious genetic disease called transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia (TDT), which includes the disease commonly known as beta-thalassaemia major, in people 12 years and older. People with this condition cannot make enough haemoglobin, a protein in the blood that carries oxygen. More specifically, people with TDT do not make enough of a part of the haemoglobin called beta-globin, due to a gene defect. Because of this defect, people with TDT are anaemic and need frequent blood transfusions to survive. Zynteglo is a type of medicine called gene therapy. It is made specifically for each patient, using the patient's own (also called autologous) blood stem cells. Zynteglo works by adding functional copies of the beta-globin gene into these cells, so that the patient can make enough beta-globin to increase total haemoglobin, improve anaemia, and carry more oxygen around their body. This reduces or eliminates the need for blood transfusions. 2. What you need to know before you are given Zynteglo

## You must not be given Zynteglo if you :

- -are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -are pregnant or breast-feeding
- -have previously received gene therapy of your blood stem cells
- -are allergic to any of the ingredients in the medicines you will be given for mobilisation and chemotherapy (see section 3).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before you are given Zynteglo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before treatment with Zynteglo, you will be given medicines known as mobilisation medicine and chemotherapy medicine (see sections 3 and 4 for more information on these medicines, including possible side effects).

Before treatment with Zynteglo, your doctor will perform tests to make sure your heart and liver are functioning properly so you can be treated safely with Zynteglo.

Zynteglo is made specifically for you, using your own blood stem cells.

After you have been treated with Zynteglo, you will not be able to donate blood, organs, or tissues in the future. This is because Zynteglo is a gene therapy medicine.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Adding a new gene into the DNA of your blood stem cells could theoretically cause myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma, although no patients have developed myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma in clinical trials with Zynteglo. After treatment with Zynteglo, you will be asked to enrol in a registry for at least 15 years in order to better understand the long-term effects of Zynteglo. During the long-term follow-up, your doctor will monitor you for any signs of myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma at least once a year. Zynteglo is prepared using parts of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which have been altered so that they cannot cause HIV infection. The modified virus is used to insert a functional beta-globin gene into your blood stem cells. Although this medicine will not give you HIV infection, having Zynteglo in your blood may cause a false positive HIV test result with some commercial tests that recognise a piece of HIV used to make Zynteglo. If you test positive for HIV following treatment, please contact your doctor or nurse. Before receiving Zynteglo you will be given chemotherapy in order to remove your existing bone marrow. If Zynteglo cannot be administered after chemotherapy or if the modified stem cells do not take hold (engraft) in your body, the doctor may give you an infusion of your own original blood stem cells that were collected and stored before the treatment started (see also section 3, How Zynteglo is given) . After you receive Zynteglo, you may have a low number of platelets in your blood. This means that your blood may not be able to clot as well as normal and you may be prone to bleeding. You must get medical attention if you: · bump your head or have a head injury · have symptoms that could be from internal bleeding, such as unusual stomach or back pain, or severe headache · have abnormal bruising or bleeding (such as bruising without injury, blood in your urine, stool, vomit, or cough up blood). Your doctor will tell you when your platelet count has recovered to normal levels. Other medicines and Zynteglo Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

You should not take hydroxyurea (a medicine for blood disorders) or any medicines for HIV infection from at least one month before you undergo mobilisation until at least 7 days after Zynteglo infusion (see also section 3, How Zynteglo is given).

You should stop taking medicines to remove iron from your body (so-called chelating agents: deferoxamine, deferiprone and/or deferasirox) 7 days before you start the chemotherapy before the infusion of Zynteglo (see section 3, How Zynteglo is given). Your doctor will advise you if and when you should start taking these medicines after Zynteglo infusion.

Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor before you are given this medicine.

If you are a woman, you will be given a pregnancy test before starting mobilisation, before you are given chemotherapy, and before Zynteglo treatment in order to confirm that you are not pregnant.

Women who could become pregnant and men capable of fathering a child must start using a reliable method of contraception from before their blood stem cells are collected and continue until at least 6 months after receiving Zynteglo.  Reliable methods of contraception include intra-uterine device or a combination of oral contraceptive (also know as the pill) and condoms.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised The added gene from Zynteglo will not be passed on to your children. Your children are still at risk of inheriting your original beta-globin gene. You should not be given Zynteglo if you are breast-feeding. It is not known whether the ingredients of Zynteglo can pass into breast milk. It may no longer be possible for you to become pregnant or father a child after receiving chemotherapy medicine. If you are concerned about having children, you should discuss this with your doctor before treatment. Options may include providing reproductive material for storage in a tissue bank to use at a later time. For men, this may be sperm or testicular tissue. For women, this may be eggs (oocytes) or ovarian tissue. Driving and using machines Zynteglo has no influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, the mobilisation and chemotherapy medicines may cause dizziness and fatigue. Avoid driving or using machines if you feel dizzy, tired or unwell. Sodium content This medicine contains 391-1564 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This is equivalent to 20-78% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 3. How Zynteglo is given Zynteglo is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein. It can only be given in a specialised hospital by doctors who are experienced in treating patients with TDT, administering bone marrow transplants, and using gene therapy medicines. Zynteglo can only be made if enough of the right kind of blood stem cells can be collected from your blood (CD34 +  blood stem cells). Approximately 2 months before treatment with Zynteglo, you will be given a mobilisation medicine that will move your blood stem cells from your bone marrow into your blood stream. The blood stem cells can then be collected by a machine that separates blood components (apheresis machine). It may take more than 1 day to collect enough blood stem cells to make Zynteglo and to store as replacement cells if Zynteglo cannot be given or does not work.
