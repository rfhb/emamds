Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

## 1. Introduction

On 28 July 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Xolair, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study ' Special drug use observational study of Xolair in patients with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis aged ≥12 years and &lt;18 years whose symptoms were inadequately controlled despite to conventional therapies (CIGE025F1401) ' is a stand alone study. S tudy F1301 included a smaller number of patients in the age group of ≥ 12 years and &lt; 18 years (especially ≥ 12 years and &lt; 15 years) compared with other age groups. Therefore, as part of pharmacovigilance activities specified in the Japan Risk Management Plan of Xolair, a post-marketing surveillance was to be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Xolair in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, a newly approved indication, aged ≥ 12 years and &lt; 18 years (especially ≥ 12 years and &lt; 15 years) (only patients with severe to most severe symptoms who had not respond adequately to conventional therapy).

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Xolair (omalizumab) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and prevents binding of IgE to the high affinity FcεRI receptor, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the allergic cascade. Xolair is available as 75 mg and 150 mg powder vial and solvent for solution for subcutaneous injection (lyophilized formulation) and as 75 mg and 150 mg solution for subcutaneous injection in pre-filled syringe. The initial dose of Xolair varied between 375 and 600 mg in patients treated every 2 weeks and between 150 mg and 600 mg in patients treated every 4 weeks.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study CIGE025F1401: 'Special drug use observational study of Xolair in patients with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis aged ≥12 years and &lt;18 years whose symptoms were inadequately controlled despite to conventional therapies'

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Clinical study number and title

Study CIGE025F1401: Special drug use observational study of Xolair in patients with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis aged ≥ 12 years and &lt; 18 years whose symptoms were inadequately controlled despite to conventional therapies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description

Study CIGE025F1401 was an open-label, multicenter, uncontrolled, single-arm special drug use trial using a central registration system in patients with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis aged ≥12 years and &lt;18 years whose symptoms were inadeq uately controlled despite to conventional therapies and were then administered Xolair.

The observation period was of 24 weeks, with Day 1 defined as the start date of Xolair treatment. Because of the duration of Xolair treatment depended on the pollen dispersal situation and other factors, patients who completed or discontinued Xolair treatment before the visit at 24 weeks after the start of treatment, were followed up to 30 days after their last dose of Xolair.

## Methods

## Study participants

The study population included 50 paediatric patients (aged ≥ 12&lt; 18 years) diagnosed with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms, inadequately controlled despite conventional therapy.

Inclusion criteria

1. Patients who used Xolair in accordance with the instructions of Japan package insert
2. Patients aged ≥ 12 years and &lt; 18 years at the start of Xolair
3. Patients who used Xolair for the following indication: Indication: seasonal allergic rhinitis (only patients with severe to most severe symptoms whose symptoms were inadequately controlled despite to conventional therapy)
4. Patients having provided written consent to participate in this study before the start of Xolair in the relevant pollen season, in person and from their legally acceptable representative (legal representative)

Exclusion criteria

1. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the Xolair ingredients

## Treatments

The investigator treated patients in accordance with the Japan package insert.

## Sample size

Although there are many patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis in Japan, the target number of patients was set at 30 in consideration of the target patient population of Xolair being patients with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis not responding adequately to conventional therapy, as well as the actual number of enrolled paediatric patients and the registration period in the special drug use investigations for the other approved indications such as bronchial asthma.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was a non-randomized study. Blinding/masking methods were not applicable.

Due to the nature of this non-interventional study, all statistical analyses were solely descriptive. In general, data used for analyses were information before Xolair treatment and protocol-specified data during the observation period (including the follow-up period), except for the outcome and date of outcome of adverse events. All statistical analyses were performed by Novartis Pharma K. K. and EPS Corporation using SAS version 9.4 or higher.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 50 paediatric patients were enrolled in 16 sites and had their registration confirmed (registration form received and confirmed) and CRF locked. Of these patients, 4 patients did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were excluded from the safety and efficacy analysis.

N = Number of patients analyzed for efficacy, m = number of patients evaluated at each evaluation timepoint

The denominator was the number of patients evaluated at each evaluation timepoint.

The severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis comprehensively assessed by physicians was severe or higher in 82.7% of the patients in the efficacy analysis population at baseline. However, this proportion decreased over time, and the severity was moderate or lower in 86.7% of the patients at the last evaluation. Similarly, nasal symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal obstruction) and difficulty in daily activities tended to improve continuously after baseline.

The investigator assessed the severity of each seasonal allergic rhinitis symptom (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, difficulty in daily activity) at each visit (with or without Xolair administration) in accordance with the criteria in the Practical Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan (2016), using '4+,' '3+,' '2+,' '1+,' or '-,' and recorded the assessment in the CRF.

The results of analysis considering the full-scale dispersal period of cedar pollen showed a similar tendency of improvement in severity of the disease and severity of each symptom.

Each factor that may affect the efficacy of Xolair was examined (including age, the effect on the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis by duration of treatment with Xolair, the effect on the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis by severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis at the first visit and between patients with and without a history of treatment with Xolair for seasonal allergic rhinitis) but no factor that greatly affects the efficacy was found in this study.

There was no notable difference in the effect on the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients who started Xolair in January or February. Since patients who started Xolair in March or later received only 1 or 2 doses, it was difficult to evaluate the effect on the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

## Safety results

In the safety analysis population (46 patients), the median (minimum to maximum) safety analysis period was 71.0 (18 to 131) days.

The patient with seasonal allergy was a 16-year-old woman who received Xolair every 2 weeks. Seasonal allergy (event verbatim, worsening of primary disease) occurred on Day 43 after the first dose of Xolair, which was resolving on Day 50 after onset. The event was reported to be mild in severity and not related to Xolair. The patient with injection site pain was a 16-year-old man who received Xolair every 2 weeks. Injection site pain occurred on Day 42 after the first dose of Xolair, which resolved on Day 44 after onset. The event was reported to be mild in severity and related to Xolair.

No serious adverse events or deaths were observed. There were no adverse events leading to discontinuation of Xolair.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for paediatric studies, the MAH submitted the final study report of 'Special drug use observational study of Xolair in patients with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis aged ≥ 12 ye ars and &lt; 18 years whose symptoms were inadequately controlled despite to conventional therapies\".

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The condition studied is not approved within EU/EES and as the submitted study was an uncontrolled, open-label study there are limitations to the evaluation of efficacy and safety. However, in the study, including 46 paediatric patients, there are no findings questioning the previously confirmed positive benefit-risk balance in the paediatric population previously concluded. The reported AEs for the paediatric population were in line with the known safety profile of Xolair.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Study CIGE025F1401 included 46 patients with severe to most severe seasonal allergic rhinitis aged ≥12 years and &lt;18 years receiving omalizumab. Xolair is approved for the treatment of severe persistent allergic asthma, chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) / Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) and Nasal Polyps in the EU/EEA. The indication seasonal allergic rhinitis is never applied for. The Applicant does not plan to update the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) with results from this study. This is considered reasonable due to the limited study size and the design of the study.

Overall, the safety profile of Xolair observed in the paediatric study CIGE025F1401 was consistent with the already known safety profile of Xolair.
