## Posology

Adults

The recommended dose in adults is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) all taken together orally every 12 hours for 5 days.

Paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg

The recommended dose in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg is shown below in Table 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1: Recommended dose for paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg

| Patient population                                         | Recommended dose                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Paediatric patients ≥6 years of age weighing ≥40 kg        | 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) all taken together orally every 12 hours for 5 days |
| Paediatric patients ≥6 years of age weighing ≥20 to <40 kg | 150 mg nirmatrelvir (one 150 mg tablet) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) taken together orally every 12 hours for 5 days      |

## Special attention for paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg to less than 40 kg

There is a pack specific for paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg to less than 40 kg. This pack contains 5 blister cards with two separated parts each containing one tablet of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir for administration every 12 hours.

Paxlovid should be administered as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made and within 5 days of symptom onset. Completion of the full 5-day treatment course is recommended even if the patient requires hospitalisation due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with this medicinal product.

If the patient misses a dose within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 to &lt; 90 mL/min]. In adult patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to &lt; 60 mL/min) or with severe renal impairment [eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min, including patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) under haemodialysis], the dose should be reduced as shown in Table 2 to avoid over-exposure. The treatment should be administered at approximately the same time each day for 5 days. On days patients with severe renal impairment undergo haemodialysis, the dose should be administered after haemodialysis (see section 5.2).

Table 2: Recommended dose and regimen for adult patients with renal impairment

| Renal function                                                                     | Days of treatment   | Dose and dose frequency                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min)                               | Days 1-5            | 150 mg nirmatrelvir (one 150 mg tablet) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) every 12 hours |
| Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) including those requiring haemodialysis | Day 1               | 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) once          |
| Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) including those requiring haemodialysis | Days 2-5            | 150 mg nirmatrelvir (one 150 mg tablet) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) once daily     |

Abbreviation: eGFR=estimated glomerular filtration rate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special attention for patients with MODERATE renal impairment

There is a pack specific for patients with moderate renal impairment. This pack contains 5 blister cards with two separated parts each containing one tablet of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir for administration every 12 hours.

## Special attention for patients with SEVERE renal impairment

There is a pack specific for patients with severe renal impairment. This pack contains 1 blister card with one separated part containing two tablets of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir for administration once on Day 1, and four additional separated parts each containing one tablet of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir for administration once daily on Days 2 to 5.

Although the safety and pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have not been studied in paediatric patients with renal impairment, dose reduction in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg with renal impairment should parallel that recommended for adults with the same degree of renal impairment (see Table 2) (see section 5.2).

Dose in paediatric patients with renal impairment weighing less than 40 kg has not been determined.

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is needed for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (ChildPugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Paxlovid should not be used in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Severely immunocompromised population

Data are limited in severely immunocompromised individuals. A treatment duration of 10 days may help to mitigate the risk of virological rebound in patients with severe immunodepression (e.g. active haematologic malignancies, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CAR T-cell therapy or B-cell depleting therapies) (see section 5.1).

## Concomitant therapy with ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimen

No dose adjustment is needed. Patients diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are receiving ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimen should continue their treatment as indicated.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Paxlovid in paediatric patients below 6 years of age or weighing less than 20 kg have not been established.

Paediatric dosing for paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg is based on the results from a paediatric study (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

## Method of administration

For oral use.

Nirmatrelvir must be coadministered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly coadminister nirmatrelvir with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of this active substance that will be insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

This medicinal product can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed, as no data is currently available.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Medicinal products listed below are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible medicinal products that are contraindicated with Paxlovid.

Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions.

- Sedative/hypnotics: clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, oral midazolam and triazolam
- Vasopressin receptor antagonists: tolvaptan

Medicinal products that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance.

- Antibiotics: rifampicin, rifapentine
- Anticancer drugs: apalutamide, enzalutamide
- Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone
- Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators: lumacaftor/ivacaftor
- Herbal products: St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )

Paxlovid cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A4 inducer (see section 4.5).

A multi-disciplinary approach (e.g., involving physicians and specialists in clinical pharmacology) should be considered to determine the adequate timing for Paxlovid initiation taking into account the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer and the need to initiate Paxlovid within 5 days of symptom onset.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Risk of serious adverse reactions due to interactions with other medicinal products

Management of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in high-risk COVID-19 patients receiving multiple concomitant medications can be complex and require a thorough understanding of the nature and magnitude of interaction with all concomitant medications. In certain patients, a multi-disciplinary approach (e.g., involving physicians and specialists in clinical pharmacology) should be considered for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

management of DDIs especially if concomitant medications are withheld, their dose is reduced, or if monitoring of side effects is necessary.

## Effects of Paxlovid on other medicinal products

Initiation of Paxlovid, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A or initiation of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A in patients already receiving Paxlovid, may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A (see section 4.5).

## Coadministration of Paxlovid with calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors

Consultation of a multidisciplinary group (e.g., involving physicians, specialists in immunosuppressive therapy, and/or specialists in clinical pharmacology) is required to handle the complexity of this coadministration by closely and regularly monitoring immunosuppressant blood concentrations and adjusting the dose of the immunosuppressant in accordance with the latest guidelines (see section 4.5).

## Effects of other medicinal products on Paxlovid

Initiation of medicinal products that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of Paxlovid, respectively.

These interactions may lead to:

- Clinically significant adverse reactions with severe, life-threatening or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicinal products.
- Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of Paxlovid.
- Loss of therapeutic effect of Paxlovid and possible development of viral resistance.

See Table 3 for medicinal products that are contraindicated for concomitant use with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and for potentially significant interactions with other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Potential for interactions should be considered with other medicinal products prior to and during Paxlovid therapy; concomitant medicinal products should be reviewed during Paxlovid therapy and the patient should be monitored for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medicinal products.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions and serious skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with Paxlovid (see section 4.8). If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue this medicinal product and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

## Severe hepatic impairment

No pharmacokinetic and clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, this medicinal product should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

## Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering this medicinal product to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities or hepatitis.

## Elevation in blood pressure

Cases of hypertension, generally non serious and transient, have been reported during treatment with Paxlovid. Specific attention including regular monitoring of blood pressure should be paid notably to elderly patients since they are at higher risk of experiencing serious complications of hypertension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk of HIV-1 resistance development

Because nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.

## Excipients

## Lactose

Nirmatrelvir tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Sodium

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets each contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effect of other medicinal products on Paxlovid

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates.

Coadministration of Paxlovid with medicinal products that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce Paxlovid therapeutic effect.

Coadministration of Paxlovid with medicinal product that inhibits CYP3A4 may increase nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations.

## Effects of Paxlovid on other medicinal products

## Medicinal products CYP3A4 substrates

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and increases plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Thus, coadministration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with medicinal products highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated (see Table 3). Coadministration of other CYP3A4 substrates that may lead to potentially significant interaction (see Table 3) should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks.

## Medicinal products CYP2D6 substrates

Based on in vitro studies, ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 &gt; CYP2D6. Coadministration of Paxlovid with drug substrates of CYP2D6 may increase the CYP2D6 substrate concentration.

## Medicinal products P-glycoprotein substrates

Paxlovid also has a high affinity for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and inhibits this transporter; caution should thus be exercised in case of concomitant treatment. Close drug monitoring for safety and efficacy should be performed, and dose reduction may be adjusted accordingly, or avoid concomitant use.

Paxlovid may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.

Based on in vitro studies there is a potential for nirmatrelvir to inhibit MDR1 and OATP1B1 at clinically relevant concentrations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dedicated drug-drug interactions studies conducted with Paxlovid indicate that the drug interactions are primarily due to ritonavir. Hence, drug interactions pertaining to ritonavir are applicable for Paxlovid.

Medicinal products listed in Table 3 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible medicinal products that are contraindicated or may interact with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Careful monitoring of adverse effects is recommended when these medicines are coadministered with Paxlovid.                                       |
| Analgesics                         | ↑ Buprenorphine (57%, 77%)                                  | The increases of plasma levels of buprenorphine and its active metabolite did not lead to clinically significant pharmacodynamic changes in a population of opioid tolerant patients. Adjustment to the dose of buprenorphine may therefore not be necessary when the two are dosed together.                                                                               |

If concomitant use with Paxlovid is necessary, consider a dose reduction of these narcotic analgesics and closely monitor therapeutic and adverse effects (including respiratory depression). Refer to the individual SmPCs for more information. |
| Analgesics                         | ↓ Methadone (36%, 38%)                                      | Increased methadone dose may be necessary when coadministered with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer due to induction of glucuronidation. Monitor methadone-maintained patients closely for evidence of withdrawal effects. Dose adjustment should be considered based on the patient's clinical response to methadone therapy.                                 |

Coadministration of ibrutinib and ritonavir should be avoided. If the benefit is considered to outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be used, reduce the ibrutinib dose to 140 mg and monitor patient closely for toxicity.                                                                                                                     |

Decreased R-warfarin levels may lead to reduced anticoagulation, therefore it is recommended that anticoagulation parameters are monitored when warfarin is coadministered with ritonavir.                                                                           |
| Anticonvulsants           | Carbamazepine*, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Primidone                            | Carbamazepine decreases AUC and C max of nirmatrelvir by 55% and 43%, respectively. Phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone are strong CYP3A4 inducers, and this may lead to a decreased exposure of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir and potential loss of virologic response. Concomitant use of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone with Paxlovid is contraindicated (see section 4.3).                                     |

Due to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and hepatic adverse reactions, a dose reduction of ketoconazole should be considered when coadministered with ritonavir.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Antidepressants           | ↑ Amitriptyline, Fluoxetine, Imipramine, Nortriptyline, Paroxetine, Sertraline | Ritonavir administered at high dose in accordance with its previous use as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine or sertraline. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir. |

Thereby, increasing the risk of serious arrhythmias from this agent and therefore concomitant use with Paxlovid is contraindicated (see section 4.3).                                                                                                                       |
| Anti-HIV                  | ↑Bictegravir/ ↔ Emtricitabine/ ↑Tenofovir                   | Ritonavir may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of bictegravir through CYP3A inhibition. Ritonavir is expected to increase the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide by inhibition of P-gp, thereby increasing the systemic concentration of tenofovir.                                                        |

While rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir coadministration. The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition.

Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus. This coadministration should only be considered with close and regular monitoring of immunosuppressant blood concentrations, to reduce the dose of the immunosuppressant in accordance with the latest guidelines and to avoid over-exposure and subsequent increase of serious adverse reactions of the immunosuppressant. It is important that the close and regular monitoring is performed not only during the coadministration with Paxlovid but is also pursued after the treatment with Paxlovid. As overall recommended for managing the drug-drug interaction, consultation of a multidisciplinary group is required to handle the complexity of this coadministration (see section 4.4). |

|                           | ↑ Oral Midazolam (1330%, 268%)* and parenteral Midazolam    | Midazolam is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4. Coadministration with Paxlovid may cause a large increase in the concentration of midazolam. Plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore, coadministration of Paxlovid with orally administered midazolam is contraindicated (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with coadministration of Paxlovid and parenteral midazolam. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggests a possible 3- to 4-fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. If Paxlovid is coadministered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dose adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. |

However, because ritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro , the recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. In contrast to long-term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant interaction with bupropion after short-term administration of low doses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting reductions in bupropion concentrations may have onset several days after initiation of ritonavir coadministration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Steroids                  | Budesonide, Inhaled, injectable or intranasal fluticasone propionate, Triamcinolone | Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 86%) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal fluticasone propionate; similar effects could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised by CYP3A e.g., budesonide and triamcinolone. Consequently, concomitant administration of ritonavir at high dose in accordance with its previous use as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may be required over a longer period. |

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

There are limited data on the use of Paxlovid in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes; women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with this medicinal product and as a precautionary measure for 7 days after completing the treatment.

Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Patients using combined hormonal contraceptives should be advised to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception during treatment with this medicinal product, and until one menstrual cycle after stopping the treatment (see section 4.5).

## Pregnancy

There are limited data from the use of Paxlovid in pregnant women.

Animal data with nirmatrelvir have shown developmental toxicity in the rabbit (lower foetal body weights) but not in the rat (see section 5.3).

A large number of women exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy indicate no increase in the rate of birth defects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems.

Animal data with ritonavir have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Paxlovid is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless the clinical condition requires treatment with this medicinal product.

## Breast-feeding

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are excreted in breast milk (see section 5.2).

There are no available data on the effects of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir on the breast-fed newborn/infant or on milk production. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment and as a precautionary measure for 48 hours after completing the treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

There are no human data on the effect of Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) or ritonavir alone on fertility. Both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, tested separately, produced no effects on fertility in rats (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Paxlovid is expected to have no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions reported during treatment with Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) were dysgeusia (4.6%), diarrhoea (3.0%), headache (1.2%) and vomiting (1.2%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile of the product is based on adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and spontaneous reporting.

The adverse reactions in Table 4 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1000); not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Patients with severe renal impairment

Based on limited data from a Phase 1, open-label study, the safety profile of Paxlovid in participants with severe renal impairment, including those requiring haemodialysis, was consistent with the safety profile observed in clinical trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety of Paxlovid in paediatric patients was evaluated in a Phase 2/3, open-label, single-arm study (see section 5.1).

In the study analysis, 75 participants 6 to less than 18 years of age weighing at least 20 kg were included in the assessment of safety. The adverse reaction profile observed in this study is similar to that in the adult population.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix Ⅴ .

## 4.9 Overdose

Treatment of overdose with Paxlovid should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with this medicinal product.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE30

## Mechanism of action

Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also referred to as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) or nsp5 protease. Inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro renders the protein incapable of processing polyprotein precursors which leads to the prevention of viral replication.

Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir.

## Antiviral activity

Nirmatrelvir exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection of differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (dNHBE) cells, a primary human lung alveolar epithelial cell line (EC50 value of 61.8 nM and EC90 value of 181 nM) after 3 days of drug exposure.

The antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir against the Omicron sub-variants BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, BA.4.6, BA.5, BF.7 (P252L+F294L), BF.7 (T243I), BQ.1.11, BQ.1, XBB.1.5, EG.5, and JN.1 was assessed in Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of a P-gp inhibitor. Nirmatrelvir had a median EC50 value of 88 nM (range: 39-146 nM) against the Omicron sub-variants, reflecting EC50 value foldchanges ≤ 1.8 relative to the USA-WA1/2020 isolate.

In addition, the antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir against the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron BA.1 variants was assessed in Vero E6 P-gp knockout cells. Nirmatrelvir had a median EC50 value of 25 nM (range: 16-141 nM). The Beta variant was the least susceptible

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

variant tested, with an EC50 value fold-change of 3.7 relative to USA-WA1/2020. The other variants had EC50 value foldchanges ≤ 1.1 relative to USA-WA1/2020.

## Antiviral resistance in cell cultures and biochemical assays

SARS-CoV-2 M pro  residues potentially associated with nirmatrelvir resistance have been identified using a variety of methods, including SARS-CoV-2 resistance selection, testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses with M pro  substitutions, and biochemical assays with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 M pro containing amino acid substitutions. Table 5 indicates M pro substitutions and combinations of M pro substitutions that have been observed in nirmatrelvir-selected SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Individual M pro substitutions are listed regardless of whether they occurred alone or in combination with other M pro substitutions. Note that the M pro S301P and T304I substitutions overlap the P6 and P3 positions of the nsp5/nsp6 cleavage site located at the C-terminus of M pro . Substitutions at other M pro cleavage sites have not been associated with nirmatrelvir resistance in cell culture. The clinical significance of these substitutions is unknown.

## Table 5: SARS-CoV-2 M pro  amino acid substitutions selected by nirmatrelvir in cell culture (with EC50 fold change &gt; 5)

S144A (2.2-5.3), E166V (25-288), P252L (5.9), T304I (1.4-5.5), T21I+S144A (9.4), T21I+E166V (83), T21I+A173V (3.1-8.9), T21I+T304I (3.0-7.9), L50F+E166V (34-175), L50F+T304I (5.9), F140L+A173V (10.1), A173V+T304I (20.2), T21+L50F+A193P+S301P (28.8), T21I+S144A+T304I (27.8), T21I+C160F+A173V+V186A+T304I (28.5), T21I+A173V+T304I (15), L50F+F140L+L167F+T304I (54.7)

Most single and some double M pro amino acid substitutions identified which reduced the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to nirmatrelvir resulted in an EC50 shift of &lt; 5-fold compared to wild type SARS-CoV-2. In general, triple and some double M pro amino acid substitutions led to EC50 changes of &gt; 5-fold to that of wild type. The clinical significance of these substitutions needs to be further understood.

## Viral load rebound

Post-treatment viral nasal RNA rebounds were observed on Day 10 and/or Day 14 in a subset of Paxlovid and placebo recipients in EPIC-HR, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. The incidence of viral rebound in EPIC-HR occurred in both the Paxlovid treated participants and the untreated (placebo) participants, but at a numerically higher incidence in the Paxlovid arm (6.3% vs. 4.2%). Viral rebound and recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms were not associated with progression to severe disease including hospitalisation, death or emergence of resistance.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of Paxlovid is based on the interim analysis and the supporting final analysis of EPIC-HR, a Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in non-hospitalised, symptomatic adult participants with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eligible participants were 18 years of age and older with at least 1 of the following risk factors for progression to severe disease: diabetes, overweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m 2 ), chronic lung disease (including asthma), chronic kidney disease, current smoker, immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive treatment, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, sickle cell disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, active cancer, medically-related technological dependence, or were 60 years of age and older regardless of comorbidities. Participants with COVID19 symptom onset of ≤ 5 days were included in the study. The study excluded individuals with a history of prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination.

Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death from any cause through Day 28. The analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set (all treated participants with onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapeutic mAb treatment), the mITT1 analysis set (all treated participants with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment), and the mITT2 analysis set (all treated participants with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days).

A total of 2113 participants were randomised to receive either Paxlovid or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 45 years with 12% of participants 65 years of age and older (3% were 75 years of age and older); 51% were male; 71% were White, 4% were Black or African American, and 15% were Asian; 41% were Hispanic or Latino; 67 % of participants had onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days before initiation of study treatment; 80% had a BMI &gt; 25 kg/m 2  (36% a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m 2 ); 11% had diabetes mellitus; less than 1% of the study population had immune deficiency, 49% of participants were serological negative at baseline and 49% were serological positive. The mean (SD) baseline viral load was 4.71 log10 copies/mL (2.89); 27% of participants had a baseline viral load of &gt; 10^7 (copies/mL); 6.0% of participants either received or were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment at the time of randomisation and were excluded from the mITT and mITT1 analyses. The primary SARS-CoV-2 variant across both treatment arms was Delta (99%), mostly clade 21J.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the Paxlovid and placebo groups.

The determination of primary efficacy was based on a planned interim analysis of 754 participants in mITT population. The estimated risk reduction was -6.5% with unadjusted 95% CI of (-9.3%, -3.7%) and a 95% CI of (-10.92%, -2.09%) when adjusting for multiplicity. The 2-sided p-value was &lt; 0.0001 with 2-sided significance level of 0.002.

Table 6 provides results of the primary endpoint in the mITT1 analysis population for the full data set at final study completion.

## Post-hoc subgroup analysis in severely immunocompromised participants

A post-hoc subgroup analysis in severely immunocompromised participants (e.g., active haematologic malignancies, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CAR T-cell therapy or B-cell depleting therapies) has been performed and was derived from EPIC-IC (C4671034) study in immunocompromised participants. In participants who were severely immunocompromised, the median time to achieving NP swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA &lt;LLOQ was numerically longer in the 5-day treatment group (28 days) compared with the 10-day (13 days) and 15-day (15 days) treatment groups. The proportion of participants with both a positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test and any self-reported targeted symptom of COVID 19 from Day 15 through Day 44 was 33.3% (6 of 18 participants), 6.3% (1 of 16 participants), and 0% (0 of 16 participants) in the 5-, 10- and 15-day nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment groups, respectively. The incidence of viral RNA rebound observed in the severely immunocompromised participants was 25% (5 of 20 participants), 0% (0 of 17 participants) and 5% (1 of 20 participants) in the 5-, 10-, and 15-day Paxlovid treatment groups, respectively.

## Paediatric population

Paxlovid was evaluated in a Phase 2/3, open-label, single-arm study (EPIC-PEDS, C4671026) investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in non-hospitalised symptomatic paediatric participants with confirmed COVID-19 who are at risk of progression to severe disease. Data are available from 75 participants 6 to less than 18 years of age weighing at least 20 kg who received Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg or 300 mg/100 mg) orally every 12 hours for 5 days. The most frequently reported risk factors at baseline for progression to severe disease were obesity (49%) and chronic lung disease (40%).

Efficacy in paediatric patients is based on matching exposure to adult COVID-19 patients.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Paxlovid in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have been studied in healthy participants and in participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Ritonavir is administered with nirmatrelvir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer resulting in higher systemic concentrations and longer half-life of nirmatrelvir.

Upon repeat-dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 75 mg/100 mg, 250 mg/100 mg, and 500 mg/100 mg administered twice daily, the increase in systemic exposure at steady-state appears to be less than dose proportional. Multiple dosing over 10 days achieved steady-state on Day 2 with approximately 2-fold accumulation. Systemic exposures on Day 5 were similar to Day 10 across all doses.

## Absorption

Following oral administration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg after a single dose, the geometric mean nirmatrelvir Cmax and AUCinf at steady-state was 2.21 µg/mL and 23.01 µg*hr/mL, respectively. The median time to Cmax (Tmax) was 3.00 hrs. The arithmetic mean terminal elimination half-life was 6.1 hours.

Following oral administration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg after a single dose, the geometric mean ritonavir Cmax and AUCinf was 0.36 µg/mL and 3.60 µg*hr/mL, respectively. The median time to Cmax (Tmax) was 3.98 hrs. The arithmetic mean terminal elimination half-life was 6.1 hours.

## Effect of food on oral absorption

Dosing with a high fat meal increased the exposure of nirmatrelvir (approximately 61% increase in mean Cmax and 20% increase in mean AUClast) relative to fasting conditions following administration of 300 mg nirmatrelvir (2 × 150 mg)/100 mg ritonavir tablets.

## Distribution

The protein binding of nirmatrelvir in human plasma is approximately 69%.

The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98-99%.

## Biotransformation

In vitro studies assessing nirmatrelvir without concomitant ritonavir suggest that nirmatrelvir is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. However, administration of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of nirmatrelvir. In plasma, the only medicinal product-related entity observed was unchanged nirmatrelvir. Minor oxidative metabolites were observed in the faeces and urine.

In vitro studies utilising human liver microsomes have demonstrated that CYP3A is the major isoform involved in ritonavir metabolism, although CYP2D6 also contributes to the formation of oxidation metabolite M -2.

## Elimination

The primary route of elimination of nirmatrelvir when administered with ritonavir was renal excretion of intact medicinal product. Approximately 49.6% and 35.3% of the administered dose of nirmatrelvir 300 mg was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. Nirmatrelvir was the predominant drug-related entity with small amounts of metabolites arising from hydrolysis reactions in excreta. In plasma, the only drug-related entity quantifiable was unchanged nirmatrelvir.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Human studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was primarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, part of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir .

## Specific populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir following nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg or 300 mg/100 mg dosing twice daily have been evaluated in 68 paediatric participants 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg (see section 5.1).

Population pharmacokinetic analyses and model-based simulation demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in paediatric participants 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg were similar to those in adult participants after accounting for weight differences (Table 8), with Cmax, AUCtau, and Cmin values of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.7-fold higher, respectively. The recommended paediatric dosing regimens in participants 6 years of age and older weighing at least 20 kg result in no clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to those in adults receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg twice daily for 5 days (see section 4.2).

There is insufficient information to assess the exposure of Paxlovid in paediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg.

## Age and gender

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir based on age and gender have not been evaluated.

## Racial or ethnic groups

Systemic exposure in Japanese participants was numerically lower but not clinically meaningfully different than those in Western participants.

## Renal impairment

Compared to healthy controls with no renal impairment, the Cmax and AUC of nirmatrelvir in adult patients with mild renal impairment was 30% and 24% higher, in adult patients with moderate renal impairment was 38% and 87% higher, and in adult patients with severe renal impairment was 48% and 204% higher, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Severe renal impairment including those requiring haemodialysis

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir in adult participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and severe renal impairment (eGFR&lt; 30 mL/min) either requiring haemodialysis (n=12) or not requiring haemodialysis (n=2) were evaluated after administration of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once on Day 1 followed by 150 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once daily on Days 2-5 for a total of 5 doses.

During a 4-hour haemodialysis session, approximately 6.9% of nirmatrelvir dose was cleared through dialysis. Haemodialysis clearance was 1.83 L/h.

Population pharmacokinetic model-based simulations showed that administration of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once on Day 1 followed by 150 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir once daily on Days 2-5 in adult participants with severe renal impairment resulted in comparable exposures on Day 1 and at steady-state (AUC0-24 and Cmax) to those observed in adult participants with normal renal function receiving 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily for 5 days.

Based on the results of population PK analysis model-based simulation, dose reduction in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg with renal impairment should parallel that recommended for adults with the same degree of renal impairment.

Dose in paediatric patients with renal impairment weighing less than 40 kg has not been determined.

## Hepatic impairment

Compared to healthy controls with no hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir in participants with moderate hepatic impairment was not significantly different. Adjusted geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUCinf and Cmax of nirmatrelvir comparing moderate hepatic impairment (test) to normal hepatic function (reference) was 98.78% (70.65%, 138.12%) and 101.96% (74.20%, 140.11%), respectively.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

## Breast-feeding mothers

Following 3 doses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg administered twice daily in 8 healthy lactating women, under high-fat high-calorie fed conditions, both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were excreted into breast milk. The estimated milk to plasma ratios for Cmax and AUC were 0.27 and 0.26, respectively for nirmatrelvir and 0.06 and 0.07, respectively for ritonavir.

## Interaction studies conducted with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir

CYP3A4 was the major contributor to the oxidative metabolism of nirmatrelvir when nirmatrelvir was tested alone in human liver microsomes. Ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and increases plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir and other drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Despite being coadministered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, there is potential for strong inhibitors and inducers to alter the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir.

Nirmatrelvir does not reversibly inhibit CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, or CYP1A2 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro study results showed nirmatrelvir may be inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. The clinical relevance is unknown. Based on in vitro data, nirmatrelvir has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, MATE1, MATE2K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B3, OCT1 and OCT2. There is a potential for nirmatrelvir to inhibit MDR1 and OATP1B1 at clinically relevant concentrations.

The effect on the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was assessed with itraconazole (CYP3A inhibitor) and carbamazepine (CYP3A inducer). The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means for nirmatrelvir AUCinf and Cmax were 44.50% and 56.82%, respectively, following nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg coadministration with multiple oral doses of carbamazepine. The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means for nirmatrelvir AUCtau and Cmax were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

138.82% and 118.57%, respectively, when nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was coadministered with multiple doses of itraconazole as compared to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir administered alone.

The effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on other drugs was assessed with midazolam (CYP3A substrate), dabigatran (P-gp substrate), and rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate). The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means for midazolam AUCinf and Cmax were 1430.02% and 368.33%, respectively, when midazolam was coadministered with multiple doses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir compared to midazolam administered alone. The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means for dabigatran AUCinf and Cmax were 194.47% and 233.06%, respectively, following dabigatran administration with multiple doses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir as compared to administration of dabigatran alone. The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means for rosuvastatin AUCinf and Cmax were 131.18% and 212.44%, respectively, following rosuvastatin administration with multiple doses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir as compared to administration of rosuvastatin alone.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No nonclinical safety studies have been conducted with nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir.

## Nirmatrelvir

Studies of repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity revealed no risk due to nirmatrelvir. No adverse effects were observed in fertility, embryo-foetal development, or pre- and postnatal development studies in rats. A study in pregnant rabbits showed an adverse decrease in foetal body weight, in the absence of significant maternal toxicity. Systemic exposure (AUC24) in rabbits at the maximum dose without adverse effect in foetal body weight was estimated to be approximately 3 times higher than exposure in humans at recommended therapeutic dose of Paxlovid.

No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with nirmatrelvir.

## Ritonavir

Repeat-dose toxicity studies of ritonavir in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid gland and kidney. Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were accompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes. Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have not been seen in dogs. Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary to phospholipidosis. However, clinical trials revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced ocular changes in humans. All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir. Clinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function tests.

Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinuria were noted in rats and are considered to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease. Furthermore, no clinically significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials.

Genotoxicity studies revealed no risk due to ritonavir. Long-term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans . Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats. Developmental toxicity observed in rats (embryo-lethality, decreased foetal body weight and ossification delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a maternally toxic dose. Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryo-lethality, decreased litter size and decreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dose.

5. How to store Paxlovid
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Paxlovid is and what it is used for

Paxlovid contains two active substances nirmatrelvir and ritonavir in two different tablets. Paxlovid is an antiviral medicine used for treating adults and children and adolescents 6 years to less than 18 years of age weighing at least 20 kg with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe disease.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. This medicine stops the virus multiplying in cells and this stops the virus multiplying in the body. This can help your body to overcome the virus infection, and may prevent you from developing severe illness.

You must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after 5 days.
