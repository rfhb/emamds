## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Blenrep is indicated in adults for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma:

- in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy; and
- in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least one prior therapy including lenalidomide.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Blenrep is initiated and monitored by physicians experienced in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

## Recommended supportive care

Patients should have an ophthalmic examination (including visual acuity and slit lamp examination) performed by an eye care professional before each of the first 4 doses of Blenrep treatment, and as clinically indicated thereafter (see section 4.4).

## Posology

Administration of Blenrep is to be continued according to the recommended schedule until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blenrep is administered in combination with other treatments (see Table 1). For other medicinal products that are administered with Blenrep, see section 5.1 and the respective current Summary of Product Characteristics.

| With pomalidomide and dexamethasone (BPd) (Cycle length = 4 weeks) | Cycle 1: 2.5 mg/kg administered once Cycle 2 onwards: 1.9 mg/kg administered once every 4 weeks |

a Bortezomib and dexamethasone are administered for the first 8 cycles.

If a planned dose of Blenrep is missed due to reasons other than adverse reactions, it is recommended that Blenrep be resumed with the start of the next planned treatment cycle.

If a planned dose of Blenrep is missed due to adverse reactions, it is recommended that Blenrep be resumed with the start of the next planned treatment cycle after recovery of adverse reactions (see Table 3).

## Dose modifications

Dose modifications are required for nearly all patients to manage safety and tolerability. Dose reduction levels for Blenrep are provided in Table 2. Recommended modifications to manage adverse reactions are provided in Table 3.

a There is no reduced dose level 2.

## Ocular adverse reactions

Ocular events were graded based on ophthalmic examination findings that include the combination of corneal examination findings and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The patient's ophthalmic examination findings should be reviewed by the treating physician before determining the dose of Blenrep.

The corneal examination findings may or may not be accompanied by changes in BCVA. Ocular adverse reaction severity is defined by the most severely affected eye as both eyes may not be affected to the same degree. It is important for physicians to consider not only corneal examination findings but also visual acuity changes and reported symptoms as they evaluate dose delays and reductions.

Do not re-escalate dose after a dose reduction is made for ocular adverse reactions. Re-escalation of dose for non-ocular adverse reactions is to be based on clinical judgement, if applicable.

- a Non-ocular adverse reactions were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).
- b A corneal defect may lead to corneal ulcers. These should be managed promptly and as clinically indicated by an eye care professional. Corneal ulcer, by definition, means an epithelial defect with underlying stromal infiltration.
- c If thrombocytopenia is considered disease-related, is not accompanied by bleeding, and recovers with transfusion to &gt;25 x10 9 /L platelets, continuing treatment at the current dose may be considered.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients who are aged 65 years or over (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (eGFR 60-89 mL/min), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min), severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min not requiring dialysis), or endstage renal disease (eGFR  15 mL/min requiring dialysis) (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than upper limit of normal [ULN] to ≤ 1.5 × ULN and any aspartate transaminase [AST] or total bilirubin ≤ ULN with AST &gt; ULN). There are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN to ≤ 3.0 × ULN and any AST level), or in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than &gt; 3.0 × ULN and any AST level) to support a dose recommendation; Blenrep should only be used in these patients if the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks (see section 5.2).

## Body weight

Blenrep is dosed based on baseline actual body weight and has been studied in patients with body weight 37 to 170 kg (see section 5.2). For changes of body weight &gt;10% during treatment, recalculate dose based on the actual body weight at the time of dosing.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Blenrep in the paediatric population for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

## Method of administration

Blenrep is for intravenous infusion only and is administered by an intravenous infusion pump using an infusion set made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin over approximately 30 minutes. In the event of an infusion-related reaction (IRR), the administration time may be extended beyond 30 minutes, provided that the total in-use time, including both preparation and administration of the dose, does not exceed the allowable 6-hour duration.

Blenrep must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.

Blenrep must be diluted before administration.

Filtration of the diluted solution is not required. However, if the diluted solution is filtered, 0.2 µm or 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES) based filter is recommended.

For instructions on dilution, precaution before manipulating or administering the medicinal product, handling, and disposal of the vials, see section 6.6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Ocular adverse reactions

Ocular adverse reactions (e.g., blurred vision, dry eye, eye irritation, and photophobia) have been reported with the use of Blenrep. The most commonly reported corneal examination findings include superficial punctuate keratopathy, microcyst-like epithelial changes, and haze, with or without changes in visual acuity or symptoms. Clinically relevant changes in visual acuity may be associated with temporary difficulty in driving or operating machinery (see sections 4.7 and 4.8). Patients should be advised to temporarily avoid activities such as driving or operating machinery if visual symptoms occur (see section 4.7) and to report any changes in vision promptly. Regular ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended.

Physicians should also encourage patients to inform them of any ocular symptoms. Ophthalmic examinations, including assessment of visual acuity and slit lamp examination, should be performed before each of the first 4 doses of Blenrep and during treatment as clinically indicated.

Patients should be advised to administer preservative-free artificial tears at least 4 times a day during treatment. Patients should avoid using contact lenses until the end of treatment. Bandage contact lenses may be used under the direction of an ophthalmologist.

Patients experiencing corneal examination findings (keratopathies such as superficial punctate keratopathy or microcyst-like deposits) with or without changes in visual acuity may require a dose modification (delay and/or reduction) or treatment discontinuation based on severity of findings (see Table 3).

Cases with changes in the subbasal nerve plexus of the cornea (e.g., nerve fibre fragmentation and loss of nerve fibres) resulting in hypoesthesia of the cornea and cases of corneal ulcers (ulcerative and infective keratitis) have been reported (see section 4.8). These should be managed promptly and as clinically indicated by an eye care professional. Treatment with Blenrep should be interrupted until the corneal ulcer has healed (see Table 3).

## Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenic events (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) have been reported with the use of Blenrep. Thrombocytopenia may lead to serious bleeding events, including gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding (see section 4.8).

Complete blood counts (CBC) with differential and including platelet counts should be frequently monitored throughout treatment. Patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or those on concomitant anticoagulant treatments may require more frequent monitoring and may be managed with a dose delay or dose reduction (see Table 3). Supportive therapy (e.g., platelet transfusions) may be provided according to standard medical practice.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infusion-related reactions

Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been reported with the use of Blenrep. Most IRRs were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within the same day (see section 4.8). If a Grade 2 or higher infusionrelated reaction occurs during administration, reduce the infusion rate, or stop the infusion depending on the severity of the symptoms. Institute appropriate medical treatment and restart infusion at a slower rate if the patient's condition is stable. If Grade 2 or higher IRR occurs, consider premedication for subsequent infusions (see Table 3).

## Pneumonitis

Cases of pneumonitis, including fatal events, have been observed with Blenrep. Evaluation of patients with new or worsening unexplained pulmonary symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnoea) must be performed to exclude possible pneumonitis. In case of suspected or confirmed Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis, it is recommended that Blenrep is discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated.

## Hepatitis B virus reactivation

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation can occur in patients treated with medicinal products directed against B cells, including Blenrep, and in some cases, may result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Patients with evidence of positive HBV serology must be monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV reactivation as per clinical guidelines. In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on Blenrep, treatment with Blenrep must be withheld and patients must be treated according to clinical guidelines.

## Excipients with known effect

## Polysorbate 80

This medicinal product contains polysorbate 80 (E433), which may cause allergic reactions. Each 70 mg vial contains 0.28 mg of polysorbate 80 (E433) in 1.4 mL of withdrawable reconstituted solution, and each 100 mg vial contains 0.4 mg of polysorbate 80 (E433) in 2 mL of withdrawable reconstituted solution.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. Based on available in vitro and clinical data, there is a low risk of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions for belantamab mafodotin. Clinical pharmacokinetic assessments of belantamab mafodotin in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and/or dexamethasone indicated no clinically relevant drug-drug interaction between belantamab mafodotin and these small molecule medicinal products.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation

## Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception in females and males

## Women

The pregnancy status of women of child-bearing potential must be verified prior to initiating therapy with Blenrep. Women of child-bearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with Blenrep and for at least 4 months after the last dose.

## Men

Men with female partners of child-bearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with Blenrep and for at least 6 months after the last dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of belantamab mafodotin in pregnant women. Based on the mechanism of action of the cytotoxic component monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), belantamab mafodotin can cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). Human immunoglobulins (IgG) are known to cross the placental barrier, and therefore, being an IgG, belantamab mafodotin has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus.

Blenrep is not recommended during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risks to the foetus. If a pregnant woman needs to be treated she must be clearly advised on the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether belantamab mafodotin is excreted in human milk. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is present in human milk in small amounts. Since belantamab mafodotin is a humanised IgG monoclonal antibody, and based on the mechanism of action, it may potentially cause serious adverse reactions in breastfed newborns or infants of treated mothers.

Blenrep is not to be used during breast-feeding and breast-feeding is to be avoided for at least 3 months after the last dose of Blenrep.

## Fertility

Based on findings in animals and the mechanism of action, belantamab mafodotin may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3).

Therefore, physicians may counsel women of childbearing potential and men being treated with Blenrep who desire children in the future regarding fertility preservation.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Blenrep has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Patients must be advised to use caution when driving or operating machines while on Blenrep as it may affect patients' vision and influence their ability to drive or use machines due to impact on visual acuity and other ocular adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse reaction frequencies are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies, from patients with multiple myeloma exposed to belantamab mafodotin, for which, after thorough assessment, a causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility.

The safety of belantamab mafodotin has been evaluated in more than 7500 patients with multiple myeloma, including 516 patients who received belantamab mafodotin in triplet combinations as part of the DREAMM-6 (a Phase 1/2, open-label dose exploration study), DREAMM-7, and DREAMM-8 studies, 312 patients who received belantamab mafodotin as monotherapy in the DREAMM-2 and DREAMM-3 studies, and including patients from the post-marketing setting.

Adverse reactions are listed in Table 4 by system organ class and by frequency.

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as:

Very common:

≥ 1/10

Common:

≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10

Uncommon:

≥ 1/1 000 to &lt;1/100

Rare:

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Ocular adverse reactions

Across pooled datasets from 3 trials of belantamab mafodotin in combination with other therapies (n = 516), DREAMM-6 (a Phase 1/2, open-label dose exploration study), DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8, ocular events were reported and included ophthalmic examination findings and ocular adverse reactions. The most common (&gt; 25%) were reduced visual acuity (90%), corneal examination findings based on the ophthalmic examination findings (89%), blurred vision (62%), dry eye (44%), foreign body sensation in eyes (40%), photophobia (37%), eye irritation (35%), and eye pain (27%).

Corneal examination findings (keratopathies such as superficial punctate keratopathy and microcystlike deposits) were reported based on the ophthalmic examination findings as Grade 1 in 5% of patients, Grade 2 in 14%, Grade 3 in 59% and Grade 4 in 12%. Cases of corneal ulcer (ulcerative and infective keratitis) were reported in &lt; 1% of patients (n = 5). At least 1 corneal examination finding or BCVA-related event (Grade ≥ 2) was reported by 86% of patients.

Table 5 includes a summary of decreased vision in patients with normal baseline (snellen equivalent visual acuity 20/25 or better in at least one eye) and corneal examination findings from pooled data of belantamab mafodotin in combination with other therapies.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no known specific antidote for belantamab mafodotin overdose. If overdose is suspected, patients must be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate supportive treatment instituted.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX15.

## Mechanism of action

Belantamab mafodotin is a humanised IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic agent, mcMMAF. Belantamab mafodotin binds to cell surface BCMA and is rapidly internalised. Once inside the tumour cell, the cytotoxic agent (cys-mcMMAF) is released disrupting the microtubule network, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The antibody also enhances recruitment and activation of immune effector cells, killing tumour cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. Apoptosis induced by belantamab mafodotin is accompanied

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

by markers of immunogenic cell death, which may contribute to an adaptive immune response to tumour cells.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Cardiac electrophysiology

Belantamab mafodotin or cys-mcMMAF had no meaningful QTc prolongation (&gt; 10 ms) at doses of up to 3.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were rarely detected. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

DREAMM-7: belantamab mafodotin in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone The efficacy and safety of belantamab mafodotin in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (BVd) were investigated in a multicentre, randomised (1:1), open-label, Phase 3 study conducted in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who had relapsed following treatment with at least one prior line of therapy.

In the BVd arm (N = 243), patients received belantamab mafodotin 2.5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks on day 1 of each cycle; bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 (subcutaneously) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of cycles 1 to 8 (21-day cycles); and dexamethasone 20 mg (intravenous infusion or orally) on the day of and the day after bortezomib treatment. In the daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVd) arm (N = 251), patients received daratumumab 16 mg/kg (IV) in 21-day cycles: every week for cycles 1 to 3 and every 3 weeks for cycles 4 to 8. Dexamethasone and bortezomib schedules were the same in both arms. Treatment continued in both arms until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study end. Patients were stratified by the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS), prior exposure to bortezomib, and the number of prior lines of therapy.

The key eligibility criteria for the study were having a confirmed diagnosis of MM as defined by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, having previously been treated with at least 1 prior line of MM therapy, and having had documented disease progression during or after their most recent therapy. Patients were excluded if they were intolerant to bortezomib, refractory to twice weekly bortezomib, previously treated with BCMAtargeted therapy, had ongoing ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain, or had current corneal epithelial disease except for mild punctate keratopathy.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as evaluated by a blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) based on the IMWG criteria for MM.

A total of 494 patients were evaluated for efficacy in DREAMM-7. Baseline demographics and characteristics were similar across both arms including: median age: 65 years (36% aged 65-74 years and 14% aged 75 years or older); 55% male, 45% female; 83% White, 12% Asian, 4% Black, &lt; 1% mixed race; R-ISS stage at screening I (41%), II (53%), III (5%); 28% high cytogenetics risk, median number of 1 prior line of therapy; 8% with extramedullary disease (EMD) present; and of those who received treatment (N = 488), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0 (48%), 1 (48%), or 2 (4%). In the BVd arm, 90% of patients received prior proteasome inhibitor therapy (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), 81% of patients received prior immunomodulator therapy (lenalidomide, thalidomide, pomalidomide), and 67% of patients previously received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). There were 9% of patients refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy and 39% of patients refractory to immunomodulator therapy. In the DVd arm, 86% of patients received prior proteasome inhibitor therapy (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), 86% of patients received prior immunomodulator therapy (lenalidomide, thalidomide, pomalidomide), and 69% of patients previously received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Ten percent of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy and 41% of patients refractory to immunomodulator therapy.

Patients treated with belantamab mafodotin in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone had a statistically significant improvement in PFS, overall survival (OS), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate compared with daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. Efficacy results at the time of the first interim analysis (data cut-off 2 October 2023), except OS where data is presented from the second interim analysis data cut-off (7 October 2024) are presented in Table 6 and Figures 1 and 2.

DREAMM-8: belantamab mafodotin in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone The efficacy and safety of belantamab mafodotin in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (BPd) were investigated in a multicentre, randomised (1:1), open-label, Phase 3 study conducted in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who had relapsed following treatment with at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the BPd arm (N = 155), patients received belantamab mafodotin 2.5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion once on day 1 in cycle 1 (28-day cycle) followed by belantamab mafodotin 1.9 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks on day 1 of cycle 2 onwards (28-day cycles); pomalidomide 4 mg (orally [PO]) administered on days 1 to 21; and dexamethasone 40 mg PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in all cycles (28-day cycles). In the pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd) arm (N = 147), pomalidomide 4 mg PO was administered every 3 weeks on days 1 to 14 in all cycles (21-day cycles); bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2  was administered subcutaneously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in cycles 1 to 8, and on days 1 and 8 in cycle ≥ 9 (21-day cycles). Dexamethasone 20 mg PO was administered on the day of and the day after bortezomib. The dose level of dexamethasone in each arm was reduced by half in patients aged 75 years and older. Treatment in both arms continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, initiation of another anticancer therapy, or end of study/death. Patients were stratified by the number of prior lines of treatment, prior exposure to bortezomib, prior anti-CD38 treatment, and International Staging System (ISS) status.

The key eligibility criteria included having confirmed diagnosis of MM as defined by IMWG criteria, having previously been treated with at least 1 prior line of MM therapy, including lenalidomide, and having had documented disease progression during or after their most recent therapy. Patients were excluded if they received prior treatment with or intolerant to pomalidomide, were previously treated with BCMA-targeted therapy, or had current corneal disease except for mild punctate keratopathy.

The primary efficacy outcome measure was PFS as evaluated by a blinded IRC based on the IMWG criteria for MM.

A total of 302 patients were evaluated for efficacy in DREAMM-8. Baseline demographics and characteristics were similar across both arms including: median age: 67 years (43% aged 65-74 years and 18% aged 75 years or older); 60% male, 40% female; 86% White, 12% Asian, &lt; 1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, &lt; 1% mixed race; ISS stage at screening I (59%), II (26%), III (15%); 33% high cytogenetic risk, median number of 1 prior line of therapy; 10% with EMD present; and of those who received treatment (N = 295), ECOG PS 0 (55%), 1 (42%), or 2 (3%). In the BPd arm, 100% of patients received prior immunomodulator therapy (lenalidomide, thalidomide), 90% of patients received prior proteasome inhibitor therapy (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), 25% of patients received prior anti-CD38 therapy (daratumumab, isatuximab), and 64% of patients previously received ASCT. There were 82% of patients refractory to immunomodulator therapy, 26% of patients refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy, and 23% of patients refractory to anti-CD38 therapy. In the PVd arm, 100% of patients received prior immunomodulator therapy (lenalidomide, thalidomide), 93% of patients received prior proteasome inhibitor therapy (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), 29% of patients received prior anti-CD38 therapy (daratumumab, isatuximab, anti-CD38), and 56% of patients previously received ASCT. There were 76% of patients refractory to immunomodulator therapy, 24% of patients refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy, and 24% of patients refractory to anti-CD38 therapy.

Patients treated with belantamab mafodotin in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone had a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the overall population compared with pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. Efficacy results at the time of the first interim analysis (data cut-off 29 January 2024) are presented in Table 7 and Figures 3 and 4.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Blenrep in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Maximum concentration for belantamab mafodotin ADC occurred at or shortly after the end of infusion while cys-mcMMAF concentrations peaked ~24 hours after dosing.

Table 8 describes the pharmacokinetics of belantamab mafodotin for 2.5 mg/kg doses on cycle 1 Day 1 at the end of the first 3-week interval.

Table 8: Belantamab mafodotin pharmacokinetics at the end of the first 3-week interval a

|                | AUC b                  | C avg21            | C max              | C tau              |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| ADC (%)        | 3 950 mc g•h/mL (30.6) | 7.83 mcg/mL (30.6) | 43.7 mcg/mL (22.1) | 2.03 mcg/mL (62.5) |
| cys-mcMMAF (%) | 94.2 ng•h/mL (42.3)    | 0.243 ng/mL (42.4) | 0.976 ng/mL (45.3) | -                  |

ADC = antibody drug conjugate; AUC = Area under the curve; Cavg21 = belantamab mafodotin average concentration over 21 days; Cmax = maximum plasma concentration; Ctau = concentration at the end of a dosing interval.

- a   Data presented as geometric mean (%CV), based on population PK models.

b   AUC for ADC is AUC(0-21days) and AUC(0-7days) for cys-mcMMAF.

Accumulation of belantamab mafodotin (ADC) was minimal to moderate (the ratio from cycle 3 to cycle 1 was 1.13 for Cmax and 1.58 for AUC) and accumulation of cys-mcMMAF was negligible as observed in clinical trials with a every 3 weeks dosing regimen.

## Distribution

In vitro , cys-mcMMAF exhibited low protein binding, (70% unbound at a concentration of 5 ng/mL) in human plasma in a concentration-dependent manner.

Based on the population PK analysis, the geometric mean (geometric CV%) for steady-state volume of distribution of belantamab mafodotin was 10.8 L (22%).

## Biotransformation

The monoclonal antibody portion of belantamab mafodotin is expected to undergo proteolysis to small peptides and individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. Cys-mcMMAF had limited metabolic clearance in human hepatic S9 fraction incubation studies.

## Drug interactions

In vitro studies demonstrated that cys-mcMMAF is not an inhibitor, an inducer, or a sensitive substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes, but is a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP2, MRP3, bile salt export pump (BSEP), and a possible substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes and transporters are not expected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Based on the population PK analysis from patients treated with belantamab mafodotin monotherapy or in combination with other medicinal products, the geometric mean (geometric CV%) belantamab mafodotin (ADC) initial systemic clearance (CL) was 0.901 L/day (40%), and the elimination halflife was 13 days (26%). Following treatment, steady-state CL was 0.605 L/day (43%) or approximately 33% lower than initial systemic CL with an elimination half-life of 17 days (31%).

The fraction of intact cys-mcMMAF excreted in urine was not substantial (approximately 18% of the dose) after cycle 1 dose, with no evidence of other MMAF-related metabolites.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Belantamab mafodotin exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over the recommended dose range with a reduction in clearance over time.

## Special populations

## Elderly

Based on a population of patients aged 32 to 89 years, age was not a significant covariate in population pharmacokinetics analyses.

## Renal impairment

In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min, n = 8), belantamab mafodotin Cmax decreased by 23% and AUC(0-tau) decreased by 16% compared with patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min, n = 8). For cys-mcMMAF, Cmax and AUC(0168h) decreased by 56% and 44%, respectively compared to patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Renal function (eGFR 12-150 mL/min) was not a significant covariate in population pharmacokinetic analyses that included patients with normal renal function, mild (eGFR 60-89 mL/min), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min), or severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min not requiring dialysis). No impact on belantamab mafodotin PK was observed for patients with end stage renal disease (eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min requiring dialysis, n = 5).

Belantamab mafodotin is not expected to be removed via dialysis due to its molecular size. While free cys-mcMMAF may be removed via dialysis, cys-mcMMAF systemic exposure is very low and has not been shown to be associated with efficacy or safety based on exposure-response analysis.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic function as per the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group classification, was not a significant covariate in population pharmacokinetic analyses that included patients with normal hepatic function, mild (total bilirubin &gt; ULN to ≤ 1.5 × ULN and any AST or total bilirubin ≤ ULN with AST &gt; ULN) or moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN to ≤ 3 × ULN and any AST). Limited data are available for patients with moderate (n = 5) or severe hepatic impairment (n = 1, total bilirubin &gt; 3 × ULN and any AST) in the population pharmacokinetic analyses.

## Body weight

Body weight (37 to 170 kg) was a significant covariate in population pharmacokinetic analyses, but this effect will be adjusted by the weight-proportional dosing regimen (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology

In non-clinical trials, the principal adverse findings (directly related to belantamab mafodotin) in the rat and monkey, at similar exposures to the recommended clinical dose of 2.5 mg/kg, were elevated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

liver enzymes sometimes associated with hepatocellular necrosis at ≥ 10 and ≥ 3 mg/kg, respectively, and increases in alveolar macrophages associated with eosinophilic material in the lungs at ≥ 3 mg/kg (rat only). Most findings in animals were related to the cytotoxic drug conjugate, the histopathological changes observed in the testes and lungs, were not reversible in rats.

Single cell necrosis in the corneal epithelium and/or increased mitoses of corneal epithelial cells was observed in rat and rabbit. Inflammation of the corneal stroma correlating with superficial haze and vascularisation was observed in rabbits. Belantamab mafodotin was taken up into cells throughout the body by a mechanism unrelated to BCMA receptor expression on the cell membrane.

## Carcinogenesis/mutagenesis

Belantamab mafodotin was genotoxic in an in vitro micronucleus screening assay in human lymphocytes, consistent with the pharmacological effect of cys-mcMMAF-mediated disruption of microtubules causing aneuploidy.

No carcinogenicity or definitive genotoxicity studies have been conducted with belantamab mafodotin.

## Reproductive toxicology

No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of belantamab mafodotin on reproduction or development. The mechanism of action is to kill rapidly dividing cells which would affect a developing embryo which has rapidly dividing cells. There is also a potential risk of heritable changes via aneuploidy in female germ cells.

Effects on male and female reproductive organs have been observed in animals at doses of ≥ 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 4 times the exposure of the clinical dose. Luteinised nonovulatory follicles were seen in the ovaries of rats after 3 weekly doses. Findings in male reproductive organs that were adverse and progressed following repeat dosing in rat, included marked degeneration/atrophy of seminiferous tubules that generally did not reverse following dosing cessation.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Caution should be used during handling and preparation of Blenrep. Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products.

## Preparation of solution for infusion

Blenrep is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product. Proper handling procedures must be followed. Use aseptic technique for the reconstitution and dilution of the dosing solution.

Calculate the dose (mg), total volume (mL) of solution required and the number of vials needed based on the patient's actual body weight (kg).

## Reconstitution

1. Remove the vial(s) of Blenrep from the refrigerator and allow to stand for approximately 10 minutes to reach room temperature.
2. Reconstitute each 70 mg vial with 1.4 mL of water for injections to obtain a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reconstitute each 100 mg vial with 2 mL of water for injections to obtain a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake.

3. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be a clear to opalescent, colourless to yellow to brown liquid. Discard the reconstituted solution if extraneous particulate matter other than translucent to white proteinaceous particles is observed.

## Dilution

1. Withdraw the necessary volume for the calculated dose from each vial.
2. Add the necessary amount of Blenrep to the infusion bag containing 250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Mix the diluted solution by gentle inversion. The final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 0.2 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL. Do not shake.
3. Discard any unused reconstituted solution of Blenrep left in the vial.

If the diluted solution is not used immediately, it may be stored in a refrigerator (2 ºC -8 ºC) for up to 24 hours prior to administration. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution to equilibrate to room temperature prior to administration. The diluted solution may be kept at room temperature (20 ºC -25 ºC) for a maximum of 6 hours (including infusion time).

## Administration

1. Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion only and approximately over 30 minutes using an infusion set made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin. In the event where the administration time may be extended beyond 30 minutes, do not exceed the allowable 6-hour duration in-use time, including both preparation and administration of the dose.
2. Filtration of the diluted solution is not required. However, if the diluted solution is filtered, 0.2 µm or 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES) based filter is recommended.

## Disposal

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

## 1. What Blenrep is and what it is used for

Blenrep contains the active substance belantamab mafodotin. It is used in combination with other cancer medicines to treat adults who have a cancer of the bone marrow called multiple myeloma.

Belantamab mafodotin consists of a monoclonal antibody connected to a cytotoxic agent (a type of cancer medicine). The monoclonal antibody is a protein designed to find the multiple myeloma cancer cells in your body and bind to them. Once attached to the cancer cells, the cytotoxic agent is released inside the cells and kills them.

Blenrep will be given to you together with other cancer medicines used to treat multiple myeloma:

- bortezomib and dexamethasone, or
- pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

It is important you read the patient leaflets for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, ask your doctor.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Blenrep

## You should not be given Blenrep :

- -if you are allergic to belantamab mafodotin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- ➔ Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you.

## Warnings and precautions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Eye problems

This medicine can cause changes to the surface of your eye which can result in changes in vision, blurred vision, and dry eyes.

You should have an eye examination by an eye care professional before each of the first 4 doses of this medicine. Your doctor may order further eye tests for you while you are on treatment with Blenrep. Even if your vision seems fine, it is important that you get your eyes checked during treatment with this medicine because some changes can happen without symptoms and may only be seen during an eye examination.

- ➔ Do not use contact lenses while you are receiving treatment unless instructed to do so by your eye care professional.

Your doctor will ask you to use eye drops called preservative-free artificial tears at least 4 times a day during treatment to moisten and lubricate your eyes. You should apply them as instructed.

Tell your doctor if you notice changes with your vision. Your doctor may reduce the dose or change the time between doses. Your doctor might also ask you to see an eye care professional.

➔ Contact your doctor if you have blurred vision or other eye problems.

## Abnormal bruising and bleeding

Blenrep can decrease the number of blood cells called platelets which help to clot your blood. Symptoms of low platelets levels ( thrombocytopenia ) include:

- abnormal bruising under the skin,
- bleeding longer than usual after a blood test or cut to the skin,
- bleeding from your nose or your gums, or more serious bleeding.

Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test before you start treatment, and regularly during treatment with Blenrep, to check that your platelet levels are normal.

- ➔ Tell your doctor if you develop abnormal bleeding or bruising, or any symptoms that worry you.

## Infusion-related reactions

Blenrep is given by a drip ( infusion ) into a vein. Some people who receive infusions develop infusionrelated reactions . These reactions can happen during the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step-by-step instructions for use and handling, reconstitution, and administration

The trade name and batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file.

Caution should be used during handling and preparation of Blenrep. Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products.

## Preparation of solution for infusion

Blenrep is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product. Proper handling procedures must be followed. Use aseptic technique for the reconstitution and dilution of the dosing solution.

Calculate the dose (mg), total volume (mL) of solution required and the number of vials needed based on the patient's actual body weight (kg).

## Reconstitution

1. Remove the vial(s) of Blenrep from the refrigerator and allow to stand for approximately 10 minutes to reach room temperature.
2. Reconstitute each 70 mg vial with 1.4 mL of sterile water for injections to obtain a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake.
3. Reconstitute each 100 mg vial with 2 mL of sterile water for injections to obtain a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake.
3. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be a clear to opalescent, colourless to yellow to brown liquid. Discard the reconstituted solution if extraneous particulate matter other than translucent to white proteinaceous particles is observed.

## Dilution instructions for intravenous use

1. Withdraw the necessary volume for the calculated dose from each vial.
2. Add the necessary amount of Blenrep to the infusion bag containing 250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Mix the diluted solution by gentle inversion. The final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 0.2 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL. Do not shake.
3. Discard any unused reconstituted solution of Blenrep left in the vial.

If the diluted solution is not used immediately, it may be stored in a refrigerator (2 ºC -8 ºC) for up to 24 hours prior to administration. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution to equilibrate to room temperature prior to administration. The diluted solution may be kept at room temperature (20 ºC -25 ºC) for a maximum of 6 hours (including infusion time).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Administration instructions

1. Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion only over approximately 30 minutes using an infusion set made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin. In the event where the administration time may be extended beyond 30 minutes, do not exceed the allowable 6-hour duration in-use time, including both preparation and administration of the dose.
2. Filtration of the diluted solution is not required. However, if the diluted solution is filtered, 0.2 µm or 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES) based filter is recommended.

## Disposal

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
