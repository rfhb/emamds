## 2. Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM 124

[Study initiation date: 01-July-2010/ Study completion date: 10-September-2013 Data lock point (Date of database freeze): 21-August-2015]

This PAM is the stand-alone submission of the final study report for the study 113369 (MENACWY-TT083), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. A short critical expert overview has been provideThe Company concluded that currently no changes to the Product Information of Infanrix hexa are needed.

## Methods:

This study was a phase IIIb open, multi-country, randomised, controlled study designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response of GSK Biologicals' meningococcal serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine Nimenrix™ (MenACWY-TT) when given intramuscularly at 2, 4 and 12 months of age or given at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age compared to two licensed MenC conjugate vaccine given intramuscularly at 2, 4 and 12 months of age.

This multicentre study was conducted in 44 centres located in three countries (Estonia, Germany and Spain).

Duration of treatment: The duration of the study was approximately 16 months for each subject.

## Study design

This was a phase IIIB self-contained, open, multi-country, randomized, controlled study with four parallel groups. Blood samples were collected from each subject at pre-vaccination (Day 0), one month after the last priming vaccination (Month 3), at pre-booster (Month 10) and post-booster (Month 11).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study Population was composed of male or female infants between, and including, 6-12 weeks (4290 days) of age at the time of the first study vaccination.

The study groups were as follows:

- Group ACWY\\_3: subjects received three primary vaccination doses of MenACWY-TT vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and one booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine at 12 months of age.
- Group ACWY\\_2: subjects received two primary vaccination doses of MenACWY-TT vaccine at 2 and 4 months of age and one booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine at 12 months of age.
- Group MenCCRM: subjects received two primary vaccination doses of Menjugate vaccine at 2 and 4 months of age and one booster dose of Menjugate vaccine at 12 months of age (active control group).
- Group MenC-TT: subjects received two primary vaccination doses of NeisVac-C vaccine at 2 and 4 months of age and one booster dose of NeisVac-C vaccine at 12 months of age (active control group).

All subjects were vaccinated with Infanrix hexa and Synflorix at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age.

Primary Outcome /Efficacy Variable concerned Immunogenicity with respect to components of the investigational vaccine.

- rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 for each of the four serogroups in all subjects, one month after the final priming vaccination.

Secondary Outcome for Infanrix hexa immunogenicity and safety assessment:

1. Immunogenicity with respect to components of the co-administered Infanrix hexa :

Antibody concentrations/titres for

- o anti-diphtheria ( ≥ 0.1 IU/ml and concentrations),
- o anti-tetanus ( ≥ 0.1 IU/ml and concentrations),
- o anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN ( ≥ 5 EL.U/ml and concentrations),
- o anti-HBs ( ≥ 10 mIU/ml, ≥ 100 mIU/ml and concentrations),
- o anti-polio type 1, 2 and 3 ( ≥ 1:8 and titres),
- o anti-PRP ( ≥ 0.15 μ g/ml, ≥ 1.0 μ g/ml and concentrations) antibodies

in a randomised subset of 25% of subjects, at pre-vaccination, one month after the final priming vaccination, pre-booster and one month post-booster dose.

## 2. Safety

To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the investigational vaccine.

## Results:

## Demography:

## Primary epoch

Across all vaccine groups the mean age of the subjects in the Primary ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 8.7 weeks (range 6 to 12 weeks) with a standard deviation of 1.5. The distribution of males and females was similar with 50.5% male and 49.5% female. According to geographic ancestry, the majorityof subjects were White/Caucasian/European Heritage (94.2%), 2.6% of subjects were White Arabic /

North African Heritage and 1.6% of subjects Other.

## Booster epoch

Across all vaccine groups the mean age of the subjects in the Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 12.1 months (range 12 to 13 months) with a standard deviation of 0.4. The distribution of males andfemales was similar with 49.9% male and 50.1% female. According to geographic ancestry, the majorityof subjects were White/Caucasian/European Heritage (95.1%), 2.1% of subjects were White Arabic /

North African Heritage and 1.3% of subjects Other.

The demographic profile of the Primary and Booster Total Vaccinated Cohorts and Primary and Booster ATP cohorts for safety were similar to those described for the Primary and Booster ATP cohorts for immunogenicity.

## Safety:

## In Primary phase

## Unsolicited AEs

- At least one unsolicited symptom was reported by 52.1% - 56.4% of subjects across the four study groups during the 31-day period after primary vaccination .

## SAEs

- At least one SAE was reported by 6.4% of subjects (MenCCRM group) to 8.1% of subjects (ACWY\\_3 group) from study start up to the day preceding the booster vaccination.
- One subject in the ACWY\\_3 group reported a SAE (epilepsy) which was considered by the investigator to be vaccine related.

## In Booster phase

## Unsolicited AEs

- At least one unsolicited symptom was reported by 32.6% - 36.4% of subjects across the four study groups during the 31-day period after booster vaccination .

## SAEs

- At least one SAE was reported by 2.8% of subjects (ACWY\\_3 and MenCCRM groups) to 3.5% of subjects (ACWY\\_2 group) from the booster vaccination up to the end of the ESFU, none of which were considered by the investigator to be related to study vaccination.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion

Stand-alone submission of the final study report for this study, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. A short critical expert overview has been provided. Vaccination with MenACWY-TT  (Nimenrix) in infants when co-administered with Infanrix hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/ Hib) and Synflorix (PCV10) was immunogenic and well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. The Company concluded that currently no changes to the Product Information of Infanrix hexa are needed.

The Rapporteur endorses the discussion and conclusion of the MAH concerning immunogenicity and safety of the post-primary and booster results of Infanrix hexa in this standalone submission of the paediatric study MENACWY-TT-083 (GSK Study 113369).
