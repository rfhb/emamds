<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Posaconazole is a broad spectrum triazole antifungal indicated in the systemic treatment of pathogenic yeasts and moulds and is currently available as an oral suspension (Noxafil). The oral suspension is administered  3-4  times  daily  and  must  be  taken  with  food  (preferably  a  high  fat  meal)  to  ensure adequate systemic exposure.

The applicant has sought to maximise systemic absorption and reduce the food effect by developing an  acid  resistant  tablet  (gastro  resistant  tablet).  The  product  incorporates  a  pH  sensitive  polymer (hypromellose  acetate  succinate)  which  limits  dissolution  in  the  stomach,  thereby  maximising dissolution and absorption in the small intestine.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The product is presented as new gastro resistant tablets containing 100 mg of posaconazole as active substance.

Other ingredients are: hypromellose acetate succinate, cellulose microcrystalline, hyprolose, silica dental type, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, macrogol, titanium dioxide (E171), talc, iron oxide yellow (E172).

The product is available in a PVC/ polychlorotrifluoroethylene laminate blister with push-through aluminium lidding.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

The active substance used in the proposed gastro resistant tablets, pocasonazole, is the same active substance as that approved for the currently authorised oral solution.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The aim of the development was to obtain a solid tablet of a size that was easy to swallow and that provided sufficient solubility of the active substance in the intestinal environment to enhance bioavailability and reduce the food effect and absorption variability observed with the authorised oral suspension.

The new pharmaceutical form is manufactured with the currently approved active substance which is also used for the other already authorised oral solution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All the chosen excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.

The  focus  of  the    commercial  formulation  development  was  to  develop  a  formulation  that  met  the proposed  Quality  Target  Product  Profile  (QTPP)  exhibited  the  desired  in-vitro,  in-vivo  performance, showed  good  stability  and  was  easy  to  process.  Early  formulation  design  focussed  on  the  prior knowledge  gained  from  development  of  an  oral  suspension  and  established  that  the  tablet  should deliver low solubility in the stomach (low pH) and high solubility in the small intestine (neutral pH). A delayed release gastro-resistant film-coated tablet, which comprises a solid dispersion of the active substance in Hypromellose Acetate Succinate (HPMCAS) was developed. HPMCAS is a pH sensitive polymer stabiliser excipient which was selected to form a solid dispersion using a hot melt extrusion (HME)  method.  The  pH  sensitive  solubility  of  the  HPMCAS  limits  posaconazole  release  at  low  pH (pH&lt;4). At neutral  pH  (pH6.8),  the  high  solubility  of  HPMCAS  allows  posaconazole  to  be  released. Three prototype formulations were developed to optimise the excipient quantities and compared to a capsule containing only the extrudate (no excipients).

The applicant has utilised a Quality by Design approach to finished product development, which has been generally adequately conducted. Manufacturing process development used Design of Experiments to establish Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs) for manufacturing process parameters. The development data provided adequately support the proposed reduced in process testing of tablet crushing strength and tablet weight during compression (critical step).

The primary packaging consists in a PVC/Aclar laminate blister with push-through aluminium lidding. The finished product manufacturer tests the primary packaging for identification (IR), visual examination and overall thickness. Acceptance criteria was presented and considered acceptable. A declaration was also provided showing that the materials in the primary packaging are compliant with Directive 2002/72/EC and Directive 94/62/EEC.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process consists of 6 main steps: premix and blending, hot melt extrusion, milling, blending and lubrication, compression and film coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.

The applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated through development using Quality by design (QbD) principles, that the manufacturing process is adequately controlled within the PARs specified. The proposed in process controls for tablet crushing strength and tablet weight are therefore considered appropriate and are satisfactorily underpinned by risk assessment

The manufacturing process is generally well described and process validation will be conducted on the first three commercial scale batches of the finished product. An acceptable validation protocol has been provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Product specification

The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC) and uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur).

Batch analysis results are provided for a seven batches (development and commercial scale) confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability data of three batches of finished product representative for the commercial scale stored under long term conditions for 12  months at 25ºC / 60% RH, for up 12 months under intermediate conditions at  30 o C/75%RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested for description, assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), and dissolution (HPLC). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Additional data were also provided for moisture content and polymorphic form.

In addition, photostability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B using one batch and data provided. The samples were analysed for description, assay, impurities, moisture content and dissolution. No significant changes were observed thus demonstrating the proposed container closure system adequately protects the tablets from light.

Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of this new pharmaceutical form Noxafil 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

This application is supported by the non-clinical safety program conducted for the currently marketed POS oral suspension. No additional pharmacology or toxicology studies were conducted in support of the POS solid oral tablet. A pharmacokinetic (PK) study in non-human primates (NHP) was conducted with various oral and intravenous (I.V) formulations and data from this study was used to bridge the solid oral tablet formulation to the current marketed oral suspension. The proposed final clinical formulation was not used in this NHP study, however pH-sensitive polymer (hypromellose acetate succinate, HPMCAS was used in this NHP study.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

Not applicable.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

A pharmacokinetic (PK) study in non-human primates (NHP) was conducted with various oral and intravenous (I.V) formulations and data from this study was used to bridge the solid oral tablet formulation to the current marketed oral suspension (Tablet A, Tablet B and capsule). The proposed final clinical formulation was not used in this NHP study, however pH-sensitive polymer (hypromellose acetate succinate, HPMCAS was used in this NHP study.

Male Cynomolgus monkeys were given single oral (60 mg) or I.V doses of either 0.4 ml/kg (1 mg/kg dose) and 2 ml/kg (5 mg/kg dose). Blood samples were taken pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-dose. The various formulations can be seen in the Table below.

The over-all conclusion of this study was that following a single 60 mg posaconazole oral administration, all three prototype capsule formulations (i.e. those formations that used HPMCAS-MF polymer) increased posaconazole exposure when compared to an oral suspension indicating an increase in oral bioavailability. The formulation containing the HPMCAS-MF polymer form displayed the greatest increase (~7-fold) in exposure.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

Not applicable.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The recommended dose of the oral suspension formulation is 200 mg (5 ml) four times a day for the treatment of refractory invasive fungal infections and 200 mg (5 ml) three times a day for the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections. For the tablet formulation of posaconazole, there is a recommended loading dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day on the first day, then 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) once a day thereafter. An assessment of the risk was performed for the oral suspension and no significant risk to the environment related to the use of posaconazole was anticipated.

The Phase I screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) indicates that further evaluation of posaconazole is not warranted due to a log Kow &lt; 4.5.

Based on the outcome of the Phase I environmental assessment, the predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECSURFACEWATER) for the active ingredient, posaconazole was 4 μg/L, indicating that posaconazole may represent a risk to the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. Therefore a Phase II-Tier A environmental effects assessment and concomitant risk assessment was required.

The outcome of the Phase II Tier A Assessment comparing the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) and PEC ratios conclude that posaconazole does not present a risk to surface water, ground water, micro-organisms or to sediment-dwelling organisms. Posaconazole will not bioconcentrate and is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment due to normal patient use. Thus, no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

further action was necessary in this case and no special precautionary or safety measures need to be taken for the storage, labelling, administration, and disposal of posaconazole. A risk assessment for sediment dwelling organisms was conducted and calculated to be 0.01. Since this value is less than 1, posaconazole was considered unlikely to represent a risk to sediment dwelling organisms. In response to questions, the applicant provided further information on the environmental risk of the proposed product. The applicant has conducted a risk assessment for sediment dwelling organisms which includes a refinement of the Fpen based on published epidemiological data. A refined Fpen of 0.031% was used. This estimate was considered to be the upper limit of the population potentially exposed because it assumes all patients with the above-mentioned diseases will take posaconazole. The resulting PECSW was 0.12 μg/L. A PNEC for sediment (PNECSED) of 0.76 mg/kg 760 (μg/kg) was calculated. The PEC for sediment (PECSED) was calculated using the refined Fpen of 0.031%, the highest soil Koc value for posaconazole, and a refined PECSW of 0.0011 μg/L, estimated using SimpleTreat 3.1. For this assessment, PECSED was conservatively estimated to be 8.06 μg/kg (0.0081 mg/kg). The PEC/PNEC for sediment was determined by comparing the PECSED to the PNEC based on the midge test (PNECSED). The ratio calculated by the Applicant was: 760 μg/kg 8.06 μg/kg = 0.01 The applicant stated that since this ratio is less than 1, posaconazole was considered unlikely to represent a risk to sediment dwelling organisms. However, a PEC sediment of 963 µg/kg (dry sediment) by Simple Treat has also been calculated. The value is based on a lower vapour pressure (no votalization) for injection applications. Nevertheless, no risk for sediment is expected although the risk quotient is slightly above 1 (1.3) because the tested concentration in the sediment organism test (76 mg/kg mean measured) was far above the water solubility and no effect was observed. The half-life of the parent posaconazole in two river sediments was calculated to be 20.4 and 21.1 days. The half-lives of the two major transformation products in in two river sediments were calculated to be 38 and 106.7 (metabolite M2) and 358.1 and 108.1 (M3). The Applicant states that the metabolites (M2 and M3) could not be named according to chemical nomenclature as their definitive structures are unknown. However, different half-lives for the fate of the major transformation products (elucidated structure) of posaconazole in water/sediment systems have been calculated. Nevertheless, all three transformation products show persistence in sediment with half-lives &gt;120d. Posaconazole is therefore classified as being persistent. The identified three transformation products can be included in the summary of the main study results with the DT50 values as follows: M1 (cannot be named): stable in sediment, persistent

- M2 (cannot be named): 215.9 d (DE recalculated, SFO), persistent

M3 (cannot be named): 358.1 d, persistent

The Applicant has also provided the bioconcentration test report (Wildlife International, Ltd., Posaconazole: A bioconcentration test with the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), Final report, 16-Oct2012 which was cited in the environmental risk assessment. The results of the submitted bioconcentration test report were considered plausible although the validation criteria for the study failed. The test concentrations in the test chambers varied more than ± 20%. The applicant stated that the variability in analytical results was due to the initial impacts of aeration of test solutions. Aeration during the study was considered necessary to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations to keep the large number of fish alive which were required for tissue sampling during the course of the test.

Three clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to evaluate the relative and absolute bioavailability of posaconazole administered as different tablets and dosage forms and/or the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole. ( P04975, P07691, P07783 )

In addition, a food effect study was carried out in the clock stop period with tablet D (study P112).

## Study P04975

Study P04975 was an open-label, partially randomized, 4-way crossover, 100-mg single-dose, 2-part study, in 16 patients designed to characterize posaconazole pharmacokinetics for a new capsule and 2 new prototypical tablet formulations (tablet A and B) relative to the marketed oral suspension (Noxafil) in 16 healthy volunteers under fasting and fed conditions.

-  Exposures for  the  posaconazole  tablet  (Tablet  A  and  B)  and  capsule  formulations  were  not markedly affected by food. (Consistent with historic data, a high-fat meal increased the mean peak  and  total  exposures  2.5-  to  3-fold  when  posaconazole  was  administered  as  an  oral suspension.)
-  Under both fasted and fed conditions, both posaconazole tablet formulations (tablets A and B) and the capsule formulation showed similar peak and total exposures.
-  Under fasted conditions, the tablet formulations (tablets A and B) and capsule formulation had less intersubject variability in peak and total exposures than the posaconazole oral suspension.

## Study P07691

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This six-sequence, randomized, open label, three-period, single site, single-dose study compared three formulations of posaconazole ( tablet D, tablet C and oral suspension ) in healthy subjects (18 to 65 years old) male and female subjects with a BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m2.

The study was designed to assess the relative bioavailability between the posaconazole tablet D with posaconazole tablet C (both 100mg, fasted), and posaconazole tablet D fasted with posaconazole oral suspension (fed) .

## Relative bioavailability of posaconazole tablet D versus POS tablet C:

Following a single-dose administration of 100 mg each, the rate and extent of absorption of posaconazole tablet D in fasted state was slightly lower compared to posaconazole tablet C in the fasted state.

-  Following a single dose administration of posaconazole 100 mg in the fasted state in healthy adults, the AUCs and Cmax of posaconazole tablet D were slightly lower compared to the AUCs and Cmax of posaconazole tablet C (10% and 14% lower respectively for AUC and Cmax);
-  The differences in AUC and Cmax between the tablet formulation D and the oral solution are not clinically relevant.
-  Following a single dose administration of posaconazole 100 mg in the fasted state for posaconazole tablet D and after a high fat meal for posaconazole oral suspension 100mg in healthy adults, the AUC and Cmax were considered to be similar between treatments.

## Study P07783 (Part 1)

This study was an open label, two-part, single and multiple-dose study in healthy volunteer subjects. Part 1 of the study was designed to estimate the absolute bioavailability of the FMI (posaconazole tablet D yellow) compared to an investigational posaconazole intravenous (IV)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

solution (via peripheral infusion) following a single dose administration of 300 mg for both formulations.

Part 2 of the study was designed to estimate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of posaconazole tablet D following 8 days of daily administration of 300 mg and is described later.

Mean AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ for the posaconazole tablet (tablet D) (22722 and 23647 hr*ng/mL, respectively) were approximately 2-fold smaller compared to the posaconazole IV solution (42905 and 44380 hr*ng/mL, respectively). The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) following the posaconazole tablet administration was approximately 7- fold lower than Cmax after posaconazole IV solution administration. Cmax was reached at a median of 5 hours for the tablet and at the end of infusion (0.5 hours) for the IV solution. The variability in Cmax and AUCs was consistently higher following posaconazole tablet administration (CV 38% to 48%, respectively) than following posaconazole IV solution administration (CV 19% to 32%, respectively).

The mean elimination half-life was similar (between 28 and 29 hours) for the two formulations. The (apparent) clearance and apparent volume of distribution were both approximately twice as high for the posaconazole tablet than for the posaconazole IV solution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration, in a cross-over design. The wash-out between successive dose administrations was at least one week. A total of 18 healthy male and female adult volunteers between 18 and 65 years (inclusive), BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive), were enrolled. Blood samples for PK evaluation were collected pre-dose (0 hour) and up to 72 hours post dose on Day 1.

Results of this study show that when a single dose of 300 mg posaconazole Tablet D is taken with a high fat meal, posaconazole exposure in terms of AUC0-last and Cmax increased 51% and 16%, respectively.

## Multidose studies with oral formulations

## Study P05637 (tablet C)

This study was a randomized (3:1), third-party blind, placebo-controlled, single and rising multipledose study, designed to determine the multiple dose (primary objective) and single dose (secondary objective) pharmacokinetics of posaconazole for a new solid oral tablet formulation in healthy subjects. Tablet C was used in this study.

This healthy volunteer study (n= 24, from 18- 65 years of age) was performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of posaconazole tablets and to evaluate the safety and tolerability. In addition, the effect of a twice daily (BID) loading dose and BID multiple dosing on the pharmacokinetics and safety was investigated.

A total of 24 subjects were to be randomized to one of two cohorts of 12 subjects each (9 active and 3 placebo) to receive single and multiple doses of posaconazole oral tablet.

For Cohort 1 (n= 12) , on Day 1, subjects received a single 200 mg dose of posaconazole or placebo. On Day 6, subjects received a 200 mg BID dose of posaconazole or placebo in the morning and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evening. On Days 7 through 14, subjects received a 200 mg once daily (QD) dose of posaconazole or placebo. On Days 15 through 22, subjects received 200 mg BID doses of posaconazole or placebo in the morning and evening.

For Cohort 2 , on Day 1 subjects received a single 400 mg dose of posaconazole or placebo in the morning. On Day 6, subjects received a 400 mg BID dose of posaconazole or placebo in the morning and evening. On Days 7 through 14, subjects received a 400 mg QD dose of posaconazole or placebo. Cohort 2 did not contain the BID doses on Days 15 through 22 that were administered in Cohort 1. PK modelling data suggested that safe exposure limits would be exceeded at 400 mg BID.

Following single oral administration of posaconazole tablet, the exposure increased in a dose-related manner. Based on log-transformed data, the dose-normalized Cmax and AUC for posaconazole 400 mg were 83% and 91% of that observed with the 200 mg dose).

## Pharmacokinetic Results (Multiple Doses)

Following multiple oral administration of posaconazole tablet (200 mg QD, 200 mg BID, and 400 mg QD) for 8 days, the exposure among treatment groups increased in a dose-related manner. Based on log-transformed data, the dose-normalized Cmax and AUC for posaconazole 400 mg were 76% and 81% of that observed with the 200 mg dose. The accumulation ratios upon multiple doses were 3.14, 4.75 and 3.16 for 200 mg QD, 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD doses, respectively. The variability in exposure for 400 mg dose appeared to be relatively higher (CV% of 54% for AUC). The steady state appeared to be achieved by Day 13.

- d : Accumulation ratio is calculated as ratio of AUC(tau) of Day 14 to Day 1 (QD dosing) and Day 22 to Day 6 (BID dosing), respectively.
- e: 200 mg BID and 400 mg BID loading dose on Day 6 for Cohort 1 and 2, respectively.

f: Pre-dose concentrations accounted for 1-5% and 1-9% of Cmax for 200 BID and 400 BID, respectively.

For single dosing

-  Posaconazole AUC increased in a dose related manner between 200 and 400 mg
-  Maximum posaconazole exposure was obtained at a median of 4 hr and 5 hr for 200 mg and 400 mg, respectively; mean half-life was comparable for the two dose levels (25-26 hr).
-  Variability ranged from 23% to 35% for AUCs.
-  Dose normalized posaconazole exposure on Day 1 was consistent with that observed in a previous study of posaconazole solid oral formulation (P04975, AUC0-∞ of 11400 hr*ng/mL after a single oral dose of 100 mg tablet under fasting condition).

## For multiple dosing

-  Posaconazole exposure increased in a dose related manner; when the dose increased in a 1:2 ratio, exposure increased in 1:1.9 and 1:1.8 ratios for Day 1 and Day 14, respectively, based on AUC.
-  Maximum  posaconazole  exposure  was  obtained  at  a  median  of  4  hours  and  5  hours, respectively; mean half-life was between 27 hours for 400 mg QD dosing and 31 hours for the 200 mg BID regimen. Variability for the 400 mg QD was higher (54% on AUC) than for the other dose regimens (32-38%).
-  Accumulation  ratios  for  the  QD  dose  regimens  were  comparable  for  200  mg  and  400  mg (around 3.15)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Steady state was reached by Day 13 (i.e. at 8 days of QD dosing including BID dosing on Day 6)

## Study P07783 (Part 2, Tablet D)

Part 2 of the study was designed to estimate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of posaconazole tablet D following 8 days of daily administration of 300 mg. (Part 1 was discussed earlier).

Part 2: On Day 1 of Part 2, subjects received a morning and evening dose of 300 mg posaconazole tablet  D  (3  X  100mg  tablets  twice  daily  as  a  loading  dose).  In  the  morning  of  Days  2  through  8, subjects received a single dose of 300 mg posaconazole tablets D yellow (3 X 100mg tablets).

Twelve (12) healthy adult subjects were enrolled for Part 2 and 11 subjects completed this study part.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction study

## Study P07764

This was a randomized, open-label, single center, five-way crossover, single dose healthy volunteer study requested by the FDA to investigate whether differences in absorption of posaconazole tablets were observed by increasing gastric pH and by changing the gastric and intestinal motility through pharmacological intervention with 4 drugs:

In this study Tablet D green was used. Twenty-one (21) subjects were enrolled and 20 subjects completed the study, with 1 subject withdrawing consent prematurely.

Antacid: A single 400 mg (100 mg x 4) dose of posaconazole tablets was dosed immediately after administration of 20 ml of Mylanta Ultimate Strength liquid under fasted condition.

Ranitidine: The H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine (Zantac tablets) was dosed at 150 mg BID orally on Day 1. A single 400 mg dose of posaconazole tablet was administered one hour after administration of the first ranitidine dose under a fasted condition.

Esomeprazole: The proton-pump inhibitor esomeprazole (Nexium) was dosed as 40 mg once in the morning QAM x 5 days (Days -4 to 1). Then on the fifth day (Day 1) esomeprazole was administered with a single 400 mg dose of posaconazole tablet under fasted condition.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Metoclopramide: The prokinetic agent metoclopramide (Reglan) was dosed at the highest recommended dose, 15 mg orally four times daily, during two days, starting on Day -1. On Day -1, metoclopramide doses were to be taken on an empty stomach 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. In the morning of Day 1 metoclopramide was to be administered together with a single 400 mg dose of posaconazole tablet under fasted condition.

In conclusion, there is no clinically meaningful effect of gastric pH or gastric motility on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole after co-administration of posaconazole with each of these drugs affecting the gastric pH or gastric motility.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

Not applicable.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The aim of the development programme was to produce a formulation that would improve exposure and avoid the requirement for multiple dosing taken with a high fat meal, which was recognised to pose problems in the target population. The proposed new tablet formulation is designed to inhibit the release of the active ingredient until the drug reaches the small intestine, where the entire dose of solubilised posaconazole is to be released triggered by the higher pH, aiming to maximize systemic absorption. During the development of the acid resistant pH-sensitive tablet formulation of posaconazole, several prototype formulations were tested (tablets A, B, C, capsule). The tablet formulations differed in their excipients, but the ratio of the solid dispersion composition of HPMCAS was held constant in all tablets (and the capsule). Dissolution showed similar release characteristics for all tablets with complete dissolution of the posaconazole tablets within 60 minutes, using twostage dissolution with pH change from 2 to 6.8 at 30 minutes, mimicking conditions of use with a transit from highly acidic to less acidic environment in the GI tract. Tablet D (yellow) was chosen as the FMI. D yellow and D green differ in the colour coating only and can be considered equivalent.

Study P07691 demonstrated that tablet D, when given fasted, has a similar overall exposure when compared with the currently marketed posaconazole oral suspension administered after a high fat

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

meal, when both are given at a dose of 100mg. It is noteworthy that the approved dose for the oral suspension as prophylaxis 200mg, given 3 times daily, while the proposed dose for the tablet formulation in this indication is 300mg once daily.  Following the CHMP discussion, a study investigating the food effect of tablet D was performed during the clock stop period and demonstrated that a food effect is observed with tablet D, but is considerably less than with the oral suspension. After a high fat meal, AUC is increased by 50% with the tablet compared to the fasting state. The effect on Cmax is small (16% increase).

A single dose study comparing tablet D to a non- approved intravenous solution (currently under evaluation in another line extension procedure) demonstrated an absolute bioavailability of around 50% in the fasting state. Variability for AUC and Cmax was higher with the tablet formulation, indicating that absorption factors contribute to CV%. As expected apparent clearance and Vz were twice as high for the tablet. T1/2 was around 28h for both formulations after a single dose.

Of note, these single-dose studies were performed with a posaconazole dose of 100mg. The dose proposed for marketing is 300mg (3 tablets of 100 mg), making this the preferred choice of dose for comparative bioavailability studies for a drug with linear PK.

Multiple dose studies were conducted with tablets C and D. Steady state was reached on Day 6- 8 of multiple dosing. There is relevant accumulation with multiple dosing, which is higher than expected, with an accumulation ratio of around 3. Half- life after 400mg QD multiple dosing was 26 h, as seen after single dose administration. Exposure increased approximately linearly between doses of 100mg and 400 mg with tablets D and C.  Dose linearity of doses up to 800mg had previously been demonstrated for the oral suspension. Relevant interactions with drugs affecting stomach pH and emptying were not observed.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The goal of the development programme was to produce a formulation with a reduced food effect and increased absorption.

With the results of study P112, it was demonstrated that the food effect of tablet D was relevantly reduced  when  compared  to  the  oral  suspension,  but  not  entirely  abolished.  Exposure  increases  by about 50% with a high fat meal with the tablet compared to 3- 4 fold with the oral suspension. The effect on Cmax is small for the tablet formulation. The effect of lighter meals on AUC is unknown.

At  a  single  dose  of  100mg,  tablet  D  given  when  fasted  produces  similar  exposures  as  100mg  oral suspension when given in the fed state.

Tablet  D  (fasted)  was  shown  to  have  an  absolute  bioavailability  of  around  50%  compared  to  an investigational  intravenous  solution,  which  is  currently  under  regulatory  review  in  a  parallel  line extension procedure.

Inter-study  comparisons  showed  that  after  single  doses  with  the  tablet  formulations,  there  is  an approximately linear increase of exposure up to a dose of 400mg.

The half- life for the 4 tablets A- D was similar, ranging from around 26- 29 hours, resulting from an apparent clearance of around 11- 15 L/h and a high volume of distribution. Exposures ranged from around 1140- 8400 hr.ng/mL and were lowest for tablet D.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is significant accumulation (accumulation factor around 3) which is greater than expected. This may at least in part be due to differences in food intake. Steady state is reached by Day 6-8. Apparent clearance decreases and half-life is longer with multiple dosing, and AUC and Cmax increase. These effects  are  not  fully  explained,  but  posaconazole  may  inhibit  its  own  metabolism,  thereby  reducing clearance over time. In addition, changes in food intake over time may increase exposure. This effect would be expected to be less pronounced with the tablet formulation and absent with an intravenous formulation.

Overall, the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole tablets have been sufficiently characterised, although the reason for the extent of accumulation seen is not fully clarified.

## 2.5. Bridging strategy, pharmacokinetics in target population and clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Bridging Strategy

This clinical program for the posaconazole tablet has been designed to demonstrate comparable exposure and safety for the posaconazole tablet among the same patient populations for which the posaconazole oral suspension has already been approved. The primary intent of the pivotal clinical study in patients (P05615) was to fully characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and assess the safety of the posaconazole tablet in neutropenic subjects (AML and MDS) and in subjects who had undergone a HSCT and were under treatment for GVHD.

The MAH states that a clear dose-response relationship has been identified with higher exposures associated with a higher likelihood of clinical response. In general, efficacy for prophylaxis appeared to be greater in posaconazole-treated subjects than in control subjects when posaconazole exposures were in the second or higher quartiles. This effect was seen not only in the pivotal Phase 3 prophylaxis studies (P 01899 and C/I98- 316) but also in patients with aspergillosis enrolled in the refractory IFI study (P00041)

## Posaconazole Oral Suspension Exposure Response Analysis In Key Clinical Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The plasma concentrations achieved in the 2 prior prophylaxis trials with posaconazole oral suspension at the approved clinical dose have been used by the MAH as a predictor of overall prophylaxis efficacy, and these 2 studies provide the basis for the target therapeutic exposure in the bridging study. In study P01899, the mean posaconazole plasma concentration following posaconazole oral suspension was 583 ng/mL, with 90% of patients attaining posaconazole average plasma levels (Cavg) greater than  or  equal  to  228  ng/mL.  In  study  C/I98-316,  the  mean  posaconazole  plasma  concentration following  posaconazole  oral  suspension  was  1130  ng/mL  with  90%  attaining  posaconazole  plasma Cavg greater than or equal to 322 ng/mL.

Furthermore,  a  key  fungal  pathogen  that  is  targeted  with  antifungal  prophylaxis  and  antifungal treatment is Aspergillus . Based on in vitro data, the posaconazole minimum inhibitory concentration of 90% of isolates  (MIC90)  for Aspergillus species  isolated  from  clinical  infections  is  0.5  ug/mL  (500 ng/mL).

Hence, the exposure target for selecting a dose for the posaconazole tablet in the pivotal posaconazole tablet patient study (P05615) was a steady -state Cavg range between 500 ng/mL to 2500 ng/mL for 90% of subjects. This exposure range was selected based upon the exposure response relationship noted with posaconazole oral suspension in the prophylaxis of IFI setting (C/I98 -316 and P01899) as well as the studies that were conducted in the refractory IFI setting (P00041). It was expected that a greater  proportion  of  subjects  would  attain  Cavg  greater  than  or  equal  to  500  ng/mL  with  the posaconazole tablet than with the oral suspension, as issues regarding limited absorption due to poor food intake were considered no longer relevant.

<!-- image -->

ProjectedExposureforPOSSolution200mgQDand300mgQD=Boxrepresents25thto75thpercentiles,lineinsidethe ss (anysubjectwithavalueoutsideofthe1othand9oth percentile).

With regards to the upper exposure limit, the protocol P05615 specified that the upper limit exposure Cavg threshold for posaconazole tablet Phase 1B portion of the study was to be 3750 ng/mL. A similar study for the posaconazole IV solution (study P05520) specified an upper limit exposure Cavg threshold for the posaconazole IV study to be 3650 ng/mL. The maximum desired exposure target was related to safety based upon prior clinical and preclinical events with posaconazole. The development program for posaconazole tablet sought to maintain exposures within the upper limit of exposures achieved with previous posaconazole formulations. The highest posaconazole steady-state exposures in prophylaxis studies were noted in subjects with Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) receiving posaconazole prophylaxis (99th percentile of exposure: 3260 ng/mL). Posaconazole exposures in healthy volunteers receiving posaconazole oral suspension have been shown to be 2-fold to 3-fold higher than those found in patients and include exposures up to approximately 5960 ng/mL. Within this range of exposures, no dose-limiting safety events have been identified in either patients or healthy volunteers enrolled in posaconazole oral suspension clinical trials. In animals, preclinical findings of a possible association of an effect on steroidogenesis with high posaconazole exposure have been noted similar to that reported with other azoles. This effect has been observed in animals at an AUC of approximately 130,000 hr.ng/mL (Cavg of 5,400 ng/mL) with a no-effect level preclinically with AUC &lt;90,000 hr·ng/mL (Cavg 3,750 ng/mL). Exposure was targeted to be within the range of posaconazole exposures previously studied and considered to be safe and effective in the prophylactic setting. The exposure target is based upon the range of exposures achieved, as well as the exposure-response relationship found in earlier controlled studies of posaconazole oral suspension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The exposure target range for the use of posaconazole tablets in patients in the prophylaxis setting was set as below:

Cavg at steady-state levels ≥500 ng/mL or AUC ≥12,000 hr·ng/mL in at least 90% of subjects (per PK evaluable dosing cohort).

- Mean Cavg steady-state level ≤2,500 ng/mL or AUC ≤59,000 hr·ng/mL (per serial PKevaluable dosing cohort)
- No subject with a mean steady-state plasma concentration &gt;3,750 ng/mL or with a steadystate AUC &gt;90,000 hr·ng/mL (per serial PK-evaluable dosing cohort)

Cavg was the exposure parameter used in studies with posaconazole oral suspension and therefore this was the major bridging PK parameter. In addition to the Cavg as the major bridging parameter, the Cmin is taken into account and evaluated against the Cavg requirements.

## PK and exposure in target population: Main study (P05615)

This  single  pivotal  Phase  1b/3  study  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics,  safety,  and tolerability  of  multiple  dose  administration  of  posaconazole  tablet  in  patients  receiving  prophylaxis. Study P05615 was a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, global study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of posaconazole tablet used as prophylaxis in 230 adult subjects at high risk for IFIs.

Further details on the study design are given in section 'Clinical efficacy' .

The primary objective of this study was the characterization the PK profile of posaconazole tablets in a representative subject population.

## Treatment administered

Tablets were taken without regard to food. Planned treatment duration was up to 28 days, minimum duration 8 days

## Population and sampling

Part 1 enrolled neutropenic subjects undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS) with a minimum duration of therapy of 8 days and a maximum duration of 28 days.

Part 1A : 200 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 200 mg QD thereafter

Part 1B: 300 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 300 mg QD thereafter

The dose selection and decision to proceed to Part 2 were based on the posaconazole tablet exposure levels achieved and the safety observed among the Part 1 subjects.

Part 2 enrolled two patient populations. Neutropenic subjects undergoing chemotherapy for AML or MDS and subjects who were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Patients received a dose of 300mg posaconazole per day (after a loading dose of 2x 300mg on day 1).

## Sampling Part 1:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Serial PK sampling on Day 1 and Day 8 at pre-dose, approximately 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8 in all patients
-  Trough levels on Day 2, Day 3, Day 8, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 28 (or EoT) in all patients

Sampling Part 2: Sparse PK sampling (trough, Cmin) in all subjects

-  Serial PK sampling on Day 1 and Day 8 in a subset of ca. 30 HSCT patients

The primary PK parameter of interest was the plasma posaconazole exposures at steady state (Cavg). The desired exposure targets at steady state needed to be met in Part 1 to allow for dose selection for Part 2.

A dose was to be selected for Part 2 based on the following criteria in the serial PK-evaluable cohort:

- Cavg at steady-state levels ≥500 ng/mL or AUC ≥12,000 hr·ng/mL in at least 90% of subjects (per PK evaluable dosing cohort).
- Mean Cavg steady-state level ≤2,500 ng/mL or AUC ≤59,000 hr·ng/mL (per serial PKevaluable dosing cohort)
- No subject with a mean steady-state plasma concentration &gt;3,750 ng/mL or with a steadystate AUC &gt;90,000 hr·ng/mL (per serial PK-evaluable dosing cohort)

In addition, Cmin values were to be evaluated similar to the Cavg.

## PK Results

A total of 230 subjects were treated, 20 subjects treated with posaconazole tablet 200 mg (Part 1A), and 210 subjects treated with posaconazole tablet 300 mg (Part 1B, n=34; Part 2, n=176). The study treated 110 (48%) subjects with AML (new diagnosis), 20 (9%) subjects with AML (first relapse), 9 (4%) subjects with MDS, and 91 (40%) subjects with HSCT, as the primary diseases at study entry.

## 200 mg (Part 1A), Serial PK evaluable cohort

The predefined targets for dose selection for Part 2 were not achieved with the 200 mg dose.  Six (6) of 18 subjects (33%) attained Cmin between 200 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, and 12 of 18 (67%) attained Cmin between 500 ng/mL and 2500 ng/mL.

## Individual Observed Posaconazole Cavg in Serial PK Evaluable Subjects Following 200 mg or 300 mg Multiple Dosing of Posaconazole Tablet

<!-- image -->

In Part 1 subjects, a strong correlation was found between the observed Cavg values and observed average  Cmin  values  (R2=0.92).  Using  the  serial  PK  data  from  both  Parts  1  and  2,  the  following formula  was  developed to  predict  steady-state  Cavg  (predicted  Cavg,  pCavg)  using  observed  Cavg and trough values (Cmin) on Day 8:

## Predicted Cavg (pCavg) = 228 + 1.02 · Avg\\_Cmin .

Using this linear regression model the pCavg could be derived from the observed average Cmin values obtained at steady state in the Cmin PK-evaluable cohort. The average Cmin was calculated as the average of observed trough plasma values at steady state on Days 8, 14, 21 and Day 28/EOT:

## Predicted Cavg (pCavg) Evaluation

Among 205 Cmin PK-evaluable subjects receiving 200 mg or 300 mg QD, the mean pCavg levels for 200 mg and 300 mg (1010 ng/mL and 1970 ng/mL) in the Cmin PK-evaluable cohort were higher than the observed Cavg values on Day 8 in the serial PK-evaluable subjects (981 ng/mL and 1580 ng/mL).

Shaded Area = POS Tablet Exposure Target (500 ng/mL - 2,500 ng/mL) for 90% of subjects

Source Data: Posaconazole (SCH 56592) Intravenous Solution Briefing Document April 2010 and P05615.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

## Composite pharmacokinetic analysis

The composite PK analysis included the 5 healthy volunteer studies (P04975, P05637, P07764, P07691, P07783) presented above and 1 patient study (P05615). The healthy volunteer studies included doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg for single dose data, and 200 mg and 400 mg for multiple dose (steady state) data. The patient study P05615 was analysed separately, with doses of 200 and 300 mg administered QD (following BID dosing on day 1).

The objective of this composite PK analysis is to evaluate the factors that affect single and multiple dose posaconazole pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and to estimate intra-and inter individual variability. Additionally, factors affecting posaconazole PK in patients were evaluated.

All individual PK parameters were dose normalized to 100 mg and natural log transformed and evaluated in a linear mixed effects model including fixed effects of dose (since posaconazole PK is slightly less than proportional for doses higher than 300 mg), formulation, race, and gender, a random effect of subject within study, and covariates of age and weight.

## Population PK (popPK) model

The primary objectives of the analysis were

- o To develop a population PK model of posaconazole tablet using data in healthy volunteers and patients and quantify the variability of posaconazole exposure
- o To perform covariate analysis to identify the demographic and clinical factors that might affect the exposure of posaconazole

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o To conduct simulations to estimate the mean Cavg and Cmin and the percent of population with exposures above 500 ng/mL.

This population PK analysis includes the data from the 5 healthy volunteer studies (P04975, P05637, P07764, P07783 and P07764) and 1 patient study (P05615). Only data from healthy volunteers and patients who were treated with posaconazole tablet were included. Data from all tablet formulations were used (tablet A, B, C, and D) with posaconazole tablet D as the final formulation.

In total, 335 subjects (104 healthy volunteers and 231 patients (1 patient had one pre-dose sample and was thus not included in the PK analyses in the study) and 5756 observations were available for the analysis.

## Results

The data were best described by a 1-compartmental model with a sequential zero first order absorption and a first order disposition from the central compartment. Model was parameterized in terms of clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V).The inter-individual variability was assumed log normal and inter-occasion variability on the absorption and bioavailability parameters was incorporated. Data were log transformed for fitting purposes. The residual variability was described by two parameters, one for the (clinical) phase 1 and one for the (clinical) phase 2/3 data.

Covariate analysis showed 5 statistically significant covariates, 1 continuous (weight on F1) and 4 categorical (Regimen on Clearance, food on KA (absorption rate constant), formulation and subpopulation on F1 (bioavailability)

Model qualification showed that the model was adequate and robust and could be used for simulation purposes and calculation of the relevant exposure parameters (AUCô, Cavg, Cmin). Although the Cmax was underpredicted (more pronounced at single dose compared to multiple dose), the prediction of AUC0-T and Cmin was good with in most cases a slight overprediction. The model best describes the PK of posaconazole in the patient population.

A food effect study has been recently conducted with the posaconazole 300 mg Tablet D after the initial submission. Hence, the original existing model has been updated by including the food effect data of P112.

Although food is now identified as a significant covariate on bioavailability in this updated popPK model, the table above shows that the estimates of all the other model parameters are quite similar in the updated popPK model relative to the original popPK model.

## The MAH concluded that

-  Posaconazole tablet pharmacokinetics can be modelled adequately with a 1- compartmental pharmacokinetic model with sequential zero/first order absorption.
-  Moderate variability was estimated for bioavailability (24 and 21% respectively for between and within subject variability) and clearance (38%).
-  Variability for the rate of absorption (Ka) was relatively high as there was limited data to support precise assessment of this parameter.

## Model predicted exposures for posaconazole tablet formulation

The popPK model was developed from the available data on the tablet formulation. This open one compartmental population PK model with sequential zero/first order absorption model was subsequently used to simulate patient PK profiles and then model estimated AUC and Cmin were compared against observed values in order to evaluate the performance of the model for the target patient population. As indicated by the boxplot, the final PK model is able to simulate patient PK parameters comparable to the observed ones.

## Boxplot comparing observed and simulated PK parameters in patients

<!-- image -->

The population PK model developed for posaconazole tablet was used to simulate the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole in subjects at high risk for IFI and to assess the percentage of population with steady-state exposures above 500 ng/mL and 3750 ng/mL for 2 important parameters, Cavg and Cmin. In addition to 300 mg, alternate dose levels of 200 mg and 250 mg QD dosing (with BID dosing on Day 1) were simulated.

As there is no appreciable reduction in the proportion of subjects with very high exposures between the 250- and 300-mg dose and the known variability of posaconazole exposure would likely conceal any minor pharmacokinetic differences between these 2 doses, the MAH maintains that the 300-mg dose is the appropriate dose for consideration in both the prophylactic setting and as salvage therapy for refractory IFI.

## Comparisons of exposures after single doses of the oral suspension and the tablet formulation

In response to questions, the following comparisons were provided. For the single dose data, the observed concentration time profile for posaconazole tablet on Day 1, following 300 mg BID dose, is shown and compared with the observed concentration time profile for the posaconazole oral suspension on Day 3, following dosing as 200 mg QID (i.e., after 2 days of 200 mg QID dosing). This latter profile was selected because this is the best reflection of an early concentration-time profile with posaconazole oral suspension in patients at hand.

## Additional Simulations to Evaluate Weight-based Dosing in Allogeneic HSCT Patients

Further simulations with the population PK model, developed for posaconazole tablet have been conducted in order to evaluate if a subgroup of patients may benefit from a lower dose (200 mg) of posaconazole tablet. As it was agreed that exposure differences between 250 and 300 mg were generally small, only the lower dose of 200 mg was further evaluated.

The simulation dataset included 1000 acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) subjects and 1000 HSCT subjects and the significant covariate (weight) identified during model development was included in the dataset. Three cut-off weights were chosen at the low end of the weight distribution, i.e. 50, 60 and 70 kg, representing approximately 5, 18 and 40% of the subjects included in the pivotal prophylaxis study of the posaconazole tablet (P05615). The simulations evaluated a 300 mg BID loading dose on Day 1 followed by 300 mg QD, and a 200 mg BID loading dose on Day 1 followed by 200 mg QD.

It is noted that the simulations are based on limited exposure data, in particular in the weight group ≤50 kg, and therefore the simulated exposures in this weight group are considered less reliable.

## Further Simulations of the Effect of Food

Results of the food effect study with the final market image (FMI) of posaconazole tablet show that when a single dose of 300 mg of posaconazole tablet is administered with a high fat meal, posaconazole exposure (AUC(0-last)) increased 51%, as compared to the exposure of a single dose of 300 mg posaconazole tablet taken in a fasted state. When these data were included in the population PK model, the model describes a 56% increase in bioavailability when posaconazole tablets are taken

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with a high fat meal, which is in concordance with the food effect that was observed in PN112. The estimated food effect is based on administration with a high fat meal which represents a worst case extreme of the potential food effect in patients receiving posaconazole as prophylaxis. It is likely that is noteworthy because lighter meals are more typical for the patient population for whom this drug is to 3-fold with a low fat meal and 4-fold with a high fat meal.

the food effect for lighter meals (i.e., lower fat) will be less than the ~50% effect observed. This effect indicated. By way of example, with posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg), AUC was increased by 2.6 It is not possible to simulate patient exposures with the population PK model under different food intake conditions, because the food status of patients included in P05615 is unknown. In fact the Applicant considers that it is likely that the range of exposures seen in P05615 actually captured the food effect in the target patient population, with exposures of AML/MDS patients and HSCT patients reflecting the lower and the higher end of the food effect, respectively. In study P05615, a ~30% higher plasma exposure of posaconazole was observed in HSCT patients as compared to neutropenic AML/MDS patients. Differences in plasma exposure between HSCT patients and the sicker, neutropenic AML/MDS patients may be related to their ability to take their dose with food (i.e., AML/MDS patients recently rendered neutropenic from cytotoxic chemotherapy also routinely suffer from severe nausea and anorexia, thereby limiting their food intake). Notably, the food effect largely falls within the moderate variability of posaconazole exposure in P05615 (CV% of approximately 40% in patients). However, in order to address this question to some extent, significant assumptions with regard to food intake in the clinical trial P05615 were applied to population PK to facilitate further simulations. The population PK model was used to simulate the exposure (Cavg) of a typical HSCT patient weighing 50, 60, or 70 kg, receiving a 200 or 300 mg daily dose under different assumed food conditions. For the exposure estimation under different food scenarios, 2 significant assumptions were made. The first assumption was that during patient study P05615, each patient had taken posaconazole tablets with a high fat meal, and now for the simulation, the tablets are taken fasted (reducing the exposure with a factor representing a food effect of 1/1.56 (0.64) from the population PK model). The same was done for the exposure estimation for the second assumption of a fed condition, wherein it was assumed that each patient was dosed fasted during patient study P05615, and now for the simulation the tablets are taken with a high fat meal (increasing the exposure with a factor representing a food effect of 1.56 from the population PK model).

Of  note,  in  Table  1.4,  the  '1'  value  represents  simulated  exposures  when  posaconazole tablet  was taken without regard to food (the actual food intake status in patient study P05615).

This table shows that, a HSCT patient weighing 50 kg, who now receives a dose of 200 or 300 mg with a high fat meal (assuming that he had fasted during study P05615), would obtain a Cavg of 2710 or 4064 ng/mL, respectively. As expected, for a patient weighing 60 or 70 kg, exposures with the same food intake condition/assumptions are lower. On the other hand, if a HSCT patient weighing 70 kg now receives a daily dose of 200 or 300 mg under fasting condition (assuming he had taken high fat meals during study P05615), the Cavg would be 786 or 1181 ng/mL, respectively. As expected, for a patient weighing 50 or 60 kg, exposures under the same food intake condition/assumptions are higher.

## Applicability of data from the prophylaxis population to the treatment population

While a relatively lower dose of posaconazole oral suspension was used in the pivotal prophylaxis trials (600 mg/day) compared to the treatment dosing (800 mg/day), overlapping exposures have been seen in patients with these two treatment regimens.

The demographic characteristics were also similar among the three pivotal trials of posaconazole oral suspension (including the 2 trials in prophylaxis [P01899, C/I98-316] and 1 trial in treatment of IFI [P00041]) and the more recent posaconazole tablet study in prophylaxis (P05615).

## 2.5.2. Main study (P05615)

Pharmacokinetics and safety of solid oral posaconazole (SCH 56592) in subjects at high risk for invasive fungal infections.

## Methods

This was a two-part, sequential, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, global study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of posaconazole tablet when used as prophylaxis in adult subjects at high risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The study was conducted between 2009 and 2012. Patients were enrolled in 42 study centres in 15 countries:

The primary objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of posaconazole tablet in a representative subject population. The secondary objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the safety and gastrointestinal tolerability of posaconazole tablet in a representative subject population, and (2) to evaluate the steady-state posaconazole exposure in a representative population given posaconazole tablet.

The study consisted of sequential parts 1A, 1B and 2.

Part 1 enrolled neutropenic subjects undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS). The treatment duration was to be up to 28 days, with a minimum duration of therapy of 8 days and a maximum duration of 28 days. Two different dosing groups were evaluated in Part 1.

Part 1A: 200 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 200 mg QD thereafter

Part 1B: 300 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 300 mg QD thereafter

The dose selection and decision to proceed to Part 2 were based on the posaconazole tablet exposure levels achieved and the safety observed among the Part 1 subjects.

Part  2  enrolled  two  patient  populations.  Neutropenic  subjects  undergoing  chemotherapy  for  AML  or MDS and subjects who were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

## Study Participants

Eligible children were to be aged ≥ 18 years weighing more than 34kg with Anticipated (likely to develop within 3 days to 5 days) or documented prolonged neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500/mm3 [0.5 x 10 9 /L]) at baseline and likely to last for at least 7 days due to standard intensive induction chemotherapy.

The targeted sample size was 210 subjects. The determination of sample size was based upon the targeted number of subjects for evaluation of PK and safety as well as the anticipated discontinuation rate.

The posaconazole plasma concentration-time data was determined by a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the study, there were a total of 230 treated subjects, 20 subjects were treated with posaconazole tablet 200 mg (Part 1A), and 210 subjects were treated with posaconazole tablet 300 mg (Part 1B, n=34; Part 2, n=176).

A total of 237 subjects were screened for eligibility. 27 subjects who were screened but not enrolled (22 subjects) (i.e., screen failures) or enrolled but not treated (5 subjects). Failure to meet protocol eligibility criteria was the primary reason for which subjects were not enrolled

## Outcomes

Clinical failure during the exposure was the secondary efficacy endpoint collected. There was no adjudication or review of IFI diagnosis. The reported IFI diagnosis was based upon investigator judgment.

In the 200 mg Cohort, IFIs (proven or probable as determined by the investigator) were reported for 2 subjects (10%) treated with posaconazole. Both subjects with an IFI in the 200-mg dosing cohort (Part 1A) died as a result of the infection within the protocol-defined follow up period of 65 days. The Cmin values for these patients  were reportedly 261ng/ml and 162ng/ml Cavg was not reported. There were no further deaths in the 200 mg Cohort.

In the 300 mg Cohort, there was 1 subject (&lt;1%) treated with posaconazole with a reported IFI (proven or probable as determined by the investigator). This subject was diagnosed with a fungal infection of the pleura (with abnormal radiograph on Day 8). Culture results reported the isolation of Candida glabrata . The subject's posaconazole concentration at the time of diagnosis of the infection was 2530 ng/mL.

There were 9 additional subjects in the 300 mg Cohort identified by the investigator with a \"possible\" IFI. Abnormal radiographic findings were reported for all subjects with a diagnosis of a 'possible' IFI; no mycological evidence of infection was identified in these subjects. In all cases, the investigator reported the presence of possible IFI for the analysis of clinical failure.

The incidence of AEs associated with discontinuation of study drug was 18% for subjects in the 300mg dosing cohort. Early treatment discontinuation due to a possible IFI occurred with six (3%) out of the 18 subjects. Eighteen (9%) of the treated subjects were not alive at Day 65, the majority of which occurred in Part 2 of the study. Note there were two additional 300 mg subjects that had reported deaths after the Day 65 window (&gt;70 days).

## 2.5.3. Discussion on bridging strategy, pharmacokinetics and exposure in patients and clinical efficacy

## Bridging strategy

The PK/PD relationship for azoles in general and for posaconazole in particular has been studied in a murine model for candidiasis and a rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. For Candida , the PK/PD parameter most closely related with outcome in a murine model was shown to be AUC24/MIC. The Cmax/MIC ratio was also shown to be relevant. In clinical studies plasma concentration rather than AUC/MIC ratios have been used in an attempt to correlate exposure and response and Cavg is used as the bridging parameter. The plasma concentration curve for posaconazole at steady state is relatively flat due to the long half- life, and Cavg and AUC can be used interchangeably. Cavg is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

derived by dividing AUCtau/tau. Scientific advice had been obtained from CHMP for the development of an intravenous solution of posaconazole. A development programme focusing on PK and exposure similarity between the approved formulation of posaconazole (oral suspension) and the proposed new formulation was agreed in principle. Exposure- response analysis from the pivotal trials for the oral suspension had indicated an association between lower plasma concentrations and clinical failure. The lower boundary (Cavg &gt; 500 ng/mL) for the pivotal tablet study (P05615) was selected based on the results of the exposure/ response analyses from studies with the oral suspension. While a exposure- response relationship seems plausible, and is supported by some in vitro data, clinical data are sparse. A clear target is difficult to establish. There is no identified exposure level separating clinical response from failure. In the pivotal prophylaxis trials mean Cavg were 583 ng/mL with 90% of patients attaining posaconazole average plasma levels (Cavg) ≥228 ng/mL (study P01899) and 1130 ng/mL with 90% attaining posaconazole plasma Cavg greater than or equal to 322 ng/mL (study C/I98-316). In the treatment trial, clinical results were best for patients in the 4th quartile, which had a steady-state Cavg mean of 1250 ng/mL. It is agreed that the outcome in the upper exposure quartiles is better than in the lowers quartiles in the treatment study P00041. Due to the low number of events in the prophylaxis trials, such a trend is more difficult to detect. For this reason data were reviewed by using a composite endpoint as proposed by the FDA, which provided support for the 500ng/ml lower boundary. This method certainly increases the event rate, however by including mortality it does at the same time introduce further uncertainty in the evaluation, as this population has a relatively high mortality unrelated to fungal infections and their treatment. For the pivotal study with the tablet formulation, a target range of Cavg between 500- 2500 ng/ml was aimed for in 90% of subjects, as discussed in the CHMP scientific advice.  Considering all the data presented, and acknowledging the inherent difficulties, it seems reasonable to accept the proposed 500ng/ml threshold as the lower boundary for both treatment and prophylaxis indication. The rationale for the upper boundary of the 500- 2500ng/ml target range targeted for 90% of the population was not well explained. While around half of the healthy volunteers had exposures around 2500 ng/ml or greater, less than 5 % of patients had such exposures. The absolute upper boundary (Cavg &lt; 3,750 ng/mL) was selected based on preclinical toxicology findings, specifically considering a possible effect of posaconazole on steroidogenesis, although the NOEL (Cavg 975ng/ml) for such an effect in monkeys is seen within the therapeutic range in humans and seems hence difficult to justify. Less than 7.5% of the healthy volunteers had exposures around 3750 ng/ml or greater, and such exposures had not been observed in any patient trials with the oral suspension.

## PK and exposure - study P05615

This single arm Phase 1/III study aimed to establish the PK profile of the posaconazole tablet formulation and to provide bridging data to the oral suspension. Posaconazole tablets were given without regard to food in this study and food intake was not recorded.  Two dose levels, 200mg and 300mg, were investigated using two different tablet formulations (C and D).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dense  sampling  was  performed  in  all  patients  in  part  1  and  a  subset  of  part  2  patients.  Sparse sampling (Cmin) was performed in the remaining subjects in Part 2. Data from dense (serial) sampling are available from 68 patients, of which n=17 were HSCT patients receiving a dose of 300mg and 51 patients with AML or MDS who received doses of 200mg (n=18) or 300mg (n= 33). The 2 groups were analysed separately as in studies with posaconazole oral suspension, exposure was shown to be higher in patients with HSCT. At the 200mg dose level, investigated only for the group with the expected lower exposure (AML/MDS), PK target criteria were not met. At a dose of 300mg, 90% of AML/ MDS patients were within the target range of 500- 2500nm/ml, the remaining 10% had exposures &gt; 2500 but &lt; 3750ng/ml, meeting the predefined criteria. There was a strong correlation between Cmin and Cavg in part 1 of the study. In part 2, sparse sampling (Cmin) only was performed, and Cavg was predicted based on this correlation (pCavg). The Cmin evaluable cohort included 205 patients. Here, predicted mean Cavg levels for 200 mg and 300 mg (1010 ng/mL and 1970 ng/mL) were higher than in the group of serial PK-evaluable subjects (1970 ng/mL vs. 1580 ng/mL in the ). This may in part be due to an overestimation of Cavg in the upper exposure range and in part reflect a real difference between the populations as the underlying conditions differ. The lower limit exposure criteria were met; however the upper bound was exceeded. At a dose level of 300mg, &gt; 99% of had plasma concentrations of Cavg &gt; 500ng/ml. However, 15% of patients had exposures &gt; 2500 ng/ml, and 4% exceeded the upper threshold of 3750ng/ml. As expected from data with the oral suspension, HSCT patients had higher exposures on average an exceeded the target range more frequently. The MAH developed a population PK model, which was used to simulate 1000 HSCT and AML patients each, taking the identified relevant covariate of weight into account. The modelled data are in line with the study results. The upper end of the targeted range is exceeded in a relevant proportion of subjects. Patients after HSCT patients and or those weighing &lt;72.5 kg are more likely to exceed the target exposure range. As the upper exposure target was exceeded with the 300mg dose, additional modelling was requested to evaluate doses &lt; 300mg. These simulations indicate that the 200mg dose would indeed be expected to result in lower than targeted exposures in 8% of patients overall, while this number is reduced to 3.3% with 250mg and to 1% with the 300mg dose. The aim of the development program was the increase exposure and efficacy, which is justified by the high morbidity and mortality of IFI when they occur. The figures indicate that from an efficacy perspective, a dose of 300mg may be preferable, as may be expected.  It should however be remembered that the target exposure is derived from a limited dataset and the chosen cut-off of 500ng/ml is not a clear margin separating success from failure. Simulation results presented with the responses show that there is indeed a relatively small difference between patients achieving exposures &gt; 3750 ng/ml between the 250mg and 300mg dose overall. The dose of 300mg may be the most appropriate dose at least for a proportion of patients. Apart from the underlying disease, weight has also been identified as a relevant covariate and a weight cut-off for a lower dose may decrease the number of patients with high exposures with relevantly affecting the lower margin.  Further simulations requested explored if this dose should be applicable to the whole

target population. Those simulations suggested that a lower dose of 200mg in HSCT patients &lt; 60 or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

70kg would lead to a lower proportion of patients exceeding the upper target range, although the difference is comparatively small. Separating the posology by weight alone would have been practicable; however, separating the dose in addition by weight seems less appropriate, in particular as it is not clear how other immunosuppressed patients not falling in either category should be treated (where posaconazole is used as a treatment, the target population includes all patients with an IFI).

An added complicating factor is the observed food effect for the tablet formulation. In the pivotal study posaconazole tablets were given without regard food, yet the food effect study submitted with the responses indicates a 50% increase in AUC with a high fat meal. The effect may be less in clinical practice, where the majority of the target population may not take high fat meals, but it is not known how lighter meals may have affected exposure. The applicant's position was that the effect of food is largely captured in the range of exposures seen due to the differences in food intake between the populations, which is likely correct to some extent. Additional simulations, covering the more extreme ends of the food related exposure spectrum were provided, showing that the risk of underexposure is below that seen with the presently approved formulation. A wording pointing out that exposure is increased by food intake is added to the SmPC.

## Applicability of data from the prophylaxis population to the treatment population

While there are some uncertainties about the exposure targets in general, it is accepted in principle that the exposure targets set for the prophylaxis indication may be applied to the treatment indication based on the available data. However, several factors may lead to differences in exposure between prophylaxis and treatment populations: e.g. patients with rIFI may require different doses to achieve similar exposures due to reduced absorption due to the acute infection or PK parameters affecting exposure (such as Vd, CL) may be altered in acute infection. There may also be differences in concomitant medication. The currently approved dose for the oral suspension for the treatment rIFI is 800mg/ day, while the approved dose for prophylaxis is 600mg/day. Despite the different doses, there is overlap in the resulting exposure between study 041 (treatment of IFI) when compared to 316 (prophylaxis of IFI), which might suggest higher doses may be needed in the treatment population than in the prophylaxis indication to achieve similar exposures.  When dose normalised exposures are compared, it appears that there is little difference between mean exposure in the treatment study, which included patients with AML/MDS and HSCT (and others), and study P01899 (AML/MDS only), while mean exposure is lower than in trial 316 (HSCT only). The relative proportion of patients with HSCT or AML/MDS in study P00041 will have affected the overall result, and separate evaluation of these subgroups would contribute to the understanding of the comparative exposure.

The main difference between the exposure not only in these subpopulations, but also between the treatment and the prophylaxis population, is considered to lie in the different ability to comply with dietary requirement, which is plausible. It is agreed that the reduced food effect seen with the tablet formulation can be expected to reduce the differences between the groups and provides support for the view that the same dose may be appropriate for both. The applicant provided data to suggest that the pathophysiological changes during infection are not likely to lead to relevant difference in exposure in the treatment population.

## Clinical efficacy

This open, non-comparative study was not designed as a clinical efficacy study, but aimed to investigate the PK of the proposed tablet formulation of posaconazole in the target population for the prophylaxis indication and to provide additional safety data. The study population included patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with AML/MDS and HSCT with the aim to enrol patients representative of the target population for antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole. A tabulated comparison of the baseline demographics between P05615 and the trials with the oral suspension indicated that the populations appear similar, and while some of the baseline covariates of possible relevance to exposure data were not evenly distributed between the studies (gender, race) as may be expected, these factors were not consistently shown to be relevant in the composite PK analysis.

A PK target range of Cavg was set for study part 1, based on the results from previous trials with the oral suspension as a surrogate for the clinical outcome and PK results have been discussed earlier. The study design including lack of a control group and short study duration may be acceptable with regards to the primary endpoint, but limits safety data evaluation. The criteria for diagnosis of an IFI were not clearly presented and not adjudicated.

The reported rate of breakthrough fungal infections was low. In the 200mg dose group, 2 of 20 patients were clinical failures, and 1 failure occurred in the 300 mg dose group. Nine patients were identified to have possible infections; in 6 of these cases posaconazole was discontinued.  Of the 8 cases which suspected or proven IFI for which plasma concentration values were available, 4 were below the exposure target of 500ng/ml, and 4 above. Available data are too limited to draw conclusions.

In the pivotal prophylaxis trials in HSCT patients (C/I98-316), the reported IFI rate at 16 weeks was 5% (16/301 subjects) with an average duration study drug of 84 days. The incidence of IFI in the pivotal trial in AML/MDS with posaconazole oral suspension (P01899) was 7/304 (2%); the average duration of treatment for subjects in this study was 22 days, but follow up was longer than in P05615.

In summary, the reported incidence of IFI in this trial was low and appeared in line with earlier prophylaxis trials with the oral suspension, however treatment duration and follow up was shorter than in previous trials. As expected, no firm conclusions can be drawn from these results.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on bridging strategy, pharmacokinetics and exposure in patients and the clinical efficacy

The generated data suggest an exposure/response relationship, and such a relationship is biologically plausible. The lower boundary of 500ng/ml is an acceptable lower exposure target based on the limited data available. It does however not represent a cut-off clearly separating success from failure. The acceptability of the upper exposure target depends on the observed safety.

Simulation results suggest that a dose of 300mg may be the most appropriate dose for the majority of patients. A lower dose of 200mg could reduce the proportion of HSCT patients &lt;60kg exceeding the target range of Cavg. In view of the relatively small difference, the lack of confirmed safety problems from the available database so far, and the practical difficulties separating subpopulations explained earlier it seems preferable to apply the 300mg dose to the whole target population.

The omission of recording the food effect in the pivotal study remains a flaw in the development programme of the tablet formulation, and the CHMP recommends that further information should be obtained in the on-going trial.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

A total of 334 subjects treated with posaconazole tablet were enrolled in clinical studies to support the registration of posaconazole tablet. This included 104 healthy volunteer subjects, who were enrolled in five Phase 1, single and multiple dose studies and 230 patients, who received a daily dose of either 200mg or 300mg. Safety data were collected for all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of posaconazole or placebo to posaconazole.

Safety data in healthy volunteers as summarised by the MAH are presented below:

Of the 31 healthy volunteers who received multiple daily doses of posaconazole tablets of 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg following a BID loading dose on Day 1, 4 subjects (13%) discontinued treatment due to an AE that was considered possibly or probably related to study drug. The most common reported TEAEs after multiple dosing were hepatic enzyme increased (23%, all considered mild or moderate), diarrhoea (19%), and nausea (13%) which were all considered treatment related. There were no deaths or SAEs in any of the studies of healthy. The safety profile of posaconazole tablets in healthy volunteers was similar to the safety profile of posaconazole oral suspension in healthy volunteers.

The overview focuses on the data from the 210 patients who received the proposed dose of 300mg/ day, for further data on the 200mg dose group (n=20) please see the Clinical assessment report.

In comparison, in the two randomized, comparative prophylaxis studies (P01899 and C/I98-316) of posaconazole oral suspension that enrolled a similar population to that enrolled in P05615, the most frequently reported TEAEs were fever (posaconazole: 45%, FLU: 47%), diarrhoea (posaconazole: 42%, FLU: 39%), and nausea (posaconazole: 38%, FLU: 37%). The most common treatment-related TEAEs were nausea (posaconazole: 7%, FLU: 8%), diarrhoea (posaconazole: 5%, FLU: 4%), and vomiting (posaconazole: 4%, FLU: 5%).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The most common AEs leading to death were from \"infections and infestations\", reported in 8 subjects (including sepsis and septic shock), and there were 2 subjects with reported renal failure as an AE leading to death. All of the AEs leading to death in the 20 subjects were reported as unlikely related to study drug.

SAEs were reported for 69 (33%) of the 300 mg cohort. The most common SAE terms reported (≥4 subjects) were 11 subjects with febrile neutropenia (5%), 5 subjects with sepsis (2%), and 4 subjects with diarrhoea (2%). SAEs considered related to posaconazole were reported for 6 (3%) patients. There were 2 (1%) subjects with treatment related SAEs of increased blood creatinine and drug reaction (suspected DDI with cyclosporine), 2 (1%) SAEs of abnormal liver function tests, 1 (&lt;1%) subject with hepatotoxicity, and 1 (&lt;1%) subject with renal failure.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

The incidence of AEs associated with discontinuation of study drug was 18% for subjects in the 300 mg Cohort. There were 6 (3%) subjects with treatment failure that resulted in early treatment discontinuation. AEs considered related to posaconazole were reported in 11 (5%). The most common AEs (≥3 subjects) that led to discontinuation of study drug were nausea (2%), fungal infection (1%), and liver function test abnormal (1%).

## Adverse events of special interest

## Hepatic Adverse Events

Liver function test abnormality or hepatic enzyme increase were reported for 9 (4%) subjects treated as a part of the 300 mg Cohort. Seven (3%) of the subjects with liver function test abnormality or hepatic enzyme increase were classified by the investigator as having a related TEAE. Three of these 7 (1%) subjects with a related TEAE of liver function test abnormality were discontinued from study.

In addition to the 9 subjects with abnormal liver function tests or enzymes, hepatic TEAEs were reported by 10 (5%) subjects. This included 1 subject with hepatotoxicity TEAEs reported in both SOC categories. Four (4) (2%) subjects experienced severe or life-threatening hepatic TEAEs. Two met study criteria for Hy's Law. Three of the subjects described above  were considered to have hepatic TEAEs possibly related to study drug, this included I case meeting Hy's law criteria, one case of abnormal liver function test, and one case of 'cytolytic' hepatitis, classed as severe.

## Cardiovascular events including ECG abnormalities

In the 300 mg Cohort of P05615, cardiovascular TEAEs were reported by 11 (5%) subjects.  Three subjects had a cardiovascular TEAE that were judged to be related to study therapy. This included 2 subjects with QTc prolongation &gt;500, which was though the be study drug related, was associated with bradycardia and led to discontinuation in one case. Posaconazole trough concentration peaked at 811 ng/mL on Day 3.Two cardiovascular events were reported as SAEs and led to drug discontinuation and death, but both of these were considered unlikely related to study drug.

## Gastrointestinal events

In the 300 mg Cohort of P05615, the most commonly reported gastrointestinal AEs included diarrhoea (29%), nausea (27%), vomiting (13%), abdominal pain (11%), and constipation (10%). A total of 54 (26%) subjects experienced gastrointestinal AEs considered related to study drug. Of these, the most commonly reported events were nausea (11%) and diarrhoea (8%). Ten (10) (5%) subjects reported gastrointestinal AEs that led to study drug discontinuation. The most commonly reported gastrointestinal AEs that led to study drug discontinuation were nausea (2%) and diarrhoea (1%). There was one gastrointestinal AE (neutropenic colitis) that led to death. This event was not considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.

## Laboratory findings

For ALK-P, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, the majority of subjects' baseline values were Grade 0. For ALK-P and total bilirubin, the majority of subjects' values remained at Grade 0 throughout the study of the 300 mg Cohort. The largest shifts were three grade shifts, from Grade 0 to Grade 3 in 1 subject for ALK-P and 4 (2%) subjects for total bilirubin. For ALT, the majority of subjects' values either remained at Grade 0 (84 [40%] subjects) or had a minor shift of 1 grade (59 [28%] subjects from Grade 0 to Grade 1). For AST, the majority of subjects' values either remained at Grade 0 (110 [52%] subjects) or had a minor shift of 1 grade (61 [29%] subjects from Grade 0 to Grade 1). The largest shifts that occurred for ALT and AST were four grade shifts, from Grade 0 to Grade 4 in 1 subject for ALT or AST.

There were 2 subjects, Subject No. 2/000179 and 50/000072, in the 300 mg Cohort of P05615 that met the protocol pre-specified criteria for significant hepatic effect consistent with Hy's law (ALT and/or AST ≥ 3X ULN with ALK-P ≤ 2X ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2X ULN without evidence of bilirubin obstruction. In the subject with possibly posaconazole related LFT derangedment meeting Hy's law

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The posaconazole interactions seen with posaconazole oral suspension are also expected to occur with the posaconazole tablet. As has been shown with other azole antifungals, posaconazole is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations and, thus, possesses the potential for drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In vivo, posaconazole does not significantly inhibit other human CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8/9 and CYP2D6. posaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations are unlikely to be altered by inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP450 enzymes. posaconazole is metabolized via UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Phase 2 enzymes); therefore, inhibitors or inducers of this clearance system may affect posaconazole's plasma concentrations. Posaconazole is a substrate and inhibitor of the transporter P glycoprotein (PgP), so inhibitors or inducers of the PgP system may affect posaconazole 's.

## Subjects with high exposure versus low exposure

These analyses were focused on the proposed 300-mg dose in an effort to eliminate any bias of the actual dosage administered (200 mg vs. 300 mg) on the safety assessment. Furthermore, in an effort to eliminate any effect of the predicted Cavg (pCavg) calculation on the exposure variable, the analyses were performed by classifying subjects based upon the actual observed steady state Cmin (trough) values rather than predicted Cavg.

In the Cmin &gt; 3,750 ng/mL subgroup (Table 14-6 and Table 14-8), there were four adverse events that occurred in more than 1 subject; they were events of Hypertension (3 subjects), Alanine Aminotransferase Increased (AST; 2 subjects), Aspartate Aminotransferase Increased (ALT; 2 subjects), and Blood Alkaline Phosphatase Increased (3 subjects). Most of these events were not related to study therapy (often due to extenuating circumstances) and/or resolved with continued posaconazole treatment; see the comment section of Table 14-9 for additional information regarding these AEs.

## Post marketing experience

There is no post-marketing experience with Noxafil gastro resistant tablets.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The adverse event profile of posaconazole has been established for the oral suspension. Common adverse events include gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea and vomiting), abnormal liver function tests, electrolyte abnormalities and hypersensitivity reactions (rash). Hepatotoxicity is usually reversible, but rare cases of fatal hepatotoxicity have been reported. QT prolongation is known to occur and is a class effect of azoles.

The pattern of the most common treatment-related AEs observed in this study was similar to the AEs seen with the oral suspension. The proportion of deaths, SAEs and of patients who had to be discontinued from treatment due to AEs was lower than in studies with the oral suspension in cross study comparisons. However, while exposure levels were higher with the tablet, overall treatment duration and hence cumulative exposure and follow- up was lower than in the studies with the oral suspension. There were also fewer patients with baseline laboratory abnormalities enrolled in this study.

SAEs with at least a possible relationship to treatment were reported in 6 cases in the 300mg group, of which there were 2 cases of renal failure and 2 cases of abnormal liver function test.

Hepatotoxic effects or abnormal lever function tests were reported from 18 patients, in 9 cases these were considered to be drug related. In 5 of these patients treatment was discontinued, and 2 met the criteria for Hy's law. Posaconazole plasma concentrations were reported to be &lt; 2500 ng/ml for all of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the patients considered to have treatment related hepatic events, including those meeting Hy's law's criteria. Two patients with hepatic AE (of mild- moderate severity) considered unrelated had posaconazole plasma concentrations of around 3400ng/ml.

QT prolongation led to drug discontinuation in one case.

A positive association between exposure and overall treatment related AEs was not observed. The number of cases is however too small to draw firm conclusions. A slightly higher incidence of AEs was in fact observed in the first (lowest) quartile. This observation may be an indication that patients with lower exposure are those who are more unwell, leading not only to decreased absorption but also making them more likely to develop adverse events. There was no clear relationship between exposure and the most relevant adverse events, including abnormal liver function tests, although it does appear that compared to the oral suspension, hepatic adverse events were overall somewhat more common.  As a limiting factor, it must be stressed that in this population, attributing a specific adverse event to a specific treatment is very challenging indeed.

The frequency of adverse events in patients with exposures above and below 2500mg/ml and above and below 3750ng/ml was compared in the 300mg dose group. Comparisons were based Cmin rather than Cavg. There was no clear increase in overall numbers of adverse events in those with exposures &gt; 2500ng/ml. Hypomagnesaemia and abnormal liver function tests were more frequently observed with higher exposure, but there was no reported increase in grade 3 and 4 changes from baseline for the laboratory abnormalities.

There were only 6 patients with Cmin&gt; 3750ng/ml. Of these, 4 experienced treatment related AEs, three of which were severe and one of which lead to treatment discontinuation (for hypertension). There was 1 subject with moderately increased LFTs, judged to be treatment related but treatment was continued. In 2 other cases increased LFTs were considered unrelated (LFTs improved during continued treatment with posaconazole in one case, in the second case LFTs were elevated on Day 1 of treatment.)

Analysis of exposure by quartile and comparison of high (&gt;2500ng/ml) versus low (&lt; 2500ng/ml) exposure did not show an exposure related increase in overall AEs. There may be a higher number of patients with abnormal liver function tests and hypomagnesaemia, however an increase in higher grade laboratory abnormalities was not reported. The study results therefore do not show an unacceptable increase of overall or specific adverse events with higher exposures. However, the numbers of patients with high exposures (&gt; 2500ng/ml) is small (n= 25), and the observed results have to be interpreted with caution. Most of the common adverse events seen with posaconazole can be monitored in clinical practice. Clear recommendations for monitoring and management of adverse events are included in the SmPC.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The lack of a control group and shorter duration of treatment makes the interpretation of the adverse events difficult. Based on the data presented, it appears that patients with higher exposures did not experience more or more serious adverse events than those with lower exposures. The number of patients with high exposures is however low.

The majority of adverse events observed with posaconazole can be further monitored.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety database particularly where high exposures are concerned is currently small. The applicant was asked to suggest measures to collect further data to increase the safety database and generate further exposure-response data. At present, there is an on-going study PN069 aiming to recruit 600 patients (50% of which will received posaconazole in tablet and or IV form) and investigating the efficacy and safety of posaconazole in the treatment of IFI. The study is expected to generate relevant additional safety data.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## 2.8. Risk Management Plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: The RMP is acceptable.

## PRAC Advice

Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 10, the PRAC considers by consensus that the risk management system for Noxafil in the treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections (as detailed in section 4.1 of SmPC) is acceptable.

This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

With the introduction of a new formulation, the possibility of medication errors due to substitution between the different formulations, which could result in under-dosage or overdosage, has been identified as an important potential risk.

The PRAC Rapporteur agrees that the safety concerns listed by the MAH are appropriate.

## · Pharmacovigilance plans

With the exception of medication error as described above, review of the posaconazole tablet data indicated no new safety concerns arising with this new formulation. The planned pharmacovigilance actions will remain the same as currently in place for the posaconazole oral suspension.

There are no additional pharmacovigilance activities proposed for posaconazole.

The PRAC Rapporteur, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The PRAC Rapporteur also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures

## · Risk minimisation measures

The PRAC Rapporteur considered that important safety concerns for posaconazole, including the newly-identified risk of medication error, can be efficiently minimised through routine risk minimisation measures.

The summary table provided in the RMP includes not only risk minimisation measures but also refers to pharmacovigilance. This should be corrected in the next version of the RMP.

The PRAC Rapporteur, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures remains sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

In addition, it was noted that the on-going study PN069 is referred to in the RMP.  Having agreed that additional exposure-related safety data will be collected part of the on-going study PN069, the CHMP noted that the RMP will be updated accordingly at the next opportunity and part of the on-going line extension to IV procedure.

## 2.9. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The proposed gastro-resistant tablet formulation has improved absorption when compared to the currently approved oral suspension in a population of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Compared to the oral suspension, the effect of food on absorption is significantly reduced, which is a distinct advantage in the target population, a proportion of which will not be able to comply with food intake requirements of the oral suspension.

When given as a single daily dose of 300 mg without regard for food, mean posaconazole exposure from the tablet is expected to exceed a Cavg of 500 ng/ml, which is considered to be associated with higher rates of clinical success in the treatment and prophylaxis of IFI.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

No controlled, adequately powered clinical efficacy trial was conducted with the new formulation. The development programme was based on an observed exposure-response relationship in clinical trials with the oral suspension and relies on limited data due to low case numbers. The chosen efficacyrelated exposure target of more than 500 ng/ml is not a clear cut-off separating failure from success.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Posaconazole  has  an  established  adverse  effect  profile  which  includes  gastrointestinal  side  effects (diarrhoea and vomiting), abnormal liver function tests, electrolyte abnormalities and QT prolongation. These effects are seen with both the oral suspension and the tablet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study data and model derived simulated data indicate that a relevant proportion of patients will exceed plasma concentrations of 2500 ng/ml and also the upper target limit of 3750 ng/ml. There are limited safety data for these exposure levels, as they were seen to a lesser extent - or not at all - in the studies with the oral suspension.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The  review  of  the  safety  data  did  not  show  any  unexpected  adverse  events  compared  to  previous studies with the oral posaconazole suspension. However, the value of new safety data generated with the  tablet  formulation  in  supporting  this  application  is  limited  by  the  lack  of  a  control  group.  The company provided data to demonstrate that patients with higher exposures do not experience more or more severe adverse events than those with lower exposures, however less than 50 patients were observed with exposures &gt; 2500 ng/ml and only 6 with &gt; 3750 ng/ml. Confounding causality factors for adverse events in the target population contributes to difficulties in data interpretation.

PK  and  safety  data  stem  from  patients  with  AML  and  MDS  or  those  after  HSCT  who  received posaconazole for prophylaxis. No data were generated for patients with other underlying diseases and active fungal infections.

It has been established that the gastro-resistant tablet does have a food effect (50% increase in AUC with a high fat meal). This was not taken into consideration in the pivotal trial, where posaconazole was administered without regard for food. This may affect the generalizability of the trial data.

## Balance

## Benefit-risk balance

Based on the evidence provided, the benefit risk balance for the proposed dose of 300 mg is considered positive for Noxafil gastro-resistant tablets.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment

The proposed daily dose of 300 mg is appropriate in a large proportion of patients, but due to the high PK variability some patients may experience unnecessarily high exposures. Extensive explorations and simulations for dose adjustments have been provided. It was hypothesised that a lower dose of 200mg could reduce the proportion of HSCT patients &lt;60 kg exceeding the target range of Cavg. Nevertheless, in view of the relatively small difference, the lack of confirmed safety problems from the available database so far, and the practical difficulties separating subpopulations explained earlier it seems preferable to recommend the 300 mg dose to the whole target population.

The omission of recording the food effect in the pivotal study remains a flaw in the development programme of the tablet formulation, and the CHMP recommended that further information on food intake as well as plasma concentrations over time and when possible plasma concentrations at the time of adverse events should be obtained in the on-going PN069 trial.

Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion that the improved absorption and higher exposure provided by the proposed gastro- resistant tablet, with the implied beneficial effect for efficacy, outweighed the risk of higher exposure in a proportion of patients. This conclusion takes into account that further

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy and in particular safety data are generated in the on-going clinical trial in the treatment of IFI with posaconazole.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Noxafil 100 mg gastro-resistant tablet in the treatment of the following fungal infections in adults (see section 5.1):

- Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;
- Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are intolerant of amphotericin B;
- Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole;
- Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products;

Refractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days of prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy.

Noxafil is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following patients:

- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are at high risk of developing invasive fungal infections;
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing invasive fungal infections.

is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:
