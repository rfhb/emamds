## 3 . PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension for injection (injection)

The vaccine appears as a whitish cloudy uniform suspension .

## 4 . CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4 . 1 Therapeutic indications

VacPertagen is indicated for:

- booster immunisation against pertussis of individuals 12 years of age and older,
- passive protection against pertussis in early infancy following maternal immunisation during pregnancy (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.1).

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Individuals 12 years of age and older

A single dose of 0.5 mL should be administered.

Pregnant women

A single dose of 0.5 mL should be administered during the second or third trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of VacPertagen in children less than 12 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

VacPertagen should be administered only by intramuscular injection, preferably in the deltoid region.

This vaccine must not be administered intravascularly, intradermally or subcutaneously.

The content of VacPertagen pre-filled syringe should be well shaken before use. If resuspension does not occur after vigorous shaking or foreign particles or discoloration are observed, the vaccine should not be used.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or formaldehyde . Hypersensitivity after previous administration of VacPertagen or any other pertussis vaccine.

Vaccination with this vaccine is contraindicated if an individual has experienced in the past a severe allergic reaction or any encephalopathy with unknown aetiology within 7 days following previous vaccination with a pertussis containing vaccine.

Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with neurological disorders or uncontrolled epilepsy until treatment for the condition has been established, the condition has stabilised, and the benefit of vaccination clearly outweighs the risk.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Prior to immunisation

Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history, in particular adverse reactions after past vaccinations.

## Pertussis containing-vaccine

If any of the following events have occurred after administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine, the decision to administer further doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine should be carefully considered:

- Temperature of ≥ 40 °C within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable cause
- Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode [HHE]) within 48 hours of vaccination
- Persistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination
- Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.

There may be some circumstances, such as high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical care should be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxietyrelated reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia). Bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

There are no clinical data with VacPertagen in immunocompromised individuals. The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or immunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or disease. Nevertheless, vaccination of individuals with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection is recommended even if the antibody response may be reduced.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccines, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees.

## Infant immune response following maternal vaccination

Limited data indicate that maternal antibodies interfere with induction of PT-specific immune response to primary immunisation with DTwP/DTaP in infants born to women vaccinated with VacPertagen during pregnancy (see sections 4.6 and 5.1).

## Excipient with known effect

VacPertagen contains less than 1 mmol sodium (1.7 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of VacPertagen with other vaccines has not been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

VacPertagen can be administered in the second or third trimester of pregnancy in accordance with official recommendations (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety data from three randomised controlled clinical trials (250 pregnancy outcomes), one prospective observational trial (497 pregnancy outcomes), two retrospective observational trials (2 565 pregnancy outcomes) and from passive surveillance where VacPertagen or Td-VacPertagen (Tetanus, diphtheria and VacPertagen) were administered to pregnant women during the second or third trimester, have shown no vaccine related adverse effects on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child.

There are no data from the use of VacPertagen in pregnant women during the first trimester. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of VacPertagen during first trimester of pregnancy.

See section 4.4 for possible consequences of vaccination during pregnancy on primary infant vaccination.

Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

No study on lactation has been performed and it is not known whether VacPertagen is excreted in human milk. As this vaccine contains inactivated antigens, no risk to the breastfed infant should be expected. The risks and benefits of vaccination should be assessed before deciding to vaccinate a breastfeeding woman.

## Fertility

No human data on fertility is available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect adverse effects on female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

VacPertagen has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines . However, individuals should avoid driving or operating machinery if they experience symptoms that may impair their ability to concentrate or react, such as fatigue or myalgia (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination with VacPertagen were injection site pain (77.6%), headache (59.7%), fatigue (52.2%), myalgia (45.3%), arthralgia (24%), malaise (22.7%) and nausea (22.4%). The majority of the reactions were mild in severity and resolved within a few days of onset.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety of a single dose of VacPertagen was evaluated in 2 508 individuals 12 years of age and older including 150 adolescents, 2 318 non-pregnant adults and 40 pregnant women based on data from randomised controlled clinical trials (Table 1).

Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common (≥ 1/10) Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100) Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000) Very rare (&lt; 1/10 000)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V .

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdose with VacPertagen is unlikely due to its single dose presentation.

There is no specific treatment for an overdose with VacPertagen. In the event of an overdose, the individual should be monitored and provided with symptomatic treatment as appropriate.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group : Vaccines, bacterial vaccines, Pertussis vaccines, ATC code: J07AJ02

## Mechanism of action

VacPertagen contains two purified pertussis antigens: recombinant pertussis toxin (PTgen), and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA). Following intramuscular administration, VacPertagen induces a boost in PT-specific and FHA-specific antibody responses. Maternal antibodies are transferred to infants born to women vaccinated during the second or third trimester of pregnancy.

## Immunogenicity

Efficacy data are not available for VacPertagen. No correlate of protection has been established for pertussis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy of VacPertagen was inferred by comparing levels of antibodies specific to the 2 pertussis antigens contained in VacPertagen with levels induced by vaccines containing 3 or 5 pertussis antigens.

Immunogenicity was assessed based on the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of PT-IgG and FHA-IgG, measured by Enzyme Linked Immunoassay (ELISA), and PT neutralising antibody (PTNA) measured by a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell assay.

Immune response in adolescents and adults

Immunogenicity of VacPertagen was evaluated in 2 randomised controlled trials in 148 adolescents (TDA202) and 75 adults 18 years and older (TDA206).

Trial TDA202 is a phase III dual-site, randomised, observer-blind, controlled trial in healthy, nonpregnant adolescents aged 12-17 years old (mean age 14 years old). A total 450 individuals were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive VacPertagen, Td- VacPertagen or the Tdap comparator. The majority of individuals were female (58%) and Asian (100%).

Trial TDA206 is a phase III single-site, observer-blind, randomised, active-controlled clinical trial in healthy, non-pregnant adults aged 18-75 years old (mean age 44 years old). A total of 750 individuals were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive different formulations of acellular pertussis vaccines (including VacPertagen) or a Tdap comparator. Randomisation was stratified by age group. Each group included 120 participants aged 18-64 and 30 participants aged 65-75 years old.

Immune response after vaccination with VacPertagen in adolescents and adults is shown in Table 2.

Immunogenicity in infants (&lt; 2 months of age) born to women vaccinated with VacPertagen during pregnancy

In the TDA207 trial, the pertussis antibodies were transferred from mothers to infants with similar transplacental ratio in infants born to women vaccinated with VacPertagen or Tdap comparator. The pertussis antibody concentrations in infants at birth and at 2 months of age (prior to infant primary immunisation) are shown in Table 5.

Immunogenicity in infants born to women vaccinated with VacPertagen during pregnancy

In the TDA207 trial, the infants were vaccinated with three doses of pertussis vaccines (DTwP or DTaP). Most infants born to mothers vaccinated with VacPertagen (n=29/35) or with the comparator vaccine (n=23/32) received whole-cell pertussis containing vaccine (DTwP), at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. The pertussis antibody concentration in infants at 7 months of age was lower for PT-IgG in the VacPertagen group (Table 6). As no correlate of protection for pertussis has been established, the clinical relevance of these observations remains to be fully understood.

## 1. What VacPertagen is and what it is used for

VacPertagen is a vaccine used to prevent pertussis. It is used as a booster vaccination in adolescents (12 years and older) and adults who were previously vaccinated against the disease (active vaccination). It is also used as a passive vaccination to protect infants in the first few months of life by vaccinating mothers during pregnancy.

Pertussis (often called whooping cough) is a highly infectious disease that can occur at any age. The disease affects the airways causing severe episodes of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing and can last for several weeks. Pertussis can also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis), lung infections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death.

VacPertagen activates the immune system (the body's natural defences) to make antibodies, against the infecting bacterium that protect against pertussis disease. Most people will have received pertussis vaccines earlier in their life, but these may not provide life-long protection.

An active vaccination helps your body to produce new antibodies. Passive vaccination in the second or third trimester of pregnancy allows the body to make antibodies that are passed to the infant through the placenta before birth. This helps provide immediate protection to the infant in the first few months of life before the baby is given their own pertussis vaccine.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive VacPertagen

## Do not use VacPertagen

- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) or to formaldehyde.
- if you have had an allergic reaction after receiving a pertussis vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- if you have suffered from a severe allergic reaction or a reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days after receiving a pertussis containing vaccine.
- if you have an unstable or progressive medical condition affecting the brain and nervous system, such as uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given VacPertagen if you:

- have experienced any of the following problems after getting a pertussis-containing vaccine in the past:
- -a high body temperature (40 °C or higher) within 48 hours after vaccination
- -a collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours after vaccination
- -persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination during childhood
- -had a fit (convulsion) with or without fever within 3 days of vaccination.
- are feeling nervous about getting the vaccine or have ever fainted after any injection. This can help your doctor or nurse take precautions in case you may faint.
- have an infection with a high fever. If this is the case, vaccination will be postponed. There is no need to delay vaccination for a minor infection such as a cold but talk to your doctor first.
- have a bleeding problem or bruise easily, or if you are receiving anti-blood clotting medicines.
- have a weakened immune system, due to another medical condition or certain treatments. This may prevent you getting the full benefit from VacPertagen.
- are pregnant and in the first trimester of pregnancy

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given VacPertagen.

As with any vaccine, VacPertagen may not fully protect all those who receive it.

## Children

VacPertagen is not recommended in children under 12 years of age.

## Other medicines and VacPertagen

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, or have recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. Talk to your doctor or nurse for advice before getting this vaccine if you are breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) such as muscle pain (myalgia) or feeling tired (fatigue), may temporarily reduce your ability to drive and use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## VacPertagen contains sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (1.7 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How VacPertagen is given

You will be given one injection of 0.5 mL into the muscle of your upper arm (deltoid muscle). If you have any questions on the use of VacPertagen, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.

## Serious side effects

- Severe allergic reactions may occur very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). Signs of an allergic reaction include difficulty breathing, blueness of the tongue or lips, rash, swelling of the face or throat, and low blood pressure causing dizziness or collapse.

Such symptoms usually develop quickly after the injection is given. Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of these symptoms after vaccination.

## Other side effects

Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)

- headache
- feeling sick (nausea)
- muscle pain (myalgia)
- joint pain (arthralgia)
- pain where the injection is given
- feeling tired (fatigue)
- generally feeling unwell/discomfort (malaise)

## Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- swollen or painful lymph nodes (lymphadenitis and lymphadenopathy)
- vomiting
- digestive problems such as diarrhoea and gut inflammation (enteritis)
- rash
- urticaria
- itching (pruritus) where the injection is given
- hard mass/lump (induration) where the injection is given
- bruising where the injection is given (injection site haematoma)
- chills
- fever

Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- redness (erythema) and swelling where the injection is given

Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people)

- a forceful heartbeat that may be rapid or irregular (palpitations)

## Reporting of side effects

If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.
