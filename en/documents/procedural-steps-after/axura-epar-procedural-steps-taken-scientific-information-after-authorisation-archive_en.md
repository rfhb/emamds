| II/0047 | To update section 4.8 of the Summary Product Information (SPC) to include Dyspnoea and a subsequent update of section 4 of the Package Leaflet (PL). In addition, the MAH included a linguistic correction in the Italian SPC section 4.8 and the name of the local representative in Spain was updated. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 29/05/2009 | 24/06/2009 | SmPC and PL            | Following the assessment of PSUR No. 10 of memantine (Axura) on 19 February 2009 the CHMP requested the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to submit within 2 months a Type II variation to include dyspnoea as an adverse drug reaction in section 4.8 of the SPC. The basis for the CHMP request was the result of a review of clinical trials that was performed to elucidate the incidence rates of dyspnoea. The events were analysed by dose, seriousness and indication. Overall, the incidence rates of dyspnoea were higher in patients treated with memantine compared to those receiving placebo. No notable differences between treatments were found when considered all studies with Alzheimer's dementia indication. |

All three strengths (5 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg) of the newly formulated tablets were tested to determine their in vitro dissolution profile, which were considered similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The CHMP agreed that the Pharmacokinetic data obtained in healthy volunteers showed minimal differences in the plasma concentration-time profile between twice-daily and once-daily dosing regimen. Five clinical studies in patients with AD supported the efficacy and safety assessment of the once-daily dosing regimen with memantine. In relation to efficacy results, no relevant differences were observed when AD patients were treated with memantine 20 mg once-daily with respect to patients treated with 10 mg twice-daily. In relation to the safety and tolerability both regimens showed similar safety profile. |

In patients with moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) no dosage adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are available. The product information was updated to reflect these results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| II/0021 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet to give dose recommendations for patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/06/2007 | 30/07/2007 | SmPC and PL | The MAH performed a pharmacokinetic study to investigate the influence of the renal impairment on the pharmacokinetic profile of memantine. The study showed that: The exposure of patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min) is comparable to the exposure in healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is required in these patients. The extent of exposure in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 49 ml/min) is about 60% higher than the extent of exposure of healthy subjects. In these patients the daily dose should be reduced to 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. The exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 - 29 ml/min) is about 100% higher than in healthy subjects. In these patients the daily dose should be 10 mg per day. |

| II/0013 | This application concerns an update of the product information following the evaluation of the 6th PSUR. Section 4.5 of the SPC has been updated in relation to interactions with warfarin and section 4.8 of the SPC regarding pancreatitis, depression, suicidal ideation, suicide and psychotic reactions. Relevant sections of the PL was amended accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 23/03/2006 | 27/04/2006 | SmPC and PL | Following the assessment of the 6th PSUR, the SPC and PL have been updated in relation to interactions with warfarin. Close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR in patients treated concomitantly with oral anticoagulants was advised which is also reflected in the SPC. Following PSUR 6, the MAH performed also a re-analysis of each individual case report with pancreatitis reported either through the spontaneous reporting system or in clinical trials. It was concluded that isolated cases of pancreatitis had been observed in post-marketing experience. Alzheimer's disease, has been associated with psychotic reactions, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. Although confounding factors cannot be excluded, these events have been reported in patients treated with Memantine. |
