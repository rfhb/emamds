## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cladribine (multiple sclerosis), the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on excretion of cladribine in human breastmilk from the literature, the PRAC considers  that  excretion  of  cladribine  in  human  milk  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing cladribine (multiple sclerosis) should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cladribine (multiple sclerosis) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cladribine (multiple sclerosis) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
