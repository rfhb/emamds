## 1.  Introduction

On 10 January 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar 13, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2.  Scientific discussion

## 2.1.  Information on the development program

The MAH stated that 'A Cohort Study to Evaluate Immunogenicity for Children Aged 5 Months to ≤60 Months at the Time of Clinical Pneumonia Diagnosis': B1851196: is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Not applicable as no study intervention was given. Participants were vaccinated as part of their paediatric health care, not as part of this study.

## 2.3.  Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1.  Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

-  B1851196: A Cohort Study to Evaluate Immunogenicity for Children Aged 5 Months to ≤60 Months at the Time of Clinical Pneumonia Diagnosis.

## 2.3.2.  Clinical study

B1851196: A Cohort Study to Evaluate Immunogenicity for Children Aged 5 Months to ≤60 Months at the Time of Clinical Pneumonia Diagnosis.

## Description

This cohort study was designed to describe serotype specific antibody levels among children, 5 months to ≤60 months of age, with the diagnosis of clinical pneumonia (per local standards). Participants were characterized by 13vPnC vaccination status cohort (in children who completed at least 2 doses of 13vPnC versus children that did not receive any 13vPnC dose) and by pneumococcal VT carriage status. This was an epidemiology study (no study intervention was given).

## Methods

## Study Design and Study Participants

This cohort study was designed to describe vaccine serotype (VT) specific antibody levels and deep upper respiratory aspirate pneumococcal VT carriage statuses among children who were 5 months to ≤ 60 months of age and hospitalized with clinical pneumonia at SCH.

Participants were assigned to a cohort based on their 13vPnC vaccination status ('13vPnC cohort' or 'Non-13vPnC cohort'). The 13vPnC cohort included those children who had received at least 2 doses of 13vPnC, and the Non-13vPnC cohort included those children that did not receive any 13vPnC dose as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

part of their paediatric care. Participants were also characterized by deep upper respiratory aspirate pneumococcal VT carriage status ('VT carriage+' or 'VT carriage- or Streptococcus pneumoniae-, Sp-').  The four 13vPnC vaccination cohort / pneumococcal VT carriage status subgroups are presented in Table 1.

| Immunogenicity | To describe the antibody levels, as measured by IgG and MOPA, by 13vPnC vaccination cohort and by VT carriage status, among children 5 months to <60 months of age with a diagnosis of clinical pneumonia per local standards. | The serotype specific IgG GMC and MOPA GMT for each of the pneumococcal vaccine serotypes measured at the time of diagnosis of clinical pneumonia. | The serotype specific IgG GMC and MOPA GMT for each of the pneumococcal vaccine serotypes measured at the time of diagnosis of clinical pneumonia |

## Sample size

The study enrolled 300 participants, 276 (92.0%) of whom were evaluable for immunogenicity analyses (IgG for all; MOPA in a subset): 92 in the 13vPnC cohort and 184 in the non-13vPnC cohort.

Of the 276 in the evaluable population, 259 participants completed the study. 17 (5.7%) evaluable participants discontinued the study due to protocol deviations during the follow-up phase, but they were still considered evaluable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Randomization and blinding were not applicable to the present study as participants were assigned to a cohort according to their 13vPnC vaccination status.

## Statistical Methods

The multiple regression model used the log concentration or log titers as the dependent variable. Independent variables included vaccination cohort (13vPnC or non-13vPnC), carriage status ('VT Carriage+' or 'VT Carriage- or Sp-'), and the interaction of the vaccination cohort and carriage status, as well as the confounding variables (age at enrollment, sex, and season of enrollment).

## Results

## Participant flow

Participants were in the study for 1 day. After the blood draw (obtained from all participants) and the deep upper respiratory aspirate (if collected as a study procedure), participants were followed for 12 hours. Two non-13vPnC participants were planned to be included in the unvaccinated cohort for every participant enrolled in the 13vPnC cohort. Non-13vPnC cohort participants' enrollment dates were within 6 months of those of the 13vPnC cohort participants. The standard guidance for the diagnosis of pneumonia at SCH was followed for entry into the study. Pneumonia diagnosis was made by the clinical judgment of treating doctors based on the 'Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Pediatric Internal Medicine', issued by the Chinese Medical Association.

## Recruitment

Participants of the study were 5-60 months of age at the time of consent with a diagnosis of clinical pneumonia per SCH standard of care. Participants (or their legally authorized representatives) were informed that their participation was voluntary. Participants (or their legally authorized representatives) signed a statement of informed consent that met the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, HIPAA requirements (where applicable), and the IEC or study center.

## Baseline data/ Number analysed

A total of 300 participants were enrolled in this study, of whom 276 (92.0%) were included in the evaluable population: 92 in the 13vPnC cohort and 184 in the non-13vPnC cohort. The evaluable population consisted of 135 female and 141 male participants aged 5 to 59 months, with a mean (SD) age of 24.5 (14.24) months. In the 13vPnC cohort, the mean (SD) age of participants was 20.6 (10.86) months, and the majority were enrolled in summer and fall (68 [73.9%] participants). In the non-13vPnC cohort, the mean (SD) age of participants was older, 26.4 (15.32) months, and the majority were enrolled in fall and winter (164 [89.1%] participants; Table 3). Of the 276 in the evaluable population, 259 participants completed the study. Although 17 (5.7%) evaluable participants discontinued the study due to PDs during the follow-up phase, they were still evaluable. The culture results of deep upper respiratory aspirates (labeled in the Tables as 'VT Carriage +' or 'VT Carriage or Sp -') were available for 259 participants, and 52 of the aspirates grew S. pneumoniae . A serotype could be identified for 39 of the S. pneumoniae samples.

## Multiplex Opsonophagocytic Activity (MOPA) Results

For MOPA assessment, 69 participants with adequate blood volumes from the non-13vPnC cohort were used, which was approximately equal to the number of 13vPnC participants (Table 13). Crude results by 13vPnC vaccination cohort:

-  In the 13vPnC cohort, the GMTs ranged from 70.9 (serotype 1) to 3791.4 (serotype 7F). In the non-13vPnC cohort, the GMTs ranged from 14.8 (serotype 1) to 223.2 (serotype 7F). The GMR values, 13vPnC cohort / non-13vPnC cohort, ranged from 4.78 (serotype 1) to 44.46 (serotype 23F).

Model based adjusted results by 13vPnC vaccination cohort (Table 14):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  In the 13vPnC cohort, the adjusted GMTs ranged from 50.4 (serotype 1) to 4247.1 (serotype 7F). In the non-13vPnC cohort, the adjusted GMTs ranged from 13.1 (serotype 1) to 261.1 (serotype 14). The adjusted GMR values, 13vPnC cohort / non- 13vPnC cohort, ranged from 3.86 (serotype 1) to 38.46 (serotype 19F).

Crude results of GMT comparison between VT carriage status by 13vPnC vaccination cohort:

-  In the 13vPnC cohort, the pneumococcal MOPA GMTs for VT carriage+ participants ranged from 35.0 (serotype 1) to 4661.3 (serotype 7F). The GMTs for the VT carriage- or Spparticipants ranged from 71.1 (serotype 1) to 4111.0 (serotype 23F). The GMR values, VT carriage+/ VT carriage- or Sp-, ranged from 0.06 (serotype 6B) to 3.87 (serotype 19F).
-  In the non-13vPnC cohort, the pneumococcal MOPA GMTs for VT carriage+ participants ranged from 11.1 (serotypes 1 and 5) to 442.5 (serotype 7F). The GMTs for the VT carriage- or Sp- participants ranged from 14.6 (serotype 1) to 180.8 (serotype 7F). The GMR values, VT carriage+/ VT carriage- or Sp-, ranged from 0.44 (serotype 4) to 2.45 (serotype 7F).

Model based adjusted results of GMT comparison between VT carriage status by 13vPnC vaccination cohort (Table 16):

-  In the 13vPnC cohort, the pneumococcal MOPA adjusted GMTs for VT carriage+ participants ranged from 37.1 (serotype 1) to 4502.1 (serotype 7F). The adjusted GMTs for the VT carriage- or Sp- participants ranged from 68.3 (serotype 1) to 4160.0 (serotype 23F). The adjusted GMRs, VT carriage+/ VT carriage- or Sp-, ranged from 0.07 (serotype 6B) to 4.37 (serotype 19F).
-  In the non-13vPnC cohort, the pneumococcal MOPA adjusted GMTs for VT carriage+ participants ranged from 10.1 (serotype 1) to 449.1 (serotype 14). The adjusted GMTs for the VT carriage- or Sp- participants ranged from 16.9 (serotype 1) to 153.2 (serotype 7F). The

## Adverse Events

In the 13vPnC cohort, 5 participants reported AEs (Table 16.2.7.1). All the AEs were of mild severity. The most frequently reported AE was diarrhoea (2 participants); all other AEs (including enteritis, blood creatine phosphokinase MB increased, vomiting and gastroenteritis) were reported in single participants. In the non-13vPnC cohort, 12 participants had reported AEs. All the AEs were of mild severity. The most frequently reported AE was diarrhoea (3 participants). Other AEs included vomiting, pyrexia, gastroenteritis, enteritis, hepatic function abnormal, hypoglycaemia, oxygen saturation decreased, hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia, and gastritis. The MAH considered that none of the AEs to be related to 13vPnC. None of the AEs caused study discontinuation.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

B1851196 was a cohort study to evaluate immunogenicity of 13PnC in children 5-60 months with the diagnosis (per local standards) of clinical pneumonia. No study intervention was given. Participants were vaccinated as part of their paediatric care, not as part of this study.

Participants were characterized by 13vPnC vaccination cohort (in children who completed at least 2 doses of 13vPnC versus children that did not receive any 13vPnC dose) and by pneumococcal carriage status (VT carriage positive versus VT carriage negative or S pneumoniae carriage negative). In general, IgG levels and MOPA titer values measured during an episode of pneumonia were greater among those who had been vaccinated with 13vPnC prior to study participation as part of their paediatric care (13vPnC cohort), as compared to those who were not (non-13vPnC cohort), which suggests that two or more doses of a 13vPnC infant series vaccination established long-term antibody responses.

The administration of 13PnC was well tolerated and the AEs reported in this group were consistent with medical events or conditions that are common in this age group. The findings in this study is consistent with the known profile of 13vPnC as reflected in the EU SmPC and support the continued use of 13vPnC. No changes are being proposed to the Prevenar 13 label in this submission.
