IA=interim analysis; IV=intravenous

- Preterm or full-term at birth
- Full-term neonate is defined as an infant born ≥3 7th week of gestation.
- Preterm neonate is defined as a neonate born after completion of 26weeks of gestation and before the beginning of the 37th week of gestation.
- Multiple IV infusions administered twice daily for 3 days
- The first 5 participants (in Group 1) received tedizolid phosphate at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg. Based on the first IA for these 5 participants, the dose for the study was kept at 3.0 mg/kg for participants weighing &lt;10 kg, but adjusted to 2.5 mg/kg for those weighing 10 to &lt;30 kg. Of the 47 allocated participants, 45 received the 3.0 mg/kg dose and 2 (1 in Group 1 Cohort 2 and 1 in Group 4) received the 2.5 mg/kg dose.

## Objective(s)

## Primary objective

## Part A

1.  To  describe  the  single-dose  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  IV  tedizolid  phosphate  and  its  active metabolite, tedizolid, when administered to paediatric subjects, aged 28 days to &lt;24 months (Group 1 [Cohorts  1  and  2  combined]),  full-term  neonates  aged  birth  to  &lt;28  days  (Group  2),  and  preterm neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 3).

2. To describe the multiple-dose PK of IV tedizolid phosphate and its active metabolite, tedizolid, when administered to full-term neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 2), and preterm neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 3).

## Part B

3.  To  describe  the  single-dose  PK  of  tedizolid  following  oral  suspension  of  tedizolid  phosphate administration to paediatric subjects aged 28 days to &lt;24 months (Group 4), full-term neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 5), and preterm neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 6).

## Secondary Objectives

## Part A

1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV tedizolid phosphate administration in paediatric subjects aged 28 days to &lt;24 months (Group 1 [Cohorts 1 and 2 combined]), full-term neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 2), and preterm neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 3).

## Part B

2.  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  oral  suspension  tedizolid  phosphate  administration  in paediatric subjects aged 28 days to &lt;24 months (Group 4), full-term neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 5), and preterm neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 6).

## Tertiary/Exploratory Objectives

To describe the bioavailability of tedizolid following oral suspension tedizolid phosphate administration to paediatric subjects aged 28 days to &lt;24 months (Group 4), full-term neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 5), and preterm neonates aged birth to &lt;28 days (Group 6).

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

- For each IV group: AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, apparent terminal t1/2, CL, Vd
- For each oral group: AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, apparent terminal t1/2, CL/F, Vd/F

## Secondary Endpoints

- Adverse events

## Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoints

- % Bioavailability of tedizolid

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The planned enrolment was 42 participants. A total of 47 participants (includes 5 replacements) were enrolled and allocated to 1 of the 9 groups/cohorts. Of the 47 participants allocated, 40 were included in the Per Protocol (PP) population, which defined the population evaluable for PK analysis of tedizolid, and all 47 were included in the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population for safety analysis.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

P014 was a nonrandomized, open-label study.

## Statistical Methods

## Safety

Summary statistics  and  plots  will  be  generated  for  the  change  from  baseline  values  at  the  interim analysis and the end of study, as deemed clinically appropriate.

## Pharmacokinetics

## IV Administration (Group 1 Cohorts 1 and 2, Group 2, and Group 3)

A  non-model  based  geometric  mean  of  the  AUC  and  Cmax  of  tedizolid  phosphate  and  its  active metabolite, tedizolid, after administration (5th dose or first dose on Day 3 for multiple-dose groups) will be calculated for each PK sampling scheme by age and dose (if dose adjusted at interim analysis) group.

## Oral Administration (Groups 4, 5 and 6)

The AUC of tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid, administered as oral suspension will be calculated using naïve-pooled  approach.  Only  one  value  for  AUC  will  be  estimated  for  each  age  group.  The bioavailability will be estimated by dividing the naïve-pooled AUC from oral administrated subjects by the estimated AUC from IV administrated subjects, for each age group.

## Results

## Participant flow

A  total  of  49  individuals  were  screened,  2  were  screen  failures,  and  47  participants  (including  5 replacements)  were  allocated  to  1  of  9  groups/cohorts  and  received  study  intervention.  All  47 participants completed study treatment and completed the study. No participants discontinued study intervention or discontinued from the study for any reason.

## Recruitment

Clinical  investigator  study  sites  were  located  at  30  centers  in  the  following  5  countries:  Bulgaria, Colombia, Norway, United Kingdom and United States.

## Baseline data

A total of 47 participants were allocated to, and received, study treatment. Participants were allocated to each group as follows:

- Preterm or full-term at birth
- b Full-term neonate is defined as an infant born ≥37th week of gestation.
- Preterm neonate is defined as a neonate born after completion of 26 weeks of gestation and before the beginning of the 37th week of gestation.
- 5 neonates receiving a single IV infusion (5/47 allocated participants) were replaced due to having ≥2 of their 3 PK samples BLOQ for tedizolid (2 full-term neonates in Group 2 Cohort 1 and 3 preterm neonates in Group 3 Cohort 1).
- 7/47 allocated participants (14.9%) were excluded from the PP population due to having ≥2 of their 3 PK samples BLOQ for tedizolid (2 full-term neonates in Group 2 Cohort 1, 4 preterm neonates in Group 3 Cohort 1, and 1 preterm neonate in Group 3 Cohort 2). Of the 7 participants excluded from the PP population, 5 were replaced (see footnote d above); and 2 were not replaced as they were enrolled after the final PK analysis and enrollment closure (1 preterm neonate in Group 3 Cohort 1 and 1 preterm neonate in Group 3 Cohort 2).

## Mean Age (Standard Deviation):

Overall mean age (SD) across all groups was 88.8 days (165.7 days, range: 1 to 608 days).

## Sex:

29 (61.7%) male, 18 (38.3%) female

## Ethnicity:

26 (55.3%) not Hispanic or Latino, 20 (42.6%) Hispanic or Latino, 1 (2.1%) not reported

## Race:

26 (55.3%) White; 19 (40.4%) Multiple; 1 (2.1%) American Indian or Alaska Native; 1 (2.1%) Black or African American

## Pharmacokinetic results:

- Based on the first IA (Group 1 Cohorts 1 and 2 [n=5], 1 weighing &lt;10 kg and 4 weighing 10 to &lt;30 kg), the tedizolid phosphate doses expected to achieve comparable tedizolid exposures across the weight stratification were 3.0 mg/kg (body weight &lt;10 kg) and 2.5 mg/kg (body weight 10 to &lt;30 kg), twice  daily  for  3  days  when  administered  as  multiple  IV  infusions.  All  subsequent  IAs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

confirmed  this  dosing  paradigm  for  the  remaining  42  participants,  resulting  in  a  total  of  45 participants receiving 3 mg/kg and 2 participants receiving 2.5 mg/kg tedizolid phosphate.

- Tedizolid phosphate was rapidly converted to tedizolid after IV and oral administration. NCA-based PK parameters for tedizolid phosphate (prodrug) were not estimated due to the limited number of participants having quantifiable tedizolid phosphate concentrations at ≥ 2 time points.
- The tedizolid plasma PK results in Table 2-4 of the submitted CSR were observed after IV or oral administration of tedizolid phosphate.
- Accounting for variability and imbalances in sample size across each of the age groups, tedizolid exposure (AUC, Cmax) was generally comparable after administration of a single IV infusion or a single oral dose of tedizolid phosphate.
- The range of apparent t1/2 was 4.17 to 7.08 hours after a single IV infusion and 3.82 to 13.4 hours after a single oral dose, supporting twice-daily dosing of tedizolid phosphate.
- Although data were more limited, steady-state tedizolid exposure (Cmax,ss, AUC0-12,ss) after multiple IV  infusions  of  tedizolid  phosphate  appeared  to  be  largely  similar  across  full-term  and  preterm neonates.  Tedizolid  exposure  after  single-  vs  multiple-dose  administration  was  also  comparable, indicating minimal accumulation.
- In general, tedizolid exposure was largely similar after IV or oral administration, with an estimated bioavailability of 95.2%.

## Number analysed

Of the 47 participants allocated, 40 were included in the PP population, which defined the population evaluable  for  PK  analysis  of  tedizolid,  and  all  47  were  included  in  the  APaT  population  for  safety analysis.

## Efficacy results

There were no efficacy endpoints for this study.

## Safety results

## Overall Extent of Exposure

A total of 47 participants received at least 1 dose of tedizolid phosphate.

In Part A, 35 participants received IV tedizolid phosphate:

- 27 participants received a single IV infusion of tedizolid phosphate 3.0 mg/kg (n=26) or 2.5 mg/kg (n=1).  This  participant  is  captured  in  as  receiving  2.5  mg/kg  based  on  their  screening  weight;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

however,  based  on  their  weight  collected  just  before  the  start  of  infusion,  the  dose  was  ~3.0 mg/kg (the exact dose was 2.83 mg/kg).

- 8 participants received multiple IV infusions of tedizolid phosphate 3.0 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days (n=8).

In  Part  B,  12  participants  received  oral  tedizolid  phosphate  in  a  single  oral  suspension  dose  of 3.0 mg/kg (n=11) or 2.5 mg/kg (n=1).

## Summary of Adverse Events

Overall, across all groups/cohorts, AEs were reported for 8/47 (17.0%) participants. One drug-related AE (Group 6, immature granulocyte count increased) was reported after a single oral dose of tedizolid phosphate. One SAE (Group 1 Cohort 1, therapeutic product effect incomplete) and 1 ECI (Group 3 Cohort 2, anemia) were reported that were considered by the investigator to be not drug-related. No clinically  meaningful  changes  in  laboratory  values  or  vital  signs  were  reported.  No  participants discontinued study intervention or discontinued from the study for any reason, and no deaths were reported.

| IV=intravenously;MD=multiple-dose;PO=orally;SD=single-dose Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. a Full-term neonate is defined as an infant born ≥37th week of gestation. b Preterm neonate is defined as a neonate born after completion of 26 weeks of gestation and before the beginning of the 37th week of gestation. Adverse event terms are from MedDRA Version 25.1 |         |         |

One participant (a preterm neonate in Group 6) had 1 drug-related AE (immature granulocyte count increased) after receiving a single oral dose of tedizolid phosphate.

All  AEs were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 SAE (therapeutic product effect incomplete; n=1  in  Group  1  Cohort  1)  that  was  classified  as  severe  and  was  also  classified  as  an  SAE.  The participant  had  a  slower-than-expected  response  to  the  concomitant  antibiotic  administered  for  an underlying infection.

There were no deaths reported for this study.

There were no discontinuations of study intervention due to AEs. No participant discontinued from the study for any reason.

One event of clinical interest (anaemia) was reported for 1 participant (in Group 3 Cohort 2) that was considered by the investigator to be not related to study intervention. The investigator classified the event as mild in intensity and it was reported resolved in 5 days.

The investigator considered the decrease in haemoglobin for this neonatal participant to be a clinically significant hematologic AE and, therefore, an ECI, as predefined in Section 7.2.2 of the study protocol.

The most common laboratory observation, particularly in neonates, was mild changes in haemoglobin, observed in participants with underlying sepsis and/or surgical interventions for underlying conditions. There was no apparent association of reductions in haemoglobin with exposure to tedizolid.

Assessment comment: No significant safety concern was identified.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

No  significant  concerns  regarding  tolerability  or  safety  were  identified  with  the  administration  of tedizolid to 47 participants aged birth (≥ 26 weeks gestational age at birth) to &lt;24 months.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of the final report of study MK-1986-014 (\" A Phase 1, Single- and Multiple-Dose Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Oral and IV Tedizolid Phosphate (MK-1986) in Inpatients Under 2 Years Old \", MK-1986-014  (P014))  do  not  change  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  tedizolid  phosphate  in  the  target population in the ongoing paediatric development programme.
