## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

This marketing authorisation application for Entacapone Orion (entacapone) has been submitted by Orion Corporation as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

The MAH (Orion Corporation) for Comtess, which was authorised on 16 September 1998, provided consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical documentation of the initial dossier of this authorised product and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Entacapone Orion medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Comtess. The application for Entacapone Orion concerns the identical strengths and pack sizes to those approved for Comtess and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found in the Comtess CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

The approved indication is:

'Entacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.'

## 2.2. Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Comtess application, the quality data in support of the Entacapone Orion application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Comtess dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Comtess  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in support  of  the  Entacapone  Orion  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the Comtess dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

The ERA provided for this application consists of an adequate justification for the absence of specific study data. The medicinal product subject to this application is intended to be administered at comparable dose levels and for indications that are already approved in the European Community for Comtess. Based on the assumption that the product is intended to substitute for identical products on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the market, the approval of the referred product should not result in an increase of the total quantity of the active ingredients released in to the environment. Therefore, it should not result in an increase of risk to the environment during storage, distribution, use and disposal.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Comtess application, the clinical data in support of the Entacapone Orion application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Comtess dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because the safety profile of the medicinal product subject to this application is well established, and no safety concerns requiring risk minimisation activities have been identified for Comtess.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

## 2.6. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The Package Leaflet of Comtess has been successfully user tested in the framework of variation EMEA/H/C/0170/II/0043/G for which the CHMP opinion was adopted on 22 April 2010. Since the proposed Package Leaflet for the current application is identical to the Package Leaflet for Comtess except for the product-specific information, no further testing is warranted.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Since this application has been submitted by Orion Corporation as an informed consent application to Comtess in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Entacapone Orion 200 mg film-coated tablets was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'Entacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.'

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Entacapone Orion in the treatment of Parkinson's diseases is favourable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## Risk Management System and PSUR cycle

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the medicinal product is on the market.

The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR submission schedule for Comtess.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

Not applicable.
