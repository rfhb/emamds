The RMP version 3.3 (in line with the revision 2 of the RMP template) has also been submitted.

Reported adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of Dacogen in adults. No efficacy was observed in children aged 1 month to < 18 years with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Of the 17 subjects enrolled in the study, 14 subjects died, the majority of these were due to disease progression. Therefore, the results of this study do not support a paediatric indication. Based on this, the SmPC has been updated with the results of the phase I/II paediatric study and to recommend that Dacogen should not be used in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) |

Moreover, the existing wording for the warning of patients with renal impairment has been revised in alignment with recommendation on patients with hepatic impairment. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the contact details of the local representative in Portugal in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the term '(for pH adjustment)' has been removed from the Annex IIIA in accordance with the revision 2 of the European Commission guideline on Excipients in the labelling | 15/11/2018 | 07/02/2019 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Published literature identified 86 publications of which 18 evidenced changes in liver function tests, including hyperbilirubinemia, elevated AST/ALT and related hepatobiliary disorders. Moreover, severe elevated bilirubin and/or cholestatic events were observed, including severe LFT elevations with positive dechallenge. Based on this cumulative review, it is considered that hepatotoxicity with elevated LFT and bilirubine is associated with the use of decitabine. Therefore, changes to the product information of Dacogen are recommended in order to add the adverse events 'hepatic function abnormal' with a frequency 'very common', and 'hyperbilirubinaemia' with a frequency 'common' as new hepatobiliary disorders in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In addition, the existing warning for hepatic impairment is updated in section 4.4 of the SmPC to include clinical recommendations for patients who develop signs or symptoms. |

Dacogen powder should be aseptically reconstituted with 10 ml of water for injections. Upon reconstitution, each ml contains approximately 5 mg of decitabine at pH 6.7 to 7.3. Within 15 minutes of reconstitution, the solution must be further diluted with cold infusion fluids (sodium chloride 9 mg/ml [0.9%] solution for injection or 5% glucose solution for injection) to a final concentration of 0.15 to 1.0 mg/ml. The posology and the method of administration are not changed as consequence of the change of the dilution.   |
