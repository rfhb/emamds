## ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Panretin 0.1 % gel

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

1 g of gel contains 1 mg alitretinoin (0.1%).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Gel. Clear yellow gel. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Panretin gel is indicated for the topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) when: -lesions are not ulcerated or lymphoedematous -treatment of visceral KS is not required -lesions are not responding to systemic antiretroviral therapy -radiotherapy or chemotherapy are not appropriate 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Panretin therapy should only be initiated and maintained by specialist physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with KS. Men Patients should apply Panretin to cutaneous KS lesions using sufficient gel so as to cover each lesion with a generous coating. Frequency of application Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Patients should initially apply Panretin twice a day to cutaneous KS lesions. The application frequency can be increased stepwise to three or four times a day according to individual lesion tolerance, allowing no less than two weeks between dose increases. The frequency of application should be adjusted for each lesion independently. If application site toxicity occurs, the application frequency can be reduced as described below. There are no data on the efficacy of Panretin applied less frequently than twice daily.

Local dermal irritation may be graded according to the five-point scale shown in Table 1. Guidelines for treatment adjustments necessitated by local dermal treatment-related toxicity are specified in Table 2.

The safety and efficacy of Panretin gel in children under 18 years has not been established. No data are available.

Duration of application It is recommended that Panretin should be applied to lesions for an initial period of up to 12 weeks. Treatment of lesions that have not shown a decrease in area and/or height by week 12 should be discontinued. For those lesions that have shown a decrease in height and/or area by week 12, applications may be continued providing that there is continued improvement or at least maintenance of the response and that the product continues to be tolerated. Treatment of any lesion that has fully resolved on clinical assessment should be discontinued. Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product Patients should wash their hands before and after applications; it is not necessary to wear gloves. The gel must be allowed to dry for three to five minutes before covering with clothing. Occlusive dressings should be avoided. Care must be taken to avoid application of the gel to normal skin surrounding the lesions. Gel should not be applied on or near eyes or mucosal surfaces of the body. Showering, bathing, or swimming for at least three hours after any application should be avoided. Women Safety and effectiveness in women have not been established because of the paucity of clinical data. AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma is infrequent in women. Paediatric population Medicinal product no longer authorised

Panretin is not approved for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

## Elderly men

There are no specific recommendations for use in elderly men (above 65 years of age). AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma is infrequent in this population.

## Patients with renal or hepatic impairment

There are no data regarding the use of Panretin gel in patients with renal insufficiency or liver disease. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable 9cis -retinoic acid plasma concentrations in patients with KS after application of the medicinal product were comparable to the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

plasma concentrations of circulating, naturally-occurring 9cis -retinoic acid in untreated individuals (see section 5.2). On a theoretical basis, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency or liver disease, but these patients should be closely monitored and treatment frequency reduced, or withdrawn, if they experience adverse effects.

## 4.3 Contraindications

-  Hypersensitivity to retinoids in general, to the active substance alitretinoin or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
-  Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6).

 Women planning a pregnancy.  Treatment of KS lesions in close proximity to other skin disorders. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. There were no reports of photosensitivity associated with the use of Panretin gel in the clinical studies. However, patients must be cautioned to minimise exposure of treated areas to sunlight or other ultraviolet (UV) light. (see section 5.3). It is recommended that daily dietary intake of vitamin A should not exceed the Recommended Dietary Intake value. Alitretinoin may cause harm to the foetus. Women of child-bearing potential must use a reliable form of contraception during treatment with Panretin gel (see section 4.6) and until one month after cessation of treatment. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction The use of other topical products on Panretin treated KS lesions should be avoided. Mineral oil may be used between Panretin applications in order to help prevent excessive dryness or itching. However, mineral oil should not be applied for at least two hours before or after the application of Panretin. It is not recommended for patients to apply Panretin gel concurrently with products that contain N,N -diethylm -toluamide (DEET ), a common component of insect repellent products. Animal toxicology studies showed increased DEET toxicity when DEET was included as part of the formulation. The range and frequency of detection of quantifiable plasma 9cis -retinoic acid concentrations in patients with KS applying the medicinal product to up to 64 lesions were comparable to respective values in untreated patients. Therefore, there is a low potential for interactions with systemic medicinal products. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

There was no clinical evidence in the vehicle-controlled studies of interactions with systemic antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors; macrolide antibiotics and azole antifungals. While no data are available, it is possible that co-administration of medicinal products which induce CYP isozymes may reduce circulating levels of alitretinoin, with a possible negative effect on the efficacy of Panretin gel.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of child-bearing potential

Women of child-bearing potential must use effective contraception during, and up to one month after cessation of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Men using Panretin should take precautions to ensure that their female partners do not become pregnant.

## Pregnancy

Orally administered retinoids have been associated with congenital abnormalities. When used in accordance with the prescribing information topically administered retinoids are generally assumed to result in low systemic exposure due to minimal dermal absorption. However there could be individual factors (e.g. damaged skin barrier, excessive use) that contribute to an increased systemic exposure.

Adverse events associated with the use of Panretin gel in AIDS-related KS occurred almost exclusively at the site of application. The dermal toxicity typically begins as erythema; with continued application of Panretin gel erythema may increase and oedema may develop. Dermal toxicity may become treatment-limiting, with intense erythema, oedema, and vesiculation. When applying Panretin gel, 69.1% of patients experienced adverse drug reactions at the application site.

In rabbits, alitretinoin was shown to be teratogenic at a dose which resulted in plasma concentrations about 60 times the highest observed plasma concentration in male patients with KS following topical application of the gel. However, it is not currently certain to what extent topical treatment with Panretin gel would increase 9cis -retinoic acid plasma concentrations, in women with KS above naturally occurring levels; therefore, Panretin is contraindicated ( see section 4.3) in pregnancy, or in women planning a pregnancy. If the product is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, treatment should be discontinued. Breast-feeding It is not known whether this medicinal product is excreted in human milk. Based on the plasma concentrations observed in patients, milk concentrations of 9cis -retinoic acid probably pose a low risk for the infant. However, because of the potential for undesirable effects from Panretin gel in infants being breast-fed, mothers must discontinue breast-feeding prior to using the medicinal product and not initiate breast-feeding while using the medicinal product. Care should be taken not to bring the neonate into skin contact with areas to which Panretin has been recently applied. It is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their children to exclude the risk of transmission of the virus. Fertility No specific studies on fertility have been conducted in men or women. However, alitretinoin is teratogenic so both men and women should take adequate precautions to avoid female partners becoming pregnant. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Panretin gel is for cutaneous use and is unlikely to have an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 3 shows the following application-site drug-related adverse reactions were reported during clinical studies in patients with KS. The frequency of adverse events are classified as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), and uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100). Adverse events include verbatim terms in parentheses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The safety of Panretin gel has been assessed in clinical studies of more than 469 patients with AIDS-related KS, 439 of whom were treated with an alitretinoin concentration of 0.1%. The incidence of drug-related skin disorder, skin ulcer, pain and rash appeared to be greater in patients applying Panretin gel four times daily than in those applying it less frequently. However, the incidence of other equally common drug-related adverse events such as pruritus, oedema, exfoliative dermatitis and dry skin did not appear to increase as a function of the frequency of application. The incidence of mild/moderate rash (all events regardless of causality) was less in patients treated for less than 16 weeks than in those treated for 16 weeks or more (mild, 33% v 63%; moderate, 29% v 43%). The incidence of severe skin rash was independent of the duration of treatment (10% in both cases). Local dermal toxicity associated with Panretin gel therapy generally resolved with treatment adjustment or discontinuation (see section 4.2). Only two serious adverse reactions were reported (sepsis and cellulitis in the same patient). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The adverse events seen with Panretin gel are similar to those seen with other topical retinoids. It is unlikely that the undesirable systemic side effects associated with oral retinoids will be observed with the use of Panretin gel because the range and frequency of quantifiable 9cis -retinoic acid plasma levels concentrations after application of the medicinal product were comparable to the range and frequency of quantifiable plasma concentrations of circulating, naturally occurring 9cis -retinoic acid in untreated individuals.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported.

Systemic toxicity following acute overdose with topical application of Panretin gel is unlikely.

5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: LO1XX22 Although the molecular action of alitretinoin is thought to be mediated through interaction with the retinoid receptors, the exact mechanism of action of this medicinal product in the topical treatment of cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS is unknown. Alitretinoin (9cis -retinoic acid), a naturally-occurring endogenous hormone related to vitamin A, binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RAR  , RAR  , RAR  , RXR  , RXR  , RXR  ). Once activated, these receptors function as ligand dependent transcription factors that regulate the expression of specific genes. The regulation of gene expression by alitretinoin controls the process of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells. The efficacy of Panretin gel in treating KS lesions may be related to the demonstrated ability of alitretinoin to inhibit the in vitro growth of KS cells. Panretin gel can be expected to have local therapeutic effects only and it has no role in the prevention or treatment of visceral KS. Two controlled, multicentre, randomised, double blind parallel group, Phase III studies provided the data for Panretin gel in the treatment of index cutaneous lesions of KS (Table 4). The patient response rate was evaluated using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) criteria for lesion response in KS. Study 1 included an open-label phase, in which patients themselves elected to enroll. Study 2 was followed by an open label study (Study 2a), which included only patients electing to continue from Study 2. Table 4 Best response according to ACTG criteria for vehicle controlled phase Clinical Complete Medicinal product no longer authorised

1. Protocol-specified dose regimen was application three times a day (TID) escalating to four times a day (QID) after two weeks, with downward adjustments for toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Protocol-specified dose regimen was application twice a day (BD) only, with downward adjustments for toxicity.

In the open label phase of Study 1 (N = 184), the overall response rate increased to 66.7%. In Study 2a (N = 99), the overall response rate increased to 56.1%.

In study 1, of 110 responding patients, 36 (33%) relapsed, while all but four still being on active treatment.

Response rates were analysed both by the patient as the unit of analysis and by the lesion. Table 5 provides the individual lesion response rates for patients being treated with Panretin gel in the Phase III studies. Table 5 Index/indicator lesion 1 responses within patients during the first 12 weeks on study in initial blinded phase Number of Responding Lesions 2,3 At Least One At Least Four 1. Study 1, 6 index lesions; Study 2, up to 8 index lesions 2. Each index lesion assessed individually for response. 3. Lesions responding during the first 12 weeks on study, initial blinded phase, confirmed over at least four study weeks (confirmation of response may have occurred after 12 weeks for some lesions in Study 1). 4. Percentages calculated as number of patients with responding lesions divided by total number of patients in the initial blinded phase. In one trial, 29% of the lesions that had reached a partial response (PR) but had not attained clinical complete response (CCR) within the first 12 weeks of treatment developed a CCR during continuing treatment beyond 12 weeks. The projected time for lesions that were in partial response (PR) to later attain clinical complete response (CCR) was 168 days. It is recommended that Panretin gel should be applied for an initial treatment period of up to 12 weeks. In lesions that have responded to treatment during this time, application may be continued provided that the response improves or is maintained and the product continues to be tolerated. If a complete response of a lesion occurs, no further application of Panretin gel should be made to the responding lesion. There are no data regarding the efficacy of Panretin gel when applied to complicated lesions (e.g., when lymphoedema is present). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Medicinal product no longer authorised

Plasma concentrations of 9cis -retinoic acid were evaluated during clinical studies in patients with cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS after repeated multiple-daily dose application of Panretin gel for up to 60 weeks. A subset of these patients were followed during treatment of up to 64 lesions (range 4-64, median 11.5 lesions) for up to 44 weeks (range 2-44, median 15 weeks). In this latter group, the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable 9cis -retinoic acid plasma concentrations in patients with KS after application of the medicinal product were comparable to the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable plasma concentrations of circulating, naturally-occurring 9cis -retinoic acid in untreated individuals.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Toxicology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The phototoxicity potential of alitretinoin was assessed based on its chemical properties and data from a battery of in vitro tests. The results suggest that alitretinoin absorbs light in the UV range and is subject to photodegradation to other isomers (predominantly alltrans -retinoic acid). Alitretinoin was shown to have a weak potential to be a photo-irritant based on histidine and photoprotein binding. In cell-based in vitro assays, alitretinoin showed weak phototoxic potential.

Three doses of alitretinoin (0.01%, 0.05%, or 0.5%) in a topical gel formulation were given to rats in a 28-day dermal toxicology study. Observed effects at the application site included erythema, epidermal thickening, scaling and loosening of the stratum corneum. Clinical pathology evaluations revealed significant increases in absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts, monocyte counts, percentage of monocytes and decreases in percentage of lymphocyte differential white blood cell counts on day 29 of rats treated with alitretinoin 0.5% gel. Clinical chemistry evaluations revealed biologically relevant significant increases in the mean BUN and alkaline phosphatase values in females after the 28-day treatment. Serum LDL was increased in both male and female groups at Day 29. There were no biologically relevant haematology differences or serum chemistry differences after the 14-day period. Observed increases in mean heart-to-final body weight differences were attributed principally to the difference in the terminal body weights. Following treatment with alitretinoin 0.5% gel, mean plasma concentrations in the female rats were generally below the lower limit of quantitation (5 nMol) and mean plasma concentrations in the male rats were about 200 nMol. In contrast to these findings in rats, plasma concentrations of 9cis -retinoic acid in patients with KS applying Panretin gel never exceeded 0.638 ng/ml (2.13 nMol). This level is about 1/100 the mean concentration measured in male rats. Genotoxicity Alitretinoin was studied for genotoxic potential using the Ames test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, the chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and the CHO cell mutation test. The medicinal product was not genotoxic. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility Studies have not been performed to determine the carcinogenic potential of alitretinoin. However, the mutagenic potential has been evaluated, and alitretinoin has tested negative in the Ames test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, the chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and the CHO cell mutation test. Teratogenicity In an oral dose-ranging study in rabbits, alitretinoin induced gross malformations at a dose 35 times the topical human dose. This dose in rabbits resulted in plasma concentrations more than 60 times the highest observed plasma concentration in patients with KS following topical application of Panretin gel. No gross malformations were observed following oral administration to rabbits of doses 12 times the human topical dose (which resulted in plasma concentrations 60 times the highest observed plasma concentration in patients with KS following topical application of the gel). However, an increased rate of fused sternebrae was observed. Phototoxicity Medicinal product no longer authorised
