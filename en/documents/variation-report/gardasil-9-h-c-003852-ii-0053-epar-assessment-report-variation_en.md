## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, MSD Vaccines submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 3 December 2021 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity data following the final results of the Gardasil 9 long-term follow-up (LTFU) study V503-002-20 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some minor editorial changes (spacings) and included the updated long-term follow-up data received for the qHPV vaccine following V501-167 extension study. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The 9-valent vaccine Gardasil 9 (9vHPV) was authorised in EU in 2015.

Based on new data accrued from the now completed clinical study V503-002-20 , the MAH proposed to update the SmPC section 5.1 by updating the information on effectiveness data for 9vHPV vaccines. Study V503-002-20 had been assessed previously in separate worksharing procedures. The submission of the final study report is also in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 which sets out the obligation for MAHs to submit any MAH-sponsored studies involving the use of an authorised medicinal products in the paediatric population to the competent authority.

LTFU data for the quadrivalent vaccine, 10 years follow-up, from V501-167 extension study, was assessed during a previous procedure for the tetravalent qHPV Gardasil (EMEA/H/C/000703/II/0087) and the changes were agreed with, but the data were not completely updated in the SmPC. In the current SmPC, information on V501-167 is updated according to earlier agreement and therefore will not be repeated again in this procedure.

The phase 3 studies of the qHPV (Gardasil) and 9vHPV (Gardasil 9) vaccine programs were extended to provide LTFU data on effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety. Subjects in the qHPV vaccine arm (control arm) of the pivotal 9vHPV vaccine efficacy study were offered vaccination with 9vHPV vaccine at the end of the base study. Because there is no control group in these LTFU studies, vaccine efficacy cannot be measured. In lieu of efficacy measurements, effectiveness of vaccination with the qHPV or 9vHPV vaccine is assessed. LTFU for effectiveness was collected using the system of registries and tissue repositories in Scandinavia. Effectiveness is measured in terms of the observed incidence rates of disease in comparison with the expected incidence in an unvaccinated population.

The final study report for Study V503-002-20 provides reassuring and consistent data on long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity or persistence of antibodies. The results speak for uniform long-term protection against infection and clinical disease caused by HPV types in the vaccine. The immune responses are rapid, substantial and well sustained, with current follow-up reaching up to 10 (9vHPV) years. Over time, GMT levels and seropositivity rates decline through an expected natural course and also number of persistent infections had been grown somewhat from 8 years follow-up to 10 years follow-up.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As there were no break-through cases of dysplasia so far, one can conclude that the protective effect of Gardasil 9 lasts at least 10 years.

The updated safety follow-up did not reveal any new safety concern.

The updates in SmPC are considered relevant, but the MAH was asked to describe also the incidence of the persistent HPV infections as it was a key effectiveness endpoint of the study and as no cases would be expected in the study cohort due to the limited sample size. The MAH updated the SmPC with information about incidence of the persistent HPV infections as requested.

The benefit-risk balance of Gardasil 9 remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

| Variation approved   | Variation approved                                                                                                | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity data following the final results of the Gardasil 9 long-term follow-up (LTFU) paediatric study V503-002-20, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. V503-002-20 is a LTFU extension of Study V503-002 (base study: a 3-year immunogenicity study of the 9vHPV vaccine in girls and boys 9 to 15 years of age, which assessed the immunogenicity and effectiveness of the 9vHPV vaccine through 10 years post dose 3. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some minor editorial changes (spacings) and included the updated long term follow-up data already approved for the qHPV vaccine following V501-167 extension study. The details of local representatives for the MAH in the Package Leaflet is also updated.

is recommended for approval.

## 5. Introduction

The 9vHPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) recombinant vaccin e (GARDASIL™9), is an aluminum-adjuvanted recombinant VLP vaccine indicated for the prevention of cancer, dysplasia, genital warts, and infection caused by HPV types that are targeted by the vaccine in individuals from the age of 9 years.

This application is in support of an update to the SmPC and includes updated results from a clinical study of the 9vHPV vaccine program.

Pivotal Phase 3 studies from the 9vHPV vaccine program were extended to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity of the 9vHPV and qHPV vaccines in support of approved indications specified in the SmPC. The proposed variation aims to update section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)

Current type II variation:

- 1) Addition of long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity data from Gardasil 9 study V503-00220 (MEA 010).

V503-002-20 is a LTFU extension of Study V503-002 (base study; a 3-year immunogenicity study of the 9vHPV vaccine in girls and boys 9 to 15 years of age, which assessed the immunogenicity and effectiveness of the 9vHPV vaccine through 10 years post dose 3.

A total of 1272 participants (971 female and 301 male participants) who received 3 doses of 9vHPV vaccine in the base study were followed in the study extension. Serum was collected in the extension at Months 66, 90, and 126 to evaluate persistence of the HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 antibody responses. LTFU for effectiveness was collected at study visits every 6 months during the study extension, starting when the participant reached 16 years of age. Three analyses were conducted, including 2 interim analyses (at Months 72 and 96, representing 5.5 years and 7.5 years post dose 3, respectively) and 1 final analysis (at Month 126, representing 10 years post dose 3). This application provides the final analyses for the study extension summarized in the CSR

## 6.1. Methods -analysis of data submitted

## Clinical Immunogenicity Endpoints

The immunogenicity endpoints for the LTFU study were the assessment of serum anti-HPV antibody levels (GMTs) and the proportions of participants who remained seropositive to vaccine HPV types at specific time points of the follow-up period to allow determination of the persistence of immune responses.

The primary immunoassay was HPV-9 cLIA. The IgG LIA, which is slightly more sensitive than the HPV-9 cLIA, was used as a secondary assay in supportive analyses to assess antibody persistence.

The immunogenicity analyses were conducted in the PPI population, consisting of individuals who received all 3 doses of vaccinations with the correct dose of the correct clinical material and within acceptable day ranges, provided a Month 7 serology result within 21 to 49 days post dose 3, were seronegative by cLIA to the appropriate HPV type at Day 1 (For HPV 6 and 11, participants must have been seronegative to both HPV 6 and 11 at Day 1), and had no other protocol violations that could have interfered with the evaluation of participant's immune response to the study vaccine.

* Secondary effectiveness endpoints for V503-002-20 (because V503-002-20 has no primary effectiveness endpoints).

AIS: adenocarcinoma in situ; CIN: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; CIN1: CIN Grade 1; CIN2: CIN Grade 2; CIN3: CIN Grade 3; PIN: penile intraepithelial neoplasia; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; VaIN: vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia; VIN: vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.

For the determination of endpoints, tissue samples collected during the study were reviewed by an adjudication panel of 4 pathologists and tested by PCR to detect the presence of HPV deoxyribonucleic acid.

The primary effectiveness analyses were conducted in the PPE population consisting of individuals who received all 3 doses of vaccinations with the correct dose of the correct clinical material within 1 year, were seronegative by cLIA to the appropriate HPV type at Day 1 (seronegative to both HPV 6 and 11 in analysis of HPV 6- and 11-related endpoints), and had no other protocol violations that could have interfered with the evaluation of effectiveness of the study vaccine. Only PPE population-eligible participants who were at least 16 years of age and had at least 1 follow-up visit with PCR data contributed to the PPE analyses.

## 6.2. Results

## Final Analysis of Protocol V503-002-20: Antibody Persistence in Girls and Boys 9 to 15 Years of Age Administered 9vHPV Vaccine

GMTs assessed by HPV-9 cLIA and IgG LIA to each of the 9 HPV types were highest at Month 7 (1 month postdose 3) and decreased thereafter. The steepest decline in GMTs occurred between Month 7 and Month 12, after which titers continued to gradually decrease through Month 126 (10 years postdose 3). Seropositivity rates were &gt;99% at Month 7 and remained high at Month 126 (≥81.3% and ≥94.9% measured by cLIA and IgG LIA, respectively) for each of the 9 HPV types.

In summary, the Month 126 immunogenicity results demonstrated persistent HPV antibody responses through 10 years postvaccination in girls and boys 9 to 15 years of age who received a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine (Table 2 &amp; 3).

Assessor´s comment: Over time, GMT levels and seropositivity rates declined through an expected natural course. After 10 years, the vaccine induced antibodies are still detectable among more than 80 % of participants, depending on HPV type. There has not been a remarkable drop of antibody level or seropositivity from month 90 to month 126 indicating that antibody level is rather stable between 8 to 10 years.

## Final Analysis of Protocol V503-002-20: Long-term Clinical Effectiveness of 9vHPV Vaccine in Girls and Boys 9 to 15 Years of Age

Participants in the PPE population (n=1134) were followed for effectiveness for a maximum of 11.0 years (median: 10.0 years) postdose 3. Female participants (n=872) were followed for up to 11.0 years (median: 10.0 years) postdose 3; male participants (n=262) were followed for up to 10.6 years (median: 9.9 years) postdose 3.

One case of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58-related low-grade cervical dysplasia was observed in female participants 9 to 15 years of age in the PPE population (866 participants, 4576.1 person-years follow-up). This case was diagnosed as CIN1, which was based on a CIN1 diagnosis associated with HPV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

39 and HPV 59 on a cervical biopsy and a CIN1 diagnosis associated with HPV 16, HPV 39 and HPV 59 on an endocervical curettage. Cervical biopsy was positive for HPV 39 and HPV 59 with no pathological abnormalities. Persistent infection was observed with HPV 39 and HPV 59; HPV 16 was detected only once in association with the endocervical curettage. Based on these results, it is likely that the lesion was caused by HPV 39 or HPV 59. This CIN1 lesion is not considered a breakthrough since these 2 HPV types are not covered by the 9vHPV vaccine.

No (0) cases of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58-related PIN, genital warts, or penile/perineal/perianal cancer were observed in boys 9 to 15 years of age in the PPE population (261 participants, 1278.6 person-years follow-up).

Incidence rates of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58-related 6-month persistent infection in females and males were low (52.4 and 54.6 per 10000 person-years, respectively) and within ranges expected in vaccinated cohorts (based on results from previous efficacy studies of the 9vHPV and qHPV vaccines) (Table4).

Assessors comment: The results of persistent Gardasil 9 targeted HPV infections 8 vs 10 years followup:

| N 8 years FU   | Cases 8 years FU   | Cases/ N years   | N 10 years FU   | Cases 10 years FU   | Cases/ N 10 years   |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Persistent HPV > 6 months women   |   856 |   14 |   0.016 |   872 |   24 |   0.028 |
|-----------------------------------|-------|------|---------|-------|------|---------|
| Persistent HPV > 12 months women  |   856 |    7 |   0.008 |   872 |    9 |   0.01  |
| Persistent HPV > 6 months men     |   251 |    3 |   0.012 |   261 |    7 |   0.027 |
| Persistent HPV > 12 months men    |   251 |    1 |   0.004 |   261 |    2 |   0.008 |

The number of persistent infections (&gt;6 months) increased about two-fold at 10 years follow-up compared to the 8 years follow-up among both women and men. It is not possible to conclude from these data if this is due to waning protection or from increased exposure. The study cohort, which was at 9-15 years of age at vaccination start is now, after 10 years FU, between 20-26 years old, which is a sexually active age.

## 6.3. Discussion

9vHPV vaccine induced strong immune response with high levels of antibodies for all vaccine included HPV types. These antibodies persisted at least 10 years following vaccination with 9vHPV vaccine as measured with a binding assay. Over time, GMT levels and seropositivity rates declined through an expected natural course. After 10 years, the vaccine induced antibodies are still detectable among more than 80 % of participants, depending on HPV type. There has not been a remarkable drop of antibody level or seropositivity from month 90 to month 126 indicating that antibody level is rather stable between 8 to 10 years.

In case of 9vHPV study in younger cohort (9-15 at vaccination initiation) V503-002-20 there was no possible break through case identified during 10 years of follow-up. On the other hand, this cohort has not reached the age when the cervical lesions are usually discovered (30+).

During this study, persistent HPV infections were noted in some cases. During the 8 years follow-up, when 856 women had been sampled at least once, eleven females had HPV 16, and 3 women had one of each HPV 6, 18 and 33 infections which persisted more than 6 months. Seven HPV 16 infections were cleared, but the rest of these HPV infections persisted 12 months. At 8 years follow-up, 251 men had been sampled and three males had 6 months of persistence of HPV type HPV 11, 45 and 52. In one case, HPV 52 infection persisted 12 months.

According to the final analysis at 10 years of follow-up, 16 additional women compared to 8 years followup were sampled (altogether 872) and additional persistent HPV infections appeared. HPV 16 was altogether persistent more than 6 months in 17 women and more than 12 months in 5 women. HPV 6 persisted more than 6 months in 4 women and 12 months in 2 women. Also one women had HPV 58 infection, which persisted more than 6 months.

Among 8 males, HPV11 (1), HPV 31 (2), HPV 45 (1) and HPV 52 (4) persisted more than 6 months, whereas in 2 males HPV 52 persisted more than 12 months.

The number of infections increase compared to the earlier observation-point. It is not possible to conclude

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

if this is due to waning protection, or due to increased exposure. As this cohort was very young at the vaccination time it is unlikely that these infections were there already before vaccination.

## 7. Clinical Safety aspects

This application is in support of an update to the PI for the 9vHPV vaccine and includes Protocol V503002-20. Protocol V503-002-20 is a LTFU extension of Protocol V503-002, to assess the long-term immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety of the 9vHPV vaccine through 10 years postdose 3 (Month 126). Eligible participants included girls and boys enrolled in the V503-002 base study aged 9 to 15 years who received a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6. No vaccinations were administered during the study extension. The final analysis (at Month 126) is included in this application.

## 7.1. Methods -analysis of data submitted

## Safety Population

All safety analyses were performed on the all-participants-as-treated population, which was defined as all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine and had a safety follow-up.

## Serious Adverse Events

SAEs included those events that met standard definitions for SAEs (ie, resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was another important medical event) as well as cancer and overdose.

Adverse events resulting in death and SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be vaccine- or procedure-related occurring at any time during the study were to be reported to the Sponsor.

## Pregnancy Outcomes

Throughout the study, pregnancies were to be followed to outcome. Pregnancy outcomes were reported to the Sponsor. SAEs in infants born to study participants were collected throughout the study and followed to outcome.

## Overall Extent of Exposure

Measures of extent of exposure did not apply to the V503-002-20 study because vaccinations were not administered in the LTFU study.

The 1272 participants enrolled in the V503-002-20 study (971 female and 301 male) all received 3 doses of 9vHPV vaccine in the V503-002 base study.

## 7.2. Results

## Serious Adverse Events

No vaccine-related or procedure-related SAEs were reported during the LTFU.

One participant died during the LTFU. The cause of death was disseminated tuberculosis (SAE, onset over eight and a half years post dose 3). The death was considered not related to study vaccination or procedures.

Although not required by the protocol, 1 SAE of 'abortion threatened' at over four and a half years post dose 3, considered not related to the vaccine or study procedures, was reported in 1 participant during study V503-002-20.

## Pregnancy Outcomes

The safety profile of the 9vHPV vaccine with respect to pregnancy outcomes has been previously established based on a combined analysis of 7 Phase 3 clinical studies including more than 1500

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pregnancies.

Known outcomes were reported for 240 pregnancies in Protocol V503-002-20. Most pregnancies resulted in live births. Spontaneous abortions (fetal loss before 20 weeks of gestation) and late fetal deaths (fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation) were reported for 9.6% (23/240) and 0.4% (1/240) of the pregnancies with known outcomes, respectively. The proportion of pregnancies with live birth that resulted in a congenital anomaly was 3.3% (8/240). Overall, the proportions of pregnancies that resulted in adverse outcomes of spontaneous abortion, late fetal death, or congenital anomaly in the study were within ranges reported in the general population. These results do not change the safety profile previously established.

Eight pregnancies in Protocol V503-002-20 resulted in live births in which the infants were diagnosed with congenital anomalies. These congenital anomalies included 1 case of unspecified congenital heart disease, 4 cases of congenital ankyloglossia, 1 case of syndactyly, 1 case of cleft lip and palate, and 1 case of trisomy 21. All these congenital anomalies occurred in pregnancies with an estimated date of conception &gt;2 years postvaccination. None of these congenital anomalies were considered related to the study vaccine.

A total of 35 SAEs were reported in infants of 17 vaccinated female participants enrolled in Protocol V503002-20 from the Month 36 visit through the end of the study. None of these SAEs were considered related to the study vaccine.

Narratives for all the SAEs reported in infants were provided.

## 7.3. Discussion

No vaccine-related or procedure-related SAEs were reported during the LTFU as expected as such AEs appear in frame of the few months from vaccination and not years after. One participant died due to the tuberculosis almost 9 years after last dose of Gardasil 9 and is clearly unrelated to the vaccination. Same applies to the case of 'abortion threatened' 4.5 years post do se 3. The pregnancy outcomes were as expected, and Gardasil 9 had no influence for these.

We conclude that administration of a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine to girls and boys 9 to 15 years of age is generally well tolerated through 10 years postvaccination.

## 8. Changes to the Product Information

As  a  result  of  this  variation,  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  is  updated  to  include  information  on  long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity data following the final results of the Gardasil 9 study V503-002-20 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. In addition, the applicant took the opportunity to make some minor editorial changes (spacings) and included the updated long term follow-up data already approved for the qHPV vaccine following V501-167 extension study.

The main SmPC changes in section 5.1 proposed by the MAH were the following:

## Long-term effectiveness studies

In Protocol 002 extension study, no cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or g genital warts were observed through 8.211.0 years postdose3(median follow-up of710.6-0y years)ing girls (n = 864872 and t through 8.110.6 years postdose 3 (medlian follow-up of 7.69.9 years) in boys (n= 2621) whowere aged 9 to 15 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Persistence of immuneresponse to Gardasil 9

In long-term follow-up extension of clinical studies Protocols 001 and 002, persistence of antibody responseswasobserved:

- for at least 5 years in women who were aged 16 to 26 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9, depending on HPV type, 78 to100 % of subjects were seropositive; however, efficacy was maintained in all subjects regardless of seropositivity status for any vaccine HPV type through the end of the study (up to 67 months postdose 3, median follow-up duration of 43monthspostdose3),
- for at least 710 years in girls and boys who were aged 9 to 15 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9; depending on HPV type, 9181 to 9998% of subjects were seropositive.

Assessor´s comment: the updates are based on 10 years-follow-up of study V503-002-20. The updates are in agreement with the presented data and are therefore acceptable, but the Long-term effectiveness paragraph should also mention the data on persistent infection as no cases would be expected in the study cohort due to the limited sample size. Also, persistent infection was a key effectiveness endpoint of this study.

## Immune responses to Gardasil 9 using a 2-dose schedule in individuals 9 through 14 years of age

In a clinical trial, persistence of antibody response has been demonstrated for at least 5-10 years in girls aged 9 to13 years who received 2 doses of qHPV vaccine.

Assessor´s comment: the update bases on 10 years-follow-up of study V501-167. The updates are in agreement with the presented data during the previous procedure EMEA/H/C/000703/II/0087 for Gardasil and are therefore acceptable.

Based on the above assessment remarks, the resulting text for Section 5.1 is therefore endorsed:

## Long-termeffectivenessstudies

A subset of subjects is being followed up for 10 to 14 years after Gardasil 9 vaccination for safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness against clinical diseases related to the HPV types in the vaccine.

In the long-term extensions of clinical studies Protocols 001 and 002, effectiveness was observed in the PPE population. The PPE population consisted of individuals:

- who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment, without major deviations from the studyprotocol,
- who were seronegative to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and among women aged 16 to 26 years, PCR negative to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 through onemonthpostdose3 (Month7).

In Protocol 001\\_registry study, no cases of vaccine HPV types related high-grade CIN were observed through 9.5 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 6.3 years) in women (n = 1,448) who were aged 16 to26yearsattimeofvaccinationwithGardasil9.

In Protocol 002 extension study, no cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or genital warts were observed through &amp;.211.0 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 710.6-0 years) in girls (n = 864872) and through 8.110.6 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 7.69.9 years) in boys (n = 2621) who were aged 9 to 15 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9. Incidence rates of vaccine HPV types related 6-month persistent infections in girls and boys observed during the study were 52.4 and 54.6 per 10.000 person-years, respectively, and within ranges of incidence rates expected in vaccinated cohorts ofsimilar age(basedonresultsfrompreviousefficacystudies of Gardasil 9andqHPVvaccine).

## Summary of the MAH's response

The updated SmPC section 5.1, Long-term effectiveness studies :

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Protocol 002 extension study, no cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or genital warts were observed through 8.211.0 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 710.6-0 years) in girls (n = 864872) and through 8.110.6 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 7.69.9 years) in boys (n = 262+) who were aged 9 to 15 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9. Incidence rates of vaccine HPV types related 6-month persistent infections in girls and boys observed during the study were 52.4 and 54.6 per 10.000 person-years, respectively, and within ranges of incidence rates expected in vaccinated cohorts of similar age (based on results from previous efficacy studies of Gardasil 9 and qHPV vaccine).

## Rapporteur's comment

The MAH is asked to describe in the SmPC the outcome of the key effectiveness endpoint of the study V503-002-20, incidence of the persistent HPV infections from the study start until in the end of the study (10 y FU).
