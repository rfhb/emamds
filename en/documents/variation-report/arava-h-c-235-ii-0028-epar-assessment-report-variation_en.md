## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Introduction

This submission concerns a type II variation to Arava in response to the EMEA letter dated 25 March 2005 on the submission of data concerning the use of medicinal products in children.

Of the many subtypes of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), active polyarticular course JRA (APC-JRA) is  widely  regarded as the paediatric equivalent to adult RA. Both conditions share many clinical and pathophysiological  features.  APC-JRA  is  the  second  most  frequent  type  of  paediatric  RA,  affecting approximately  20  to  40%  of  all  children  with  JRA.  The  European  League  of  Associations  for Rheumatology (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) both recognise this subtype of paediatric arthritis and have established the key diagnostic criteria and pattern of joint involvement which characterise each of the major variants of JRA, including APC-JRA.

Currently the repertoire of medicinal products approved for the treatment of JRA in Europe is limited. Only two compounds are available in Europe, methotrexate (MTX), a Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) and etanercept, a biological. The efficacy of MTX in JRA has been demonstrated since 1992.  Compared  to  placebo,  MTX  was  shown  to  have  improved  efficacy  with  an  acceptable  safety profile  in  children  with  APC-JRA.  However,  the  frequency  and  severity  of  side  effects  increase  with higher doses, and drug resistance to MTX may develop when used over the long term.

Etanercept is a genetically engineered fusion protein that binds the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis  factor  (TNF)  and  lymphotoxin- inhibiting  their  activity.  It  has  been  established  that  TNF- inhibition by etanercept is effective at controlling APC-JRA with acceptable tolerability. Etanercept is approved in Europe for second-line therapy of JRA.

Leflunomide  is  a  DMARD  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adult  RA.  Leflunomide  is  an  isoxazole immunomodulatory agent with a unique mechanism of action. It inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis by reversibly blocking the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, resulting in antiproliferative effects on activated lymphocytes important in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases like RA.

Due to the similarities between APC-JRA and adult RA, it was anticipated that patients with APC-JRA might  also  benefit  from  treatment  with  leflunomide.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  has therefore completed clinical trials to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy profile of leflunomide in the treatment of APC-JRA in paediatric population between the ages of 3 and 17 years.

Please  note  that  according  to  the  concept  paper  from  the  CHMP  on  points  to  consider  on  clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of JIA, issued on 26 February 2004 (CPMP/EWP/422/04), the terms juvenile chronic arthritis and JRA have been replaced by JIA. However, as the clinical program with leflunomide in children with JRA was initiated prior to this paper, all of the documentation of this dossier refers to JRA instead of JIA.

For this application the following (concept) guidelines are applicable: concept paper from the CHMP on points to consider on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of JIA, issued on 47-2005  (CPMP/EWP/422/04),  and  ICH  Topic  E11  Clinical  investigations  of  medicinal  products  in  the paediatric population (CHMP/ICH/2711/99).

## Clinical aspects

A clinical program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of leflunomide in paediatric patients with APCJRA was implemented. Two studies ( HWA486/1037 and HWA486/3503 ) were conducted in children with JRA. Both studies were followed by an extension study to gather further data on the durability of efficacy over the long term. In addition, to assess efficacy and safety of leflunomide in this population, the pharmacokinetic of leflunomide and its active metabolite were assessed based on data collected from blood samples taken in both studies, and analysed collectively after completion of both studies. One of the objectives of the PPK (population pharmacokinetics) analysis was to determine appropriate dose recommendations for leflunomide use in the JRA population.

## Clinical efficacy

## Study design

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  HWA486/1037 ,  performed in children (6 to 17 years), was a Phase Ib, open label study in subjects with APC-JRA who had previously failed to respond to, or were intolerant of, MTX therapy. This  pilot  study  collected  preliminary  data  on  efficacy  and  improvement  (or  no  deterioration)  in physical  function  as  a  secondary  objective  in  order  to  determine  whether  therapy  with  leflunomide warranted further study in subjects with APC-JRA. The primary objective was to obtain PK and safety data on leflunomide. Study 1037 was 6 months in duration and was followed by an extension of 24 months (Study 1037x).

Study HWA486/3503 was a Phase III, randomised, double-dummy, double-blind study in children (3 to 17 years) performed in 32 study centres in the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Europe comparing  leflunomide  to  MTX  with  folic  acid  supplementation  in  subjects  naïve  to  both  MTX  and leflunomide. The design was used as the current US FDA regulations and ethical considerations do not permit placebo-controlled trials in children if there is a valid approved comparator (MTX, sulfasalazine and etanercept are all approved for the treatment of JRA in the US). Study 3503 was 4 months in duration and was followed by an extension of 8 months (Study 3504). The double-blind of study 3503 was maintained during the extension phase of Study 3504 (see table below).

Lef = leflunomide, Mtx = methotrexate, qd = every day, po = orally

1Proportional to a 100 mg/day dose for an adult with a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m². 2Proportional to a 10 mg/day dose for an adult with a BSA of 1.73 m²; from 8 weeks of therapy, the dose of leflunomide could be increased at the discretion of the investigator to the equivalent of 20 mg/day in a 1.73 m² adult.

All studies were conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP), as required by the ICH E6 Guideline for GCP, 1 May, 1996, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and standard operating procedures for clinical investigation and documentation in force at Aventis worldwide.

## Efficacy variables

The primary efficacy variable in both studies was the Definition of Improvement (DOI), a responder analysis  in  JRA  published  by  Giannini  et  al.  (1997).  A  subject  was  considered  a  responder  if  &gt;30% improvement (from baseline) occurred in &gt;3 of 6 variables, with no more than 30% worsening (from baseline) in any one variable. The 6 outcome measures used to calculate the DOI are as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Physician's global assessment of disease severity.
2. Subject or parent global assessment of overall well-being.
3. Physical function, using the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (CHAQDI).
4. Number of joints with active arthritis, as defined by ACR criteria.
5. Number of joints with limited range of motion (ROM) excluding sternoclavicular and sacroiliac joints.
6. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR).

A  second  primary  efficacy  variable  was  used  in  Study  3503/3504,  the  Percent  Improvement  Index (PII).  The  PII  was  defined  as  the  average  percentage  change  from  baseline  over  the  six  outcome measures  assessed.  In  the  event  that  the  mean  percent  change  was  positive  (=worsening)  the  % improvement was set to zero. 1

Secondary efficacy variables included mean changes in the 6 individual components of the DOI (and PII in 3503/3504) as well as:

## 3503/3504

-  Swollen joint count defined as inflamed joints with synovial thickness and/or effusions, without ankylosis1.
-  Joint severity score, as the sum of:
-  all joints with swelling (62 joints     assessed),
-  pain on motion (71 joints assessed),
-  tenderness (71 joints assessed),
-  limitation of motion (67 joints assessed).

1 62 joints were assessed for swelling excluding the hip, subtalar, sacroiliac, lumbar spine, thoracic spine, and cervical spine.

## Statistics

Efficacy  was  assessed  in  both  studies  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  defined  as  all  subjects enrolled who received at least one dose of study drug with one post baseline assessment. Where there were missing  data  the  Last  Observation  Carried  Forward  (LOCF)  procedure  was  applied.  Supportive efficacy was assessed in the extension cohort of Study 1037x for the extension phase months 6 to 30. Due to the small sample size and open label treatment in Study 1037, it was prospectively defined that formal statistical testing of the safety and efficacy data would not be performed. The primary endpoint for this study was at the end of the 6-month treatment period (26 weeks). The efficacy data from the extension phase are presented and summarised as supporting efficacy information.

The primary efficacy analysis in Study 3503 evaluated PII and DOI ≥ 30% at Week 16 and evaluated the durability of efficacy in the extension subjects from Week 16 to Week 48 of treatment (Week 0 to Week 32 of the extension) in its extension study 3504.

Initially the study was designed as an equivalence study with one primary endpoint the PII. There where two major amendments from a methodological perspective. Following discussion with the FDA, the JRA DOI 30% responder rate became a co-primary endpoint (amendment 4, 30-05-2002) and the study was converted from an equivalence study to a superiority study (amendment 6 initiated 09-042003) after which the last patients entered the study at 28-05-2003).

1 As part of a sensitivity analysis additional definitions of  % Improvement were explored incorporating patients with &lt; 30% worsening , with &lt;100% worsening and any change. Results were robust (data not shown).

-  C-reactive protein (CRP)
-  Subject/parent assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary hypothesis was that there where treatment difference between leflunomide and MTX in the  primary  endpoints.  In  the  event  that  superiority  was  not  achieved  with  respect  to  the  PII  noninferiority was opted for with a non-inferiority margin of 12.5%.

A  sample  size  of  37  subjects  per  group  was  calculated  as  necessary  to  observe  a  difference  in  the mean  PII  of  15%  or  greater,  with  a  standard  deviation  of  23%  (power  0.80).  In  the  event  that superiority was not achieved with respect to the % Improvement Index, then non-inferiority was to be claimed as indicated in the original protocol, i.e. when the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of mean difference for the % Improvement Index is greater than or equal to -12.5%.

The between-group comparisons conducted at Week 16 as well as at Week 48 of treatment (extension Week 32), and for each visit since the start of study treatment in Study 3503, used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment and site (pooled) as fixed effects for the PII, and the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel procedure controlling for site (pooled) for the JRA DOI ≥ 30%, responder rates.

To assess durability of efficacy, a within-group comparison of mean values at Week 16 versus Week 48 (study  end-point)  of  treatment  and  other  time-points  (secondary  efficacy  analysis)  was  conducted using ANOVA, with visit and subject as fixed effects, for the PII, and a McNemar test for the responder rates.

Subgroup  analyses  were  predefined  in  Study  3503  to  investigate  the  consistency  of  effect  across various subgroups. Subgroups concerned age, sex, race, duration of JRA, baseline swollen joint count and  endpoint  dose.  For  the  PII,  ANOVA  was  used  with  treatment,  centre,  background  variable  and treatment by background variable interaction as fixed effects. For the JAR DOI responders a logistic regression was used for the same covariates.

## Results

## Dose response studies

Results of the  population pharmacokinetics (PPK) analysis were used to determine appropriate dose recommendations for leflunomide use in the JRA population (see section 2.3 'Pharmacokinetics'). The optimal daily dose of leflunomide based on body weight is shown in table 3:

Table 3

| BodyWeight(kg)   |   DailyDose(mg) |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 10.0 -19.9       |              10 |
| 20.0 - 40.0      |              15 |
| >40.0            |              20 |

Nevertheless, only 5 and 10 mg regimens have been clinically tested (10 mg every other day for children under 20 kg and 10 mg per day for children between 20 and 40 kg).

Lef = leflunomide, Mtx = methotrexate

· 2 subjects in the methotrexate group that entered the 3504 extension study and took 3504 study medication, did not have any efficacy assessments and were excluded from the efficacy evaluable population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the small number of subjects remaining in the 1037 extension study by the time any subjects had completed 130 weeks of treatment, the study was ended before all remaining subjects had the opportunity to complete 130 weeks of treatment. At that time, 3 (17.7%) subjects had completed 130 weeks  and  the  6  (35.3%)  others  still  remaining  had  not.  During  the  extension  phase,  8  (47.1%) subjects withdrew (5 lack of efficacy, 1 adverse event and 2 for other reasons).

Sixteen subjects who completed Study 3503 did not enrol in extension Study 3504 (9 leflunomide and 7 MTX subjects). During the extension phase, 15 of the 70 subjects withdrew, the reasons for which were  lack  of  efficacy  (5  leflunomide,  0  MTX),  an  adverse  event  (1  leflunomide,  5  MTX),  withdrew consent  (1  leflunomide,  1  MTX),  progression  of  disease  (1  leflunomide,  0  MTX)  and  other  reasons (1 leflunomide, 0 MTX).

## Baseline characteristics

All 27 subjects in Study 1037 had APC-JRA and had failed MTX therapy (15 due to lack of efficacy and 12 as a result of intolerance) and all 94 subjects in Study 3503 were MTX naïve at the start of the study (see further, table). Mean age in study 1037 was 12.3 yrs in the Leflunomide group (85% female) and 13.3 yrs in the MTX group (83% female) and in study 3503 10.1 yrs in the Leflunomide group (75% female) and 10.2 yrs in the MTX group (72% female).

In  Study  1037,  the  pattern  of  disease  at  onset  of  JRA  in  the  ITT  subjects  was  polyarticular  in 19, pauciarticular in 6, and systemic in 2 subjects. Eight subjects were RF+. Mean disease duration was 7.0 years. Concomitant medications included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in 22 (81.5%), corticosteroids in 18 (66.7%) and both in 16 (59.3%) subjects.

Subjects in Study 3503 were required to have polyarticular course JRA at baseline. The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had polyarticular JRA at onset of disease. Ten subjects were RF+. The mean disease duration was approximately 1.5 years with a median duration of 0.33 years, and all but       6 subjects were DMARD-naïve.

Mean baseline  levels  for  physician's  global  assessment  of  disease  severity,  subject  or  parent  global assessment of overall well-being, CHAQDI, number of joints with active arthritis, number of joints with limited ROM and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were in study 1037 5.58, 4.37, 1.33, 14.85, 20.59, 43.54, respectively. The baseline levels of these measures in study 3503 were summarized in table 5:

## Treatment duration and exposure

In study 1037, mean duration of leflunomide therapy was 22 weeks (1 to 30 weeks). Mean loading dose was 79.63 mg and mean maintenance dose 12.22 mg. The dose of study drug was increased in 20 subjects (74.1%). In 2 subjects subsequent dose reductions were required due to adverse events. Over the 130 weeks of treatment in the extension Study 1037x, the extension cohort was exposed to leflunomide  for  a  mean  duration  of  95.9  weeks.  The  treatment  exposure  to  leflunomide  in  the extension cohort over the entire 30 month study period was 31.2 patient years.

In  study  3503,  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  groups  in  mean  study  duration  or drug exposure. Leflunomide dose was reduced in 1 subject (adverse event) and MTX dose was reduced

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in            2  subjects  (1  due  to  adverse  event)  while  the  MTX  dose  was  increased  in  1  subject  and leflunomide placebo dose increased in 1 subject.

Over the 48 weeks of treatment in the extension Study 3504, the duration of exposure to study medication in the extension population was comparable between the treatment groups. The largest proportion of extension subjects received study medication for 337 to 364 days in both treatment groups.

## Primary efficacy

In study 1037, one-third of subjects in the ITT efficacy analysis were responders at week 4 (9/27) and week 8 (10/27). These results increased to 14/27 or 51.9% at Week 12, the maximum response rate, which was sustained through Week 26 (see figure below).

Figure 1. DOl &gt;30% Over Time: ITT (n=27), LOCF

<!-- image -->

Although 14 subjects were DOI &gt;30% responders after 26 weeks of therapy using LOCF, 17 subjects entered the extension phase. Thirteen of the 17 subjects who entered the extension phase were responders at Week 26. During the long-term extension of Study 1037, DOI response rates were maintained in the 17 subjects who entered this phase of the study. After 30 months of treatment, 52.9% of subjects reached the target of a DOI response of 30%. No additional subjects withdrew for lack of efficacy during the extension.

In study 3505, two primary efficacy outcome variables were assessed, DOI response rates at 30% and PII.  Improvement  occurred  with  subjects  achieving  a  DOI  of  30%  response  after  approximately  2 months  and  remaining  responders  thereafter.  At  endpoint,  after  16  weeks  of  treatment,  a  DOI response of 30% had been achieved in 89.4% of MTX subjects and 68.1% of leflunomide subjects and the adjusted mean improvement in the PII was -44.4% in the leflunomide group and -52.9% in the MTX group (see table below). The difference in response rates was statistically significant in favour of MTX for the DOI ≥ 30% (p=0.02), but not for the PII (p=0.18). One patient in each treatment arm discontinued the study for lack of efficacy. The DOI ≥ 30% responder rate and the PII achieved at Week  16  were  maintained  in  both  treatment  groups  throughout  the  extension  Study  3504  but  the difference between treatment groups for DOI ≥ 30% was no longer statistically significant in the Study 3504 efficacy evaluable population at endpoint (Week 48) of the extension (p=0.15).

Data  assessed  as  a  function  of  age  and  weight  for  both  efficacy  outcome  measures  in  Study  3503 demonstrated no statistically significant difference in effect size between the two treatment arms for any  of  the  subgroups.  The  data  indicate  that  age  and  body  weight  had  an  effect  on  the  response. Younger (&lt;12 years), lighter (&lt;20 kg) subjects showed a better response in the MTX group compared to  the  leflunomide  group than older, heavier subjects, indicating that younger, lighter children were not  responding  as  well  to  the  leflunomide  treatment  as  their  older,  heavier  counterparts.  This  is consistent with the results of the PPK analysis, which demonstrated that the mean exposure to M1 (the primary metabolite) obtained in responders was about 59% greater than what was achieved in those children    &lt;20 kg, suggesting that the doses administered to subjects who weighed &lt;20 kg may have resulted in less efficacious plasma concentrations (see table 8 below).

## Secondary efficacy

In Study 1037, improvements were observed in all secondary outcome variables with the exception of the number of joints with reduced mobility (see table below). Improvements were observed from Week 4 and sustained throughout the 26-week treatment period. During the 30-month extension, most of these parameters continued to improve, and a reduction in the number of joints with limited mobility was seen after a total of thirty months' treatment.

In  Study  3503,  improvements  were  observed  in  all  the  secondary  outcome  variables  in  both  the leflunomide and MTX groups (see table below). The time to achieve a response during Study 3503 was similar in the 2 treatment groups, with a median time to reach a DOI ≥ 30% response of 52 days in the leflunomide groups and 56 days in the MTX group. The improvements achieved after 4 months of treatment in Study 3503 were sustained over the course of the long-term extension Study 3504, and subjects continued to improve over the following 8 months of treatment: by Week 48 of treatment an additional 1 leflunomide subject had achieved a DOI response of 50% and an additional 6 leflunomide subjects and 4 MTX subjects achieved a response rate of 70%. No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 treatment groups at any of the time points for any secondary variable during the extension Study 3054.

## Subgroup analysis

Regarding the following issues, the MAH did additional subgroup analysis to investigate:

-  The influence of corticosteroids on efficacy results for the percent improvement index (PII) and the Definition of Improvement 30% (JRA DOI 30%) variables,
-  The influence of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) positivity/negativity on efficacy results for the PII and the JRA DOI 30% parameters,
-  The  response  rate  of  JRA  patients  treated  with  placebo  in  different  placebo-controlled studies.

Concerning studies HWA486/3503 (4-month study) and HWA486/3504 (8-month study), on basis of these subgroups it was concluded that differences in mean PII parameter and JRA DOI 30% between leflunomide and MTX are consistent across levels of each subgroup. There was no evidence that the durability of response was different by level of each subgroup variable.

A summarise of the placebo effect observed in different placebo-controlled clinical studies conducted in JRA population to test MTX, sulfasalazine or etanercept was presented. The magnitude of the placebo effect in the different studies ranged from 16 to 36% and magnitude of effect of active controls was for etanercept 1 80 %, MTX 2  48% and sulphasalazine 3  44%.

## 2.1 Clinical safety

This  overview  discusses  all  adverse  events  that  were  treatment-emergent  (TEAEs),  i.e.  were  not present at baseline and occurred on treatment or during the post-treatment follow-up period; or, if present at baseline, worsened during treatment or the follow-up period. The safety data from study 1037  and  its  long-term  extension  (a  total  of  30  months  of  treatment)  were  combined  for  a  single analysis,  whereas  separate  analyses  were  performed  for  the  data  from  study  3503  (4  months  of treatment) and its extension (study 3504, 8 months of treatment).

The safety population in study 1037 comprised all 27 subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. During the 6-month treatment period, this safety population was exposed to study drug for a mean duration of 22 weeks or 154.3 days and 88.8% of subjects received study drug &gt;85 days. Seventeen subjects participated in the extension phase (extension cohort) and received at least one dose of study drug. During the entire 30-month study, the extension cohort was exposed to study drug for a mean duration of 95.9 weeks or 671.12 days and 82.4% received study drug &gt;518 days. In study 3503, there were 94 subjects in the safety population, 47 subjects in each treatment group. During  the  4-month  treatment  period,  mean  exposure  was  115  days  in  the  leflunomide  group  and 116 days in the MTX group. There were 70 subjects in the safety population of the extension Study 3504, 33 leflunomide subjects and 37 MTX subjects. During the entire 12 months of treatment, the mean duration of exposure to study drug was 338 days in the leflunomide group and 349 days in the MTX group.

The majority of subjects (&gt;80%) reported at least 1 TEAE in each of the studies, regardless of the treatment assignment (see table 11).

A similar pattern was observed in leflunomide subjects in study 3503. However, the frequency of individual adverse events was systematically lower than in the previous study, which is to be expected due to the longer duration of study 1037. The nature and frequency of adverse events reported in subjects receiving MTX was very similar, although the incidence of headache and alopecia was somewhat lower. Possibly-related TEAEs were reported in 69.8% (30/43) of leflunomide subjects and 55.3% (21/38) of MTX subjects. During the long-term extension (study 3504), the pattern and frequency of adverse events were essentially comparable to those seen in study 3503 (see table 12).

## Serious AEs

Thirteen serious AEs were reported in 7 (26.0%) subjects in study 1037 and its extension, one of which (JRA flare) occurred prior to receiving leflunomide. Two of the serious TEAEs (possible gastritis and anemia) occurred in 2 subjects during the first 26 weeks of therapy and the remaining 10 serious TEAEs in 5 subjects during the extension phase. The events were classified as serious because they were considered medically important and/or they required hospitalization. Five of the events were considered possibly related to study drug, and all 13 events resolved.

In study 3503, 11 serious TEAEs were reported in 10 leflunomide subjects and no MTX subjects reported a serious TEAE. The majority of the serious TEAEs were not considered possibly related to treatment and of mild or moderate intensity. Three subjects discontinued treatment as a result of the serious adverse event. All serious TEAEs apart from the cases of Crohn's disease and pytiriasis resolved during the study period. During the extension Study 3504, 5 serious TEAEs were reported in 4 leflunomide subjects. One of these (colitis) was considered possibly treatment-related and led to treatment discontinuation. In addition, 16 serious TEAEs were reported in 9 MTX subjects. In 4 of these subjects, including 3 cases of transaminase elevations, the events were considered to be treatment-related.

No deaths, malignancies, or pregnancies were reported in any of the studies. In Study 3503, overdoses were reported in 1 leflunomide subject (use of a 20 mg maintenance dose rather than 10 mg), and 1 methotrexate subject (unplanned ingestion of 22.5 mg). None of these overdoses were associated with the occurrence of adverse events.

## Transaminase elevations and liver function

In study 1037, 6 (22.2%) subjects presented clinically significant elevations (&gt;1.2 x ULN) in alanine transaminase  (ALT),  aspartate  transaminase  (AST)  or  both,  4  of  which  were  reported  as  adverse events and 1 of which was serious.

In study 3503, elevated transaminases were reported in 7 (14.9%) leflunomide subjects compared to 15  (31.9%)  MTX  subjects.  Four  cases  in  each  group  were  reported  as  AEs.  Transaminase  levels

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

normalized by the end of the study in 4 leflunomide subjects and in 11 MTX subjects, and remained above 2 x ULN in only 1 subject in each treatment group.

In  the  extension  study  3504,  the  incidence  of  elevated  transaminases  was  lower  in  the  leflunomide treatment group (5 subjects, 15.2%)  compared to the MTX group (11 subjects, 29.7%). Moreover, transaminase levels in all the leflunomide subjects remained below 2 x ULN, whereas 5 MTX subjects reported  ALT  levels  above  this  limit,  including  1  subject  with  an  elevation  &gt;8  x  ULN.  For  3  of  the methotrexate subjects, transaminase elevations were considered serious adverse events and treatment was  discontinued.  In  all  of  the  leflunomide  patients  (5/5)  and  9  of  the  11  methotrexate  subjects, transaminase levels subsequently normalized.

## Pharmacokinetics

Two studies ( HWA486/1037 and HWA486/3503 ) were conducted in children with JRA. Both studies were followed by an extension study to gather further data on the durability of efficacy over the long term. In addition, to assess efficacy and safety of leflunomide in this population, the pharmacokinetic ( PK)  of  leflunomide  and  its  active  metabolite  were  assessed  based  on  data  collected  from  blood samples taken in both studies, and analyzed collectively after completion of both studies. One of the objectives  of  the  population  pharmacokinetics  (PPK)  analysis  was  to  determine  appropriate dose recommendations for leflunomide use in the JRA population.

The objectives of study 1037 were to determine whether therapy with leflunomide warranted further study in subjects with polyarticular course JRA by primarily obtaining pharmacokinetic and safety data and secondarily obtaining preliminary efficacy and functional data in a small group of subjects. As a pilot  study  the  dose  selection  in  study  1037  was  based  on  the  target  M1  concentration  range  from adult experience and pharmacokinetic parameters scaled by body surface area. A population PK model was  developed  to  describe  the  data  and  the  relationship  between  the  estimated  pharmacokinetic parameters and demographic data in the JRA patient population. A simplified leflunomide dose regimen according to specific body weight categories was derived for study 3503.

Study 1037 was an open-label, non-controlled, multi-center, Phase IB study over a 6-month treatment period with up to a 24-month extension phase. Study 3503 was a randomised, double blind, parallel group, 16-week treatment trial comparing leflunomide to methotrexate, in pediatric subjects with polyarticular course JRA who were DMARD-therapy naïve.

Study  1037  was  conducted  in  pediatric  subjects  (aged  3-17  year)  with  active,  polyarticular  course juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis  who  had  previously  failed  or  were  intolerant  of  methotrexate  therapy. Eligible subjects for study 3503 were pediatric patients 3 to 17 years of age with active, polyarticular course  JRA,  irrespective  of  onset  type,  who  were  naïve  to  treatment  with  either  leflunomide  or methotrexate.

In  study  1037,  leflunomide  was  administered  orally  according  to  the  following  algorithm:  a  loading dose for 3 days according to body surface area (BSA) measured in square meters (m 2 ) based on the labeled  adult  loading  dose  of  100  mg/day  for  3  days  and  an  average  adult  BSA  of  1.73  m 2 ; maintenance doses were calculated based on a low adult dose of 10 mg/day and an average adult BSA of 1.73 m 2 . In subjects without clinical response on or after 8 weeks (based on Definition of Improvement [DOI]  responder  analysis  for  JRA  subjects  published  by  Giannini  et  al  [1997])  escalation  to  the equivalent  of  leflunomide  20  mg/day  per  1.73  m 2   BSA  was  allowed,  at  the  discretion  of  the investigator. A more simplified treatment regimen was developed for study 3503 based on the results of  study  1037.  Loading  doses  (some  multiple  of  100  mg  tablets)  and  maintenance  doses  (some multiple of 10 mg tablets) were assigned based on actual body weight as described in table PK 1.

## Table PK 1.

| Actual Body Weight (kg)   | Loading Dose                           | Maintenance Dose            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| < 20 20 - 40 >40          | 100 mg QDx 1 100 mg QDx 2 100 mg QDx 3 | 10 mg QOD 10 mg QD 20 mg QD |

In study 1037 blood samples were collected from each subject at baseline (prior to beginning study treatment),  day  3  (last  day  of  the  loading  dose),  weeks  4,  12,  and  26  during  the  initial  6-month treatment phase. On day 3, weeks 4, 12, and 26, serial assessments (5 samples) were made at each visit.  In  addition,  single  samples  were  to  be  collected  on  several  pre-specified  occasions.  In  study 3503, two blood samples were obtained for determination of leflunomide, M1 (the primary metabolite),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and TFMA (4-trifluoromethylaniline, a minor metabolite) concentrations in plasma at each of the study visits for weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. An effort was made to collect absorption and elimination phase samples from each subject during the study. Fixed sampling times were not specified.

Nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM) methods were applied to analyse the pooled data of the two studies. Only the M1 levels were used in the PPK modeling and the population mean and the variances of the pharmacokinetic parameters of M1 were obtained. The covariates including body surface area (BSA), body weight (WT), AGE, and SEX were tested to determine their influence on the PK of M1. Apparent oral total clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and input rate constant (ka) were estimated for each individual subject by using the POSTHOC Bayesian approach based on the final optimal population model and individual specific PK information. The half-life of the apparent terminal disposition phase (t1/2) was to be calculated from the CL and V.

The pharmacostatistical models were fitted to the data by the first order conditional estimation method (FOCE) with interaction. The NONMEM stepwise regressions were applied to determine the impact of the  covariates  including  BSA,  WT,  AGE  and  SEX  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  M1.  The  final  optimal model  selected  was  evaluated  by  goodness-of-fit  plots,  cross-study  comparisons,  and  a  predictive check.

The PK evaluable population consisted of 73 subjects (27 subjects in study 1037 and 46 subjects in study 3503). Of these, 57 subjects were female and 16 were male, with ages ranging from 3 to 17 years. The weight ranged from 13 to 75 kg and the body surface area (BSA) from 0.56 to 1.83 m 2 . A total of 674 observations were included in the PPK database. Of these, 493 observations were collected from study 1037 and 181 from study 3503. The number of observations per subject ranged from 1 to 23, with an average of 9.2 observations per subject. By comparison, more sparse PK samples were collected in study 3503 (mean: 3.9 observations per subject) than those in study 1037 (mean: 18.3 observations per subject). In study 1037 only M1 plasma levels were determined, while in study 3503, plasma  levels  of  parent  could  not  be  detected  in  any  subject  and  only  low  TFMA  levels  could  be detected in some subjects.

M1 disposition was well described by a one-compartment model with first order input. Inter-subject variability  was  described  by  an  exponential  error  model  on  the  structural  PK  parameters,  while  the residual variability was described by a proportional error model.

The population PK parameters estimates of the final 'optimal' model are summarised in table PK 2, and the descriptive individual Bayesian Posthoc pharmacokinetic parameter estimated of the final model in table PK 3.

According to the final 'optimal' model with WT as the sole covariate, the CL/F and V/F were estimated to be 0.020 l/h and 5.8 l, respectively, in a typical pediatric patient with a body weight of 40 kg. Administration of 20 mg leflunomide daily to the typical 40 kg pediatric patient would produce the following steady-state M1 concentration-time profile:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Steady-State M1 Concentration-Time Profile in a Typical 40 kg Pediatric Patient Administered 20 mg Daily

<!-- image -->

The  NONMEM stepwise  regression  revealed  that  CL/F  was  weakly  correlated  with  body  size  (WT  or BSA),  and  V/F  was  strongly  correlated  with  body  size  (see  figures  below).  Sex  or  age  was  not  a significant covariate once body size was taken into consideration. A rather weak correlation between the t1/2 of M1 and WT is demonstrated, indicating that the dosing interval of leflunomide should remain 24 hours for the pediatric population.

## Relationships Between Clearance and Body Weight (left panel) and Volume of Distribution and BodyWeight (rightpanel)

<!-- image -->

The difference in CL/F between the two extremes of body weight (70 and 14 kg, respectively) is approximately 50%, indicating that reduction of the maintenance dose by one half is only needed for pediatric patients weighing approximately 14 kg or less.

Results of a CL/F by weight evaluation of the PPK data demonstrated that pediatric APC-JRA patients with body weights &lt;40 kg have a reduced clearance (CL) of M1 compared to those &gt;40 kg (see table PK 3).

Previous obtained data in adults indicated that median values for Cl/F, Css and body weight in a total of 1171 adult patients with RA (Phase II and III combined data) were 0.024 l/h, 34 µg/ml and 70 kg, respectively. Based upon the final model obtained in this PPK analysis a Cl/F of 0.0254 l/h was predicted for a person weighing 70 kg. The relationship between Cl/F and WT in the JRA population (n=73) and adult RA patients (n=1171) is depicted in the figure below.

## Individual Bayesian POSTHOC Estimates of CL/F Versus Body Weight

<!-- image -->

As  body  size  and  V/F  is  strongly  correlated,  in  case  a  loading  dose  is  administered,  this  should  be adjusted for pediatric patients. However as a loading dose has been associated with acute tolerability problems, a loading dose is not recommended in pediatrics.

The  figure  below  shows  the  typical  Css  (middle  line)  and  the  95%  prediction  interval  (outer  lines) plotted against body weight (WT) after doses of 10, 15 and 20 mg, respectively, from left to right. Targeting a median Css of 34 µg/ml for all pediatric patients on average, a dose of 10 mg daily should be  recommended  for  pediatric  patients  weighing  10  to  20  kg,  15  mg  daily  for  pediatric  patients weighing        20  to  40  kg,  and  20  mg  daily  for  those  weighing  &gt;40  to  80  kg.  If  the  above  refined leflunomide dose recommendations for pediatrics were applied, the Css, as indicated by open circles in the  figure,  in  the  vast  majority  of  the  73  JRA  patients  would  have  fallen  within  the  95%  prediction interval with a median of approximately 34 µ/ml.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Predicted Cs for Refined Leflunomide Dose Recommendations Using the Inter-Subject Variability EstimateforClearance

<!-- image -->

To test the validity of recommending these doses, a simulation of 2000 replicate 'patients' was made by adding a random term (exp( ή i)) to the relationship for Cl and weight:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where WT had a uniform distribution from 10 to 80 kg, and ή i had a normal distribution with a mean of zero and an SD of 0.5. The Css was calculated by assigning a dose of 10 mg for subjects weighing 10 to

20 kg, 15 mg for subjects weighing 20 to 40 kg, and 20 mg daily for subjects weighing &gt;40 to 80 kg. The dosing interval in all weight groups was specified to be 24 hours.

The  left  box-whisker  plots  below  show  that  the  Css  for  M1  in  the  JRA  population  using  the  refined regimens are successful in achieving similar M1 exposures as they lie within the range of M1 exposures observed in adult RA patients. However in the right panel, the leflunomide regimens investigated in study 3503 clearly were not equivalent for exposure to M1 across the three weight groups. Only the 20 mg daily maintenance dose administered to pediatric subjects weighing &gt; 40 kg achieved systemic exposures comparable to those observed in adults. Consequently, the leflunomide doses prescribed for subjects &lt; 20 kg and between 20 and 40 kg were possibly too low in study 3503.

Among the 47 subjects treated with leflunomide in study 3503, 32 were categorised as responders, as measured  by  DOI&gt;30%,  and  15  were  categorized  as  non-responders  when  assessed  following  16 weeks of treatment. To examine whether the non-responders had lower exposures to M1 and were possibly also in the lower weight groups (therefore under-dosed), the model-predicted Css based on the  regimens  of  study  3503  and  individual  body  weights  were  separately  plotted  against  response status (i.e., responder or non-responder), one of the co-primary efficacy endpoints in study 3503.

Total number of subjects is 47.The CL/F value for Subject 1103001 who provided no M1 concentration data was calculated based onherbodyweight.

The left panel reveals a clear trend for lower exposures in the group of subjects who failed to respond to leflunomide. The majority of subjects (80%) in the non-responder group had exposures to M1 that were less than the median exposure in the responder group. The right panel revealed a similar but less pronounced trend for the non-responders to be those subjects in the lower weight groups. The observation that the leflunomide doses studied in the subjects who weighed less than 40 kg were suboptimal appears to be supported both on PK and efficacy grounds.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, based upon the results of the population pharmacokinetics, a leflunomide target Css of 34 µg/ml was obtained in pediatrics by a dose of 10 mg for subjects weighing 10 to 20 kg, 15 mg for subjects weighing 20 to 40 kg, and 20 mg daily for subjects weighing &gt;40 to 80 kg.

## Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment

The MAH has submitted data from two studies conducted in children with JRA. Study HWA486/1037 was  a  Phase  Ib,  open  label  study  in  subjects  who  had  previously  failed  to  respond  to,  or  were intolerant of, MTX therapy. Study HWA486/3503 was a Phase III, randomised, double-dummy, doubleblind study comparing leflunomide to MTX in subjects naïve to both MTX and leflunomide. Both studies were followed by an extension study to gather further data on the durability of efficacy over the long term.

Taking into account previous studies conducted in children, and the concept paper from the CHMP on points to consider on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of JIA (CPMP/EWP/422/04)  studies  HWA486/1037  and  HWA486/3503  were  well  designed  and  adequate outcome measures were used.

The consequence of the changing from equivalence study to a superiority study was that the sample size was re-adjusted from 240 subjects to 90 subjects. A justification of this amendment was not given but  it  appears  there  was  a  wish  to  stop  the  trial  (over  March  2002-  May  2003,  94  subjects  were recruited  whereas  another  1-2  year  would  be  needed  to  recruit  up  to  240  subjects  in  case  noninferiority  was  opted  for).  However,  there  was  no  mentioning  in  the  amendment  that  in  the  event superiority  was  not  observed,  non-inferiority  was  opted  for  only  in  the  study  report.  Further  the extrapolation of the 12.5% non-inferiority margin of percentage change is questionable and at least would have needed a justification.

However these major methodological flaws are overruled by the results. MTX seems to be superior to lelflunomide after 16 weeks treatment and non-inferiority for leflunomide has not been demonstrated. The CHMP did not raise an objection in this respect. The methods of analyses are agreed by CHMP.

A  well  established  and  extensive  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  carried  out.  The  results indicate that leflunomide Cl/F by weight evaluation that pediatric APC-JRA patients with body weights &lt; 40 kg have a reduced clearance (CL) of M1 compared to those &gt;40 kg. A dose reduction in these subjects  seems  necessary  to  obtain  a  similar  exposure/steady  state  concentration.    The  population pharmacokinetics  analysis  indicate  that  a  leflunomide  target  Css  of  34  µg/ml  (similar  to  the  Css observed  in  the  adult  population)  will  be  obtained  in  pediatrics  by  a  dose  of  10  mg  for  subjects weighing 10 to 20 kg, 15 mg for subjects weighing 20 to 40 kg, and 20 mg daily for subjects weighing &gt; 40 to 80 kg.

Following the concept paper from the CHMP on points to consider on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of JIA (CPMP/EWP/422/04), dose section should be based on recommended dose in adults of an appropriate pharmacokinetic parameter, most commonly AUC for chronic dosing. Subsequently, well planned dose ranging studies should be carried out before the confirmatory clinical trials are undertaken. However, the guideline ICH Topic E11 Clinical investigations of medicinal products in the paediatric population (CHMP/ICH/2711/99) indicates that when the medicinal product is to be used in the paediatric population for the same indication as those studied and approved in adults, the disease process is similar in adults and paediatric patients, in such cases pharmacokinetic studies in paediatric patients together with safety studies may provide adequate information for use by allowing selection of paediatric doses that will produce blood levels similar to those observed in adults. In the case of leflunomide in children with JCA, no formal dose finding studies were conducted but on basis of PK analysis 5 and 10 mg regimens have been clinically tested. This approach is considered to be sufficient because active polyarticular course JRA is widely regarded as the paediatric equivalent to adult RA. But on basis of the results of the population PK analysis the chosen doses appeared to be too low to achieve similar Css as observed in adults.

Disease characteristics at baseline were similar between the groups and the included patients describe a moderate to severe disease activity.

The  subjects  continuing  in  study  3504  from  subjects  completing  study  3503,  20%  did  not  entered study 3504. No conclusion with respect to equal efficacy can be drawn.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  two  studies  suggest  some  effect  of  leflunomide  in  the  treatment  of  JRA  in  children  who  have intolerance for  MTX or who are MTX naïve, however, placebo controlled studies are lacking and the efficacy  of  lelfunomide  was  lower  than  that  for  MTX.  After  16  weeks  treatment,  the  difference  in response rates was statistically significant in favour of MTX for the DOI ≥ 30% (p=0.02), but not for the PII (p=0.18). The DOI ≥ 30% responder rate and the PII achieved at Week 16 were maintained in both  treatment  groups  throughout  the  extension  study  3504  but  the  difference  between  treatment groups  for  DOI ≥ 30%  was  no  longer  statistically  significant  in  study  3504  efficacy  evaluable population at endpoint (Week 48) of the extension (p=0.15). The difference in efficacy favouring MTX was particularly noticeable in lighter ( ≤ 40 kg) and younger (&lt;12 years) subjects. Based on the fact that  the  M1  concentration  was  lower  in  subjects ≤ 40  kg,  it  seems  that  the  lighter  subjects  were under-dosed compared to subjects &gt; 40 kg.

Taking into account that the numbers of patients that used oral corticosteroids treatments or that had a  positive  rheumatoid  factor  in  each  study  were  small,  based  on  subgroup  analyses  it  seems  that neither the corticosteroid co-medications nor the presence of RF influenced the efficacy outcomes in study 3503 and its extension study 3504.

Although it seems  that response rates observed in leflunomide treated patients are higher in comparison  to the  response  rate  values  observed  in  placebo-treated  patients,  values  of  placebo effects obtained from previously conducted clinical studies cannot replace a head to head comparison in a clinical trial designed to compare leflunomide vs. placebo.

The pattern of adverse events of leflunomide and MTX seems to be similar. However, it is seems that lighter subjects (the proportion of leflunomide subjects weighing &lt;40 kg was 15% larger than those weighing  &gt;40  kg)  were  under-dosed  (compared  to  subjects  &gt;40kg)  due  to  the  fact  that  the  M1 concentration was lower in subjects ≤ 40 kg, and, therefore, this may also have influenced the safety data.

Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy for Arava conducted in patients with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis and comparing the safety and efficacy of leflunomide with that of MTX, the CHMP concluded  that  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Arava  in  patients  under  18  years  age  group  was  not established.
