## I. INTRODUCTION

The MAH has submitted a completed paediatric study for Zerit (stavudine) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use.

Zerit EMA/539978/2013

A short critical expert overview has also been provided. The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  study  does  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for  Zerit (stavudine) and that there is no consequential regulatory action. The Rapporteur has asked for another presentation of the data given that it is difficult to draw overall conclusions from the presentation in the current submission. II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION II.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study Stavudine (BMY-27857; d4T) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) medications in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This was a long-term observational study of children who received NRTI during the perinatal and newborn period during the conduct of the MTCT Study AI455094. Therefore, no study medication was administered during Study AI455120. II.2 Clinical aspects II.2.1 Introduction The MAH submitted a final report for AI455120 was an observational study designed to provide longterm safety monitoring of infants who were born during the conduct of Study AI455094. The children were followed for late outcomes that might have been uniquely related to perinatal ARV interventions. Study AI455120 was a Phase 3b uncontrolled, observational study designed to provide long-term safety monitoring of infants who were born during the conduct of the AI455094 study at 1 study site in South Africa. The children were followed for late outcomes that might be uniquely related to perinatal ARV interventions. Two cohorts of children were evaluated: 1) those who were HIV negative and 2) those who were HIV positive at the final study visit in Study AI455094. The first assessment of data occurred when the children were 5 years of age, and was included in the first interim CSR.  The second interim CSR summarized the assessment and analysis of the data collected when all the children reached the age of 10 years. The second interim assessment was submitted to European Medicines Agency (EMA) in January 2011 and to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2011. The EMA and FDA concurred that Study AI455120 could be terminated, as it was unlikely to expose any additional safety signals not already evident after the 10year observational period. Consequently, this study was terminated, and the final CSR includes the final data on these children. Medicinal product no longer a

## Objectives

The primary objective was to describe and assess the long-term health and development of children who received ARV therapy in utero and during the newborn period for prophylaxis of mother-to-childtransmission of HIV during the conduct of the AI455094 study.

Zerit EMA/539978/2013

The secondary objective was to assess the occurrence of the following categories of medical events that have been identified in the literature and by Health Authorities as being of specific interest with respect to the long-term follow-up of NRTI-exposed neonates. Occurrences of these events are being assessed for the cohorts of HIV-negative and HIV-positive children. · Neurologic Events: including seizures, developmental delay, speech disorder, tremor, movement disorder, abnormal motor strength · Hepatic Events: events of clinical hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, or hepatomegaly · Pancreatic Events: events of pancreatitis · Metabolic Disorders: elevated blood lactate and elevated triglycerides; clinical diagnoses of diabetes mellitus · Hematologic Disorders: anemia, macrocytosis and neutropenia · Neoplastic Events: pathologically confirmed cases of benign and non-benign neoplasms; in addition, categories of benign lesions that are normally assessed and diagnosed by physical examination documentation alone · Other: cardiomyopathy and clinical syndrome of myopathy. Methodology All subjects evaluated annually, on or around their birth date. Yearly evaluations included physical (including neurologic) examinations; growth measurements; hospitalizations; Denver Development Tests (until 7 years of age); medical diagnoses; procedural/surgical interventions; concomitant medications; clinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistries); CD4 cell count; plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid for HIV-positive subjects, and HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-negative subjects. The following tests were to be conducted once by the age of 5 years, then whenever clinically indicated: audiometry; echocardiogram (ECHO); ophthalmic examinations (every 2 years for children receiving didanosine; and special chemistries (triglycerides, lipase, and lactic acid). Female subjects were to receive a pelvic examination annually when sexually active. Statistical Considerations For the final CSR, all analyses were descriptive, and were presented by cohorts (HIV positive and HIV negative).  Categorical variables were tabulated with counts and proportions. Continuous variables were summarized with univariate statistics. Medicinal product no longer a

Deaths

A total of 147 subjects who completed Study AI455094 were included in the database used for this final analysis (10 HIV positive and 137 HIV negative). Disposition is summarized in Table 5.1. The most common reason for discontinuation was lost to follow up. All 147 children enrolled were from South Africa, and all were Black. The mean age of the children was 4.8 years, with an even distribution of male and female subjects. Ten subjects were HIV positive. Overall exposure to ARVs in Study AI455094 is summarized in Table 5.3. No study medication was administered during Study AI455120. Three subjects died (1 HIV-positive subject due to tuberculosis meningitis with increased intracranial pressure, 1 HIV-negative subject due to a motor vehicle accident, and 1 HIV-negative subject due to Zerit Medicinal product no longer a

natural causes). The first 2 deaths were reported in the first interim CSR when all children reached the age of 5 years.  The third death was reported in the final analysis. Subject AI455120-1-1284, a 10year-old HIV-negative boy with cerebral palsy, died in his sleep due to natural causes. No post-mortem was conducted, and no further information is available.

Medical Events Twenty-one children (14%) reporting medical events since they were enrolled in the study (Table 5.4 below and Appendix 12H of the AI455120 final CSR1). This total includes 1 HIV-negative subject (AI455120-1-1284) with cerebral palsy reported in the first interim analysis, who had subsequent convulsions in the second interim analysis, and whose death was reported in the final analysis. None of these medical events was likely related to NRTI therapy. Medicinal product no longer auth

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations No new safety issue associated with laboratory evaluation has been observed since the first interim analysis in 2005. Several subjects had Grade 3/4 laboratory data reported since the first interim analysis. These were transient elevations that were generally improved or normal on subsequent testing. Assessor's comment: Appropriate appendices from the CSR have been reviewed. Review was difficult, given that there is no easily obtained information noting the number of subjects for which information was available, and the number of results for subjects varied, from as few as 2 to as many as &lt; 10 Medicinal product no longer authorise

(depending on the type of test).   Abnormalities in haemoglobin/hematocrit were infrequent and only of 1-2 grade severity:  Abnormalities in white count indices were slightly more frequent with deviations in neutrophils and eosinophils predominating; abnormalities were of 1-2 grade severity.  Liver function abnormalities appear to be primarily of increased ALT and alkaline phosphatase at a greater frequency than increased AST.  Abnormalities (grade 1-2) of CPK were the most common chemistry findings (creatnine, urea, lipase).  Abnormalities of triglycerides and lactic acid were less frequent.  There was no consistent pattern of abnormalities that would indicate any relationship to exposure to stavudine.

Denver Development Test Zerit EMA/539978/2013

Vital signs and physical findings No new safety issue associated with blood pressure measurements, physical measurements, and physical examination results has been observed since the first interim analysis in 2005. Assessor's comments: The appropriate appendix from the CSR have been reviewed. Review was difficult, given that there is no easily obtained information noting the number of subjects for which information was available and the number of results for subjects varied. It is noted that the most common physical finding was cervical lymphadenopathy which did not appear to be persistent over several examinations. Neurologic Examinations Neurological examination results were normal except for 2 subjects: · Subject AI455120-1-1284 had increased reflexes, tone, and power. This subject has had cerebral palsy and convulsion episodes · Subject AI455120-1-1531 had depressed reflexes only on 1 neurological examination, and the subsequent neurological examinations were normal. Assessor's comment: The appropriate appendix from the CSR have been reviewed. Review was difficult, given that there is no easily obtained information noting the number of subjects for which information was available, and the number of results for subjects varied, Audiometic evaluations Audiometric evaluations were to be done at study entry and once at 5 years, and then repeated based on the results and the investigators' decisions. Four subjects had the audiometric evaluation repeated after the 5-year test: · Subject AI455120-1-1132 had a moderate conductive hearing loss · Subject AI455120-1-1218 had a moderately severe right sensorineural hearing loss · Subject AI455120-1-1510 had no significant hearing impairment · Subject AI455120-1-1325 had an initial conductive hearing loss that was not found at the second evaluation.

When all children had reached the age of 7 years, approximately half of them had a suspect result on at least 1 of the individual components of the Denver Developmental Test, and the most common suspect results were in the language test.

Assessor's comment:  The appropriate appendix from the CSR have been reviewed.   Review was difficult, given that there is no easily obtained information noting the number of subjects for which information was available, and the number of results for subjects varied.   Individual components of the test were personal-social, fine motor, language, and gross motor.  MAH reporting of the results endorsed. Echocardiograms Echocardiograms were normal in almost all subjects, and no evidence of cardiomyopathy was observed in any child. Six of 7 subjects who had abnormal ECHO results at study entry had normal results on repeat testing; the results were unchanged in 1 subject who had a mild mitral valve prolapsed (AI455120-1-1008). Assessor's comment:  The appropriate appendix from the CSR have been reviewed.   Review was difficult, given that there is no easily obtained information noting the number of subjects for which information was available, and the number of results for subjects varied. Ophthalmologic Examinations: Results of ophthalmologic examinations were normal in most children. Assessor's comment:  The appropriate appendix from the CSR have been reviewed.   Review was difficult, given that there is no easily obtained information noting the number of subjects for which information was available, and the number of results for subjects varied. MAH Assessment and Conclusion Overall, the results obtained in this study did not identify clinical evidence of long-term, NRTI-related toxicity in children after receiving NRTIs in utero and in the first 6 weeks of life. The overall benefit-risk profile of stavudine remains favorable for patients with limited alternative ARV treatment options. No changes to the Summary of Product Characteristics are required. II.2.2 Discussion on clinical aspects The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Zerit (stavudine) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Zerit (stavudine) and that there is no consequential regulatory action. A concern of the submitted report is that the presentation of the data make it difficult to draw overall conclusions.  It is noted in table 5.1 that a total of 147 subjects were enrolled; however, 83 subjects (56%) were lost to follow-up.  It is unclear from the data when these subjects were lost to follow-up over the time of observation.  Furthermore, for each of the measured variables, the MAH has provided only line listings of results, so it is difficult to get an overview of the actual number of subjects (of the total of 147) who had the evaluations performed and how many of the subjects completed the entire course of planned observations.  Another issue is that subjects had different numbers of Medicinal product no longer auth

Zerit EMA/539978/2013

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observations/evaluations which is not clearly explained (it is assumed that it is related to different durations of follow up).

The MAH is therefore requested to make another presentation of the data to allow for a clarified overview of the results.  The MAH should focus on clarifying the total of number of subjects who completed all the planned observations/evaluations as well as noting the proportions of enrolled subjects who had results for each of the planned observations/evaluations.

RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION ON THE

RESPONSES

Zerit

It is acknowledged that this study was requested at a time which Zerit was routinely used to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV which is no longer recommended.  However, given that the study has been completed and data are available, it seems justified that they should be reviewed appropriately III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION Overall conclusion It is difficult to draw conclusions from the data based upon the current presentation of the data. Recommendation Not fulfilled: Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide a clarified presentation of the data as part of this procedure P46 059. (see section IV 'Additional clarifications requested') IV. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED The MAH is requested to make another presentation of the data to allow for a clarified overview of the results. The MAH should focus on clarifying the total of number of subjects who completed all the planned observations/evaluations as well as noting the proportions of enrolled subjects who had results for each of the planned observations/evaluations. Background and Scope of RSI: Study AI455120 was an observational study, designed to provide long-term safety monitoring of infants who were born during the conduct of studyAI455094 (which concerned perinatal antiretroviral interventions, which included stavudine). Study AI455120 was planned to be a roll-over study, and to follow the children up to 16 years of age. Study initiation was delayed for administrative reasons, and was started in June 2004, at a time when the mean age of the children included was around 4.5 years. It was terminated earlier than planned, in April 2012. In the first review of AI455120, no particular safety issued were seen. However, a concern of the submitted report was that the presentation of the data made it difficult to draw overall conclusions. Of the total of 147 subjects enrolled; 83 subjects (56%) were lost to follow-up in the final analysis. It was unclear from the data when these subjects were lost to follow-up over the time of observation. Only line listings of results were presented, so it was difficult to get an overview of the actual number of Medicinal product no longer auth

subjects (of the total of 147) who had the evaluations performed, and how many of the subjects completed the entire course of planned observations.

The MAH was therefore requested to make another presentation of the data to allow for a clarified overview of the results. The MAH should focus on clarifying the total of number of subjects who completed all the planned observations/evaluations as well as noting the proportions of enrolled subjects who had results for each of the planned observations/evaluations.

Summarized response Study AI455120 was conducted at 1 study site in South Africa. All subjects were to be evaluated annually, on or around their birth date. Data to be collected are shown below. Due to administrative delays in starting the study, the children were approximately 4 to 5 years of age when they were enrolled. Therefore, a decision was made to perform the first interim analysis when all participating children reached approximately 5 years of age. Of the 350 eligible subjects from study AI455094, 42% (147/350) enrolled in Study AI455120. The most common reason that eligible subjects did not enroll was inability to locate the subjects (48%, 167/350), followed by refusal to consent (9%, 31/350) and subject death (1%, 5/350). 5-Year Interim Analysis The first interim analysis was conducted when all subjects had reached 5 years of age; at this time 144 (98%) were continuing the study. Of the 3 subjects who discontinued, 2 withdrew study consent and 1 died. 10-Year Interim Analysis Medicinal product no longer auth

The second interim analysis was conducted when all subjects had reached 10 years of age; now with 118 subjects (80%) still in study. Of the 29 subjects who discontinued, 20 were lost to follow up, 6 withdrew study consent, 2 died, and 1 for other reasons (i.e., mother had died/no stable home)

Final Analysis The final analysis included all available data as of 10-Aug-2012 (study stopped by the sponsor) 83 subjects (56%) had been lost to follow up, 55 subjects (37%) were discontinued for this administrative reason, 6 subjects (4%) had withdrawn consent, and 3 subjects (2%) had died. Once the decision was made in January 2012 to terminate the study, the investigator asked subjects to come in by April 2012 for a final visit. The sponsor gave site personnel the following guidance regarding case report form status page completion: · 'Administrative reason by sponsor' was to be selected for subjects who had study visits completed since the last database lock on 23-Sep-2010. This reason was entered for 55 subjects (37%) in the final analysis. · 'Lost to follow up, death, or withdrew consent,' whichever was most appropriate, was to be selected for subjects who did not have a study visit since the last database lock on 23-Sep-2010. The reason 'lost to follow up' was entered for 83 subjects (56%) in the final analysis. This ad hoc analysis showed that although a significant number of subjects (56%) were designated as 'lost to follow up,' compliance with the annual visits for these subjects was in line with the subjects who were designated as 'discontinuing due to study termination.' The majority of the subjects who were lost to follow up were followed for at least 5 years Assessor´s conclusion: The company has shown that a majority of patients were followed up to the age of 10 years of age. Hence, the previously reported data (no safety signals) would therefore seem more valid. The main problem with this study would be the delayed start, and the fact that only around 50% of the children in the prior study were included. This only shows the difficulties in performing studies in these settings. Issue resolved.  The final report of study AI455120 does not call for any changes in the SmPC or RMP of Zerit.
