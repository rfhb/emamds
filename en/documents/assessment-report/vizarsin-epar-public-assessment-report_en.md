## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

The  product  is  a  generic  medicinal  product  containing  sildenafil  as  sildenafil  citrate  as  active substance.

The reference medicinal product is Viagra 25, 50 and 100 mg film-coated tablets.

Sildenafil is an inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5). During natural erection, nitric oxide (NO) is released and this triggers the synthesis of cGMP which, in turn, relaxes the corpora cavernosa (a key point in the erection process). PDE5 present in the corpus cavernosum breaks down cGMP, sildenafil prevents the breakdown of cGMP and, thus enhances the induced erectile response.

The safety and efficacy profile of sildenafil has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of which  can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  for  Viagra.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal product Viagra, summary of the clinical data of sildenafil citrate is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted with sildenafil citrate.

The indication proposed for Vizarsin is the same as the reference medicinal product.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The product is presented as film coated tablets containing 25, 50 and 100 mg of sildenafil citrate as active substance.

Other ingredients are:

Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose (E464), magnesium stearate

Film coating: lactose monohydrate, hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), triacetin

The film coated tablets are packed in blisters of PVC/ Al foil blisters.

## Active Substance

Sildenafil is a white to off-white, crystalline powder that is slightly soluble in water. It is also insoluble in ethanol, chloroform, acetone,but soluble in dimethyl formamide, DMSO and in methanol. Sildenafil has the chemical name 5-[2-ethoxy-5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)sulfonylphenyl]-1-methyl-3propyl-4H-pyrazolo[5,4-e]pyrimidin-7-one; 2-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid. It does not show polymorphism or enantiomerism.

## · Manufacture

The manufacturing of sildenafil consists of synthesis and crystallization. Sildenafil is manufactured by  two  manufacturing  sites.  The  complete  scientific  documentation from  the  first  manufacturer  is included in the dossier. Two alternative routes are described leading to the same impurity profile. The information on the manufacturing site from the second active substance manufacturer is provided in an ASMF.

Adequate  In-Process  Controls  are  applied  during  the  manufacture  of  the  active  substance.  The specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents,  have been presented and are satisfactory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specification

The specifications of the drug substance include identification of sildenafil citrate, identification of citrates,  water  content,  heavy  metals,  sulphated  ash,  related  substances  determination,  assay  of sildenafil citrate and of citric acid, and residual solvent.

Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

## · Stability

Three production scale batches of the active substance from the first manufacturer  were put on longterm  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  12  months,  and  accelerated  (40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6  months  stability testing  ICH  conditions.  Photostability  test  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  two batches. The following parameters were tested: appearance, water, content and related substances of sildenafil and content of citric acid.  The stability results justify the proposed retest period.

Four production scale batches of the active substance from the second manufacturer were put on longterm  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  60  months,  and  accelerated  (40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6  months  stability testing  ICH  conditions.  Photostability  test  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  two batches. The following parameters were tested: appearance, water, content and related substances of sildenafil and content of citric acid.  The stability results justify the proposed retest period.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Vizarsin  has  been  developed  with  the  objective  of  developing  a  stable  formulation  and  to  match dissolution  profile  of  the  reference  product,  and  being  essentially  similar  product  to  the  reference medicinal product Viagra.

A direct compression process was firstly tested. This approach was not successful due to the static nature of the drug. A wet granulation has then been chosen.

A  lot  of  trials  have  been  conducted  in  order  to  obtain  suitable  compression  characteristics,  flow properties  of  compression mixture, optimal physical characteristics of cores and amount of coating layer, but also dissolution and stability properties.

A number of studies were also carried out to define the compatibility of the active substance with the pharmaceutical  excipients  used.  A  wet  granulation  has  been  selected  as  manufacturing  process especially in view of the static nature of the active substance.

The excipients used in the formulation are tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose (E464), magnesium stearate film coating: lactose monohydrate, hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), triacetin All excipients used are in compliance with the Ph Eur. with the exception of the colouring agent.

The lactose anhydrous is derived from milk, it is declared that it satisfy the requirements outlined in the TSE Guideline.

Blister  PVC  with  aluminium  foil  have  been  selected  in  order  to  provide  a  good  protection  of  the tablets.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Manufacture of the Product

The finished product is manufactured by two manufacturers. The manufacturing process includes blending, granulation, tabletting, drying, and film-coating.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the manufacturing process.

The  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

## · Product Specification

The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, water content (Ph Eur), hardness  (Ph  Eur),  disintegration  (Ph  Eur),  identification  of  sildenafil  (HPLC),  identification  of citrate,  identification  of  titanium  dioxide,    related  substances  (HPLC),  dissolution  of  sildenafil  (Ph Eur), assay ( HPLC),  microbiological quality (Ph Eur)

Batch  analysis  results  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  manufacture  and  indicate  that  the process is under control. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies

## · Stability of the Product

Three  production  scale  batches  of  the  finished  product  (25  mg  and  100  mg)  from  the  two manufacturers were put on long-term (25°C/60%RH)  for up 12 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months stability testing ICH conditions. Photostability test following ICH guidelines  Q1B  was  also  performed.  The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  water content, hardness, disintegration, assay, related substances, dissolution, and microbial quality.

The results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

This application is made in accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. The applicant is not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests. Nonclinical  testing  strategy  did  not  therefore  include  any  toxicological  or  pharmacological  studies performed by the applicant.

The  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  is  based  on literature  searches and adequate scientific literature has been provided. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. There is thus no need for conducting tests on animals.

No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. The introduction of sildenafil film-coated tablets manufactured by Krka is unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for  all  sildenafil  containing  products  and  the  exposure  of  the  environment  to  the  active  substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## Introduction

This application concerns a marketing authorization under the centralised procedure. The subject of this application is sildenafil citrate film-coated tablets manufactured by Krka, in three strengths 25mg, 50mg, 100mg.

This application is made in accordance with Art 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 'A generic medicinal  product  of  a  reference  medicinal  product  authorised  by  the  Community'  and  Art  10(1) 'generic  application'  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Viagra  25mg, 50mg, 100mg film-coated tablets from Pfizer Pharma (EU/1/98/077/002-004; EU/1/98/077/006-008; EU/1/98/077/010-019).

Scientific advice was not sought for the development programme. For the clinical assessment the Note for Guidance on Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in its  current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) are of particular relevance.

The applicant submitted a bioequivalence (BE) study with the highest strength of 100mg film-coated tablets and a biowaiver for the lower 50 and 25mg strengths was accepted in line with the Note for Guidance (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).

The SmPC is in line with that of the reference product Viagra.

## GCP aspects

The  bioequivalence  study  provided  in  support  of  the  application  was  performed  by  a  Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) in Canada. The clinical part of the study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as claimed by the sponsor.

In accordance to Art 8(3)(ib) of the amended Directive, and Art 6.1 of the Regulation EC/726/2004, the applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials that were conducted outside the EU were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Clinical studies

To support the application, the applicant has submitted 1 bioequivalence study with the highest strength of 100mg. This bioequivalence study was performed with healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions.

Since this is a generic application no further clinical trials were required and the applicant performed none. Concerning clinical pharmacology, clinical efficacy and clinical safety, the applicant performed an adequate review of relevant literature.

## Pharmacokinetics

## · Methods

## STUDY DESIGN:

The study was designed according to a randomised, single-dose, laboratory-blinded, two-period, twosequence crossover classical scheme.

In each period, subjects were housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 24-hour postdose events. Subjects were instructed to avoid alcohol, and food or beverages containing xanthine for 58 hours prior to dosing and during each study protocol. Subjects were also instructed to avoid food or beverages containing grapefruit for 7 days prior to dosing and during each study protocol.

In each period, subjects received a single oral 100mg dose of sildenafil with 240ml of water on the morning of Day 1. The bioequivalence study was performed under fasting conditions (after a supervised overnight fast), since the concomitant food intake reduces the rate of absorption of sildenafil with Tmax being delayed by approximately 60 minutes and Cmax reduced by 29% according to the SmPC of the reference product. Subjects were allowed to leave the clinical site after 24-hour blood draw.

A 7 day wash-out was used in the study. The terminal half-life of sildenafil is 3 to 5 hours, hence the washout period length is acceptable.

A total of 18 blood samples were collected in each period at pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.42, 0.58, 0.75, 0.92,  1.08,  1.33,  1.67,  2,  2.5,  3,  4,  6,  8,  10,  12,  16,  and  24  hours  post-dose.  Blood  samples  were processed at 4°C afterwards and plasma samples were collected and stored at (-) 20°C and shipped for analysis.

The clinical part of the study was conducted in Canada between 1 st April 2008 and 11 th April 2008. The bioanalytical facilities were in Canada and the statistical analysis was performed in Canada.

The  protocol  and  the  informed  consent  form  were  approved  by  an  institutional  review  board  on 2008/02/14 and the revision 01 of the informed consent forms was approved on 2008/03/11. The final study report was signed in July 2008.

## TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS:

In  conclusion,  the  analytical  method  allowed  a  suitable  investigation  of  the  bioavailability  of sildenafil after oral administration.

## PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES

Relevant  PK  parameters  of  sildenafil  and  its  N-desmethyl  metabolite  were  estimated  using  a  non compartmental analysis (NCA).

The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  Cmax  and  Tmax  were  either  observed  or calculated. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Cmax and Tmax were directly estimated from the individual concentrations versus time profiles. Additional PK parameters assessed included Kel, T1/2el and intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV).

## STATISTICAL METHODS

The  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  performed  at  the  Department  of  biometry  and  statistics  of Algorithme  Pharma  Inc.  Laval,  Quebec,  Canada.  Parametric  ANOVA  on  ln-transformed  AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and  C max was  carried  out  for  both  analytes: Sildenafil  and  its  N-desmethyl metabolite .  The statistical model included sequence, period and treatment factors as fixed effects and subject within sequence as random effect. According to the protocol the bioequivalence could be concluded if the least square means ratio with corresponding 90% CI between the test and reference product for lntransformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax lied within 80-125% range. A non parametric test (Wilcoxon's rank sum test) was carried out to compare Tmax.

For N-desmethyl sildenafil, the mean Kel was 0.1530 hours -1 for the test formulation and 0.1574 hours -1 for the reference product. The mean T1/2el value for the test and reference product was 4.70 hours and 4.68 hours, respectively. The intra-subject coefficient of variation was 31.3%, 16.7% and 15.8% for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf, respectively.

## · Conclusions

In conclusion, the conventional CI for ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax for sildenafil and Ndesmethyl sildenafil were within the acceptance range. No significant difference in Tmax was evidenced by the non-parametric test. Therefore, this study was considered to have met the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bioequivalence criteria as defined by the study protocol since all 90% confidence intervals were within the acceptance range for both, sildenafil and its major metabolite.

Protocol deviations (blood sampling time deviation and concomitant medication) were judged to have no significant influence on bioequivalence assessment.

## Transferability of study results to other strengths

The  applicant  submitted  a  Bioequivalence  study  with  the  highest  strength  (100mg  tablets)  and requested biowaiver for the lower 50 and 25mg strengths. This request was found acceptable since all criteria  for  a  biowaiver  listed  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) were fulfilled, namely:

1. The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process;
2. The drug input has been shown to be linear over the therapeutic dose range;
3. The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same;
4. The ratio between amounts of the active substance and excipients is the same;

5. The dissolution profiles are similar under identical conditions for the additional strength and the strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study.

In conclusion, the extrapolation of the results obtained for the 100mg sildenafil film-coated tablets to the 50mg and 25mg film-coated tablets was deemed acceptable.

## CLINICAL SAFETY

Twenty seven subjects participating in the trials reported adverse events. The maximal intensity reported for these events ranged from mild to severe. None of the events were considered serious. Four adverse events (2 cases of headache, testicular pain and testicular swelling) required the use of concomitant medication. No subject was withdrawn from the study because of an event.

In conclusion, both formulations were well tolerated with no major adverse events and no relevant differences in safety profile were observed between the preparations.

## Pharmacodynamics

No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this application.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

To support the application, 1 bioequivalence study with the highest strength of sildenafil, i.e. 100mg was submitted. The study was designed according to a randomised, single-dose, laboratory-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover classical scheme.

32 subjects of the 34 enrolled received the two treatments and were included in the statistical analysis.

The  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  under  appropriate  conditions  and  in  line  with  applicable guidelines.

The  results  of  the  bioequivalence  study  showed  that  the  conventional  confidence  intervals  for  lntransformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax for sildenafil and N-desmethyl sildenafil were within the acceptance  range  of  80-125%.  No  significant  difference  in  Tmax  was  evidenced  by  the  nonparametric test.  Therefore,  based  on the available data it was concluded that bioequivalence of the two products had been demonstrated.

The extrapolation of the bioequivalence study results obtained for the 100mg sildenafil film-coated tablets  to  the  50mg  and  25mg  film-coated  tablets  was  deemed  acceptable  since  all  criteria  for  a biowaiver listed in the applicable guidance were fulfilled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The adverse events observed in the study  were  graded  mild  to  severe and were comparable to the originator.  None  of  the  events  were  considered  serious.  Four  adverse  events  (2  cases  of  headache, testicular  pain  and  testicular  swelling)  required  the  use of concomitant medication. No subject was withdrawn from the study because of an event.

The safety concerns with the use of sildenafil have been addressed in the SmPC with the inclusion of appropriate warnings, precautions, and contraindications, and are in line with the reference product.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

This application is made in accordance with Art 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 'A generic medicinal product of a reference medicinal product authorised by the Community' and Art 10(1) 'generic application' of Directive 2001/83/EC. The reference medicinal product is Viagra 25mg, 50mg, 100mg film-coated tablets. According to the legal basis no non-clinical studies were required. The applicant provided an appropriate non-clinical overview of sildenafil based on scientific literature. Moreover, no additional clinical trials were required except for bioequivalence studies. The clinical overview provided an adequate summary of clinical data for sildenafil. The results of the bioequivalence study demonstrated the bioequivalence of 100mg film-coated tablet of Krka sildenafil and the reference product, Viagra 100mg film-coated tablet. The extrapolation of the study results to lower strengths of sildenafil, i.e. 50mg and 25mg, was deemed acceptable. The adverse events in the bioequivalence study were comparable to the reference product and no serious adverse events were observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The application contains adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the originator can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of Vizarsin  25mg,  50mg  and  100mg  film-coated  tablets  in  the  treatment  of  erectile  dysfunction  was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
