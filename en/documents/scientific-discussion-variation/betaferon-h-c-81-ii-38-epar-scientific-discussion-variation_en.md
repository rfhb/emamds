## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common, non-traumatic cause of neurologic dysfunction in young adults, and is the commonest disabling neurological disease of young people in the northern temperate zones. The highest prevalence is in Northern Europe (&gt; 200/100,000 in Scotland). The estimated number of newly diagnosed cases in Europe is more than 10,000 per year. The median age of onset is 33 years.

Betaferon was approved in the European Union in November 1995 in the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and in January 1999 in the secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).

The RRMS indication was granted based on two randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with RRMS which showed that IFN beta-1b administered subcutaneously (s.c.) at a dose of 250 µg every other day (e.o.d.) reduces the frequency and severity of relapses, and reduces the development of brain lesions  as  measured  by  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  (IFNB  Multiple  Sclerosis  Study  Group 1993, Paty 1993 ).

The  SPMS  indication  was  granted  based  on  a  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trial  conducted  in patients with SPMS, in which IFN beta-1b given s.c. at a dose of 250 µg e.o.d. was shown to delay disease progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; Kurtzke 1983). It also  showed  benefits  for  relapse  and  MRI-related  endpoints  (European  Study  Group  on  Interferon beta-1b in Secondary Progressive MS 1998).

Betaferon is currently authorized with the following indications:

- -Treatment  of  patients  with  secondary  progressive  multiple  sclerosis  with  active  disease, evidenced by relapses.
- -Treatment  of  patients  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  and  two  or  more  relapses within the last two years.

Within  the  last  years,  increasing  evidence  has  been  obtained  from  the  literature  that  more  frequent clinical events indicative of a stronger inflammatory disease activity in the early course of the disease result in a more rapid accumulation of neurological deficits ( Comi 2000; Chofflon 2000 ).  It therefore has  been  proposed  that  the  disease  should  be  treated  early  with  disease  modifying  treatments,  thus preventing or delaying the initiation or progression of irreversible neurodegenerative processes.

Treatment  with  IFNB  has  also  been  evaluated  in  patients  with  a  first  clinical  demyelinating  event before the diagnosis of clinically definite MS (CDMS) was made. In such patients, two studies have recently demonstrated  beneficial effects of two  IFNB  -1a  preparations  using  a  once-weekly administration schedule ( Jacobs et al. 2000 and Comi et al. 2001 ).

Therefore,  since  the  original  authorization  of  Betaferon,  initiation  of  IFNB  treatment  as  early  as possible to achieve maximum therapeutic effects have been encouraged by clinical experts.

Based on the results of a 2-year randomized, controlled study investigating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Betaferon treatment in patients with a first clinical demyelinating event suggestive of MS (BENEFIT study), the MAH applied to add the following indication to the already authorised ones:

'Betaferon is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis and at least two clinically silent MRI lesions, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded.'

The MAH also proposes to update SPC section 5.1 (Pharmacodynamic properties) to include the new clinical  data  generated  by  the  BENEFIT  study,  as  well  as  sections  4.2,  4.4  and  4.8.  Finally,  the Package Leaflet is revised according to these changes.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has also  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Clinical efficacy

The  clinical  efficacy  programme  was  based  on  the  BENEFIT  study,  a  multi-center,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-arm, randomized study in patients with a first (single) clinical demyelinating event suggestive of MS. The study enrolled patients after the onset of a single clinical event suggestive of MS (often referred to as 'Clinically Isolated Syndrome', 'CIS').

To further explore the long-term effects of early Betaferon treatment in patients with CIS, patients who reached end of the BENEFIT study due to CDMS or after 24 month of double blind treatment were offered enrolment in a pre-planned open-label follow-up extension of the trial. The follow-up study will examine all patients for a total observation period of 60 months after start of treatment in the  BENEFIT  study.  Relapses,  neurological  disability  and  patient  reported  health  outcomes  will  be evaluated, among other outcome variables.

## METHODS

## Objectives

The objective of the study was to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 250 µg (8 million international  units)  Betaferon  s.c.  e.o.d.  over  a  period  of  up  to  24  months  in  patients  with  a  first clinical demyelinating event suggestive of MS.

## Study Participants

The study enrolled patients within 60 days after the onset of a single clinical event suggestive of MS, based on the appearance of a new neurological abnormality which had to be present for at least 24 hours. T2-weighted brain MRI scan had to show at least two clinically silent lesions with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which had to be ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Patients were of age 18 to 45 years, with an EDSS of GLYPH&lt;1&gt; 5.0  and  could  have  a  monofocal or multifocal onset of the disease. Any disease other than MS that could better explain patients´ signs and symptoms had to be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

excluded. Patients with complete transverse myelitis or bilateral optic neuritis as well as patients who had  received  prior  immunosuppressant  therapy  were  also  excluded.  The  MAH  also  clarified  that patients with neurological symptoms (including visual disturbance) lasting less than 24 hours prior to the index period (i.e. first episode with neurological symptoms lasting more than 24 hours) were not eligible for the study. Steroid treatment of the first event, based on a treatment schedule defined in the study protocol, was performed at the discretion of the investigator.

## Treatments

## · Study treatment

Each patient was assigned to one of the two parallel treatment groups :

- -Group 1: 250 microgram (8 million IU) IFNB-1b
- -Group 2: Placebo

Both  treatments  were  given  as  s.c.  injections  e.o.d.  Treatment  duration  was  up  to  2  years  or  until progression to the primary efficacy variable of CDMS was reached. A dose titration was performed as described in Table I below. The dose of 8 mIU Betaferon s.c. e.o.d was selected for treatment of CIS patients based on findings of the previous pivotal study in patients with RRMS, in which this dose had superior efficacy to a dose of 1.6 mIU s.c., e.od. as compared to placebo treatment. Considering that the disease characteristics of patients with CIS closely resemble those of patients with RRMS and that the dose 8 mIU was shown to be safe in more than on decade of market experience, no further dose finding was performed in this patient population.

| Table I. Injection No.   | Study Day   | Dose      | Volume   |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 to 3                   | 1, 3, 5     | 0.0625 mg | 0.25 mL  |
| 4 to 6                   | 7, 9, 11    | 0.125 mg  | 0.5 mL   |
| 7 to 9                   | 13, 15, 17  | 0.1875 mg | 0.75 mL  |
| 10 etc.                  | 19, etc.    | 0.25 mg   | 1.0 mL   |

In  countries  where  an  autoinjector  for  the  administration  of  IFNB-1b  was  available,  patients  were encouraged to its use. During the study, after the titration period, the proportion of patients using an autoinjector ranged from 75.8% to 81.6% in the IFNB-1b group (month 2 onwards).

## · Prohibited concomitant therapy

Any  immunomodulatory  or  immunosuppressive  treatment  and  other  therapeutic  agents  for  MS  or other investigational pharmacological therapy for MS were prohibited throughout the study and would have been required termination of treatment.

## · Permitted concomitant therapy

## 1. Treatment of flu-like symptoms

For the first  3  months  of  treatment  with  study drug,  all  patients  were  to  be  instructed  to  take  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  prior  to  each  injection  in  order  to  minimize  flu-like symptoms due to study drug (recommended dose: 500 to 1000 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol or 200 to 400 mg ibuprofen). In addition, patients could have received additional acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 3 grams within any 24-hour period) or ibuprofen (up to a maximum of 1200 mg within any 24-hour period), as necessary for relief of expected interferon-related flu-like symptoms. At the discretion of the treating physician, these agents could be given throughout this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Steroid treatment

Steroid treatment of the single clinical demyelinating event was at the discretion of the investigator. The screening MRI scan was not to be performed while a patient was on intravenous (i.v.) corticoid therapy. The MRI was to be performed before initiation of steroid treatment.

## Randomisation and sample size

Patients  were  assigned  to  IFNB-1b  250  µg  (8  MIU),  or  placebo  (both  s.c.  injections  e.o.d.).  A randomization  procedure  was  designed  to  keep  the  overall  treatment  allocation  ratio  close  to  5:3 (IFNB-1b  :  placebo).  A  minimization  procedure  with  an  element  of  randomization  was  used  to minimize imbalances of treatment  groups  for factors that  might  affect  the  manifestation  of  definite MS: (i) steroid use during the first clinical event, (ii) investigator's classification of the first event, (iii) categorized number of T2 lesions on the screening MRI, and (iv) cerebrospinal fluid result.

Patient enrolment was planned to continue until a total of at least 400 patients had reached at least the Month-1 visit of the treatment period without EOS medication. In the end, 603 patients were screened, and 487 patients were randomized. Of these 468 patients were included in the analysis and treated.

## Endpoints

## Primary efficacy variables:

- Time to MS according to the diagnostic criteria by McDonald (McDonald et al. 2001).
- Time to CDMS according to Poser (Poser 1983).

## Secondary efficacy variables:

- Absolute change in T2 lesion volume (T2 lesion load), observed between the screening MRI scan and the last scan at/before the EOS visit.
- Cumulative number of newly active lesions observed between the screening MRI scan and the last scan at/before the EOS visit.

## Exploratory MRI efficacy variables:

- GLYPH&lt;1&gt;GLYPH&lt;2&gt; Absolute change in volume of non-enhancing hypointense T1 lesions (\"black holes') observed between the screening MRI scan and the last scan at/ before the EOS visit.
- GLYPH&lt;1&gt;GLYPH&lt;2&gt; Percentage change in brain volume (PBVC according to the SIENA method 21) observed between the screening MRI scan and the last scan at/ before the EOS visit.
- GLYPH&lt;1&gt;GLYPH&lt;2&gt; Cumulative number of new non-enhancing hypointense lesions seen on T1-weighted scans (\"black holes') observed between the screening MRI scan and the last scan at/ before the EOS visit.

Exploratory clinical efficacy variables were derived from the following test procedures: EDSS score and Kurtzkes FS scores; MSFC score and scores of subtests.

Patient-reported outcome variables were: Functional assessment of MS Trial Outcome Index (FAMSTOI) and EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D).

## Statistical methods

Analyses  of  efficacy  variables  were  based  on  468  patients  (292  IFNB-1b  patients  and  176  placebo patients)  who  had  at  least  one  administration  of  study  drug.  This  'Full  Analysis  Set'  (FAS)  was predefined as the primary analysis set of the study. Analyses of the primary efficacy variables were also  performed  with  the  'All  Randomized  Analysis  Set'  (ARS),  i.e.  all  487  patients  who  were randomized, which was introduced during the course of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary  efficacy  variables  were  analyzed  by  the  log-rank  test  (primary  statistical  analysis)  and  by proportional hazards regressions (secondary statistical analysis). According to the statistical analysis plan,  proportional  hazards  regressions  were  performed  with  covariates  used  in  the  minimization procedure.

For both primary efficacy variables the null hypothesis of no difference between IFNB-1b treatment and  placebo  was  considered.  The  efficacy  of  IFNB-1b  was  tested  by  a  sequential,  conditional approach which restricts the overall probability of a type-I-error to 0,05:

1. The  null  hypothesis  of  no  difference  in  survival  functions  between  IFNB-1b  treatment  and placebo was tested for 'Time to clinically definite MS' with a two-sided significance level of GLYPH&lt;2&gt; = 0,05.
2. Only  in  a  case  the  above  mentioned  null  hypothesis  was  rejected,  the  null  hypothesis  of  no difference in survival functions between IFNB-1b treatment and placebo was tested for 'Time to MS according to McDonald criteria' with a two-sided significance level of GLYPH&lt;2&gt; = 0,05.

Post-hoc analyses of the primary efficacy variables were performed with respect to key clinical and MRI baseline factors characterizing dissemination and activity of the disease at the time of the first event, including: (i) Age (&lt; 30 versus GLYPH&lt;3&gt; 30 years), (ii) onset of disease (monofocal versus multifocal), (iii)  number of  T2 lesions  (&lt;  9  versus GLYPH&lt;3&gt; 9),  (iv)  number  of  Gd+  lesions  (0  versus GLYPH&lt;3&gt; 1),  (v)  steroid treatment of the first event (yes versus no), and (vi) sex. For each of these covariates, the impact on the progression to CDMS (log-rank test as well as proportional hazards regression using the covariate as  the  only  stratum),  the  interaction  with  IFNB-1b  (proportional  hazards  regression:  IFNB-1b  by covariate  interaction),  and  the  efficacy  of  IFNB-1b  in  the  respective  subgroups  (log-rank  test  and proportional  hazards  regression  in  two  subgroups  resulting  from  dichotomization  of  the  BENEFIT FAS with regards to these covariates) were evaluated.

MRI efficacy variables were analyzed by nonparametric analysis of covariance for 'annualized' and 'non-annualized'  (i.e.  not  modified)  secondary  and  supportive  secondary  variables.  Corresponding MRI parameters measured in the screening MRI scan were used as covariates.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

<!-- image -->

All patients were to be titrated up to a dose of 8 mIU within a period of three weeks unless any significant local or systemic side effects occur. All patients reached the full dose according to this schedule, i.e. within 3 weeks.

## Recruitment

The study was performed between February 2002 and April 2005. 98 centres in 20 countries were involved into the conduct of the study and numbers of recruited patients vary from 1 (0.2%) for the smallest centers, up to 19 (4.1%) for the biggest center.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

Analysis of the baseline characteristics showed that treatment groups were very similar with respect to demographic  and  key  clinical  as  well  as  MRI  parameters,  as  shown  in  Table  II  below.  Baseline characteristics in the treatment groups of the ARS were close to FAS.

## All randomized set (ARS) (by-patient allocation):

All 487 patients randomized for this study were included in the ARS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Full analysis set (FAS) (by-patient allocation):

Among  the  487  ARS  patients,  the  19  randomized  patients  (4%)  who  never  received  any  study medication were not included into the FAS, leading to a total of 468 (96%) included in the FAS. Two of  these  patients  were  not  treated  as  randomized.  There  were  no  relevant  differences  between  the treatment groups with regard to the allocation of randomized patients to the FAS.

## Per-protocol set (PPS) (by-visit allocation):

During the course of the study, there was a tendency of fewer exclusions from the PPS in the IFNB-1b group as compared to the placebo group. At Month 18, 64% of the IFNB-1b patients versus 52% of the placebo patients were included into the PPS.

## Safety analysis set (SFS) (by-patient allocation):

All 468 patients with at least one dose of study medication were included into the SFS. Two of these patients were not treated. There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups with regard to the allocation of randomized patient to the SFS.

Outcomes and estimation

## · Primary efficacy variables - Primary analysis

## Time to CDMS according to Poser

The total number of patients with CDMS at any time-point during the study was 152/468 (32.5%), 75 in  the  INFB-1b  group (25.7%) and 77 patients in the placebo arm (43.8%). All other patients were censored with regard to CDMS.

By the end of the 2-year treatment period (on Day 720), the probability of not being diagnosed for CDMS (as estimated by Kaplan-Meier statistics) was 72.5% in the IFNB-1b group and 54.7% in the placebo group (see figure 1).

## Time to MS according to the diagnostic criteria by McDonald

For the establishment of dissemination in space, no relevant differences between the treatment groups were seen; for nearly half of the patients (47% in both groups), dissemination in space was established by the multifocal onset of the single event.

The proportion of patients for whom dissemination in time was established via the criterion \" GLYPH&lt;3&gt; 1 new Gd+ lesion at Month-3\" was notably higher in the placebo group (29.5%) than in the IFNB-1b group (12.0%). Conversely, the proportion of patients for whom dissemination in time was never established was higher in the IFNB-1b group (31.5%) than in the placebo group (15.3%).

By the end of the 2-year treatment period, the probability of not being diagnosed for MS according to the McDonald criteria (as estimated by Kaplan-Meier statistics) was 30.6% in the IFNB-1b group and 15.5% in the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates for FAS are shown in Figure 2. MRI scans were performed at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 which explains the step-like shape of the curve.

In  all  three  analysis  sets,  the  log-rank-tests  for  comparison  of  the  treatment  groups  led  to  p-values below the chosen significance level of GLYPH&lt;4&gt; = 0.05:

- FAS:  p = 0.000006

- ARS: p = 0.000007

- PPS:  p = 0.000001

## Primary efficacy variables - Secondary analysis

A semi-parametric proportional hazards regression showed that, for both primary efficacy variables, the respective confidence intervals for the hazard ratios of the covariates \"treatment\" and \"steroid use during single event\" do not include the value 1, thus suggesting an effect. For \"time to MS according to  the  McDonald  criteria\",  this  held  also  true  for  \" GLYPH&lt;3&gt; 9  T2  lesions  at  screening\".  For  the  other covariates, the corresponding confidence intervals for the hazard ratios do not suggest demonstrable effects on either primary efficacy variable (see Table IV).

## Secondary MRI efficacy variables

## Cumulative number of newly active lesions

For the non-annualized values, the gradual increase of the mean and median cumulative number of newly  active  lesions  was  more  expressed  in  the  placebo  group  than  in  the  IFNB-1b  group.  A significant  group  difference  in  favour  of  IFNB-1b  was  also  found  for  the  annualized  rates.  The cumulative number of newly active lesions (FAS) is summarised in Table V below.

## Absolute change in T2 lesion volume (T2 lesion load),

The change in T2 lesion  load  during  the  course  of  the  study  exhibited  a  substantial  interindividual variability.  From  screening  to  all  subsequent  visits,  the  T2  lesion  load  decreased  in  the  majority  of patients  in  both  treatment  groups.  Changes  in  T2  lesion  volume  relative  to  screening  expressed  as mm3 - FAS are summarised in Table VI below.

## Patient-reported outcome (PRO) variables

The PRO results were comparable between both treatment groups.

The Functional assessment of MS Trial Outcome Index (FAMS-TOI) had been pre-specified as the most important PRO variable. Starting from nearly identical median baseline values in both treatment groups (IFNB-1b: 129.8; placebo:  130.0), only  little  changes  over  time  and  only  minor  differences between  the  treatment  groups  were  seen;  at  EOS,  median  values  of  128.0  were  recorded  in  both treatment.  The  same  picture  was  found  for  the  FAMS  total  score:  Very  similar  baseline  values  as recorded in both treatment groups (IFNB-1b: 146; placebo: 147) were followed by EOS values of 147 (IFNB-1b) and 146 (placebo).

The EQ-5D results indicate that the long-term treatment with IFNB-1b does not have a measurable impact on the patients' HRQL. For the five dimensions of the health state classification (\"mobility\", \"self-care\",  \"pain/discomfort\",  \"usual  activities\",  \"anxiety/depression\")  no  significant  changes  over time were found. Starting from similar median baseline values in both treatment groups (IFNB-1b: 85.0; placebo: 89.0), no significant differences between the treatment groups were seen for the EQ-5D Visual analogue scale; at EOS, median values of 88.0 (IFNB-1b) and 89.0 (placebo) were recorded.

Ancillary analyses

## Results of log-rank test and proportional hazards regression in lag time subgroups

Further to CHMP request, the MAH performed post hoc analyses of primary endpoints for different 'lag time' categories (i.e. measured from onset of the first episode to treatment start). Tables X and XI provide results of log-rank tests and unadjusted proportional hazards regressions for time to CDMS / time to McDonald MS in the two subgroups '15 - 45 days' and ' GLYPH&lt;3&gt; 46  days' for  lag  time.  Results show that treatment effects were more pronounced in patients with shorter period between the onset of the first event and start of treatment.

## Modified proportional hazards regression model and unadjusted hazard ratios

The results  of  the  post-hoc  analyses  using  the  proportional  hazards  model  with  the  modified,  more complete,  set  of  covariates  that  may  affect  the  progression  to  MS  and,  the  unadjusted  proportional hazards regressions are summarized in Table XII. The results obtained for the FAS analysis were very similar to the ARS results.

## 1. Time to CDMS

The  modified  proportional  hazards  regression  indicates  that  \"time  to  CDMS\"  is  influenced  in  a statistically significant manner by IFNB-1b (decreased the risk for progression to CDMS, hazard ratio: 0.50), by the steroid treatment of the single event (hazard ratio: 1.58), by the age at screening (hazard ratio: 0.96), and by the Gd-enhancing lesions on the screening MRI (hazard ratio: 1.07). The number of T2 lesions showed a trend for an increase in risk (hazard ratio: 1.004) which did not reach statistical significance.  Neither  the  sex  nor  the  type  of  disease  onset  (mono-  or  multifocal)  influenced  the progression to CDMS.

## 2. Time to MS according to the McDonald criteria

The modified proportional hazards regression  for  \"time  to  McDonald  MS\"  resulted  in  very  similar findings, with statistically significant impact of treatment, steroid treatment of the single event and age at screening. In addition, the number of T2 lesions was also statistically significantly associated with an increased risk (hazard ratio: 1.01 per T2 lesion). As for \"time to CDMS\", by use of the extended set of covariates, an even stronger reduction in the risk for progression to MS according to the McDonald criteria was seen for IFNB-1b treatment (hazard ratio: 0.54) than in the hazards regressions using the initial set of covariates (hazard ratio: 0.57) or treatment as single covariate (\"unadjusted hazard ratio\": 0.61).

## Time course of \"CDMS\" versus \"MS according to the McDonald criteria\"

In both treatment groups, the cumulative proportion of patients with MS according to the McDonald criteria is substantially larger than the cumulative proportion of patients with CDMS (see Table XIII). By the end of the 2-year observation period, the cumulative probability for the disease development in placebo patients was 84.5% (MS according to the McDonald criteria) and 45.3% (CDMS).

## Differential risks for CDMS and treatment effects in mono- versus multifocal patients

In  order to  better understand the level of treatment response in subgroups of patients with different degree of disease activity,  the  impact  of baseline  MRI  findings  was  further  evaluated  separately  in mono- and multifocal patients.

In  monofocal  CIS  patients,  the  risk  for  CDMS  in  placebo  patients  and  the  treatment  response increased with a higher number of T2-lesions and the presence of at least one Gd-enhancing lesion. The risk for CDMS in the placebo group increased from 31% in patients with less than 9 T2-lesions to 55% in patients with at least 9 T2-lesions. Similarly the risk for CDMS increased from 36% in placebo patients without Gd-enhancing lesions to 63% in patients with Gd-enhancing lesions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  multifocal  CIS  patients,  the  risk  for  CDMS  in  placebo  patients  and  the  treatment  effect  was  not increased  by  higher  disease  dissemination  or  activity  on  the  baseline  MRI.  The  risk  for  CDMS  in multifocal placebo patients with less than 9 T2-lesions was comparable to the risk of patients with at least 9 T2-lesions. Similarly, the risk for CDMS did not differ in multifocal placebo patients without vs. with Gd-enhancing lesions.

There  were  also  differences  between  multifocal  and  monofocal  CIS  patients  with  regard  to  the treatment response. The treatment effect of multifocal patients with less MRI disease activity/dissemination  at  baseline  was  substantial,  and  numerically  even  more  pronounced  than  in multifocal patients with such MRI findings (in multifocal patients with less than 9 T2- lesions vs. at least 9 T2-lesions the hazard ratios were 0.24 [0.09-0.66] vs. 0.84 [0.50-1.41]; in multifocal patients without vs. with Gd-enhancing lesions the hazard ratios were 0.42 [0.22- 0.80] vs. 0.95 [0.48-1.87]).

## ANALYSIS PERFORMED ACROSS TRIALS (POOLED ANALYSES AND META-ANALYSIS)

In the pivotal RRMS study that supported the granting of the original RRMS indication, the hazard ratio estimate for 'Time to first relapse after start of treatment' for IFN beta-1b versus placebo was 0.69, corresponding to a reduction in the risk for a relapse by 31% ( Bogumil et al. 2005 ).

In the BENEFIT study, the reduction in risk for 'Time to first relapse' overall was 46% (hazard ratio 0.54), and in the subgroups of patients with higher dissemination / activity of the disease at the first event,  34% (hazard ratio 0.66) in multifocal patients,  41% (hazard ratio  0.59)  in  patients  with  9 or more T2 lesions, and 38% in patients with enhancement on the screening MRI (hazard ratio 0.62).

## DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL EFFICACY

The  clinical  efficacy  programme  was  based  on  a  multi-center,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, randomized study in patients with a first clinical demyelinating event suggestive of MS.

The benefit of Betaferon in patients with a first demyelinating event suggestive of MS is supported by the  primary  endpoint  as  the  results  demonstrated  a  significant  elongation  of  the  time  to  CDMS according  to  the  classifications  of  Poser  and  of  McDonald  at  the  end  of  two  years.  Conversely,  a significant decrease of the cumulative number of new active MS lesions on MRI in the IFNB-1b group in comparison with the placebo group was demonstrated.

The convincing results obtained regarding the time to CDMS and MRI lesions were not accompanied by  improvements  in  the  clinically  efficacy  variables  (EDSS,  MSFC  score)  and  the  patient-reported outcome variables, which raises questions concerning the  clinical relevance of early treatment with Betaferon. In that respect, it is noted that the beneficial effects of Betaferon on relapse re-occurrence in the BENEFIT study were comparable to the effects of Betaferon observed in the pivotal study in RRMS patients that were the basis for approval of Betaferon in this patient population. Besides, there is  a  substantial  body  of  evidence  that relapse  and  also  MRI  activity  are  associated  with  irreversible CNS damage in the early disease period ( Trapp, 1998; Kuhlmann, 2002 ),  and that relapse and MRI activity during the early rather than during the late disease periods predict long-term disease outcome ( Brex, 2002; Ebers, 2005; Lublin, 2003 ). Therefore, even a small effect could be considered clinically relevant. The lack of significance of the results obtained on clinically efficacy variables and patientreported outcomes may be explained by the fact that these parameters are too insensitive to measure disease progression during this earliest clinical period of the disease. The MAH performed additional statistical  tests  on  MSFC  outcome  parameters  (non-parametric  analysis  of  covariance  with  baseline MSFC  result  as  covariate)  which  notably  showed  a  statistically  significant  beneficial  effect  for Betaferon patients with respect to the change of the overall MSFC score from baseline to the end of study (the median change of the MSFC z-score from baseline to end of study was 0.119 in Betaferon and  0.060  in  placebo  patients;  p=0.0386).  These  results  should  be  viewed  with  caution  as  these analyses have not been adjusted for multiplicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results obtained after 2 years provide a limited follow-up of patients and it is unclear how patients who develop MS who have been pre-treated with Betaferon will fair in the long-term.  Therefore, the MAH committed to provide an accurate follow-up of data from the open-label follow-up extension of the trial, when available. In addition, the indication should be restricted to those patients with a first event of sufficient severity to warrant the use of Betaferon and with a high risk for MS. Although there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, subgroups of patients that were seen of being at higher risk to develop CDMS in the BENEFIT study were specified in section 5.1.

## Clinical safety

## PATIENT EXPOSURE

There were 468 patients in the SFS (96.1% of all patients randomized). Of these 468 patients, a total of 292 patients (95.7% of all patients randomized to this treatment group) were of the IFNB-1b group and 176 patients (96.7%) of the placebo group. For a total of 458 patients, data on the duration from start of treatment to end of study drug was available (missing for 10 patients of the SFS).

## ADVERSE EVENTS

A total of 3056 adverse events (AEs) in 443 out of 468 patients (94.7%) were reported, with more AEs and a higher proportion of patients with AEs reported in the IFNB-1b group: 2180 AEs occurred in 281 out of 292 IFNB-1b patients (96.2%) compared to 876 AEs in 162 out of 176 (92.0%) placebo patients. Differences between the treatment groups were observed for the number of AEs per patient. Patients of the IFNB-1b group had more AEs per patient than patients of the placebo group. No AE was recorded in 11 patients (3.8%) of the IFNB-1b group and 14 (8.0%) of the placebo patients.

Most  AEs  were  either  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  with  no  clear  differences  between  treatment groups: 82.9% of all IFNB-1b patients had mild or moderate AEs compared with 86.4% of all placebo patients.  The  most  frequent  AEs  were  injection  site  reaction,  flu-like  symptoms,  headache  and asthenia, all of which were more frequent in the IFN beta-1b group than the placebo group. The most frequently reported AEs with more than 10% of patients for any treatment are summarised in Table XIV.

Flu-lilke syndrone complex\" denotes the HAPTS tems fu syndrome\" and'or a combimation of at lerst two AEs ffom \" fever\", \"chills\", \"'myalgia\", \"malaise\" or \"sweafing\"

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

More patients of the IFNB-1b group had AEs that were assessed as study drug-related. A total of 254 patients (87.0%) of the IFNB-1b group and 76 patients (43.2%) of the placebo group had at least one AE  that  was  classified  as  being  treatment-related.  The  frequency  of  typical  IFNB-1b-related  AEs decreased substantially from the first year to the second year of the study. Of note, the proportion of IFN beta-1b-treated patients experiencing flu syndrome was reduced from 42% to 13% of the patients. AEs related to flu syndrome such as fever and chills were observed less frequently during the second year. Also injection site reactions occurred less frequently during the second year (30%) than during the first year (46%).

## SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/DEATHS/OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

A total of 42 AEs (out of 3056 AEs, 1.4%) were reported for 32 of 468 patients (6.8%) as serious adverse events (SAE), i.e., 28 SAEs (of 2180 AEs, 1.3%) in 20 of 292 patients (6.8%) of the IFNB-1b group and 14 SAEs (of 876 AEs, 1.6%) in 12 of 176 patients (6.8%) of the placebo group.

The majority of patients (23 of 32 patients with SAEs) had recovered from their SAEs by the end of the study, 4 were still recovering (all of the IFNB-1b group), 3 had not recovered (2 patients of the IFNB-1b group, 1 of the placebo group), and 2 had recovered with residual effects (one patient of each treatment group). No deaths were reported during this study.

## LABORATORY FINDINGS

For lymphocytes, SGPT, absolute neutrophile count (ANC), white blood cells (WBC) and SGOT, the proportion of affected patients was statistically significantly higher in the IFNB-1b group as compared to  placebo.  The  most  pronounced  group  differences  were  found  for  lymphocytes  (&lt;  1500  /mm3; IFNB-1b: 79.1%) and increased SGPT values (&gt; 5 × baseline value; IFNB-1b: 17.8%).

The five laboratory variables are summarized in Table XV for group comparisons with respect to the number/percentage of patients beyond the respective threshold value used in the summary of product characteristics.

## NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES (NABS)

The  available  data  for  NAbs  (By-visit  results  of  the  6-monthly  measurements)  are  shown  in  Table XVI. Neutralizing activity was measured at least once in 30% (75) of the IFNB-1b patients; of these, 23% (17) converted to negative status during the later study course.

The assay specificity was adequate as evidenced by the fact that only 1 placebo patient had a positive NAb titer at any time; moreover, no positive baseline titer was recorded.

A post hoc analysis indicated that there was no significant effect between positive titres for NAbs and 'Time to CDMS'. For the evaluation of potential correlations between NAb titers and efficacy, a logrank test stratified for 'all available NAb titers negative' versus ' GLYPH&lt;3&gt; 1 positive NAb titer was performed for the primary variable time to CDMS' in FAS patients randomized to IFNB-1b.

The log-rank test did not detect a statistically significant difference between the two strata (p = 0.11). Likewise, the proportional hazards regression with covariate NAb status did not provide statistically significant  results  for  this  covariate  (hazard  ratio:  0.626,  p  =  0.11).  Moreover,  the  results  of  the additional proportional hazards regression with covariate NAb status and the covariates used for the pre-specified analyses of the primary variables (\"type of disease onset\"; \"steroid use at first event\"; \"number of T2 lesions at screening\") are consistent with these findings. Figure 3 below illustrates the time to CDMS in patients with at least 1 positive NAb titer compared to patients who remained NAbnegative throughout the study.

At the request of the CHMP, the MAH performed additional statistical analyses  with regard to the relationship of positive NAb status ('at least once positive') and time to CDMS to further evaluate the effect  of  the  NAb  on  the  efficacy  in  patients  with  persisting  levels  of  antibodies.  This  additional analysis  excluded  Betaferon  patients  with  end  of  study  (EOS)  before  6  months,  9  months  and  12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

months,  respectively.  Such  an  approach  was  motivated  by  the  common  understanding  that  NAbs against  Betaferon  are  typically  not  present  (or  measurable)  during  the  first  6  to  12  months  after initiation of Betaferon therapy ( Polman, 2003; Soerensen, 2005 ).  Key results are displayed in Table XVII and Figure 4.

## COMPARISON OF AES AND LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES AMONG THE PIVOTAL IFNB-1B STUDIES

The safety and tolerability profile of IFNB-1b (250 µg e.o.d.) in patients with a first demyelinating event as observed during the BENEFIT study was compared with results obtained in previous studies in patients with RRMS or SPMS. In general, in comparison to the previous pivotal studies, AEs and laboratory abnormalities were reported in the BENEFIT study in IFN beta-1b patients with a single clinical  event  either  with  a  similar  incidence,  or  less  often.  It  is  noted  that  injection  site  reactions (ISRs) occurred in a smaller number of both IFNB-1b and placebo treated patients in the BENEFIT study. An injection site necrosis was observed in 1% of the IFNB-1b treated patients as compared to 5% to 6% in the other three pivotal studies. Similarly, flu-like symptoms was reported for a smaller portion  of  the  IFNB-1b  treated  patients  with  a  single  clinical  event  (46.2%)  as  compared  to  the previous pivotal studies (43% to 61%). With regard to ISRs, the MAH also referred to a three-month, multicenter,  randomized,  controlled  study  which  is  accepted  for  publication.  Objective of  the  study was to compare ISRs with two different autoinjectors  during  two  one-month  open-label  cross-over periods  versus  ISRs  during  the  one-month  initiation  period  using  a  standard  s.c.  hand  injection technique  in  patients  presenting  with  RRMS  and  starting  treatment  with  IFN  beta-1b.  The  mean proportion of ISRs was significantly higher in the hand injection group (35.9%) than in the respective autoinjectors groups (24.0%; p &lt; 0.0001 and 24.1%; p &lt; 0.0001).

## DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL SAFETY

The  safety  and  tolerability  profile  for  Betaferon  found  in  the  available  study  was  as  expected  and without new aspects. In comparison to the previous studies, AEs and laboratory abnormalities were reported with a similar incidence or less often. This comparison across studies should be interpreted with caution as it is made between different population samples . However, it is likely that the titration scheme  at  the  start  of  therapy,  as  well  as  the  use  of  concomitant  medication  (i.e.  non-steroid  antiinflammatory drugs) have contributed to the good tolerability at treatment initiation. In addition, the use of an autoinjector in most of the IFNB-1b treated patients at each visit, after completion of the titration phase, might have contributed to the relatively low occurrence of AEs affecting the injection site.

Although there was no indication that the presence of NAbs reduced the efficacy of Betaferon with regard to prolongation of time to CDMS, potential effects of NAbs beyond two years could not be assessed.  Previous  pivotal  studies  using  Betaferon  in  RRMS  and  SPMS  patients  showed  no attenuating  effect  of  NAb  development  on  progression  in  disability.  Evaluation  of  the  European Betaferon  SPMS  study  showed  that  effects  of  NAb  on  relapse  rate  were  substantially  varied, depending on the statistical approach and definition of positivity, although analyses comparing lowand high-NAb positive periods with NAb negative periods suggested a titer-related effect. However, it is worthy of note that substantial proportion of NAb positive patients became NAb negative during the course of the study, similar to a follow-up report from RRMS patients from the pivotal study, with 88% of Nab positive becoming  NAb  negative  over  a  period  of  9  years  ( Polman et  al,  2003 ).  The impact of persisting NAbs will be further analysed in the BENEFIT follow-up study, in which the effects of NAbs on relapse rate and disability progression will be evaluated over a time period of up to 60 months.

## 5. Pharmacovigilance

The CHMP did not require the MAH to submit a risk management plan because other patients similar to the proposed target population have already been exposed to this class of drugs.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment

The  data  provided  support  the  benefit  of  Betaferon  in  patients  with  a  first  demyelinating  event suggestive of MS as the results from the pivotal study demonstrated a significant elongation of the time to CDMS according to the classifications of Poser and of McDonald. Conversely, a significant decrease  of  the  cumulative  number  of  new  active  MS  lesions  on  MRI  in  the  IFNB-1b  group  in comparison with the placebo group was demonstrated.

The study also confirmed the safety profile of Betaferon observed in previous studies. The safety and tolerability profile for Betaferon was as expected and without new aspects.

In light of this favourable benefit/risk profile and the clarifications provided by the MAH, Betaferon may be recommended for the treatment of patients with a first demyelinating event suggestive of MS. Therefore, the following indication is added to those already authorised:

'patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process if it is severe enough to  warrant  treatment  with intravenous  corticosteroids,  if  alternative  diagnoses  have been  excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1).'

Consequential  amendments  were  also  made  to  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SPC,  and  the package leaflet was updated accordingly.
