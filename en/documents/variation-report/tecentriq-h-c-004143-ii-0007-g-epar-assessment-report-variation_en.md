## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II group of variations

Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 12 February 2018 an application for a group of variations.

The following variations were requested in the group:

| Variations requested   | Variations requested                                                                                                           | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                  | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data              | Type II | I and IIIB         |
| C.I.6.a                | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on the interim results of study GO29436 (IMpower 150). As a consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 6.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. In addition update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the monotherapy safety data and reflect the largest pooled monotherapy population available (now including also data from study IMvigor211 and PCD4989g studies). The Package Leaflet and the RMP (version 4.0) are updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make small corrections and formatting changes throughout the SmPC.

The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0220/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0220/2015 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## MAH request for additional market protection

The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication but it was withdrawn during the procedure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, estimated to be responsible for nearly one in five cancer deaths globally (1.59 million deaths, 19.4% of the total; Globocan 2012).  There were estimated to be 1.8 million new cases in 2012 (12.9% of the total), 58% of which occurred in less developed regions.  This disease is the most common cancer in men worldwide (1.4 million, 15% of the total cancers in men) and accounts for the highest absolute number of cancer deaths globally (1.2 million deaths, 24% of cancer deaths in men).  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant subtype, accounting for approximately 85% of all cases.  NSCLC can be divided into two major histologic types: non-squamous and squamous cell carcinoma.  Non-squamous histology accounts for more than half of all NSCLC,  whereas  squamous  histology  accounts  for  approximately  30%  (Brambilla  et  al,  2014  and Schrump DS et al. NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011).

For patients who have metastatic NSCLC without an oncogenic driver mutation (such as EGFR mutations or ALK translocation), the standard of care is platinum-based chemotherapy, partnered with agents such as  taxanes  (paclitaxel,  docetaxel),  vinorelbine,  gemcitabine,  and  pemetrexed,  with  or  without bevacizumab.

The most common oncogenic driver mutations in NSCLC are EGFR mutations, seen in 10-15% of Western patients and 30-50% of East Asian patients.  To date, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and, more recently, osimertinib, represent the standard treatments for EGFR-mutated NSCLC and have dramatically improved the prognosis of NSCLC patients who harbour these mutations.  A smaller subset of NSCLC patients (2-6%) harbours the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation, which is also an oncogenic driver in NSCLC.  The first generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib and, more recently, alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor are now approved for the 1L treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. For both EGFR mutant tumours and tumours with ALK translocation, the standard of care after failure of TKIs is platinum-based chemotherapy.

Over the past 4 years, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, have emerged as effective alternatives to chemotherapy for many tumor types. In 2L+ NSCLC, PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab,  pembrolizumab)  and  PD-L1  inhibitors  (atezolizumab)  demonstrated  superiority  over docetaxel  as  monotherapy.    Subsequently,  it  was  also  shown  that  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  is effective in the first line setting for patients who express high levels of PD-L1.  Pembrolizumab is currently approved for 1L treatment of NSCLC patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 (≥ 50% tumor proportion score).

Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is an Fc-engineered humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks interaction of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 (B7-H1) ligands.

In the European Union (EU), atezolizumab has been granted Marketing Authorization for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior platinum containing chemotherapy (provided tha t p atients with EGFR activating mutations or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Tecentriq), and for the treatment of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  UC  after  treatment  with  platinum  containing chemotherapy or who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%.

The current submission supports the extension of the licensed indication to the use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel for the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC.  The evidence comes from IMpower150 (GO29436), a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Phase III  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  atezolizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  + paclitaxel with (Atezo + Bev + CP) or without (Atezo + CP) bevacizumab, versus carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab (Bev + CP), in metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in the first-line (1L) setting.

The following indication was adopted by the CHMP:

'Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment  of  adult  patients  with  metastatic  non-squamous  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  In patients  with  EGFR  mutant  or  ALK-positive  NSCLC,  Tecentriq,  in  combination  with  bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies'

During the induction phase, the recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered by intravenous infusion, followed by bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and then carboplatin every three weeks for four or six cycles.

The induction phase is  followed by a maintenance  phase without chemotherapy in which 1,200 mg Tecentriq followed by bevacizumab, is administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Atezolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and does not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), atezolizumab is exempt from the submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The PK objectives for the IMpower150 study were the following:

- To characterize the PK of atezolizumab when given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel with and without bevacizumab (Arms A and B)
- To characterize the PK of carboplatin when given in combination with paclitaxel with and without atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab (Arms A, B, and C)
- To characterize the PK of paclitaxel when given in combination with carboplatin with and without atezolizumab and/ or bevacizumab (Arms A, B, and C)
- To characterize the PK of bevacizumab when given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel with and without atezolizumab (Arms B and C)

## Analytical methods

Plasma concentrations of paclitaxel were determined by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS) method with Paclitaxel-d5 as an internal standard and ranged from 2-2500 ng/mL. Covance, Madison US.

Carboplatin plasma concentrations were determined by quantitation of platinum using a validated inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method with Iridium as an internal standard. The method ranged from 100-10,000 ng/mL Archinova, UK.

A validated indirect sandwich ELISA was used to quantify atezolizumab in human serum.

The method for the quantification of bevacizumab concentrations was an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

## Anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing

All ADA samples were screened in validated bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Atezolizumab ADA testing was conducted at ICON Laboratory Services, Inc. (ICON). Bevacizumab ADA testing was conducted at QPS, Netherlands B.V.

Any sample that was deemed positive by the screening ADA assay was assessed for ADA specificity to the specific molecule (atezolizumab or bevacizumab) using a confirmatory competitive bridging ELISA. Samples that were confirmed positive were then serially diluted to obtain a titer value.

Using a surrogate positive control antibody, the relative sensitivity of the atezolizumab ADA screening assay was determined to be 20.4 ng/mL in the absence of atezolizumab. The ADA screening assays were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

able to detect 500 ng/mL of the surrogate positive control in the presence of 200 µg/mL atezolizumab to enable the detection of ADAs in the presence of high trough levels of atezolizumab.

Using a surrogate positive control antibody, the relative sensitivity of the bevacizumab ADA screening assay was determined to be 7.72 ng/mL in the absence of bevacizumab. The ADA screening assays were able to detect 500 ng/mL of the surrogate positive control in the presence of 100 µg/mL bevacizumab to enable the detection of ADAs in the presence of high trough levels of bevacizumab.Pharmacokinetic data

The descriptive statistics of the available Cmax (30 minutes following the end of the infusion in Cycle 1 or Cycle 3) and Cmin (pre-dose) concentrations of atezolizumab in serum for the Atezo+CP arm and Atezo +Bev +CP arm following 1200 mg q3w IV administration are summarized in Table 1. Steady state based on trough concentration (Cmin) was reached by approximately Cycle 3.

## ADA results from IMpower150

The baseline prevalence of atezolizumab ADAs was 2.9% in the Atezo +Bev +CP arm and 4.6% in the Atezo +CP arm for atezolizumab-treated patients with a baseline ADA sample. The post-baseline treatment-emergent ADA incidences were comparable in both arms where patients received atezolizumab, with ADA-positive incidences of 36.4% in the Atezo +Bev +CP arm and 38.5% in the Atezo +CP arm. Average atezolizumab Cmin for both ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients appeared to approach a plateau (or steady-state) between 4-8 cycles of dosing. There was a consistent trend for lower exposure in ADA-positive patients, but Cmin for both groups was in excess of the target serum concentration of 6 µg/mL.

Of 787 ADA evaluable patients in the safety evaluable population, one patient had a positive, treatment induced bevacizumab ADA and the baseline prevalence was &lt;2%.

## 2.3.3. PK/PD modelling

## Overview of population Pharmacokinetics

The popPK of atezolizumab was first assessed based on Phase I data from two clinical studies PCD4989g and JO28944 (n = 472 patients, 4563 PK samples).  This 'Phase I popPK Model' was subsequently subjected to an external evaluation with the use of atezolizumab PK data collected in Study IMpower150.

The objectives of this analysis were to:

- Assess the PK of atezolizumab in chemotherapy naive patients with non-squamous NSCLC in Study IMpower150 through external evaluation of the Phase 1 popPK Model
- Derive exposure metrics of atezolizumab in chemotherapy naive non-squamous NSCLC patients in the IMpower150 study
- Explore the potential impact of chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab coadministration on atezolizumab PK

The IMpower150 population PK dataset included 4386 evaluable atezolizumab serum concentrations from 778 patients with NSCLC receiving 1200 mg of atezolizumab q3w by IV infusion. In the Atezo+CP Arm, there were 395 patients receiving both atezolizumab and chemotherapy (carboplatin+paclitaxel) and 383 patients in the Atezo+Bev+CP Arm who received Atezolizumab+chemotherapy+bevacizumab.

Population  PK  analysis  was  performed  using  a  non-linear  mixed-effects  modelling  approach  with NONMEM, Version 7.3 (ICON Development Solutions, USA). Perl-Speaks-NONMEM (PsN) (Version 3.7.6 Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to evaluate/validate the population PK model using predictive checks. Data exploration and visualization as well as descriptive statistics were performed using R+ V3.3.1 in addition to Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) packages.

A population PK model of atezolizumab developed previously using Phase 1 data was used to predict IMpower150 data and to derive the individual Bayesian post-hoc PK parameter estimates based on the observed time-concentration profiles in IMpower150 data. The atezolizumab Phase 1 popPK model was a two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination including covariate effects. The model used was the final model including covariate effects.

The  number  of  evaluable  PK  concentrations  (with  concentrations  above  the  assay  LOQ),  excluded samples, samples below the limit of quantification (BLQ) as well as the total number of patients included in the analysis are presented in Table 4. Serum atezolizumab concentrations versus time were explored graphically for identification of outliers. Of the 778 patients included in the population PK dataset, the ratio of males to females was 468:310 (60.2% male). Median age was 63 years (range: 31-89 years) and body weight ranged from 37 to 196 kg. Approximately 81.5% of the patients were white.

## Covariates

Missing covariates values, when missing in less than 15% of the total number of patients, were imputed to median values by gender for continuous covariates or to the most frequent category for categorical covariates. No unexpected covariate effect was identified in the IMpower150 study. Exploratory analyses of  the  relationships  between  individual  CL,  V1  and  V2  patient-level  random  effects  and  covariates (continuous,  categorical,  and  including  body  weight,  albumin,  tumor  burden,  gender,  and  ATAG) indicated that covariate effects in IMpower150 data were generally consistent with those identified in the Phase 1 popPK Model. For any observed trends, no effect reached p &lt; 0.001.

## Model diagnostics

The ability of the Phase 1 popPK Model to describe atezolizumab PK in NSCLC patients was evaluated by external prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPC) based on atezolizumab concentrations from 778 patients out of 802 ITT patients (97%). The pcVPC was performed using Cmax and Cmin atezolizumab data by grouping peak or trough samples for the entire period of treatment. Only the IMpower150 PK visits with at least 40 samples were displayed on the plots. Using time-after-dose, peaks were defined for samples occurring between 0.01 and 1-day post-dose while troughs were defined for samples occurring between 10 and 30 days post-dose. PK samples from the visit 120 days after the last dose were not used for the evaluation. For each peak/trough grouping, 95% prediction intervals (PIs) of the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of simulated concentrations were computed across 1000 replicates and compared to the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of observed concentrations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The pcVPC as external evaluation revealed an adequate performance of the model for the peak and the troughs of Cycle 1 to 3.  A trend to under-prediction of the exposure  was observed after long-term treatment.

The 90% PIs of the concentration-time profiles over 50 weeks and concentration versus time-after-dose (cycle  5  and  later)  profiles,  were  simulated  across  100  replicates  and  compared  to  observed concentrations. The atezolizumab concentrations from the visit, '120 days after the last dose' were included.

The goodness-of fit plots suggested that the model was able to describe the PK profiles well without re-estimating the Phase 1 popPK Model population parameters. No trends were observed in goodness-of fit plots at the individual level after post-hoc Bayesian estimation, indicating that the Phase 1 popPK Model allowed reliable estimates of individual parameters in Phase 3 patients.

## Estimation of atezolizumab exposure

Individual CL, V1 and V2 patient-level random effects estimated with the Phase 1 popPK Model were used to predict atezolizumab concentration profiles and calculate exposure metrics both at Cycle 1 and Cycle 10 (steady state). The predicted cycle 1 and steady-state PK profiles for each individual were based on the starting dose (dose on Day 1 given q3w, and the actual duration of infusion for cycle 1, then 30 min of infusion for all the subsequent doses and time points: 0, every 0.01 day for the first 3 days, every 0.5 days until 20.99 days post-dose at cycle 1 and at steady-state.

## 2.3.4. Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology

The covariate effects in IMpower150 data were consistent with those identified in the Phase I popPK Model.  Atezolizumab  ADA-positive  patients  (about  one  third  of  all  patients)  experienced  lower atezolizumab exposure expressed as Cmin (about 20%) than ADA-negative but all in excess of the target serum concentration (6 µg/mL).

Due to the low sample size in the ADA-positive population (n=101 in the Atezo+Bev+CP arm and n=96 in the Atezo+CP arm), the Applicant provided the exposure-response (ER) OS analyses in two exposure groups divided by median first cycle Cmin (High: Cmin ≥ median; Low: Cmin &lt;median). (data not shown)

The Applicant presented, upon request, an overview of post baseline incidence of ADA across 8 clinical studies  (data  not  shown).  The  frequency  of  %  ADA  positive  seems  independent  of  indication  and treatment ranging from 30.4% to 54.5%.

There is a trend towards lower efficacy in the Cmin &lt;median subgroup (without Adjustment of Baseline Imbalanced Prognostic Factors). This is more pronounced in the ADA+ population of the Atezo+CP Arm; the HR (95% PI) for low and high exposure (Cmin) groups were 1.0 (0.74, 1.3) and 0.8 (0.58, 1.1), respectively, in ADA-positive patients who received Atezo + CP after adjustment of prognostic factors (TGI-OS model simulations).

In the data submitted during the procedure, the exposure of ADA+ patients in the low-exposure group (Atezo+CP arm; arm A) was slightly lower compared to that of the Atezo+Bev+CP arm (arm B). It is however agreed that there was a large overlap in exposure range between the two arms; the HR (95% PI) for low and high exposure (Cmin) groups were 0.66 (0.43, 0.93) and 0.71 (0.50, 1.0), respectively, in ADA-positive patients who received Atezo+Bev+CP after adjustment of prognostic factors (TGI-OS model simulations).

Summary of best overall Response in ADA+Patients, Low Exposure Group (Cmin &lt;Median) for Arm A (Atezo+CP) and Arm B (Atezo+Bev+CP) indicated a higher percentage of patients in IMpower150 Study in  Arm  B  showing  complete  response,  partial  response  and  lower  percentage  regarding  progressive disease. Individual plots of overall survival in ADA+ patients indicated comparable results regarding both arms.

Samples collected for ADA evaluation in the IMpower150 study were not evaluated for neutralising ADA's. Although it is considered acceptable that nADA data are not submitted within the present procedure, the Applicant should provide this data post-approval. Furthermore, the MAH is recommended to conduct an assessment of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, PFS, and ORR in NSCLC Studies POPLAR, OAK, IMpower150, IMpower130, IMpower131, and IMpower132. The MAH has presented an acceptable proposal/plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  goodness-of-fit  plots  for  population  and  individual  predictions  appeared  adequate.  Individual weighted residuals (IWRES) were evenly distributed around 0, suggesting no bias in the predictions of high and low concentrations of atezolizumab. The pcVPC revealed the mean atezolizumab concentrations were under-predicted after long term use (after Cycle 3). This effect, not captured by the model, was suggested to be caused by a decrease in clearance and considered as being of no clinical relevance. The Phase 1 popPK Model is suitable to describe the individual PK data from the IMpower150 Study and seems suitable for determination of atezolizumab exposure metrics (Cycle 1 and steady-state) for comparison of the  exposure  between  two  treatment  arms,  with  and  without  bevacizumab,  in  patients  from  Study IMpower150.

The  mean  atezolizumab  exposure,  expressed  as  AUC  (after  a  single  dose  and  at  steady-state)  and achieved after simulation using individual predicted Cl and V1/V2 parameters, were slightly higher in the arm with bevacizumab. The exposure difference between the arms was highest at steady-state but not considered clinically relevant.

The exposure during Cycle 1 and after long-term therapy seems to be similar in both arms: in presence or absence of bevacizumab, indicating no impact of co-administration of bevacizumab on atezolizumab PK. Both cycle 1 and steady-state exposure metrics were similar to those estimated in other NSCLC studies using atezolizumab in monotherapy, which suggested that the atezolizumab exposure is not impacted by the co-administration of the chemotherapy (carboplatin+paclitaxel).

It is agreed that atezolizumab PK is not affected by the presence or absence of bevacizumab.

In order to address the uncertainties in relation to ADA, the MAH is recommended:

-To  submit  and  discuss  the  neutralising  ADA  data  for  both  atezolizumab  monotherapy  and  when co-administered with Carboplatin-paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in IMpower150.

- To submit an assessment of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, PFS,  and  ORR  in  NSCLC  Studies  POPLAR,  OAK,  IMpower150,  IMpower130,  IMpower131,  and IMpower132.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

No additional dose-response study was performed, and data are limited to those submitted at the time of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application. The 1200 mg Q3W dose was used in the OAK study and therefore approved in 2L-NSCLC.

## 2.4.2. Main study

IMpower150 (GO29436): A Phase III, open-label, randomized study of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab compared with carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab in chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer

## Methods

The study enrolled an 'all-comer' patient population, meaning that patients were eligible for the study regardless of their PD-L1 expression level in tumour tissue, and included those with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK)-positive tumours (EGFR mutant/ALK + ). No prior treatment for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC was allowed except for EGFR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mutant/ALK+ patients who had experienced progressive disease (PD) (during or after treatment) or intolerance to treatment with one or more EGFR or ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), respectively.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment regimens:

- Arm A treatment: atezolizumab +carboplatin + paclitaxel (Atezo + CP) (induction: four or six 21-day cycles); atezolizumab (maintenance: 21-day cycles)
- Arm B treatment: atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin+ paclitaxel (Atezo + Bev + CP) (induction: four or six 21-day cycles); atezolizumab + bevacizumab (maintenance: 21-day cycles)
- Arm C treatment: bevacizumab + carboplatin+ paclitaxel (Bev + CP) (induction: four or six 21-day cycles); bevacizumab (maintenance: 21-day cycles)

<!-- image -->

The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients, regardless of receipt of the assigned treatment.

The  ITT -WT population is defined as the  ITT population excluding patients with an activating EGFR mutation or ALK translocation. As stated in the SAP, sensitizing EGFR mutations include all activating EGFR in exons 18 through 21.

The Teff gene signature population is defined using expression of a T-effector gene signature in tumor tissue,  as  analyzed  using  a  centrally  performed  (Targos),  quantitative,  real-time,  polymerase  chain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reaction based clinical trial assay developed by Roche Molecular Systems. This signature is defined by the average mRNA expression of 3 genes  PD-L1 (CD274), CXCL9, and IFNγ , normalized to a reference gene.  It  is  a  surrogate  for  both  PD-L1  expression  and  a  pre-existing  immunity  within  the  tumour microenvironment (Kowanetz et al, 2017). The Teff-high population is defined as patients in the ITT population with Teff signature expression ≥ -1.91. On the converse, the Teff-low population is defined as ITT patients with Teff signature expression &lt;-1.91.

The Teff-high WT population is defined as the Teff-high population excluding patients with an activating EGFR mutation or ALK translocation.

<!-- image -->

The PD-L1 population is defined as one of the following: TC2/3 or IC2/3 population, defined as ITT patients with PD-L1 TC2/3 or IC2/3 expression in baseline tumor tissue; PD-L1 TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population is defined as ITT patients with PD-L1 TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 expression in baseline tumor tissue.

The PD-L1 WT populations are defined as the PD-L1 populations (TC2/3 or IC2/3 population or TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3  population)  excluding  patients  with  an  activating  EGFR  mutation  (see  above)  or  ALK translocation.

*PD-L1 populations: To asses PD-L1 status, sections from tumour specimens from eligible patients were prospectively stained and evaluated by an external central laboratory using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) IHC assay, according to scoring algorithm measuring PD-L1 on tumor cells (TC) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) (see the following Table). Patients were subsequently stratified at TC3 or IC2 cut-off at enrollment. TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, as well as TC2/3 or IC2/3 scores used for the secondary endpoint analyses were determined from re-reads to corresponding cut-offs prior to database lock for the primary PFS analysis, using the same previously PD-L1 stained tumor sections from the enrollment. TC3 or IC3 scores were derived from raw percentage scores also prior to the database lock.

No dose reductions were permitted in the study for atezolizumab or bevacizumab. If AEs occurred that necessitated withholding atezolizumab or bevacizumab, the dose remained unchanged once treatment resumed. Dose reductions, interruptions, and discontinuation of carboplatin and paclitaxel were allowed.

No crossover was permitted from the control arm (Arm C) to either of the experimental arms (Arm A and B).  Following  the  induction  phase,  patients  continued  treatment  with  maintenance  therapy.  Patients received study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel), or loss of clinical benefit (atezolizumab), or study termination by the Sponsor.

- To  evaluate  investigator-assessed  ORR,  PFS,  and  DOR,  according  to  modified  RECIST  for  the atezolizumab-containing treatment arms
- To evaluate PFS at 6 months and at 1 year in each treatment arm
- To evaluate the OS rate at 3 years in each treatment arm
- To assess predictive, prognostic, and pharmacodynamic exploratory biomarkers in archival and/or fresh tumor tissue and blood and their association with disease status, mechanisms of resistance, and/or response to study treatment
- To evaluate the utility of biopsy at the time of apparent PD to distinguish apparent increases in tumor volume related to the immunomodulatory activity of atezolizumab (i.e., pseudoprogression/tumor-immune infiltration) from true PD

· To evaluate and compare patient's health status as assessed by the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 3-Level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire to generate utility scores for use in economic models for reimbursement

· To determine the impact of atezolizumab as measured by change from baseline in patient-reported outcomes  (PROs)  of  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL),  lung  cancer-related  symptoms,  and functioning as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13

## Outcomes/endpoints

The co-primary efficacy endpoints were PFS as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 in the Teff-high WT and the ITT-WT populations, and OS in the ITT-WT populations. Secondary endpoints are PFS and OS in other populations, PFS as assessed by IRF, ORR and DOR.

If the difference in OS between Atezo+CP (Arm A) and Bev+CP (Arm C) in the ITT-WT population is statistically  significant,  a  comparison  of  Atezo+Bev+CP  (Arm  B)  versus  Bev+CP  (Arm  C)  and  a comparison of Atezo+CP (Arm A) versus Bev+CP (Arm C) will be conducted in the Teff-high population and the ITT population, with a comparison of Atezo+Bev+CP (Arm B) versus Bev+CP (Arm C) prioritized.

Tumor assessments occurred every 6 weeks (± 7 days) for 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks (± 7 days) after the completion of the Week 48 tumor assessment, regardless of treatment delays, until radiographic PD per RECIST v1.1 (or loss of clinical benefit for atezolizumab-treated patients who had continued treatment after radiographic PD according to RECIST v1.1), withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurred first.

## Sample size

The sample size of this study was based on the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to both PFS and OS (co-primary endpoints) for the comparison of the Atezo+Bev+CP arm versus Bev+CP arm.

The  estimate  of  the  number  of  events  required  to  demonstrate  efficacy  with  regard  to  PFS  in  the comparison of Atezo+Bev+CP arm versus Bev+CP arm was based on the following assumptions:

· One-sided significance level of 0.003 for the comparison of the Atezo + Bev + CP arm versus Bev + CP arm in the Teff-high WT population

· One-sided significance level of 0.003 for the comparison of the Atezo + Bev + CP arm versus Bev + CP arm in the ITT -WT population

· 98% power to detect an HR of 0.55, corresponding to an improvement in median PFS from 6 months to 10.9 months in the Teff-high WT population

· 98% power to detect an HR of 0.65, corresponding to an improvement in median PFS from 6 months to 9.2 months in the ITT -WT population

· No interim analysis for PFS

· Dropout rate of 5% per 12 months

The  estimate  of  the  number  of  events  required  to  demonstrate  efficacy  with  regard  to  OS  in  the comparison of the Atezo+Bev+CP arm versus Bev +CP arm was based on the following assumptions:

· One-sided significance level of 0.019 for the comparison of the Atezo + Bev + CP arm versus Bev + CP arm in the ITT -WT population

· 87% power to detect an HR of 0.75, corresponding to an improvement in median OS from 12 months to 16 months in the ITT-WT population

· One interim OS analysis performed at the time of the final PFS analysis, at which time approximately 73% of the total number of OS events required for the final analysis are expected to have occurred as determined through use of the Lan-DeMets approximation to the O'Brien-Fleming boundary

· Dropout rate of 5% per 24 months

The estimate of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to PFS and OS in the comparison of the Atezo+CP arm versus Bev+CP arm was based on assumptions similar to those outlined above.

With  these  assumptions,  approximately  1200  patients  in  total  were  enrolled  into  this  study,  with approximately  720  patients  in  each  comparison  in  the  ITT-WT  population.  The  ITT-WT  population included  approximately  1080  patients,  assuming  10%  prevalence  for  sensitizing EGFR mutations  or ALK-positive disease. The Teff-high WT population included approximately 540 patients, assuming 50% prevalence with the chosen Teff cutoff.

## Randomisation

Randomization  to  one  of  the  three  treatment  arms  occurred  in  a  1:1:1  ratio.  Permuted  block randomization was applied to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm. Randomization was stratified by the following criteria:

- Sex (male vs. female)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Presence of liver metastases at baseline (yes vs. no)
- PD-L1 expression by IHC (TC3 and any IC vs. TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 vs. TC0/1/2 and IC0/1)

Patients received their first dose of study drug on the day of randomization if possible.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study. The Sponsor was blinded to treatment arm allocation and patient-level data on PD-L1 expression and Teff gene signature until the database had been locked for analysis.

## Statistical methods

Treatment comparisons were conducted by first comparing Arm B versus Arm C and then comparing Arm A versus Arm C based on a stratified log-rank test in the biomarker-selected Teff-high-WT and ITT-WT populations for the PFS endpoint and in the ITT-WT population for the OS endpoint. ITT population is tested after ITT-WT population. For each comparison, analyses were conducted according to α-spending algorithm to control for the one-sided type I error rate (0.025) and to account for an interim OS analysis.

Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the median PFS and the median OS for each treatment arm, and a Kaplan-Meier curve was constructed to provide a visual description of the difference between treatment arms. The Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology was used to construct the 95% CI for the median PFS and the median OS for each treatment arm.

Definition, censoring and methodology for primary and secondary endpoints has been previously detailed in the Summary of analysis methods for efficacy parameters (Outcomes/endpoints section).

## Hypotheses

The null and alternative hypotheses regarding PFS and OS in each population (Teff-high WT, ITT-WT) can be phrased in terms of the survival functions SA(t) or SB(t) for the atezolizumab-containing arms and SC(t) for the control arm:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The HRs, λA/λC and λB/λC (where λA, λB, and C represent the hazard of having a PFS or death in the Atezo+CP, Atezo+Bev+CP and Bev+CP arms, respectively), comparing the treatment effect between the two treatment arms, was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with the same stratification variables used for the stratified log-rank test, and the 95% CI was provided.

## Discussion on modification of endpoints along study design:

Initially, the co-primary endpoints for this study were investigator-assessed PFS in the ITT population and PD-L1 population (protocol version 1). However, efficacy data with atezolizumab and other check-point inhibitors in 2L+ NSCLC show that OS is in fact the most sensitive endpoint for cancer immunotherapy in the monotherapy setting. For example, in the randomized Phase III Study GO28915 (OAK) in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC, an OS benefit with atezolizumab monotherapy compared with docetaxel was observed in the ITT population, with a stratified HR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.87). PFS in the ITT population was similar between both treatment arms: HR of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.10). These data, together with the fact that OS is the most objective measure of clinical benefit for patients with advanced/unresectable or metastatic lung cancer, led to the inclusion of OS as a co-primary endpoint, along with the PFS primary endpoints (protocol version 5). Since an OS analysis might be confounded by the fact that many of patients in IMpower150 would likely receive subsequent immunotherapy after progression,  crossover  from  the  control  arm  to  either  of  the  experimental  arms  after  PD  was  not permitted.  In  addition  to  changes  to  the  primary  efficacy  objectives  during  the  IMpower150  study conduct, the primary analysis populations were also modified to exclude patients with known activating EGFR mutations or ALK-positive tumors. These populations are defined as 'wild-type' patients (ITT-WT and Teff-high WT populations; protocol version 6). This change was based on the observations from monotherapy  studies  in  2L+  NSCLC  where  the  survival  benefit  of  immunotherapy  was  similar  to chemotherapy in the EGFRmutant/ALK+ patients, whereas OS was clinically and numerically improved in patients that did not have driver mutations such as EGFR mutation or ALK translocation.

Furthermore, the primary biomarker analysis population was also changed from PD-L1 expression by IHC to expression of a Teff gene signature, defined as the Teff-high WT population. The Teff gene signature had been identified based on analyses in the POPLAR (Phase II Study GO28753) and OAK studies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. These analyses had shown that the Teff signature may have a stronger association with efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy than PD-L1 expression on TCs and/or ICs as determined by IHC. More detail on the Teff gene signature is provided in Section 3.8.2. Efficacy in Teff-high and ITT populations (including EGFR mutant/ALK+ patients) were pre-specified as secondary objectives.

## Interim analyses

No interim analyses were planned for the co-primary endpoint of PFS in this study.

The final PFS analysis was conducted when both of the following criteria had been met: approximately 516 PFS events had occurred in the Atezo+Bev+CP and Bev+CP arms combined in the ITT-WT population and the last patient had enrolled in the study. The final PFS analysis was expected to occur approximately 29 months after the first patient was enrolled. At the time of the final PFS analysis, it was expected that approximately 249 events would have occurred in the Teff-high WT population. These numbers of events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

would allow for a minimum detectable difference corresponding to an HR of approximately 0.70 in the Teff-high WT population and 0.78 in the ITT-WT population.

The OS interim analysis for the primary comparison of Arm B versus Arm C will be conducted by the Sponsor at the time of the final PFS analysis for the primary comparisons. It is expected that there will be approximately  370  OS  events  in  the  ITT-WT  population  in  the  combined  Arm  B  and  Arm  C  at  this timepoint, in which case an interim OS analysis will be conducted with the stopping boundaries for the OS interim  and  final  analyses  computed  using  the  Lan-DeMets  approximation  to  the  O'Brien-Fleming boundary. If there are significantly fewer than 370 OS events at the PFS final analysis, a nominal α of 0.01% (negligible impact on overall type I error rate) could be spent on the OS analysis at the time of the PFS final analysis. The next interim will be conducted after approximately 370 OS events are observed, with the stopping boundaries for the OS interim and final analyses calculated the same way as above.

The final OS analysis for the primary comparison of Atezo+Bev+CP arm versus Bev+CP arm will be conducted when there are approximately 507 OS events in the ITT-WT population in the combined Atezo +Bev+CP and Bev+CP arms. This number of events corresponds to a minimum detectable difference in HR  of  approximately  0.83  in  the  ITT-WT  population.  The  OS  final  analysis  is  expected  to  occur approximately 40 months after the first patient was randomized.

## Subgroup analyses

The consistency of PFS and OS results in subgroups will be examined in the populations where PFS and/or OS benefit had been demonstrated. The subgroups were defined by the following:

- Demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity)
- Baseline disease characteristics (e.g., ECOG performance status; presence of liver metastases at baseline; smoking status; metastatic sites such as brain, bone, etc.; EGFR mutation status; Kirsten rat sarcoma [ KRAS ] mutation status; EML4-ALK rearrangement status, intended number of cycles of induction treatment, etc.)
- PD-L1 IHC status (e.g., TC3 or IC3, TC2/3 or IC2/3, TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, and their corresponding complementary groups)
- Complementary  biomarker  population  defined  by  Teff  cutoff  value  -  1.91  and  additional biomarker populations defined by the Teff cutoff values of - 2.38 and - 2.93

Summaries of PFS and OS, including the unstratified HR estimated from a Cox proportional hazards model and KM estimates of median PFS and OS, were produced separately for each level of the subgroup for the comparisons between two treatment arms and displayed in a forest plot. KM plots of PFS and/or OS were also produced for selected subgroups. Summaries of ORR by subgroup are also provided.

## Sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity  analyses  will  be  performed  to  evaluate  the  potential  impact  of  missing  scheduled  tumor assessments  on  the  primary  analysis  of  PFS,  as  determined  by  the  investigator  using  a  PFS  event imputation rule. The following two imputation rules will be considered:

· If a patient missed two or more scheduled tumor assessments immediately prior to the date of the PFS event according to RECIST v1.1, the patient will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to the first of these missed visits.

· If a patient missed two or more tumor assessments scheduled immediately prior to the date of the PFS event according to RECIST v1.1, the patient will be counted as having progressed on the date of the first of these missing assessments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The imputation rule will be applied to patients in all treatment arms. Statistical methodologies analogous to those used in the primary analysis of PFS will be used for this sensitivity analysis.

If &gt; 5% of patients received non-protocol therapy before a PFS event in any treatment arm, a sensitivity analysis will be performed for the comparisons between two treatment arms (i.e., Arm A vs. Arm C, Arm B vs. Arm C and, if applicable, Arm A vs. Arm B) in which patients who receive non-protocol therapy before a PFS event will be censored at the last tumor assessment date before receipt of non-protocol therapy.

If &gt; 5% of patients are lost to follow-up for OS in either treatment arm, a sensitivity analysis will be performed for the comparisons between two treatment arms (i.e., Arm A vs. Arm C, Arm B vs. Arm C, and, if applicable, Arm A vs. Arm B) in which patients who are lost to follow-up will be considered as having died at the last date they were known to be alive.

Atezo=Atezolizumab, Bev=Bevacizumab, CP=Carboplatin+Paclitaxel. Data Cut-off: 15 Sep 2017; RAVE Data Extracted: 10 Nov 2017.

## Recruitment

In the ITT population, a total of 2166 patients were screened; of these, 1202 patients from 240 centers in 26 countries were randomized.

The first patient was randomized on 31 March 2015. The last patient was randomized on 30 December 2016. Data Cut-off was on 15 September 2017.

The number of patients randomized per country, followed by the number of centers (in parentheses), is summarized below:

United States 266 (61), Spain 138 (20), Germany 94 (17), Japan 93 (15), Australia 88 (16), Ukraine 74 (13), France 72 (12), Italy 50 (11), Chile 44 (3), Netherlands 39 (12), Russia 37 (5), Taiwan 34 (10), Brazil 27 (9), Portugal 23 (6), Latvia 17 (2), Belgium 16 (2), Switzerland 14 (3), Austria 12 (2), Argentina 10 (7), Bulgaria 10 (2), Mexico 9 (3), Peru 9 (3), Singapore 9 (1), Slovakia 8 (3), Canada 6 (1), Lithuania 3 (1).

Failed screening: A total of 964 patients failed screening based on information collected on the IxRS. The most common reasons for screen failure were lack of known PD-L1 tumor status by IHC (137 patients), prior treatment for Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC (127 patients), and a history of treated asymptomatic CNS metastases that failed specific protocol eligibility criteria (94 patients).

Allocation: A total of 1202 patients were randomized: 400 patients to the Bev+CP arm, 400 patients to the Atezo+Bev+CP arm and 402 patients to the Atezo+CP arm. Overall, 15 patients did not receive any study treatment (6 patients each in the Bev+CP and Atezo+Bev+CP arms and 3 patients in the Atezo+CP arm).

Discontinuation from Study: In the ITT population, a higher proportion of patients discontinued from the study in the Bev+CP arm (53.0%) compared with the Atezo+Bev+CP (41.8%) and Atezo+CP (46.0%) arms. The most common reason for study discontinuation was death (42.5% of all patients).

Follow up: The median duration of survival follow-up among ITT patients was consistent across the arms: 15.4  months  in  the  Bev+CP  arm  (range  0.0-28.6),  15.1  months  in  the  Atezo+Bev+CP  arm  (range 0.0-26.3), and 15.4 months in the Atezo+CP arm (range 0.0-25.1). As of the clinical cutoff date of 15 September 2017, two untreated patients remained on study; 13 untreated patients had discontinued the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study due to withdrawal by subject (3 patients), death (3), other (3), protocol violation (2), and physician decision (2).

## Conduct of the study

The first version of the protocol was issued on 21 November 2014 and was amended five times. The key changes to the protocol are summarized below.

- o Protocol Amendment 1 (Version 2) - 29 March 2015

Protocol  GO29436  was  amended  to  clarify  the  inclusion  criterion  on  contraception  and  extend  the requirement  for  its  use  to  6  months  after  last  dose  of  study  drug  for  all  patients  randomized  to  a bevacizumab-containing treatment arm. In addition, reporting for SAEs and AESIs was extended to 90 days after last dose of study treatment or until initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first.

- o Protocol Amendment 2 (Version 3) - 14 August 2015

Major changes to Protocol GO29436, Version 3 are as follows:

The evaluations of PFS at 6 months and at 1 year and OS at 3 years were added as exploratory objectives.

The  contraception  requirements  in  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  and  the  pregnancy-reporting information were revised to comply with prescribing information for bevacizumab.

The study inclusion criteria were modified to allow for patients with treated, asymptomatic cerebellar metastases to be enrolled provided that specific criteria were met.

The exclusion criteria for history of autoimmune disease was broadened to allow for patients with eczema, psoriasis, or lichen simplex chronicus of vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis were excluded) to be permitted, provided that they met the specific conditions.

The study exclusion criterion regarding treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents within 6 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever was shorter) prior to randomization was modified to 4 weeks prior to randomization.

The exclusion criterion specifying that patients with a history of allergic reaction to intravenous contrast that required steroid pretreatment should have baseline and subsequent tumor assessments performed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was removed. Patients with contraindications to contrast could have assessments done with non-contrast computed tomography or MRI.

Bevacizumab was changed to an investigational medicinal product (IMP). Text was added to clarify that bevacizumab would be supplied to all sites by the Sponsor.

The guideline to administer paclitaxel 60 minutes after the completion of bevacizumab was removed. Paclitaxel could be administered immediately following the completion of bevacizumab.

Additional requirements were added for hepatitis B and hepatitis C testing to ensure that patients did not have active disease at screening.

Additional detail was added to ensure that PRO assessments were collected as intended for patients who discontinued treatment for any reason other than PD or loss of clinical benefit (for atezolizumab-treated patients who continued treatment beyond RECIST v1.1 PD and who continued atezolizumab).

Collection of mandatory tumour specimens, if clinically feasible, was now required for all patients.

- o Protocol Amendment 3 (Version 4) - 11 November 2015

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Protocol GO29436, Version 4 was amended to clarify that a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks or five half-lives, whichever was longer, of any systemic immunomodulatory agent was required prior to enrollment.

- o Protocol Amendment 4 (Version 5) - 31 May 2016

Protocol GO29436, Version 5 was amended to add a co-primary endpoint of OS to the PFS primary endpoint  due  to  recent  data  suggesting  that  OS  may  be  a  more  sensitive  endpoint  for  cancer immunotherapy. Changes were made to the statistical testing procedure, accordingly. In addition, this amendment includes the following key changes:

A secondary efficacy objective and outcome measure was added to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab as measured by investigator-assessed TTR according to RECIST v1.1 for the ITT population, the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population, and the TC2/3 or IC2/3 population.

The exploratory objectives and outcome measures to evaluate IRF assessment of PFS, overall response rate,  disease  control  rate,  duration  of  response,  and  TIR  according  to  modified  RECIST  for  the atezolizumab-containing treatment arms were removed.

The inclusion criteria were modified to specify that patients who had received prior radiotherapy with curative intent had to be treatment-free for at least a 6-month interval prior to randomization.

Based on the half-life of atezolizumab of 27 days, the length of female patient contraception and follow-up of pregnancy reporting was revised from 90 days to 5 months. The contraception requirements for male patients  and  pregnancy-reporting  requirements  for  female  partners  of  male  patients  who  received atezolizumab were updated on the basis of the safety information for atezolizumab.

General  medical  exclusion  criteria  were  revised  to  include  cerebrovascular  accident  as  a  significant cardiovascular  disease  and  to exclude  patients  with  illnesses  or  conditions  that  interfered  with  their capacity to understand, follow, and/or comply with the study procedures.

Two  exclusion  criteria  were  added  related  to  bevacizumab  in  response  to  fatal  adverse  events  of pulmonary hemorrhage that occurred in the study and to be consistent with other clinical studies that use bevacizumab: clear  tumour  infiltration  into  the  thoracic  great  vessels  is  seen  on  imaging  and  clear cavitation of pulmonary lesions is seen on imaging. These additional exclusion criteria were endorsed by the iDMC.

Permitted therapy was modified by removing hormonal therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists for prostate cancer because they are considered anti-cancer therapies.

Traditional herbal medicines were removed from prohibited therapies, and language was added to state that concomitant use of herbal therapies was not recommended. Use of herbal therapies for patients in the study was allowed only at the discretion of the investigator, provided that there were no known interactions with any study treatment.

The screening assessments were revised, specifying that either a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the pelvis was required at screening.

The timepoint for the whole blood sample collection at Cycle 1, Day 1 was moved to screening to enable the sample to be taken prior to any Cycle 1, Day 1 pretreatment with steroids.

For patients who discontinued study treatment for any reason other than PD or loss of clinical benefit, the schedule  of  subsequent  electronic  PRO  (ePRO)  assessments  had  changed  to  align  with  the  tumor assessment schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients whose native language was not available on the ePRO device, an exemption from all ePRO assessments was provided.

The length of time that atezolizumab could be withheld was clarified to be a maximum of 105 days beyond the last dose of atezolizumab; exceptions required Medical Monitor approval.

The requirement for a tumor response assessment at the treatment discontinuation visit was removed.

- o Protocol Amendment 5 (Version 6) - 01 March 2017

Protocol  GO29436  was  amended  to  reflect  changes  in  the  analysis  populations  and  in  statistical methodology described in the SAP. Key changes to the protocol are summarized below:

The primary analysis populations for the co-primary endpoints of PFS and OS had changed. PFS was analyzed in the ITT -WT population and Teff-high WT population (Teff gene signature as determined by an RNA-based assay); OS was analyzed in the ITT -WT population. Both populations excluded patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK -positive tumors. The analyses of PFS and OS in patients defined by their PD-L1 expression status on TCs and ICs as determined by IHC would be performed as secondary analyses. The analyses of PFS and OS in all randomized patients would be conducted as secondary analyses.

The testing hierarchy and α -spending algorithm were adjusted and the comparison between the Atezo + Bev + CP and Bev + CP arms would be conducted prior to the comparison between the Atezo + CP and Bev + CP arms.

On the basis of updated U.S. FDA guidance, the additional censoring rule for the primary endpoint of PFS for  U.S.  registration  purposes  was  removed  (FDA  2015).  The  impact of  the  missing  visits  would be assessed as a sensitivity analysis.

The statistical testing procedures were amended to reflect the change in analysis populations.

To focus the efficacy analyses on more meaningful endpoints, the secondary objectives and outcome measures regarding investigator-assessed time-to response (TTR) and investigator-assessed time-in-response  (TIR)  per  RECIST  v1.1,  had  been  changed  to  exploratory  objectives  and  outcome measures. The exploratory objectives and outcome measures of disease control rate, TTR, and TIR by IRF assessment per RECIST v1.1 and by investigator assessment per modified RECIST were removed.

In patients of Asian race/ethnicity, the paclitaxel starting dose was lowered from 200 mg/m2 to 175 mg/m2. This change was recommended by the iDMC after a review of the safety data that noted a higher overall  level  of  hematologic  toxicities  in  patients  from  Asian  countries  compared  with  those  from non-Asian countries.

Based on the half-life of atezolizumab of 27 days, the use of live, attenuated vaccines was extended to 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab.

Language was added to clarify that tumour tissue collected at screening would be evaluated for the expression of PD-L1 and the T-effector gene signature. Exploratory biomarkers would be identified by IHC, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, next-generation sequencing, and/or other methods.

Statistical methods for exploratory PRO measures were added.

## Protocol deviations:

Major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  in  relation  to  the  following  four  categories:  procedural, medication, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria. All patients with protocol deviations were included in the efficacy analyses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

33.9% of ITT patients had at least one major protocol deviation; the majority of patients had procedural deviations (24.0%), 7.6% had medication deviations, 5.2% had inclusion criteria deviations, and 3.6% had exclusion criteria deviations. Overall, the frequency and types of deviations were similar between treatment arms.

Bonferroni-adjusted CI and p-values (unequally weighted Bonferroni method, per EMA/CHMP/44762/2017) are provided for co-primary endpoints that were formally tested by the 22 January 2018 clinical cutoff date (CCOD) based on the alpha spending algorithm.  The below table lists the final results for PFS in both ITT-WT and Teff-high WT populations (CCOD: 15 September 2017).  The statistical testing conclusions remain the same after the adjustment for all the efficacy analyses listed in the table below.  All p-values, confidence intervals, alpha boundaries are two sided.

Patient reported outcomes (PROs)

The completion rates were high (&gt;80%) for both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 across treatment arms throughout the course of treatment. At baseline, 91.4% (n = 360) in the Bev + CP arm, 90.6% (n = 357) in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and 92.7% (n = 370) of patients in the Atezo + CP arm completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 in the ITT population. Similar rates of baseline completion were also observed using the EORTC QLQ-LC13: 89.8% (n = 354) in the Bev + CP arm, 88.8% (n = 350) in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and 92.5% (n = 369) in the Atezo + CP arm.

Completion rates with both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires remained above 70% in all arms until Cycle 20 in the Bev + CP arm, Cycle 25 in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and Cycle 24 in the Atezo + CP arm; most cycles in all arms had completion rates &gt;= 80%. The latest cycle with approximately 25% of the original population remaining to complete the PRO assessments was Cycle 13 in the Bev + CP arm, Cycle 15 in the Atezo + CP arm, and Cycle 18 in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Atezo + Bev + CP arm. Rates of completion in both the Teff-high-WT and ITT-WT populations were similar to those observed in the ITT population.

## Health related quality of life (HRQoL) and function

Patients in all treatment arms reported moderately impaired HRQoL at baseline as assessed through the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Heal Status (GHS) score with mean scores of 62.7, 62.3, and 61.5 for Atezo + CP arm, Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and Bev + CP arm, respectively. Patients in all arms reported moderate to high scores for all aspects of function (i.e., physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) at baseline; mean scores for physical function were 76.3, 75.9, and 75.1 for the Atezo + CP arm, Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and Bev + CP arm, respectively. Baseline scores for all functional scales were comparable between treatment arms.

Observation of change in scores over time suggests that GHS/HRQoL and Physical Function mean scores in each arm return to baseline scores following the completion of chemotherapy and numerically improve thereafter. Overall, the mean change from baseline never crossed the 10 point threshold indicating that overall, changes in GHS/HRQoL and PF are not clinically significant at any time point through Cycle 13, at which point there are fewer than 25% of patients in the baseline sample of the Bev + CP arm and comparisons between arms should be done with caution.

Mean change from baseline scores for other function domains (i.e., cognitive, emotional, social, role), follow a similar pattern at most of the post-baseline timepoints evaluated; patients in all three treatment arms report comparable scores. Mean change from baseline in GHS and function scores in both the ITT-WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) and Teff-high WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) populations were similar to those observed in the ITT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) population.

## Treatment burden/tolerability

Patients' perspective regarding the severity of commonly experienced treatment-related symptoms (i.e., fatigue, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, sore mouth, dysphagia, hemoptysis) was captured via the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires. Initially, average change from baseline scores in fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting scores numerically worsened in all treatment arms then returned to their baseline level following the completion of chemotherapy.

Patients in all arms, on average, did not report clinically meaningful worsening (&gt;= 10 point increase from baseline) at any point on treatment for multiple treatment-related symptoms including fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, hemoptysis, dysphagia, and sore mouth through Cycles 13, 15, and 18 for the Bev + CP, Atezo + CP, and Atezo + Bev + CP arms, respectively. A clinically meaningful worsening was observed across treatment arms for both patient-reported peripheral neuropathy and alopecia; large mean increases from baseline (&gt;= 60 point increase for alopecia; &gt;=30 point increase for peripheral neuropathy) were seen initially in all treatment arms and attenuated over time at similar time points across arms. Mean change from baseline scores were numerically lower (lower symptom severity) for patients in the Atezo + CP arm compared with patients in the Bev + CP arm for fatigue, sore mouth, constipation, and diarrhea at most time points post-baseline. Mean change from baseline results in both the ITT-WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) and Teff-high-WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) populations were similar to those observed in the ITT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) population.

## Disease burden

No differences were observed between treatment arms in the time to deterioration of each individual lung cancer symptom, i.e., cough (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), dyspnea single-item (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), dyspnea multi-item (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), chest pain (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), and pain in arm/shoulder (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT). Median time to deterioration were not reached in any arm across symptom scores (with the exception of pain in arm/shoulder 18.7 months in the Bev + CP arm; dyspnea 21.9 months in the Atezo + CP arm) for analyses conducted in the ITT population. Mean change from baseline in all treatment arms, on average, reported numerical improvement in multiple lung cancer symptom scores (i.e., chest pain, pain in arm/shoulder, cough,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and dyspnea single-item) for most timepoints on treatment. Results were comparable among arms at most timepoints on treatment (EORTC QLQC30 and LC13).

Impact from ADA status on efficacy (ADA Evaluable Atezolizumab Patients in Safety Evaluable Population)

The results presented in tables 36-39 suggest that persistent ADA subsets may be confounded by survivorship bias therefore, use of the persistent and transient ADA definitions in the oncology population requires careful interpretation.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The proposed indication is: Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC).  Patients  with  EGFR  mutant  or  ALK-positive  NSCLC  should  have  received  targeted therapy if clinically indicated prior to receiving Tecentriq.

The  proposed  posed  posology  is  1200  mg  administered  by  IV  infusion  q3w.  Treatment  should  be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until it is no longer tolerated by the patient.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The MAH has provided data from the first interim analysis (data cut-off 15 September 2017) and second interim analysis (data cut-off 22 January 2018) from G029426 (IMpower150) to support this application.

1202 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Atezo + CP (arm A), Atezo + Bev + CP (arm B) or Bev + CP (arm C). Dosing and schedule for drugs in all three arms was based on previously approved indications and hence endorsed. Randomization was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases at baseline, and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

The control group (Arm C) is currently a standard of care for the first-line treatment of NSCLC based on the results of the ECOG 4599 study, which showed a significant improvement in OS (12.3 months vs. 10.3 months [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.80; p &lt; 0.003]), PFS (6.4 months vs. 4.8 months [HR = 0.65; p &lt; 0.0001]), and ORR (35% [133 of 381 patients] vs. 15% [59 of 392 patients]; p &lt; 0.001) in patients treated with bevacizumab q3w in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel compared with carboplatin paclitaxel alone.No crossover was permitted from the control arm (Arm C) to either of the experimental arms. This is acceptable, since OS is one of the primary efficacy endpoints. Patients randomized to arms containing atezolizumab (A and B) were allowed to keep maintenance treatment beyond progression, but those randomized to the arm containing bevacizumab without atezolizumab (Arm C) were not.

The study was originally designed to demonstrate an overall survival benefit of Atezo + Bev + CP in an all-comer  population  (ITT).  However,  emerging  data  from  2L+  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC) studies with monotherapy PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors demonstrated that patients with EGFR mutations did not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

derive significant clinical benefit from these drugs. In consequence,  the hierarchical testing scheme was adjusted in version 6 of the protocol, such that ITT population could not be formally tested if arm A did not show statistically significant OS benefit as compared to arm C. After such amendments, the co-primary efficacy  endpoints  were  investigator-assessed  PFS  per  RESIST  1.1  in  the  Teff-high  WT  population (Teff-high patients without an activating EGFR mutation or ALK translocation) and the ITT-WT population (defined as the ITT population excluding patients with an activating EGFR mutation or ALK translocation) and  overall  survival  in  the  ITT-WT  population.  The  method  to  control  the  type  1  error  for  the  two co-primary endpoints and for the comparisons of Arms A vs. C and B vs. C was considered adequate in general.

Numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria conditioned the randomisation of about 55% (1202 out of 2166) of  screened  patients.  From  the  non-participating  patients,  44%  were  excluded  due  to  issues regarding lack of PD-L1 status, prior treatment for stage IV NSCLC or CNS metastases that did not fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria. The enrolled population seems in line with expectations for the 1L setting in metastatic NSCLC patients.

ITT population was subdivided into multiple subpopulations according to diverse parameters (presence or absence of EGFR mutations/ALK translocations, Teff gene signature score, PD-L1 staining) as a way to optimally select the group of patients with most benefit.

Being this a study of three arms, most of the comparisons (OS, PFS, ORR, DOR, etc.) were performed between the experimental arms (B and A) against the control arm (C), that is, B vs. C and A vs. C. However, to define the added benefit of bevacizumab to Atezo + CP, the MAH was also requested to perform OS and PFS comparisons of arm B vs. A for the ITT population (the sought indication is in all-comers).

Baseline characteristics are well balanced among the three arms of treatment. As expected, since PD-L1 status  was  a  stratification  factor,  distribution  of  its  subcategories  across  the  three  arms  in  the  ITT population is fair. It is remarkable that almost half (48.6%) of all randomized patients are PD-L1 negative (TC0 and IC0).

In  the  second  interim  analysis  there  was  a  minor  variation  of  the  numbers  analysed,  as  2  patients originally categorised as EGFR positive and 3 patients originally ALK positive were recategorised as having no mutations.

Overall, the main criticism to the design and conduct of this study is the modification of primary efficacy objectives and populations in subsequent protocol amendments, however the validity of the study is not questioned.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Primary efficacy endpoints:

ITT-WT PFS: Final PFS analysis in ITT-WT population (co-primary endpoint) was done in the first interim analysis (data cut off 15-SEP-2017) when about 781 PFS events had happened in 1040 WT patients, about 75.1%. With data cut off of 22-JAN-2018, about 80.8% PFS events (855 in 1045 WT patients) have occurred and the median PFS remains identical for all three arms, including their 95% CIs: median PFS in ITT-WT population was 6.3 months in arm A, 8.3 months in arm B and 6.8 months in arm C. The updated data cutoff maintained the statistically significant PFS advantage for the comparison of arm B vs. C: stratified HR (0.62 → 0.59) and p-value (&lt;.0001 → &lt;.0001).

Considering the comparison of arms B and C, the study met its first co-primary efficacy endpoint, since the median duration of PFS was greater in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm (8.3 months, 95% CI: 7.7, 9.8) compared with the Bev + CP arm (6.8 months, 95% CI: 6.0, 7.1). This renders a stratified HR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.74; p &lt; 0.0001) and confers a statistically significant and clinically relevant advantage

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to the combination of Atezo + Bev + CP in WT patients. The comparison of arms A and C, delivers a HR of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.04; p: 0.14).

Teff-high WT PFS: 447 out of 1202 patients (37.2%) were classified as Teff-high WT. When these patients are selected, PFS benefit from Atezo + Bev + CP (arm B) is increased: median PFS in arms A and C was similar to ITT-WT population (6.7 and 6.8 months, respectively), but notably higher for arm B (11.4 months). In Teff-high WT population there are scarcely any differences in PFS between first and second interim  analyses.  Arm  B  maintains  a  statistically  significant  PFS  advantage  as  compared  to  arm  C, whereas arm A and C are not statistically different. However, to all appearances, the newly introduced Teff-biomarker did not distinguish satisfactorily between responders and non-responders. Comparison between Teff-high and low subgroups in the control arm (Bev+CP) suggests that Teff expression does not appear to be a predictive factor in this study. These data are supported by comparing Teff-high and low subgroups in 2L NSCLC (OAK). Overall, PD-L1 appeared to identify a broader patient population with similar  treatment  effect  compared  with  Teff  gene  signature  (i.e.  PD-L1  IHC  appeared  to  be  a  more adequate predictive biomarker, since there is obviously a subgroup of patients with Teff gene signature low but positive PD-L1 expression who derived a benefit by PD-L1 directed treatment).

ITT-WT OS: With an event rate of 53% in ITT-WT population, median OS was 19.4 months in arm A, 19.2 months in arm B and 14.7 months in arm C. When considering the complete study period (the whole curve, not just the median), even if there is a borderline statistical difference in OS between arm B (Atezo + Bev + CP) and C (Bev + CP), this difference is not clinically relevant. From a clinical point of view and based on the KM for OS plots and the estimates for median survival time, the difference between arms B (Atezo + Bev + CP) and A (Atezo + CP) is negligible. This is even more pronounced in the PD-L1 positive (TC3/IC3)  population,  where  actually  no  meaningful  differences  in  the  KM  plots  could  be  detected. Evolution of the OS comparison -per stratified HR- of arm B vs. arm C in ITT-WT population is static [0.78 (0.62, 0.97) → 0.78 (0.64, 0.96)], whereas the comparison of A vs. C varies minimally [0.92 (0.74, 1.15) → 0.88  (0.72,  1.08)].  However,  comparisons  of  hazard  ratios  might  be  questionable  given  the non-proportional hazards and using survival rates at specific landmarks might prove more sensible: at 12 months, 61% of patients were alive in arm C, as compared to 67% in arm B and 65% in arm A; at 24 months, 34% of patients were alive in arm C, compared to 43% in arm B and 39% in arm A. However, as OS data are not mature at 24 months, no conclusion can be drawn at this stage.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints:

Results of PFS in ITT population were similar to ITT-WT: median PFS was 6.7 months in arm A, 8.4 months in arm B and 6.8 months in arm C. Median PFS in arm C (Bev + CP) is comparable to the result established by the pivotal trial NCT00021060 (6.2 months). The stratified HR for the comparison of arms B and C was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.69), indicating a clinically meaningful benefit with Atezo + Bev + CP as compared with Bev + CP. PFS between arms A and C is similar, although not yet formally tested (stratified HR of 0.91, 95% CI 0.78, 1.06).

PFS benefit from treatment in arms B or A, as compared to arm C, was much higher for patients with increasing PD-L1 IHC positivity (TC2/3 or IC2/3). However, subgroup analysis suggests a small clinical advantage (PFS and OS) from Atezo + Bev + CP as compared to Bev + CP also in the PD-L1 negative subgroup (TC0/IC0), albeit with a late crossing of the OS curves after months 12.

EGFR/ALK+  patients: The  number  of  subjects  with  EGFR  mutations  and  ALK  translocations  in IMpower150 is limited; OS data are not fully mature yet and a statistical significance in the ITT population could not be provided due to the hierarchical multiple testing sequence. Nonetheless, the provided data support the assumption of a clinically meaningful benefit for the addition of atezolizumab + bevacizumab to carboplatin + paclitaxel in the EGFR/ALK+ subpopulation of the trial. Given the unmet medical need for this subpopulation of patients after failure of TKI therapies, its inclusion in the indication is supported by the preliminary OS and PFS data. There are no data on the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bevacizumab,  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  in  EGFR+  patients  who  have  progressed  previously  on erlotinib+bevacizumab and this has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Patients with liver metastases: in Arm B as compared to Arm C, pre-specified subgroup analyses from the interim OS analysis showed an OS improvement for patients with liver metastases: HR of 0.52.

ORR: In  ITT population, confirmation of response by the Investigator has brought upon a significant decrease of the previously reported response rates (7-8% in each arm), but arm B (56.4%) keeps a considerable advantage over arms C (40.2%) and A (40.6%).

DoR: Regarding ITT population, arm B exhibited a significantly longer median response (11.5 months, 95% CI 8.9, 15.7) than arm C (6.0 months, 95% CI 5.5, 6.9). Responders from arm A had a median DoR of 7.0 months, but the 95% CI (5.7, 8.3) overlaps with that from arm B, so the difference in DoR between arms B and A is not significant.

Concordance between PD-L1 and Teff gene signature: PD-L1 IHC appeared to identify a broader patient population with similar treatment effect compared with Teff gene signature in the IMpower150 study.

8.7% of patients (66 of 762) who were Teff-high were found to have PD-L1 status of TC0 and IC0 by SP142 PD-L1 IHC- 19% of patients (145 of 762) who were found to be Teff-low were considered TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 by SP142 IHC. Analysis of these non-overlapping biomarker subgroups clearly revealed that the PD-L1 marker is better to distinguish between responders and non(worse)-responders.

Benefit  from  adding  bevacizumab  to  Atezo  +  CP  (Arm  B  vs.  Arm  A): Although  the  study  was  not statistically powered for these comparisons, their values provide insight into the benefit from adding bevacizumab to Atezo + CP. PFS benefit from arm B (mPFS 8.4 months) is clear and regarding arm A (mPFS 6.7 months) significant: descriptive HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.79, p-value &lt; 0.0001). Nonetheless, HR for OS in ITT population when comparing arms B (mOS 19.8 months) and A (mOS 19.5 months) is 0.90 (95% CI 0.74-1.10, p-value 0.30). A similar result comes out when comparing such arms in ITT-WT population: 0.90 (CI and p-value not provided), slightly favoring arm B, even when mOS was higher in arm A (19.4 months) than arm B (19.2 months). On the same line, OS benefit from Atezo+Bev+CP vs. Atezo + CP in EGFR/ALK+ patients is doubtful as well: HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.34-1.28, p-value not provided).

Atezolizumab ADA status: There was a high rate (30-40%) of ADA conversion (negative to positive) in both arms (A and B). In treatment-induced ADA-persistent patients (all subsets), lower median OS and median PFS were observed compared with ADA-negative and ADA-transient patients. Although these differences  might  in  part  be  confounded  by  the  imbalances  in  baseline  characteristics,  the  reduced efficacy of ADA-positive patients in the Atezo + CP arm could be clinically meaningful.  This issue will be addressed post-approval.

Efficacy by age subgroups: Dividing the ITT population in &lt;65 and ≥65 years of age did now show PFS or OS differences between these subgroups when comparing arms B and C, but it did suggest slightly diminished efficacy in older individuals when arms A and C where compared. The limitations regarding data in elderly patients have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

PROs: The results show that the 4-drug combination did not have any major effect on QoL. However, having in mind the worse safety profile of Atezo+beva+CP compared to atezo+CP and the open-label design, these data should be interpreted with caution.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Efficacy results of the second interim analysis from IMpower150 show that both co-primary endpoints have been met, thus confirming superiority from Atezo + Bev + CP over Bev + CP in terms of PFS in ITT-WT/Teff-high WT population and OS in ITT-WT population. ITT population cannot be formally tested because of the statistical amendments introduced in the last version of the protocol. Arm A (Atezo + CP)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

versus Arm C (Bev + CP) efficacy boundary was not crossed and Arm A (Atezo + CP) will be re-tested at the time of the final OS analysis,, but its overall OS benefit is similar to arm B (Atezo + Bev + CP).

Subgroup analysis demonstrates PFS benefit from Atezo + Bev + CP vs. Bev + CP in EGFR/ALK+ patients and in patients with liver metastases, supported by a clinically meaningful OS benefit (formal statistical testing was not planned).

Teff  gene  signature  did  not  prove  to  be  a  useful  biomarker  to  distinguish  from  responders  and non-responders in this trial: PD-L1 IHC appeared to identify a broader population with beneficial effect from Atezo + Bev + CP.

In order to address the uncertainties in relation to ADA, the MAH is recommended:

- -To  submit  and  discuss  the  neutralising  ADA  data  for  both  atezolizumab  monotherapy  and  when co-administered with Carboplatin-paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in IMpower150.
- To submit an assessment of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, PFS,  and  ORR  in  NSCLC  Studies  POPLAR,  OAK,  IMpower150,  IMpower130,  IMpower131,  and IMpower132.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Study IMpower150: The safety population included all treated patients, defined as randomized patients who received any amount of any component of study treatment. For the safety analyses, patients were grouped according to whether any amount of atezolizumab was received, including when atezolizumab was received in error. Specifically for patients randomized to the Bev + CP arm, if atezolizumab was received in error in addition to Bev + CP treatment, the patients were grouped with the Atezo + Bev + CP arm for the safety analyses.

Accordingly, safety evaluable population consisted of 400 patients from arm A, 393 patients from arm B and 394 patients from arm C.

Atezolizumab Monotherapy: In addition, safety data on single-agent atezolizumab from seven studies (OAK,  IMvigor211,  IMvigor 210,  POPLAR,  FIR,  BIRCH  and  PCD4989g)  are  presented  for  3075 atezolizumab-treated safety-evaluable patients (all patients who received any amount of atezolizumab) of whom 1636 (53.2%) are patients with NSCLC.

The update of the monotherapy dataset has had minor impact in the known safety profile of atezolizumab. Noticeable changes seen at the SmPC include hyperthyroidism with all-grades incidence of 0.9% (from 'common' to 'uncommon') and urinary tract infections (10.8%) now classified as 'very common'.

Note:  The denominator for the maintenance/follow up phase is adjusted to patients who received at least one dose of study treatment during the maintenance phase.  Therefore, the total number of events or patients with Grade 5 or events leading to treatment withdrawal for each treatment phase does not add up to the overall number.

## Comparison between IMpower150 Atezo + Bev + CP Arm and Monotherapy

## Comparison of key safety results between first and second interim analysis

A comparison of the key safety results from the first and second interim analyses is provided in the table below. No new safety signals are identified and the safety profile is consistent between the two cutoffs. The key findings were as follows:

- Median exposure to study drug remained consistent with the previous clinical cutoff date (CCOD).
- The proportion of patients with at least one adverse event (AE; any grade) remained consistent with the primary clinical study report (CSR) and was similar between treatment arms (Bev + CP: 99.0% Atezo + Bev + CP: 98.2%; Atezo + CP: 97.8%). Overall, the AEs with an incidence rate of at least 10% observed with atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab were those events known to occur with an incidence of at least 10% for each individual study treatment.
- Since the previous CCOD, a larger increase in the number of AEs was observed in Atezo + Bev + CP (additional 334 events) and Atezo + CP (additional 229 events) compared with Bev + CP (additional 90 events).
- Grade 3-4 AEs were comparable between treatment arms (Bev + CP: 58.4% Atezo + Bev + CP: 63.6%; Atezo + CP: 57.5%). Grade 3-4 AEs related to any study treatment remained higher in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm (56.7%) compared with the Bev + CP arm (48.5%) and Atezo + CP arm (43.0%).
- The proportion of patients experiencing serious AEs (SAEs) remained higher in Atezo + Bev + CP (44.3%) compared with Bev + CP (34.3%) and Atezo + CP (39.3%).
- Since the previous CCOD, two new Grade 5 events were reported in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm, including 1 event of intestinal ischemia and 1 event of unexplained death. One additional Grade 5 event ('death' considered unrelated to atezolizumab), reported in a patient in the Atezo + CP arm at the previous CCOD, was reclassified subsequent follow-up review to interstitial lung disease (ILD; considered related to atezolizumab treatment).
- The proportion of patients experiencing AEs considered by the investigator as related to any study treatment remained comparable between treatment arms (Bev + CP: 95.7%, Atezo + Bev + CP: 94.1%; Atezo + CP: 94.3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The incidence of AEs of special interest (AESIs) for atezolizumab was consistent with the primary analysis as well as the known safety profile of atezolizumab, with the exception of immune-mediated pancreatitis and meningoencephalitis. Pancreatitis has since been added to the table of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) since this medical concept reached the threshold of what is deemed to be clinically different  from  monotherapy,  and  meningoencephalitis  (including  non-infective  encephalitis)  was removed from the table of ADRs as this medical concept no longer meets the threshold of what is deemed to be clinically different from monotherapy.
- The majority of atezolizumab AESIs were mild or moderate in severity.
- The incidence of AESIs for bevacizumab remained consistent with that reported at the earlier CCOD as well as the known safety profile of bevacizumab.

## Post marketing experience

No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  in  the  post-marketing  setting  for  atezolizumab  used  as  a monotherapy (see Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report [PBRER] data lock point of 17 November 2017).  As of 17 November 2017, 15,888 patients had been exposed to atezolizumab in the post-marketing setting.  The combination regimens administrated in Study IMpower150 are not approved yet.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Safety evaluable population in study IMpower150 consisted of 400 patients from arm A, 393 patients from arm B and 394 patients from arm C.

Exposure pattern of atezolizumab (number of doses received, treatment duration, dose intensity, total cumulative dose) is slightly higher in arm B than A. The same can be said about bevacizumab, with higher exposure in arm B than C. Arms B and A were allowed to keep treatment beyond progression whereas arm C was not. 122 patients from the Atezo + CP arm and 97 patients from the Atezo + Bev + CP arm received a mean of 3 doses of atezolizumab after progression. From these patients, a higher proportion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of patients from arm B had bulky progression than those from arm A. On the same line, patients who continued atezolizumab after progression in arm A lived longer (mOS 13.5 months) than those from arm B (mOS 11.1 months).

As expected, the majority of patients (95%) experienced one or more AEs through the study. Overall, the frequency of any AEs, G3-4, G5, serious AEs and AEs leading to dose modification/interruption was higher in the induction phase than in the maintenance phase for all 3 arms of treatment. The trend of higher toxicity from the 4-drug regimen (as compared to both 3-drug regimens) is evident in both phases. The frequency of G3-4 AEs in the induction phase in all 3 arms is around 50%. However, in the maintenance phase, about 23% of patients from one-drug arms (arm A = atezolizumab, arm C = bevacizumab) had G3-4  AEs,  as  compared  to  37%  from  the  2-drug  arm  (arm  B  =  atezolizumab  +  bevacizumab). Immune-related  endocrinopathies  in  atezolizumab-containing  arms  were more  frequent  in the maintenance than in the induction phase.

In general, arm B had higher incidence of AEs than the other two arms. AEs with higher incidence in arm B than arms A and C were nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, dysphagia, fatigue, pyrexia,  mucosal  inflammation,  headache,  musculoskeletal  pain,  epistaxis,  haemoptysis,  dysphonia, febrile  neutropenia, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, diverticulitis, decreased appetite,  hypomagnesaemia,  hypokalaemia,  dehydration,  hyponatraemia,  hyperglycaemia,  platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, weight decreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, WBC  count decreased, hypertension, hypertensive crisis, proteinuria, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

Epistaxis,  hypertension  and  proteinuria  were  equally  common  in  bevacizumab-containing  arms  and almost absent in arm A. When AEs were selected if considered treatment-related, they also occurred more frequently in arm B than in the other arms.

Grade 3-4 AEs were overall frequent in all three arms of treatment, being registered in 59% (698 out of 1187) of patients from the safety population. G3/4 AEs occurred with 5% higher frequency in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm (61.6%), as compared to the Atezo + CP arm (56.5%).

AESIs: AESIs (any grade and G3/4) were more common in arm B than in arms A and C. Discontinuation due to an AESI followed the same pattern. Immune-related hepatitis and colitis were more common in arm B than the other arms. Hypothyroidism and rash -more easily manageable than the previous- were more  frequent  in  arms  A  and  B.  All  other  immune-mediated  AE  had  an  incidence  comparable  to atezolizumab  monotherapy  and  were  clinically  manageable.  Less  frequent  immune-related  AESIs (meningoencephalitis, pancreatitis, hypophyisitis) were rare. As compared to atezolizumab monotherapy (34%), AESIs of any grade were also much more frequent in atezolizumab-containing arms (51% in arm B and 46% in arm A). This difference is mostly driven by AESIs that are clinically manageable such as hepatitis  (lab  abnormal),  hypothyroidism  and  rash.  AESIs  that  required  corticosteroid  treatment  in IMpower150 occurred in about 20% of each of the atezolizumab-containing arms, and they had similar efficacy outcomes to the overall ITT population.

Atezolizumab AESIs: Any-grade immune-related pneumonitis occurred in 29 patients: 3 (0.8%) patients in arm C, 10 (2.5%) in arm B and 16 (4.0%) in arm A -in this last group with median duration of 4.2 months.  Overall,  nearly  2%  of  patients  that  received  atezolizumab  required  hospitalisation  for autoimmune pneumonitis, but there were no G5 AEs from pneumonitis. Frequency of immune-related hepatitis  was  much  higher  in  arm  B  (5.1%)  than  arm  A  (3.0%),  as  were  hypothyroidism  and hyperthyroidism.

Bevacizumab AESIs: Incidence of haemorrhagic events is significantly higher in bevacizumab containing arms: 32.3% and 31.2% in arms B and C, respectively, as compared to 14.5% in arm A. Incidence of haemoptysis in arm B (27 out of 393 patients, 6.9%) doubles that of arm A (14 out of 400 patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3.5%). Out of 61 patients who presented haemoptysis, 13 required hospitalisation for such AE and 5 of them died as a direct consequence. Of the 13 hospitalised patients, 12 (92%) had received bevacizumab either in arm B or C. All 5 patients who died from haemoptysis had received the 4-drug regimen (Atezo + Bev + CP) in arm B. 4 patients exposed to bevacizumab (2 in arm B and 2 in arm C) died from fatal pulmonary haemorrhage, which prompted modification of criteria to exclude patients with clear tumour infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or cavitation of pulmonary lesions.

Incidence of hypertension was significantly higher in arms B and C (24.6%) than arm A (3.5%), and comparable to its incidence in all previous bevacizumab studies. No relevant differences on incidence of hypertension are seen between arms B and C.

Cerebrovascular accident occurred in 6 patients from arm B (1.5%), two of which died. Incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism in bevacizumab-containing arms was higher than arm A (3.8% vs. 2.5%), and more likely associated to fatality: all 4 patients that died from pulmonary thromboembolism were in bevacizumab-containing arms (2 patients in arm B and 2 in arm C). The increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmCP.

Overall,  complications  associated  to  bevacizumab,  in  particular  in  the  4-drug  regimen,  cannot  be underestimated: G5 events from pulmonary thromboembolism, myocardial infarctions, haemoptysis, cerebrovascular accidents and pulmonary haemorrhage accounted for 9 patients in arm B and 7 patients in arm C. In comparison, only 1 patient died from any of these AEs in the Atezo + CP arm.

Serious AEs were more common in arm B (44.3%) as compared to either arm C (34.3%) or A (39.3%). Excluding pneumonia (6.1% in arm B vs. 3.1% in atezolizumab monotherapy), incidence of serious AEs was in general comparable to atezolizumab monotherapy population. Febrile neutropenia attributable to treatment was also more frequent in arm B (6.9%) regarding arms A (3.3%) or C (4.3%).

Deaths: The most common cause of death in all treatment arms was progressive disease: 531 out of 620 deaths (86%). Incidence of G5 AEs was relevantly lower in arm A (10 patients, 2.5%) as compared to arms B (24 patients, 6.1%) and C (21 patients, 5.3%), and even compared to atezolizumab monotherapy population (3.9%).

A large proportion of G5 AEs appeared to be possibly related to bevacizumab treatment and this has already been highlighted in bevacizumab-related AEs. Overall, most common G5 AEs were haemoptysis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and febrile neutropenia. While deaths from thoracic disorders were more common in arm B (9 events), deaths from infections were more common in arm C (6 events).

Special populations: A worse safety profile was generally observed in patients aged ≥65 years, compared with patients &lt;65 years in the bevacizumab-containing arms. The worse safety profile in elderly patients has been reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The most pronounced differences in safety between patients with ECOG PS 0 or 1 were noticed in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm. A tendency towards a worse safety profile for female vs. male patients can be observed across all treatment arms.

Due to increased hematologic toxicities observed in Asian patients in IMpower150, it is recommended that the starting dose of paclitaxel should be 175 mg/m2 every three weeks (see section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC).

Discontinuation: Most of the withdrawals of any study treatment were attributable to withdrawals of bevacizumab in both the induction and the maintenance phase. In the bevacizumab-containing arms numerically higher rates of discontinuation of only chemotherapy and all study treatments were observed in the induction phase compared to the Atezo+CP arm (5.3%, 5.6% and 3.3% withdrawals of all study treatments for Bev+CP, Atezo+Bev+CP and Atezo+CP, respectively). These data underline the relevant contribution  of  bevacizumab  to  the  toxicity  profile  and  the  (worse)  tolerability  of  the  combination therapies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Updated safety results: The Atezo + Bev + CP arm has manifested a worse toxicity profile with longer follow-up. Since the previous data cutoff, a larger increase in the number of AEs was observed in the Atezo + Bev + CP (additional 334 events) and Atezo + CP arms (additional 229 events) compared with the Bev + CP arm (additional 90 events). The same trend (with largest numerical increases in AEs in the Atezo + Bev + CP since the first analyses) was observed for grade 3-4 AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from any treatment and AE leading to any dose modification/interruption.

Since  atezolizumab  is  cleared  from  the  circulation  through  catabolism,  no  metabolic  drug-drug interactions are expected.  Based on PK data from IMpower150, there is no evidence of a PK drug-drug interaction  with  the  coadministration  of  atezolizumab  and/or  bevacizumab  with  carboplatin  and paclitaxel.

The  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  or  immunosuppressants  before  starting  atezolizumab  should  be avoided  because  of  their  potential  interference  with  the  pharmacodynamic  activity  and  efficacy  of atezolizumab.  However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used to treat immune-related adverse reactions after starting atezolizumab.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The combination of Atezo + Bev + CP was found to be tolerable but showed a clearly worse safety profile than the other two arms in IMpower150. This 4-drug regimen exhibited higher toxicity compared to the other treatment arms as observed with the higher incidence of any, G3/4, serious and G5 AEs. However, arms A and B had comparable incidence and outcome for immune-related AEs as for atezolizumab monotherapy,  whereas  bevacizumab-related  AEs  had  significantly  high  incidence  and  fatality,  in particular in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 6.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, changes related to section 4.8 of the SmPC have been implemented in order to update the monotherapy safety data and reflect the largest pooled monotherapy population available (now including also data from study IMvigor211 and from all cohorts for study PCD4989g). In addition, small corrections and formatting changes have been implemented throughout the SmPC.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

- No  significant  changes  impacting  the  readability  of  the  package  leaflet  are  made.  The  new additions follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the approved package leaflet.
- The target group of users will be similar between the approved indication (locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy) and the applied indication (first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC), with no significant age difference.
- Moreover,  the  posology  proposed  in  this  application  is  the  same  as  the  currently  approved indication.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The indication as considered by the CHMP is for Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies (see section 5.1).

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.  This disease is the most common cancer  in  men  worldwide  and  accounts  for  the  highest  absolute  number  of  cancer  deaths  globally. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant subtype, accounting for approximately 85% of all. NSCLC can be divided into two major histologic types:  non-squamous and squamous cell carcinoma. Non-squamous histology accounts for more than half of all NSCLC, whereas squamous histology accounts for approximately 30%.

Genetic  changes  that  have  prognostic  and  predictive  significance  in  NSCLC  include  EGFR  mutations (10-40%) and ALK traslocations (2-6%).

The aim of therapy in the metastatic setting of NSCLC is to prolong progression free survival and overall survival, with no addition of major treatment-related toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

For patients who have metastatic NSCLC without an oncogenic driver mutation (such as EGFR mutations or ALK translocations), first-line standard of care is platinum-based chemotherapy, partnered with agents such as taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed, or platinum-based chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab. For both EGFR mutant patients and patients with ALK translocation, the standard of care after failure of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is platinum based chemotherapy.

Over the last few years, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, have emerged  as  effective  2L+  treatment  in  NSCLC:  nivolumab,  pembrolizumab  and  atezolizumab  have demonstrated superiority over docetaxel as monotherapy.

Since these patients usually undergo rapid clinical deterioration during disease progression, many of them do not receive second line treatment.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

IMpower150  (GO29436)  is  a  phase  III  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  atezolizumab  in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, versus carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab,  in  metastatic  non-squamous  NSCLC  in  the  first-line  setting.    The  current  submission supports the use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel for the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC, including patients with EGFR mutations or ALK translocations who have failed targeted therapy.  This variation is being submitted at this time because the protocol-specified first interim analysis has been conducted, with a clinical cut-off date of 15 September 2017.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The updated data was submitted from the second interim analysis of IMpower150 with data cut-off of 22 January 2018. Both co-primary efficacy endpoints of the study have been met.

In ITT-WT population, median PFS was 6.7 months in arm A, 8.4 months in arm B and 6.8 months in arm C.  Stratified HR of 0.59 (p &lt; 0.0001) confers a statistically significant advantage to Atezo + Bev + CP as compared to Bev + CP. There was no significant difference between the numbers, percentages and comparisons  on  PFS  in  Teff-high  WT  population  compared  to  the  first  interim  analysis,  but  PD-L1 expression appears to identify a broader population with similar treatment effects as compared to the Teff gene signature.

Median OS in ITT-WT population was 19.4 months in arm A, 19.2 months in arm B and 14.7 months in arm C. A statistically significant benefit from arm B over arm C is demonstrated from a stratified HR of 0.78 (p = 0.0164).

Subgroup analysis showed that patients with liver metastases at enrolment obtained the highest OS benefit in ITT population (arm B vs. C): HR of 0.52.

EGFR/ALK+ patients also had clinical benefit from treatment following progression from TKIs: median PFS was 10 months in arm B, 6.9 months in arm A and 6.1 months in arm C, whereas median OS was 21.2 months in arm A, not reached in arm B and 17.5 months in arm C.

Most  secondary  endpoints  were  consistent  with  the  clinical  benefit  from  arm  B  shown  across subpopulations. ORR in ITT population, although certainly decreased after confirmation of response, was 56% in arm B, 41% in arm A and 40% in arm C. In the same population, median duration of response was 11.5 months in arm B, 7.0 months in arm A and 6.0 months in arm C.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Taking into account a significant atezolizumab ADA conversion rate, it remains unknown whether the emergence of these antibodies has a clear impact on efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with CP +/bevacizumab. The MAH is recommended to conduct an assessment (post-approval) of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, PFS, and ORR in NSCLC Studies POPLAR, OAK, IMpower150, IMpower130, IMpower131, and IMpower132.

Due  to  the  limited  sample  size,  the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  of  atezolizumab  in  combination  with chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab in patients aged ≥ 75 years is difficult to characterise (see section 5.1 of the SmPC)

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

In IMpower150, an overall higher frequency of adverse events was observed in the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab,  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel,  and  carboplatin  compared  to  atezolizumab,  paclitaxel  and carboplatin,  including  Grade  3  and  4  events  (63.6%  compared  to  57.5%),  Grade  5  events  (6.1% compared to 2.5%), adverse events of special interest to atezolizumab (52.4% compared to 48.0%), as well  as  adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  of  any  study  treatment  (33.8%  compared to  13.3%). Nausea,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis,  fatigue,  pyrexia,  mucosal  inflammation,  decreased  appetite,  weight decreased, hypertension and proteinuria were reported higher ( ≥ 5% difference) in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin. Other clinically significant adverse events which were observed more frequently in the atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm were epistaxis, haemoptysis, cerebrovascular accident, including fatal events.

In IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with an increased risk of developing adverse events in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Data for patients ≥75 years of age are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

* Primary efficacy endpoints

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

IMpower150 has met both its co-primary endpoints, demonstrating superiority of Atezo + Bev + CP (arm B) over Bev + CP (arm C) in terms of PFS in the ITT-WT (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.70; p &lt; 0.0001) and Teff-high WT populations (HR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.66; p &lt; 0.0001) and OS in the ITT-WT population (HR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.96; p&lt;0.0164).

PFS benefit from treatment in arms B or A, as compared to arm C, was much higher for patients with increasing PD-L1 IHC positivity (TC2/3 or IC2/3) and clinical benefit (PFS and OS) has also been observed in the PD-L1 negative subgroup (TC0/IC0) in arm B as compared to arm C, albeit with a late crossing of the OS curves after months 12. In patients with EGFR mutations and ALK translocations, despite limited numbers and the lack of mature OS data, a clinically meaningful benefit for the Atezo + Bev + CP can be concluded after failure of TKI therapies.

There was a high rate (30-40%) of ADA conversion (negative to positive) in both arms (A and B). The impact of ADA on the efficacy observed in both arms could be clinically meaningful and will be addressed post-approval.

Atezo + Bev + CP exhibited higher toxicity compared to the other treatment arms as observed with the higher incidence of any, G3/4, serious and G5 AEs. The risks of bevacizumab must be taken into account when considering treatment with Atezo + Bev + CP.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in PFS of 1.6 month and 4.9 months increase in median survival for Atezo + Bev + CP compared to Bev + CP outweighs the worst safety profile observed with the addition of atezolizumab to Bev + CP.

The benefit-risk balance of Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered positive. In patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  group  of  variations acceptable  and  therefore  recommends  the  variations  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variations accepted   | Variations accepted                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data              | Type II | I and IIIB         |
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension  of  indication  to  include  in  combination  with  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on the interim results of study GO29436 (IMpower 150). As a consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 6.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. In addition update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the monotherapy safety data and reflect the largest pooled monotherapy population available (now including also data from IMvigor211 and PCD4989g studies). The Package Leaflet and the RMP (version 4.2) are updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make small corrections and formatting changes throughout the SmPC.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
