## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Introduction

Sprycel (dasatinib) is a potent inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase and SRC family kinases along with a number  of  other  selected  oncogenic  kinases  including  c-KIT,  ephrin  (EPH)  receptor  kinases,  and PDGF β receptor. The Marketing Authorisation (MA) was granted in November 2006 for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance  to  prior  therapy  including  imatinib  mesylate,  and  also  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  (Ph+)  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  and  lymphoid  blast CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.

At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion  for  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  in  September  2006,  the Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  made  a  commitment  (FUM  010)  to  provide  data  postauthorisation from two Phase 3 studies comparing the efficacy and safety of dasatinib administered once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) in subjects with chronic (CA180034) and advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL (CA180035).

-  FUM 010: 'The proposed posology should be reassessed when results of studies CA180034 and  CA  180035  are  available.  Final  Clinical  Study  Report  (24  months  follow-up)  by  June 2009 .'

6 months data from these studies have previously been evaluated as a part of variation EMEA/H/C/709/II/02 for which a positive CHMP opinion was adopted in July 2007, recommending the approval of a change in posology for chronic phase CML to 100 mg QD as starting dose, due to a more favourable benefit/risk ratio than the 70 mg BID originally approved.

The MAH has now submitted a type II variation application to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SPC with 24-months follow-up data from the Phase III studies CA180034 and CA180035. The Package Leaflet has beeen amended accordingly.

In addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to provide an updated version of the RMP (version 6.0). Consequently, annex II has been updated to reflect the latest version agreed with the CHMP.

## Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

No additional studies on biopharmaceutical or clinical pharmacology have been submitted as part of this application.

## Clinical Efficacy

This  application  is  based  upon  two  Phase  3  studies  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  dasatinib administered once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) (current posology for the advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL indications) in subjects with chronic phase CML (CA180034) and advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL (CA180035).

## Studies CA180034 and CA180035

In the Phase 3 study (CA180034) in  subjects with chronic phase CML, dasatinib was administered QD  or  BID  at  a  total  daily  dose  (TDD)  of  100  mg  or  140  mg.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the comparison  of  MCyR  rates  after  a  minimum  follow-up  of  6  months  of  dasatinib  treatment  when administered  QD  relative  to  BID  in  imatinib-resistant  subjects.  Secondary  endpoints  included: comparison  of  MCyR  rates  between  the  2  TDDs  of  dasatinib;  durability  and  time  to  MCyR;  rate, duration,  time  to  CHR;  and  major  molecular  response  (MMR).  Six  hundred  seventy  subjects  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomized (497 imatinib-resistant, according to the assessment on the baseline case report form, and 173 imatinib-intolerant) to receive dasatinib at either 100 mg or 140 mg TDD.

In the Phase 3 study (CA180035) in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, dasatinib was administered either QD or BID at a TDD of 140 mg. The primary endpoint was the comparison of MaHR rates in all randomized subjects treated with dasatinib at 140 mg QD or 70 mg BID. Secondary endpoints included durability and time to MaHR and rate of MCyR. Six hundred eleven subjects with accelerated  phase,  myeloid  blast  phase,  or  lymphoid  blast  phase  CML  or  with  Ph+  ALL  were randomized to receive dasatinib at either 140 mg QD or 70 mg BID.

In both studies, investigators were allowed to escalate subjects' doses to achieve better efficacy or to reduce subjects' doses to  manage  adverse  events.  Efficacy  responses  were  determined  from haematologic  values,  bone  marrow  cytology  and  cytogenetics,  and  in  the  presence  or  absence  of extramedullary  disease.  All  data  presented  represent  data  collected  from  any  subject  who  was randomized.  Response  rates  were  estimated  along  with  their  95%  exact  CIs  based  on  the  ClopperPearson method. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median duration of response were provided along with their 95% CIs. Duration on treatment is calculated as the time from the first dose to the last dose of study drug; medians are presented for both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects treated in the studies. In addition, duration of response is presented for both imatinib-resistant and imatinibintolerant subjects.

MMR in subjects with chronic phase CML was assessed by RQ-PCR determined as the ratio of BCRABL copies to a control gene. These ratios were expressed using a standardized methodology initially described in the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI-571 (IRIS) trial and currently reported  by  an  international  panel  of  experts.  Data  are  reported  on  the  international  scale  after determining a laboratory specific conversion factor. Molecular data for the Phase 3 study (CA180034) were measured internally at a BMS facility using validated methodology. Results are reported in all treated subjects and in subjects who achieved a CCyR. Subjects assessed for MMR may have been tested at any time during the treatment period.

Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  until  the  time  disease progression was first documented by the investigator or death. Subjects who neither progressed nor died were censored on the date of their last cytogenetic or haematologic assessment.

## RESULTS STUDY CA180034

The median duration of exposure in CA180034 was 22 months.

Efficacy was achieved across all treatment groups with the QD schedule demonstrating comparable efficacy (non-inferiority) to the BID schedule on the primary efficacy endpoint (difference in MCyR 1.9%; 95% confidence interval [-6.8%-10.6%]). Over half of the subjects with chronic phase CML who achieved MCyR did so within the first 6 months with most subjects achieving MCyR by 1 year. MMR in all treated subjects was reported in 33% to 35% of the subjects. MMR in assessed subjects with CCyR was reported in 66% to 72% of the subjects. Rates of projected duration of MCyR and CCyR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected  overall  survival  showed  little  difference  across  dose  and schedule. Similar findings were reported for subjects who were intolerant of or resistant to imatinib. (Please refer to Table 4.3.1.2 below)

In imatinib-intolerant subjects who received 100 mg QD, MCyR was achieved in 77%, CCyR in 67%, and  MMR  (in  assessed  subjects  with  CCyR)  in  64%.  Based  on  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates,  all subjects (100%) maintained MCyR for 1 year and 92% (95% CI: [80%-100%]) maintained MCyR for 18 months. The estimated rate of PFS in this population was 97% (95% CI: [92%-100%]) at 1 year and 87% (95% CI: [76%-99%]) at 2 years. The estimated rate of overall survival was 100% at 1 year and 95% (95% CI: [88%-100%]) at 2 years.

## RESULTS STUDY CA180035

With 2 years of follow-up in subjects with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL in the Phase 3 study (CA180035),  haematologic  and  cytogenetic  responses  were  achieved  in  subjects  treated  with dasatinib.  Data  from  CA180035  establishing  the  optimal  dosing  schedule  showed  similar  efficacy between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules. With both schedules, long-term responses were identified in advanced phases of disease.

## Accelerated Phase CML:

With  2  years  of  follow-up,  most  subjects  with  accelerated  phase  CML  achieved  haematologic responses.  Efficacy  results  were  similar  between  the  140  mg  QD  and  70  mg  BID.  Cytogenetic response rates in CA180035 were lower than haematologic responses (see Table 4.3.3.2 below). Most subjects  who  achieved  MaHR  did  so  within  the  first  6  months  of  treatment.10  Rates  of  projected duration  of  MaHR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected  overall  survival  were  high  and  showed  little difference between the 2 schedules.

## Myeloid Blast Phase CML:

Efficacy  results  with  2  years  of  follow-up  were  similar  between  the  140  mg  QD  and  70  mg  BID schedules.  In  CA180035,  approximately  one-third  of  the  subjects  achieved  haematologic  and cytogenetic  responses  (see  Table  4.3.3.2  below).  In  subjects  with  MaHR,  the  time  to  response  was rapid and within the first 4 months of treatment. Rates of projected duration of MaHR, projected PFS, and projected overall survival showed little difference across the 2 schedules.

## Lymphoid Blast Phase CML:

There was little difference in efficacy between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules in subjects with lymphoid blast phase CML after 2 years of follow-up. In CA180035, more subjects achieved a MCyR compared with MaHR (Table 4.3.3.2). Most subjects who achieved MaHR did so within the first  2  months  of  treatment.10  Rates  of  projected  duration  of  MaHR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected overall  survival  were  lower  compared  with  other  advanced  phases  of  CML  reflecting  the  more aggressive nature of this disease phase.

## Ph+ ALL:

In subjects with Ph+ ALL with 2 years of follow-up, rates of MaHR were similar between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules. In CA180035, cytogenetic responses were greater than haematologic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

responses  (see  Table  4.3.3.3  below).  Most  subjects  who  achieved  MaHR  did  so  within  the  first  2 months  of  treatment.  Rates  of  projected  duration  of  MaHR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected  overall survival  were  lower  compared  with  other  advanced  phases  of  CML  reflecting  the  more  aggressive nature of this disease phase

## Dose modifications

Study CA180035 included 609 patients. Among the 304 patients who were randomized to the 140 mg QD starting dose of dasatinib, 110 (36%) were dose escalated (Table 1). Of the 110 subjects who dose escalated, 106 (96%) escalated to 180 mg, 3 to 200 mg, and 1 to 280 mg. Escalation higher than 180 mg QD was primarily due to dosing error or rising % blasts.

Of the 110 subjects who dose escalated to  180 mg QD due to either no response or partial response at  the  recommended  starting  dose,  haematologic  responses  were  reported  in  10  subjects.  Of  the  10 subjects with haematologic response after dose escalation, 4 achieved a major haematologic response (MaHR). Cytogenetic responses were reported in 18 subjects who dose escalated due to no response or partial response at the recommended starting dose. An additional 7 subjects who had a loss of MCyR regained  MCyR  after  dose  escalation.  Of  these  25  subjects  with  a  cytogenetic  response  after  dose escalation, 17 achieved MCyR. Overall, with 3 of the 4 subjects with a MaHR also achieving a MCyR, a  total  of  18 (16%)  out  of  110  subjects  benefited  from  dose  escalation  180  mg  QD.  Changes  in response following dose escalation are presented in Table 2.

* Patients who had a loss of major cytogenetic response, but regained major cytogenetic response after dose escalation.

** Of the 21 subjects with post-escalation MaHR or MCyR, 3 subjects with MaHR also achieved MCyR. Therefore, 18 unique subjects achieved benefit from dose escalation.

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

The current dosing recommendation is 70 mg BID in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL based on three Phase 2 studies and one Phase 3 previously reported with 6 months of follow-up. With long-term follow-up in the dose optimization study (CA180035), efficacy data were similar between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules, and comparable with responses reported at 6 months with 70 mg BID. With both schedules, long-lasting responses were identified. In subjects with Ph+ ALL with longer follow-up, haematologic and cytogenetic response rates were also similar between 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules. The dose of 140 mg QD supports an overall superior benefit risk and should be recommended in this population.

Dose-escalation to 180 mg QD in subjects with no response or partial response at the recommended starting dose is considered justified based on dose modification guidelines utilized in Study CA180035 that resulted in response improvement without additional safety concerns.

Protocol CA180035 allowed dose escalation from 140 mg to 180 mg total daily dose for the advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL patients for the following reasons:

-  Rising % blasts on 2 consecutive haematologic assessments at least one week apart (i.e., from Day 15);
-  No  complete  haematologic  response  (CHR),  no  evidence  of  leukaemia  (NEL),  or  minor haematologic response (MiHR) within 4 weeks;
-  No major cytogenetic response (MCyR) after 3 months;
-  No complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) after 6 months;
-  Loss of haematologic response on 2 consecutive assessments at least 1 week apart.

## Clinical Safety

As part  of  this  submission  safety  data  are  presented  for  the  safety  cohort  (all  treated  subjects  who received at least 1 dose of study drug). The safety prognosis for subjects resistant and intolerant to imatinib  was  expected  to  be  similar;  therefore,  all  of  the  safety  analyses  combined  these  2  groups except for subgroup analyses by imatinib status.

Safety data are presented separately for subjects with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL. In subjects with chronic phase CML, data are displayed by 100 mg QD, 70 mg BID, other doses, and all doses. In advanced phase CML and in Ph+ ALL, data are presented for 140 mg QD, 70 mg BID, and total.

## Exposure

Dasatinib-treated  subjects  with  CML  or  Ph+  ALL  were  followed  for  2  years.  In  CA180034,  the median duration of study therapy was similar across the 4 treatment schedules (22 months for each schedule).    In  CA180035,  the  median  duration  of  study  therapy  was  similar  between  the  QD  (6.1 months; range 0.03 - 31.2 months) and BID (6.2 months; range 0.03 - 28.8 months) groups. Likewise, there was little difference between the groups in median duration when excluding interruptions (5.7 months and 5.2 months, respectively). The median duration of exposure in the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects with CML or Ph+ ALL was 15.01 months; 55% of the subjects were administered dasatinib for more than 12 months.

## Common Drug-related adverse events

In Study CA180034 with 2 years of follow-up, the majority of treated subjects (645 [97%]) reported at least 1 AE, regardless of relationship to study drug. 9 Drug-related AEs were reported in 603 (91%) subjects. Drug-related AEs occurred less frequently in the 100 mg QD group (86%) compared with the other 3 treatment groups (range 92% to 94%). Similarly, drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs also occurred less frequently in the 100 mg QD group (36%) compared with the 140 mg QD, 50 mg BID, and 70 mg BID groups (range 42% to 53%). Common drug-related non-haematologic AEs (occurring ≥ 20% in at least 1 treatment group) were headache (23% to 32%), diarrhoea (26% to 31%), nausea (18% to 29%), fatigue (19% to 25%), dyspnoea (16% to 23%), and pleural effusion (14% to 25%).

In  CA180035, most subjects in both the QD group and the BID group reported at least 1 AE, any grade, while on study drug (98% vs. 99%).10 Drug-related AEs (reported in ≥ 10% of subjects), were reported  in  the  majority  of  subjects  (90%  in  QD  and  89%  in  BID).  Drug-related  AEs  were  similar between the QD and BID groups with 2 exceptions: pleural effusion (20% vs. 32%, respectively) and peripheral oedema (9% vs. 15%, respectively).

Of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, 1,864 (85%) experienced at least 1 drugrelated AE over the course of the study. ADRs of clinical relevance included diarrhoea (33%), pleural effusion (27%), headache (25%), haemorrhage (16%), and infection (11%).

Two tables of  selected  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  reported  in  these  Phase  3  dose-optimization studies have been updated in the proposed SPC. Uncommon and rare adverse drug reactions are also discussed and updated in the proposed SPC section 4.8.

## Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation

In  CA180034,  101  (15%)  subjects  reported  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  any  grade,  during  the study or up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication. Eighty-three (13%) subjects reported drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation. Fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group (8%) reported drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, any grade, compared with the 140 mg QD, 50 mg BID, and 70 mg BID groups (12% to 15%, respectively). The most common ( ≥ 2% incidence in at least 1 treatment  group)  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  pleural  effusion,  dyspnoea,  and headache. Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, for all grades and for Grade 3 to 5, were less frequent in the 100 mg QD group vs. the other 3 treatment groups. This difference was largely due to fewer subjects with pleural effusion leading to discontinuation in the 100 mg QD group.

In  CA180035,  192  (32%)  subjects  reported  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  any  grade,  during  the study  or  up  to  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  Drug-related  AEs  leading  to discontinuation  of  study  therapy  were  similar  between  the  QD  and  BID  groups  (14%  and  16%, respectively) with the exception of drug-related pleural effusion (2% vs. 5%, respectively). The most common ( ≥ 2% incidence in at least 1 treatment group) drug-related AE leading to discontinuation was pleural effusion.

## Serious Adverse Events

In CA180034, 276 (42%) subjects reported SAEs, any grade, during the study or up to 30 days after the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  One  hundred  seventy-four  (26%)  subjects  reported  drug-related SAEs. Fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group (19%) reported drug-related SAEs vs. the 140 mg QD, 50  mg  BID,  and  70  mg  BID  groups  (25%  to  33%).  In  particular,  pleural  effusion,  gastrointestinal disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and cardiac disorders were less frequent in the 100 mg QD group than in the other 3 treatment groups. Similarly, severe (Grade 3 to 5) drug-related SAEs were less frequent in the 100 mg QD group (13%) than in the other 3 treatment groups (16% to 25%). The  most  common  (&gt;  3%  incidence  in  at  least  1  treatment  group)  severe  drug-related  SAEs  were pleural effusion, dyspnoea, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

In CA180035, 448 (74%) subjects reported SAEs, any grade, during the study or up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication. Two hundred seventy (44%) subjects reported drug-related SAEs. There was little difference (43% vs. 46%, respectively) in drug-related SAEs between the QD and BID groups.  Notable  common  (&gt;3%  incidence  in  at  least  1  treatment  group)  drug-related  SAEs  were pleural effusion, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, cerebral haemorrhage, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia.

## Deaths

In CA180034, 65 deaths were reported of which 26 were due to disease progression. Two of the 65 deaths  were  due  to  study  drug  toxicity  (1  pulmonary  oedema/CHF/neck  pain/pleural  effusion,  1 necrosis of the colon). Both deaths occurred within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib. Of the 65 deaths, 16 occurred on-study or within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib. Of these 16, deaths were less frequent in the QD group compared with the BID group (5 vs. 11 subjects, respectively).

In CA180035, 321 out of 609 subjects died of which over half were due to disease progression. Of the 321  deaths,  126  subjects  died  on-study  or  within  30  days  of  last  dose  of  study  therapy.  For  those deaths within 30 days of last dose of study therapy, a difference between the QD and BID groups was observed  in  infection  (17%  vs.  30%,  respectively)  and  cardiovascular  disease  (3%  vs.  11%, respectively).

## Laboratory Abnormalities

In this heavily pretreated population of subjects, treatment with dasatinib was associated with severe (Grade  3  or  4)  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  and  anaemia.  There  were  few  clinically  meaningful non-haematologic changes in laboratory parameters reported on treatment with dasatinib with 2 years of  follow-up,  a  result  consistent  with  the  initial  filing.  In  CA180034  and  CA180035,  there  were minimal differences between the treatment groups in the number of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 liver function and renal function abnormalities. In addition, electrolytes changes and coagulation parameters were similar between the groups in the two Phase 3 studies. There were few instances of Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  values;  the  most  common  laboratory  abnormality  was  Grade  3  or  4 hypophosphataemia.

An updated section of laboratory test abnormalities is provided in Section 4.8 of the proposed SPC.

## Selected Safety Events

Safety  issues  of  special  importance  in  the  dasatinib  product  information  included  the  AEs  of myelosuppression, fluid retention, bleeding-related events, and QT prolongation.

## Haematology

With 2 years of follow-up, the occurrence of severe leukopaenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia were more frequent in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CML. In subjects who reported severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following brief (2 to 4 weeks) dose interruptions or reductions.

In  CA180034, cytopenia was reported less frequently in the 100 mg QD group than in the other 3 treatment  groups.  More  subjects  in  the  100  mg  QD  and  70  mg  BID  groups  (55%  and  54%, respectively) than in the 140 mg QD and 50 mg BID groups (40% and 36%, respectively) had their first  occurrences  of  leukocytopenia  after  8  weeks  of  treatment.  In  CA180035,  more  subjects  in  the BID group reported neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared with the QD group. There was little difference  between  the  QD  and  BID  groups  in  the  time  to  first  occurrence  of  Grade  3  to  4  WBC, platelet, and ANC.

## Fluid Retention

Dasatinib is associated with fluid retention. Fluid retention events were systematically identified in the dasatinib programme. Other events related to fluid retention were also examined including: 1) pleural effusion,  2)  ascites,  3)  pulmonary  oedema,  4)  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  5)  pulmonary hypertension, and 6) pericardial effusion.

In CA180034, fluid retention, any grade, was reported in 264 (40%) subjects. Of these 264 subjects, drug-related  fluid  retention  occurred  in  238  (36%)  subjects.  Pleural  effusion,  any  grade  and  any relationship, was reported in 147 (22%) subjects. Few subjects reported severe (Grade 3 to 5) pleural effusions. The majority of cases of pleural effusion were drug-related (96%; 141/147). Fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group reported pleural effusion (all grades) compared with the 140 mg QD, 50 mg BID, and 70 mg BID groups (14% vs. 25%, 23%, and 23%, respectively). The number of subjects with drug-related fluid-related events (including generalized oedema, pulmonary oedema, CHF/cardiac  dysfunction,  and  pericardial  effusion)  was  generally  lower  in  the  100  mg  QD  group compared with the other 3 treatment groups.

In CA180035, fluid retention, any grade, was reported in 281 (46%) subjects. Of these 281 subjects, drug-related  fluid  retention  occurred  in  227  (37%)  subjects.  Pleural  effusion,  any  grade  and  any relationship, was reported in 181 (30%) subjects. Few subjects reported severe (Grade 3 to 5) pleural effusions. The majority of cases of pleural effusion were drug-related (88%; 159/181) (Table 5.5.2B). Fewer subjects in the QD group reported drug-related pleural effusion compared with the BID group (20% vs. 32%, respectively). The number of subjects with drug-related fluid-related events (including generalized  oedema,  pulmonary  oedema,  CHF/cardiac  dysfunction,  and  pericardial  effusion)  was lower in the QD group compared with BID group.

## Bleeding-related Events

In  CA180034,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  any  grade,  was  reported  in  40  subjects.  Drug-related gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 21 subjects. There  was  little difference in the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding between the 4 treatment groups.

In CA180035, drug-related gastrointestinal bleeding, any grade, was reported in 63 subjects. 10 Fewer subjects  in  the  QD  group  (N  =  25)  compared  with  the  BID  group  (N  =  38)  reported  drug-related gastrointestinal bleeding.

## QT Prolongation

A comprehensive evaluation of data from Phase 2 studies (N = 865) examined the possible effect of dasatinib  on  ECG  parameters,  particularly  the  QTc  interval.  The  mean  QTc  interval  changes  from baseline using Fridericia's method (QTcF) were 4 to 6 msec; the upper 95% confidence intervals for all mean changes from baseline were &lt; 7 msec. A total of 5 subjects (&lt; 1%) reported a QTcF &gt; 500 msec; 1 of these 5 subjects reported a QTcF &gt; 500 msec on both Days 1 and 8. No events of torsade de pointes were reported.

Nine  of  the  1150  subjects  with  chronic  phase  CML  had  QTc  prolongation  reported  as  an  adverse event. Of these 9 subjects, 7 were considered related to drug. None of the 9 subjects who reported QTc prolongation were from the 100 mg QD group compared with 8 subjects from the 70 mg BID group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ten of the 1032 subjects with advanced disease had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse event. Of  these  10  subjects,  7  were  considered  drug-related.  All  10  of  the  subjects  who  reported  QTc prolongation were from the 70 mg BID group.

Overall,  of  the  2182  subjects  treated  with  dasatinib  in  clinical  trials,  21  (1%)  subjects  across  the studies  reported  a  QTcF  &gt;  500  msec,  and  14  (&lt;1%)  had  QTc  prolongation  reported  as  an  adverse reaction. These data have been updated in the proposed SPC, accordingly (Sections 4.4 and 4.8).

## Dose modifications

Analysis of safety showed no meaningful differences in subjects (advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL) with  dose  escalation  (  180  mg  QD)  compared with those without dose escalation (  140  mg  QD) except for pleural effusion, which showed fewer events in subjects with dose escalation (Table 3).

## Discussion on Clinical Safety

Safety results after 2 years of follow-up were consistent with the safety profile reported with shorter follow-up. In chronic phase CML, fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group reported drug-related nonhaematologic toxicities, all grades, than subjects in the 70 mg BID. AEs of special interest including fluid retention, haemorrhage, and some cardiac disorders were reported in fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group compared with the 70 mg BID group. Similarly, in subjects with advanced phase CML or  Ph+  ALL,  the  QD  schedule  of  administration  was  also  associated  with  fewer  drug-related  nonhaematologic toxicities (including AEs of special interest). Myelosuppression usually occurred early, especially in advanced stages of CML. Incidence and severity did not change over time.

## Updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 6.0

The purpose of the RMP update is to provide 2-year post-approval safety data from the two studies for which results are discussed above. Changes to the RMP are summarized in the following table.

-  Update of CNS haemorrhage fatal events.
-  Median duration of treatment updates.
-  Table 2a and 2b are updated with 2-year follow-up data from CA180034 and CA180035: for selected important ADRs
-  Adverse reactions are proposed to merge revised Table 3 (ADRs &gt; 5%) data in the section Adverse Reactions, therefore providing for one list only of ADRs reported in clinical trials. Inclusion of new footnote 'a' related to congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, to be in line  with the CCDS. Addition of electrocardiogram QT prolonged as uncommon ADR. Reclassification of frequencies of pulmonary hypertension, musculoskeletal stiffness, hyperuricaemia  from  uncommon  to  common  ADR.    Re-classification  of  frequency  of temperature intolerance from rare to uncommon ADR.
-  Laboratory test abnormalities haematology is  updated; table 3 (former table 4), Update of patient % experiencing grade 3/4 myelosuppression who permanently discontinued treatment from 1 to 5%: rationale for this updated provided as per cross-reference. Biochemistry ; update to grade 3/4 elevations of transaminases, bilirubin and creatinine, and addition of hypokalemia, in line with CCDS. Electrocardiogram ; information related to QT prolongation.

## Section 4.9:

-  Updated information on effect of overdosage of 280 mg per day reported for 1 week in two patients.

## Section 5.1:

Phase II clinical trials in CML Chronic Phase CML

-  The  applicant  takes  the  opportunity  to  amend  the  statement  related  to  study  CA180013 (approved 22 July 2008, procedure EMEA/H/C/000709/II/008), considered necessary, as the text was inaccurate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Phase III Clinical Trials

-  Updated number of imatinib-resistant patients in chronic phase CML (phase 2 clinical trial).
-  Update to median duration of treatment.

Table 5: Efficacy in Phase III dose optimization study: chronic phase CML

-  Update and reformatting of Table 5 (ex-table 6) with addition of clinically relevant efficacy responses,  as  Major  Molecular  Response  data  +  Survival  data  (PFS  and  OS).  Duration  of MCyR included in text.
-  Efficacy in patients intolerant to imatinib

Table 6: Efficacy in Phase III dose optimization study: advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL

-  Inclusion of new table (Table 6) presenting efficacy data in a Phase 3 dose-optimisation study for Advanced Phase CML and Ph+ ALL. Information on median duration of MaHR, PFS and OS (140mg QD vs. 70mg BID) for accelerated phase, myeloid blast phase and lymphoid blast phase CML, included in the text.

In addition, the MAH has made changes accordingly to sections 3 and 4 of the Package Leaflet, which are acceptable.

## CHMP's comment:

The changes to the Product Information are supported by the data submitted and provide further useful information to the treating physicians.

## Benefit /Risk assessment

This type II variation concerns an update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SPC with 24months  follow-up  data  from  two  Phase  3  studies  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  dasatinib administered once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) (current posology for the advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL indications) in subjects with chronic phase CML (CA180034) and advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL (CA180035).

The current dosing recommendation is 70 mg BID in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL based on three Phase 2 studies and one Phase 3 previously reported with 6 months of follow-up. With long-term follow-up in the dose optimization study (CA180035), efficacy data were similar between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules, and comparable with responses reported at 6 months with 70 mg BID. With both schedules, long-lasting responses were identified. In subjects with Ph+ ALL with longer follow-up, haematologic and cytogenetic response rates were also similar between 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules. The dose of 140 mg QD supports an overall superior benefit risk and should be recommended in this population of advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL.

Safety results after 2 years of follow-up were consistent with the safety profile reported with shorter follow-up. In chronic phase CML, fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group reported drug-related nonhaematologic toxicities, all grades, than subjects in the 70 mg BID. AEs of special interest including fluid retention, haemorrhage, and some cardiac disorders were reported in fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group compared with the 70 mg BID group. Similarly, in subjects with advanced phase CML or  Ph+  ALL,  the  QD  schedule  of  administration  was  also  associated  with  fewer  drug-related  nonhaematologic toxicities (including AEs of special interest). Myelosuppression usually occurred early, especially in advanced stages of CML. Incidence and severity did not change over time.

Overall,  data  presented  in  the  dossier  confirm  the  selection  of  140  mg  QD  as  the  recommended starting dose in subjects with advanced CML and Ph+ ALL. The proposed revised SPC Section 4.2 also includes a revised dose modification guideline:

-  For Dose escalation: in patients who did not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dosage;

-  For  Dose adjustments for undesirable effects: with guidance including interruption, reduction, and escalation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the analyses provided the CHMP considers the dose escalation recommendation justified, as there is a subgroup of patients who derive efficacy benefit with the dose escalation to 180 mg QD. In addition, few differences in the safety profile were reported in subjects with dose escalation thereby demonstrating  that  the  benefit  in  response  received  with  dose  escalation  is  not  compromised  by additional safety risks.

The CHMP consider the proposed changes to the SPC and the Package Leaflet acceptable. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to provide an updated version of the RMP (version 6.0). The revisions introduced in the RMP are relevant and fully adequate. Consequently, annex II has been updated to reflect the latest version agreed with the CHMP.

## CONCLUSION

On 22 January 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.
