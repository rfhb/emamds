PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. White lyophilised powder. The solvent is a viscous, clear and colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Breast cancer Docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with: -operable node-positive breast cancer -operable node-negative breast cancer. For patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1). Docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition. Docetaxel monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

## Non-small cell lung cancer

Docetaxel is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Docetaxel in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for this condition.

<!-- image -->

In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m 2 every three weeks, with trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started the day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered immediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was well tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Gastric adenocarcinoma Docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Head and neck cancer Docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 4.2 Posology and method of administration The use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). Recommended dose For breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. For prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or prednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). Docetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). Breast cancer For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m 2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 is given in combination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ).

<!-- image -->

followed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics.

## Non-small cell lung cancer

In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen is docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m 2 as a single agent.

<!-- image -->

Docetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥1, 500 cells/mm 3 . In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/mm 3 for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m 2 to 75 mg/m 2 and/or from 75 to 60 mg/m 2 . If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m 2 , the treatment should be discontinued.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 . Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily is administered continuously (see section 5.1). Prostate cancer The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 , as a 1-to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m 2 per day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. Gastric adenocarcinoma Treatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after cisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received prophylactic antibiotics. Head and neck cancer · Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at 750 mg/m 2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.  Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. · Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 administered as a 30-minute to 3-hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive chemoradiotherapy. For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product characteristics. Dose adjustments during treatment General

Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.Patients who experience febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m 2 in all subsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should have their dose decreased to 60 mg/m 2 .

## In combination with cisplatin

For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 in combination with cisplatin and whose nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is &lt;25,000 cells/mm 3 , or in patients who experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m 2 . For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product characteristics.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. In combination with capecitabine · For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the next docetaxel / capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0- 1, and resume at 100% of the original dose. · For patients developing the second appearance of  Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m 2 . · For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel dose. For trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. If an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite G-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m 2 . If subsequent episodes of complicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m 2 . In case of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m 2 . Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level &gt; 1,500 cells/mm 3 and platelets recover to a level &gt; 100,000 cells/mm 3 . Discontinue treatment if these toxicities persist (see section 4.4). In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil Recommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product characteristics.

In the pivotal SCCHN studies, patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide prophylactic coverage (e.g. day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles.

Special populations:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with hepatic impairment

Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/ m 2 as single agent, patients who have both elevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin &gt;ULN and/or ALT and AST &gt;3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt;6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST &gt; 1.5 × ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin&gt; 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications. The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. Paediatric population There is no relevant use of docetaxel in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). Elderly 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Docetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of &lt;1,500 cells/mm 3 . Docetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Contraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use For breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). Haematology

Neutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median of 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be retreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level ≥1, 500 cells/mm 3 (see section 4.2).

In the case of severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm 3 for seven days or more) during a course of docetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate symptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic G-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received primary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised Hypersensitivity reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should be available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised cutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe hypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Localised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema followed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see section 4.2). Cutaneous reactions Fluid retention Patients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be monitored closely. Patients with liver impairment In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m 2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel in those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m 2 and LFTs should be measured at baseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). For patients with serum bilirubin levels &gt;ULN and/or ALT and AST &gt;3.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels &gt;6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.

<!-- image -->

In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST &gt; 1.5 × ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin&gt; 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications.

## Patients with renal impairment

There are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel.

## Nervous system

The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiac toxicity

Heart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8).

When patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they should undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For more details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab.

Elderly patients treated with TCF should be closely monitored.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Contraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least 6months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). Others Additional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer For patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or infection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). Complicated neutropenia Symptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated promptly. Gastrointestinal reactions Patients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the follow up period. Congestive heart failure In the docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukaemia requires haematological follow-up. Leukaemia The benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ nodes was not defined fully at the interim analysis (see section 5.1). Patients with 4+ nodes There are limited data available in patients &gt;70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Elderly Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate ≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the elderly patients compared to younger patients. The incidence of the following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.

## Ethanol

This medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin and troleandomycin. As a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction.

Docetaxel is highly protein bound (&gt;95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with concomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not influence the binding of digitoxin.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction between docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was about 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. Docetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. No statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals like ketoconazole or itraconazole). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation There is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore,docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated. Women of childbearing potential /contraception: Women of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur. An effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. In non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). Therefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.

<!-- image -->

Docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel have been obtained in:

- 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m 2 and 75 mg/m 2 of docetaxel as a single agent respectively.
- 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin.
- 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. · 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. · 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). · 1276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). · 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). · 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). These reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; grade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4) and the COSTART terms and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm 3 ) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea and asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. For combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in ≥ 10% are displayed. There was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the trastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. For combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects ( ≥ 5%) reported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). The following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: Hypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the infusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms were flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. Immune system disorders

Severe reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized rash/erythema (see section 4.4).

## Nervous system disorders

The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain including burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Reversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to moderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and hands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently associated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. Less frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe nail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis.

Medicinal product no longer authorised General disorders and administration site conditions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. Fluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is cumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Rare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia Blood and lymphatic system disorders Reversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following docetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m² as single agent. The events were spontaneously reversible within 3 months. Nervous system disorders Very rare: one case of alopecia non-reversible at the end of the study. 73% of the cutaneous reactions were reversible within 21 days. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation was more than 1,000 mg/m2 and the median time to fluid retention reversibility was 16.4 weeks (range 0 to 42 weeks). The onset of moderate and severe retention is delayed (median cumulative dose: 818.9 mg/m 2 ) in patients with premedication compared with patients without premedication (median cumulative dose: 489.7  mg/m 2 ); however, it has been reported in some patients during the early courses of therapy.

Docetaxel 75 mg/m² in combination with capecitabine

Medicinal product no longer authorised Symptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus trastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, 64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm alone. Cardiac disorders Very common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC criteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 is known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The incidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone).

## 4.9 Overdose

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated complications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and mucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD02 Preclinical data Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo , docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. Clinical data Breast cancer Docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy Patients with operable node-positive breast cancer Data from a multicenter open label randomized study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80%, between 18 and 70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m 2 (FAC arm). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as secondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. (TAX 316) An interim analysis was performed with a median follow up of 55 months. Significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of relapses at 5 years was

reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC (25% versus 32%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 7% (p=0.001). Overall survival at 5 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (87% versus 81%, respectively) i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

by 6% (p=0.008). TAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analyzed:

The effect appears to be less pronounced than in patients with 1-3 positive nodes. The benefit/risk ratio was not defined fully in patients with 4 and more positive nodes at this analysis stage. Patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) Data from a multicenter open label randomized trial support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy. 1060 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m 2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size &gt; 2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age &lt; 35 years). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other drugs were given intravenously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomized. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. Median duration of follow-up was 77 months. Significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). Overall survival (OS) was also longer in the TAC arm with TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different between the 2 groups. TAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analyzed (see table below):

Exploratory subgroup analyses for disease-free survival for patients who meet the 2009 St. Gallen chemotherapy criteria - (ITT population) were performed and presented here TAC = docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide FAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophospamide CI = confidence interval; ER = estrogen receptor PR = progesterone receptor a ER/PR-negative or Grade 3 or tumor size &gt;5 cm The estimated hazard ratio was using Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as the factor.

Docetaxel as single agent

Two randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or 392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks.

In alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Without affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p=0.38) or time to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p=0.54), docetaxel increased response rate (52% vs. 37%, p=0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, p=0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart failure).

In anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and vinblastine (12 mg/m² every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate (33% vs. 12%, p&lt;0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01).

Medicinal product no longer authorised During these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). An open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel monotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous therapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3 hour infusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p&lt;0.01) and median survival (15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p=0.03). More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to paclitaxel (23.0%). Docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin One large randomized phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) (AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) (AC arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. · Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.0138. The median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95%CI : 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95%CI : 27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. · Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.009. The ORR was 59.3% (95%CI : 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95%CI : 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. In this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia (8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a higher incidence of severe anemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 20% (13.1 % versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic deaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm (1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). In both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during treatment and follow-up. Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab

Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours over express HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomized to receive docetaxel (100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in this pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using fluorescence in-situ hybridization

In this study, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel +capecitabine combination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days (docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to progressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p&lt;0.0001). The median time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). Non-small cell lung cancer Patients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy In a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) and overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to Best Supportive Care. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p&lt;0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p&lt;0.01), other disease-related medications (p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p&lt;0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to those with BSC. The overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 26.1 weeks. Docetaxel in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-naïve patients

In a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either Docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/ m 2 over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/ m 2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/ m 2 administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis).

Secondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung Cancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status. Results on these end-points were supportive of the primary end-points results. For docetaxel/carboplatin combination, neither equivalent nor non-inferior efficacy could be proven compared to the reference treatment combination VCis. Prostate cancer The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomized multicenter phase III study. A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥60 were randomized to the following treatment groups: · Docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. · Docetaxel 30 mg/m 2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. · Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. All 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, continuously. Patients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival compared to those treated with mitoxantrone. The increase in survival seen in the docetaxel weekly arm was not statistically significant compared to the mitoxantrone control arm. Efficacy endpoints for the docetaxel arms versus the control arm are summarized in the following table:

No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life. Gastric adenocarcinoma A multicenter, open-label, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. A total of 445 patients with KPS&gt;70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) (75 mg/m 2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m 2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/m 2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m 2 per day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF arm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer TTP (p=0.0004) in favor of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer (p=0.0201) in favor of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%.

Subgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favored the TCF arm compared to the CF arm.

A survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed a statistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the benefit of TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up.

Overall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favor of the TCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Head and neck cancer · Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323) The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, and WHO perfomance status 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m 2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m 2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days . This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response ( ≥ 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7  weeks (TPF/RT). Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m 2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m 2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response ( ≥ 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy-2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p=0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in favor of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 28% risk reduction of mortality, p=0.0128.

## · Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324)

The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter open-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two arms. The study population comprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure and patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival endpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 5.  The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Patients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy with a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to day 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses.  Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime following completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxelcontaining regimen compared to PF (median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test p = 0.004. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

A study of 14 C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in both the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl ester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is excreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites and very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the α, β and γ phases of 4 min, 36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Following the administration of a 100 mg/m 2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma level of 3.7 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4. 6 h μg/ml. Mean values for total body clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m 2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter individual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% bound to plasma proteins.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. In a small number of patients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver function impairment (ALT, AST ≥1. 5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥2. 5 times the ULN), total clearance was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are no data available in patients with severe fluid retention.

When used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma levels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration.

Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5'-DFUR.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. The effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard dexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients. No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 5.3 Preclinical safety data The carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. Docetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent with the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. Undesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair male fertility. 6.

In the pivotal SCCHN studies, patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide prophylactic coverage (e.g. day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles.

## Special populations:

## Patients with hepatic impairment

Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m 2 as single agent, patients who have both elevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of docetaxel is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

75 mg/m 2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin &gt;ULN and/or ALT and AST &gt;3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt;6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.

In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST &gt; 1.5 × ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin&gt; 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. Paediatric population There is no relevant use of docetaxel in the paediatric population in the indications breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not including type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. Elderly In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Docetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of &lt;1,500 cells/mm 3 . Docetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Contraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use For breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). Haematology Neutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median of 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be retreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level ≥1, 500 cells/mm 3 (see section 4.2).

In the case of severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm 3 for seven days or more) during a course of docetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate symptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2).

In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic G-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of complicated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received primary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Hypersensitivity reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should be available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised cutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe hypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Cutaneous reactions Localised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema followed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see section 4.2). Fluid retention Patients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be monitored closely. Patients with liver impairment In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m 2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel in those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m 2 and LFTs should be measured at baseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). For patients with serum bilirubin levels &gt;ULN and/or ALT and AST &gt;3.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels &gt;6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST  &gt; 1.5 × ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin&gt; 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other indications.

## Patients with renal impairment

There are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel.

## Nervous system

The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiac toxicity

Heart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8).

When patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they should undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For more details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab.

Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the elderly patients compared to younger patients. The incidence of the following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Others Contraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least 6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). Additional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer For patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or infection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). Complicated neutropenia Symptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated promptly. Gastrointestinal reactions Patients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the follow up period. Congestive heart failure In the docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukaemia requires haematological follow-up. Leukaemia The benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ nodes was not defined fully at the interim analysis (see section 5.1). Patients with 4+ nodes There are limited data available in patients &gt;70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Elderly Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate ≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years.

Elderly patients treated with TCF should be closely monitored.

## Ethanol

This medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin and troleandomycin. As a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised Docetaxel is highly protein bound (&gt;95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with concomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone,phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not influence the binding of digitoxin. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction between docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was about 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. Docetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. No statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals like ketoconazole or itraconazole). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation There is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated. Women of childbearing potential /contraception: Women of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur. An effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. In non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). Therefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. Lactation:

Docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel have been obtained in:

- 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/ m 2 and 75 mg/m 2 of docetaxel as a single agent respectively.
- 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin.

These reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; grade3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4) and the COSTART terms and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea and asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. For combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in ≥ 10% are displayed. There was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the trastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. For combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects ( ≥ 5%) reported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). The following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: Immune system disorders

Hypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the infusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms were flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills.

Severe reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized rash/erythema (see section 4.4).

Nervous system disorders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain including burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Reversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to moderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and hands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently associated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. Less frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe nail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis.

Very common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade ¾ neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC criteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100mg/m 2 is known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The incidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Symptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus trastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, 64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm alone. Cardiac disorders Blood and lymphatic system disorders

## Post-marketing experience

## Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)

Very rare cases of acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemoterapy agents and/or radiotherapy.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised Bone marrow suppression and other haematologic adverse reactions have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Blood and lymphatic system disorders Some cases of anaphylactic shock, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Immune system disorders Rare cases of convulsion or transient loss of consciousness have been observed with docetaxel administration. These reactions sometimes appear during the infusion of the medicinal product. Nervous system disorders Very rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during infusion of the medicinal product and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis, as cases of lacrimal duct obstruction resulting in excessive tearing have been rarely reported. Eye disorders Rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing impaired and/or hearing loss have been reported. Ear and labyrinth disorders Rare cases of myocardial infarction have been reported. Cardiac disorders Venous thromboembolic events have rarely been reported. Vascular disorders Acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Rare occurrences of dehydration as a consequence of gastrointestinal events, gastrointestinal perforation, colitis ischaemic, colitis and neutropenic enterocolitis have been reported. Rare cases of ileus and intestinal obstruction have been reported. Gastrointestinal disorders Very rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Hepatobiliary disorders

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported with docetaxel. In some cases concomitant factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Sclerodermal-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphoedema have been reported with docetaxel.

## General disorders and administration site conditions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Radiation recall phenomena have rarely been reported. Fluid retention has not been accompanied by acute episodes of oliguria or hypotension. Dehydration and pulmonary oedema have rarely been reported.

## 4.9 Overdose

There were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated complications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and mucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.

Data from a multicenter open label randomized study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80%, between 18 and 70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2 and cyclosphosphamide 500  mg/m 2 (FAC arm). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as secondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD02 Preclinical data Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene. In vivo , docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.

Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC.

An interim analysis was performed with a median follow up of 55 months. Significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of relapses at 5 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC (25% versus 32%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 7% (p=0.001). Overall survival at 5 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (87% versus 81%, respectively) i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 6% (p=0.008). TAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analyzed:

Median duration of follow-up was 77 months. Significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). Overall survival (OS) was also longer in the TAC arm with TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different between the 2 groups.

Patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) Data from a multicenter open label randomized trial support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy. 1060 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m 2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size &gt; 2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age &lt; 35 years). Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other drugs were given intravenously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomized. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received FAC.

TAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analyzed (see table below):

Docetaxel as single agent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or 392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks.

In alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Without affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p=0.38) or time to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p=0.54), docetaxel increased response rate (52% vs. 37%, p=0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, p=0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart failure).

In this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia (8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a higher incidence of severe anemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 20% (13.1 % versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic deaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm (1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure).

Medicinal product no longer authorised In anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and vinblastine (12 mg/m² every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate (33% vs. 12%, p&lt;0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01). During these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). An open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel monotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous therapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3 hour infusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p&lt;0.01) and median survival (15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p=0.03). More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to paclitaxel (23.0%). Docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin One large randomized phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) (AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600  mg/m²) (AC arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. · Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.0138. The median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95%CI : 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95%CI : 27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. · Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.009. The ORR was 59.3% (95%CI : 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95%CI : 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm.

In both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during treatment and follow-up.

Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours over express HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomized to receive docetaxel (100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in this pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive. Efficacy results are summarized in the following table.

| Parameter                                     | Docetaxel plus trastuzumab 1 n=92   | Docetaxel 1 n=94   |

In a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) and overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to Best Supportive Care. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p&lt;0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p&lt;0.01), other disease-related medications (p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p&lt;0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to those with BSC.

In this study, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel +capecitabine combination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days (docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to progressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p&lt;0.0001).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Survival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated in the following table. *: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and region of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. Secondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung Cancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status. Results on these end-points were supportive of the primary end-points results. For docetaxel/carboplatin combination, neither equivalent nor non-inferior efficacy could be proven compared to the reference treatment combination VCis. Prostate cancer The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomized multicenter phase III study. A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥60 were randomized to the following treatment groups: · Docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. · Docetaxel 30 mg/m 2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. · Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. All 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily,

Patients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival compared to those treated with mitoxantrone. The increase in survival seen in the docetaxel weekly arm was not statistically significant compared to the mitoxantrone control arm. Efficacy endpoints for the docetaxel arms versus the control arm are summarized in the following table:

Gastric adenocarcinoma A multicenter, open-label, randomized study, was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. A total of 445 patients with KPS&gt;70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) (75 mg/m 2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m 2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/m 2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m 2 per day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF arm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer TTP (p=0.0004) in favor of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer (p=0.0201) in favor of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Subgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favored the TCF arm compared to the CF arm. A survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed a statistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the benefit of TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up. Overall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favor of the TCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF.

## Head and neck cancer

- Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy(TAX323).

The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, and WHO perfomance status 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m 2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m 2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days . This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response ( ≥ 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m 2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m 2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response ( ≥ 25 % reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy-2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p=0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4  vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in favor of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 28% risk reduction of mortality, p=0.0128.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Quality of life parameters Patients treated with TPF experienced significantly less deterioration of their Global health score compared to those treated with PF (p=0.01, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale). Clinical benefit parameters The performance status scale, for head and neck (PSS-HN) subscales designed to measure understandability of speech, ability to eat in public, and normalcy of diet, was significantly in favor of TPF as compared to PF. Median time to first deterioration of WHO performance status was significantly longer in the TPF arm compared to PF. Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate pain management. · Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter open-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two arms. The study population comprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure and patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival endpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 5.  The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT). Patients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy with a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to day 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses.  Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime following completion of CRT.  All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxelcontaining regimen compared to PF (median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test p = 0.004.

A study of 14 C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in both the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl ester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is excreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites and very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with a three-compar tment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the α, β and γ phases of 4 min, 36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Following the administration of a 100 mg/ m 2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma level of 3.7 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h μg/ml. Mean values for total body clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m 2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter individual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% bound to plasma proteins.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. In a small number of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver function impairment (ALT, AST ≥1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are no data available in patients with severe fluid retention.

When used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma levels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5'-DFUR. Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is similar to that observed with cisplatin alone. The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. The effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard dexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients. No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 5.3 Preclinical safety data The carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. Docetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent with the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. Undesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair male fertility. 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Instructions for reconstitution

More than one vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require one 80 mg pack and three 20 mg packs. The required number of Docefrez powder vials should be allowed to reach room temperature (between 15 ° C - 25 ° C) for 5 minutes. Using a syringe with a needle, the entire contents of the correct vial of solvent for Docefrez is to be withdrawn and injected into the respective Docefrez powder vials.

Shake well for complete solubilisation of powder (the powder will be dissolved in less than 90 seconds). The reconstituted solution contains approximately 24 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after preparation.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised Preparation of the infusion solution After reconstitution, each vial contains an extractable volume of approx 3.36 ml concentrate, corresponding to approximately 80 mg docetaxel. The volume of concentrate (24 mg/ml docetaxel) corresponding to the required dose (mg) for the patient should be withdrawn (from the appropriate number of vials) using graduated syringes fitted with a needle. This volume of concentrate should be injected into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater than 200 mg docetaxel is required, a larger volume of the infusion vehicle should be used, so that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded in the final solution for infusion. The solution in the infusion bag or bottle should be allowed to mix manually using a rocking motion. Method of administration The docetaxel infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically administered as a 1 hour infusion under room temperature and normal lighting conditions. Disposal Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7. MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Europe B.V.
