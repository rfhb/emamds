## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for peginterferon beta-1a, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

457 cases of alopecia, including 15 cases with a positive de-challenge, were reported in the postmarketing setting. This is supportive of a causal relationship between the use of peginterferon beta-1a and alopecia. Furthermore, alopecia is listed in the Product Information of all interferon-beta 1a products and is therefore considered to constitute a pharmacological class effect. Based on the occurrence of alopecia in the pivotal clinical trial (2% in the treatment arm vs 1% in the placebo arm), this adverse drug reaction has been assigned the frequency 'common'.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for peginterferon beta-1a the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing peginterferon beta-1a is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
