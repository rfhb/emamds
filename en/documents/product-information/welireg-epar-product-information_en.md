## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 1 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST) or moderate (total bilirubin within range of &gt; 1.5 x ULN and ≤ 3 x ULN and any AST or Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Belzutifan has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy in children less than 18 years of  age have not been established (see section 5.1). No data are available.

## Method of administration

## WELIREG is for oral use.

The tablets should be swallowed whole and may be taken with or without food. Tablets should not be split, crushed or chewed, as it is not known whether this impacts absorption of belzutifan.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- Pregnancy in patients with VHL disease-associated tumours (see section 4.6).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Anaemia

Anaemia has been reported in patients receiving belzutifan in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for anaemia before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with belzutif an. For patients who develop Grade 3 anaemia, belzutif an should be withheld and patients should be treated according to standard medical practice, including erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) administration until resolved to ≤ Grade 2 (see the prescribing inf ormation for ESAs for more information). For recurrent Grade 3 anaemia, belzutif an should be discontinued. For patients who develop Grade 4 anaemia, belzutif an should be withheld and permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 4 anaemia (see section 4.2).

## Hypoxia

Hypoxia has been reported in patients receiving belzutifan in clinical studies (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be monitored for oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with belzutif an. For Grade 3 asymptomatic hypoxia, providing supplemental oxygen and continuing or withholding treatment should be considered. If withheld, belzutifan should be resumed at a reduced dose. For patients who have Grade 3 symptomatic hypoxia, belzutif an should be withheld, hypoxia should be treated, and belzutifan should be resumed at a reduced dose. If symptomatic hypoxia continues to recur, treatment should be discontinued. For Grade 4 hypoxia, treatment should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Embryo-foetal toxicity: Women of childbearing potential

Belzutifan may cause embryo-foetal harm, including foetal loss, in humans (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). The pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to initiating treatment with belzutifan.

Women of childbearing potential have to use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment with belzutifan and f or at least 1 week after the last dose due to the potential risk to the foetus (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).

## CNS haemorrhage in patients with VHL disease-associated CNS-haemangioblastomas (CNS-HB)

CNS haemorrhage, including with fatal outcome, has been observed in patients with VHL diseaseassociated CNS-HB. Physicians should be cautious of symptoms or signs of CNS haemorrhage in patients with VHL disease-associated CNS-HB being treated with belzutifan.

## Information about excipients

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro and pharmacogenomic studies indicate that belzutifan is metabolised by UGT2B17 and by CYP2C19, and that belzutifan induces CYP3A4 in a concentration dependent manner.

## Effects of belzutif an on other medicinal products

Coadministration of belzutifan with CYP3A4 substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, decreases concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. The magnitude of this decrease may be more pronounced in patients who are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (see section 5.2). Coadministration of belzutifan with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, for which minimal decrease in concentration may lead to therapeutic failures of the substrate should be avoided. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate dose in accordance with its summary of product characteristics.

Coadministration of belzutifan with hormonal contraceptives may lead to contraceptive failure (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) or an increase in breakthrough bleeding. Patients using hormonal contraceptives should be advised to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method or have their male partner use a condom during treatment with belzutifan.

In a clinical study, repeat administration of belzutifan 120 mg daily resulted in a 40% reduction in midazolam area under the curve (AUC), an effect consistent with a weak CYP3A4 inducer. Belzutif an may exhibit moderate CYP3A4 induction in patients who have higher belzutifan plasma exposures (see section 5.2).

Based on in vitro data, MATE- 2K inhibition by belzutifan is expected at clinically relevant exposures, and inhibition of MATE1 cannot be excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Belzutifan is a CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 inducer in vitro. In vivo investigations have not been perf ormed. Co-administration with belzutifan may result in a clinically relevant decrease in the plasma concentration of sensitive CYP2B6 and/or CYP2C8 substrates.

## Effects of other medicinal products on belzutifan

Coadministration of belzutifan with inhibitors of UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 increases plasma exposures of belzutifan, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of belzutif an. Patients should be monitored for anaemia and hypoxia and the dose of belzutifan should be reduced as recommended.

Effects of strong CYP2C19 inducers on belzutifan exposure have not yet been studied.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females

The pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to initiating treatment with belzutifan.

Belzutifan may cause embryo-foetal harm, including foetal loss, when administered to a pregnant woman (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Women of childbearing potential should be informed of the potential risk to a f oetus.

Women of childbearing potential have to use highly effective contraception during treatment with belzutifan and for at least 1 week af ter the last dose. Use of belzutifan may reduce the eff icacy of hormonal contraceptives. Patients using hormonal contraceptives should be advised to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method or have their male partner use a condom during treatment with belzutifan (see section 4.5).

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of  belzutif an in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## Renal cell carcinoma

Belzutifan should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with belzutifan.

## von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumours

Belzutifan is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). If pregnancy occurs during treatment with belzutifan, treatment should be discontinued.

## Breast-feeding

There are no data on the presence of belzutif an or its metabolites in human milk, their eff ects on the breast-fed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed children, advise women not to breast-feed during treatment with belzutif an and for 1 week after the last dose.

## Fertility

Based on findings in animals, belzutifan may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). Patients should be advised of this potential risk. The reversibility of the effect on f ertility is unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Belzutifan has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and f atigue may occur following administration of belzutifan (see section 4.8).

Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines, until they are reasonably certain belzutifan therapy does not affect them adversely.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of belzutif an has been evaluated in 576 patients with advanced solid tumours and VHL disease-associated localised tumours treated with 120 mg belzutifan once daily in clinical studies. The median duration of exposure to belzutifan was 9.2 months (range: 0.1 to 55.4 months).

The most common adverse reactions under treatment with belzutifan were anaemia (84.2%), fatigue (42.7%), nausea (24.1%), dyspnoea (21.4%), dizziness (17.9%) and hypoxia (16.3%).

The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were anaemia (28.8%) and hypoxia (12.2%). The most common serious adverse reactions were hypoxia (7.1%), anaemia (4.7%) and dyspnoea (1.2%).

The most common adverse reactions resulting in dose interruption of belzutifan were anaemia (7.1%), hypoxia (5.4%), fatigue (2.6%), nausea (2.4%), dyspnoea (1.7%) and dizziness (1.6%). The most common adverse reactions resulting in dose reduction of belzutifan were hypoxia (6.3%), anaemia (3.8%) and fatigue (1.7%). The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of belzutifan was hypoxia (1.4%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Anaemia (see section 4.4)

Anaemia occurred in 83% of patients with advanced RCC receiving belzutifan, 32% had Grade 3 and 0.5% had Grade 4 anaemia. Median time to onset of anaemia was 29 days (range: 1 day to 27 months). Of the patients with anaemia, 22% received transfusions only, 20% of patients received ESAs only and 14% received both transfusion and ESAs. The median number of ESA doses administered to patients was 6.5 (range: 1-87). Patients received an ESA based on haemoglobin levels and physician discretion (see section 5.1).

Anaemia occurred in 90.2% of patients with VHL disease-associated tumours receiving belzutifan, 11.5% of patients had Grade 3 anaemia. Median time to onset of all Grade anaemia events was 30 days (range: 1 day to 8 months). Of the patients with anaemia, 1.8% received transfusions only, 16.4% received ESAs only and 9.1% of patients received both transfusion and ESAs. The median number of ESA doses administered to patients was 5 (range: 1- 35). Patients received an ESA based on haemoglobin levels and physician discretion (see section 5.1).

The incidence of Grade 3 anaemia increased with higher belzutifan exposure in patients with baseline haemoglobin levels &lt; 12 g/dL (see section 4.4).

## Hypoxia (see section 4.4)

Hypoxia occurred in 15% of patients with advanced RCC receiving belzutifan and 10% of patients had Grade 3 hypoxia and 0.3% patients had Grade 4 hypoxia. Of the patients with hypoxia, 70% were treated with oxygen therapy. Median time to onset of hypoxia was 31 days (range: 1 day to 21 months).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypoxia (Grade 3) was reported in 1.6% of patients with VHL disease-associated tumours receiving belzutifan. Time to onset of  hypoxia was 56 days.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for belzutifan overdose. In cases of suspected overdose, if necessary, withhold belzutifan and institute supportive care. The highest dose of belzutifan studied clinically was 240 mg total daily dose (120 mg twice a day or 240 mg once a day). Grade 3 hypoxia occurred at 120 mg twice a day and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred at 240 mg once daily.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agent, other antineoplastic agents. ATC code: L01XX74

## Mechanism of action

Belzutifan is an inhibitor of  the transcription f actor hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2α). Under normal oxygen levels, HIF2α is targeted f or degradation by VHL protein. Impairment of  VHL protein function results in accumulation of HIF2α. Consequently, HIF -2α translocates into the nucleus and regulates expression genes, associated with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumour growth. Belzutifan binds to HIF2α, and in conditions of  hypoxia or impairment of  VHL protein f unction, belzutifan blocks the HIF2α -HIF-1 β interaction, leading to reduced transcription and expression of HIF2α target genes.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Circulating plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO) were monitored in patients as a pharmacodynamic marker of HIF2α inhibition. Reductions in EPO were observed to be dose/exposure dependent and showed a plateauing effect on reduction at exposures achieved with doses above 120 mg once daily. The maximum EPO suppression occurred following 2 weeks of consecutive dosing of belzutifan (mean percent decrease from baseline of approximately 60%). Mean EPO levels gradually returned to baseline values af ter 12 weeks of treatment.

At the recommended dose (120 mg once daily) for belzutif an, there were no clinically relevant ef f ects on the QTc interval.

## Clinical ef f icacy

## Clinical study in adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)

The efficacy of belzutif an was evaluated in LITESPARK-005, an open-label, randomised, activecontrolled Phase 3 clinical study comparing belzutif an with everolimus in 746 patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic clear cell RCC that has progressed following PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF receptor targeted therapies either in sequence or in combination. Patients could have received up to 3 prior treatment regimens and must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. The study excluded patients with hypoxia, active CNS metastases and clinically signif icant cardiac disease. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 120 mg belzutifan or 10 mg everolimus by oral administration once daily. Randomisation was stratified by International

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk categories (favourable versus intermediate versus poor) and number of prior VEGF receptor targeted therapies (1 versus 2- 3).

Patients were evaluated radiologically at Week 9 from the date of randomisation, then every 8 weeks through Week 49, and every 12 weeks thereafter.

Among the 746 patients in LITESPARK-005, 369 patients received two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-(L)1 inhibitor and at least two VEGF-targeted therapies. The baseline characteristics of those patients were: median age 63 years (range: 33 to 82 years), 40 % age 65 or older; 11 % age 75 or older; 79 % male; 78 % White; 12 % Asian; 1 % Black or African American; 42 % ECOG performance status 0 and 56 % ECOG performance status 1. Prior lines of therapies: 17 % of patients had 2 , 81 % had 3 and 2 % had 4 prior lines of  therapies. Patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 22 % favourable, 66 % intermediate, and 12 % poor.

The primary efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) measured by BICR using RECIST v1.1, and overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by BICR using RECIST v1.1. In the overall population, the study demonstrated statistically significant improvements of  PFS (HR: 0.75 [95% CI 0.63, 0.90], p-Value 0.00077) and ORR (21.9% versus 3.5%, p-Value &lt; 0.00001) for patients randomised to belzutifan compared with everolimus at a pre-specif ied interim analysis (median follow-up time of 13.5 months [range: 0.2 to 31.8 months]).

Table 3 summarises key efficacy measures in the subgroup of patients that received two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-(L)1 inhibitor and at least two VEGF-targeted therapies in LITESPARK-005. The KM curves for PFS and OS are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Clinical study in adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumours The efficacy of belzutif an was investigated in LITESPARK-004, an open-label Phase 2 clinical study in 61 patients with VHL disease who had at least one measurable solid tumour (as defined by RECIST v1.1) localised to the kidney and who did not require immediate surgery. Patients could also have other VHL disease-associated tumours, such as CNS haemangioblastomas and pNET. Patients received belzutifan at a dose of 120 mg once daily. Patients were evaluated radiologically approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter. Treatment was continued until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were required to have an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. The study excluded patients who had any evidence of metastatic disease, either RCC or other VHL disease-associated tumours, an immediate need for surgical intervention for tumour treatment, any major surgical procedure completed within 4 weeks prior to study enrolment, any major cardiovascular event within 6 months prior to study drug administration, or prior systemic treatments for VHL disease-associated RCC.

Among the 61 patients enrolled in LITESPARK-004, the population characteristics were: median age of 41 years, 3.3% age 65 or older; 52.5% male; 90.2% White; and 82.0% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 16.4% had an ECOG PS of 1. Seventy-seven percent of patients had prior RCC surgical procedures. Other VHL disease-associated tumours in patients included pancreatic lesions (100.0%) of which 36.1% were pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, CNS haemangioblastomas (82.0%), and retinal angiomas (19.7%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary efficacy endpoint for the treatment of VHL disease-associated RCC was ORR measured by radiology assessment using RECIST v1.1 as assessed by a central independent review committee (IRC). Additional ef ficacy endpoints included DOR and TTR. ORR and DOR in other VHL diseaseassociated tumours were assessed as secondary efficacy endpoints.

Table 4 summarises the efficacy results for VHL disease-associated RCC tumours in LITESPARK004, based on an interim analysis with a median follow-up time of 49.7 months.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with belzutif an in all subsets of  the paediatric population in renal neoplasms and VHL disease (see section 4.2 f or inf ormation on paediatric use).

## Conditional approval

This medicinal product has been authorised under a socalled 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of belzutifan are similar in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumours including advanced RCC. Based on population PK analysis, the simulated geometric mean steadystate (CV%) Cmax is 1.5 mcg/mL (46%) and AUC0-24hr is 20.8 mcg ·hr/mL (6 4%) in patients treated with 120 mg belzutifan. Steady state is reached after approximately 3 days.

## Absorption

Following single-dose oral administration of 120 mg of belzutifan, peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) of belzutifan occurred at 1 to 2 hours post dose.

## Effect of food

A high-fat, high-calorie meal delayed peak belzutifan concentration by approximately 2 hours but, had no effect on exposure (AUC). There was a modest decrease of Cmax by 24% following consumption of a high-f at, high-calorie meal, but this was not clinically meaningful. Theref ore, belzutifan can be taken without regard to food.

## Distribution

Based on the population PK analysis, the mean (CV%) volume of distribution is 120 L (28.5%). Plasma protein binding of belzutifan is 45%. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of belzutifan is 0.88.

## Biotransformation

Belzutifan is primarily metabolised by UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 and to lesser extent by CYP3A4. Both UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 display genetic polymorphisms (see 'Special popula tions Dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 Poor Metabolisers ' ).

## In vitro assessment of drug interactions

Belzutifan is a substrate of  UGT2B17, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Active transport is not an important determinant of belzutifan disposition. Belzutifan is not an inhibitor of CYP enzymes, UGT enzymes, or transporters with the exception of MATE-2K, and potentially MATE1. Belzutifan does not induce CYP1A2, however, belzutifan induces CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in a concentration dependent manner (see section 4.5).

## Elimination

Based on the population PK analysis, the mean (CV%) clearance is 5.89 L/hr (60.6%) and the mean elimination half-life is approximately 14 hrs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following oral administration of radiolabelled belzutif an to healthy subjects, approximately 49.6% of the dose was excreted in urine and 51.7% in faeces (primarily as inactive metabolites). Approximately 6% of the dose was recovered as parent drug in urine.

## Linearity

The plasma Cmax and AUC increased proportionally over a dose range of 40 mg to 120 mg.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of belzutifan in healthy subjects and patients with cancer, no clinically significant differences in the mean belzutif an exposure were observed between subjects with normal renal f unction and those with mild and moderate renal impairment (as evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)). In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, belzutif an exposure (AUC0-INF) decreased by 6% and increased by 14% in patients with end-stage renal disease before and after haemodialysis, respectively (see section 4.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of belzutifan in healthy subjects and patients with cancer, no clinically significant differences in the mean belzutif an exposure were observed between subjects with normal liver f unction (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN), and those with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 1 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST). In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, belzutif an exposure (AUC0-INF) increased by 52% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied (see section 4.2).

## Dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 Poor Metabolisers

Patients who are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers have higher belzutifan exposures, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of belzutifan and should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Belzutifan is primarily metabolised by UGT2B17 and CYP2C19. The activity of these enzymes varies among individuals who carry different genetic variants, which may impact belzutifan concentrations. Poor metabolisers are individuals who are considered to have no enzyme activity. In patients who are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers, CYP3A4 may be a major elimination pathway. Approximately 15% of Caucasians, 11% of Latinos, 6% of African Americans, 38% of South Asians, and 70% of East Asians are UGT2B17 poor metabolisers. Approximately 2% of Caucasians, 1% of Latinos, 5% of African Americans, 8% of South Asians, and 13% of East Asians are CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. Approximately 0.3% of Caucasians, 0.1% of Latinos, 0.3% of African Americans, 3% of South Asians, and 9% of East Asians are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. Expected frequencies in the Japanese population for the UGT2B17, CYP2C19, and dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers are approximately 77%, 19%, and 15%, respectively. Expected frequencies in the United States population for the UGT2B17, CYP2C19, and dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers are approximately 16%, 3%, and 0.5%, respectively based on the reported proportion of the US population represented by major racial/ethnic groups.

The impact of CYP2C19 and UGT2B17 poor metabolisers on belzutifan exposure was assessed in a population PK analysis. Based on the population PK model, patients who are CYP2C19, UGT2B17, or dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers, are projected to have 1.3-, 2.7- or 3.3 -fold the exposures (steady-state AUC0-24hr), respectively, compared to a typical ref erence patient (UGT2B17 extensive metaboliser, CYP2C19 extensive/intermediate metaboliser) for the recommended dose. No dose adjustment is recommended based on exposure-response analyses for efficacy and safety and the risk-benefit profile.

## Effects of age, gender, ethnicity, race, and body weight

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (range: 19 to 90 years), gender, ethnicity, race, and body weight (range: 42.1 to 166 kg) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetics of belzutifan. Potential dif ferences in exposure across races are possible due to different frequencies of metabolising enzymes (see 'Special populations -Dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 Poor Metabolisers ' ).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Repeat dose toxicity

Repeat-dose oral toxicity studies in rats and dogs for up to 3 months duration revealed anaemia at all doses including at exposure levels lower than the human exposure levels. Although the anaemia was reversible, this is relevant to humans.

## Carcinogenesis

A 26-week transgenic rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study has been conducted with belzutifan at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, corresponding to exposures up to 28-fold the human exposure at the approved dose. No belzutifan-related neoplastic findings were observed at any dose level and no carcinogenic risk was identified in the study.

## Mutagenesis

Belzutifan was not genotoxic in in vitro bacterial mutagenesis and micronucleus assays, and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay at 1.7-f old human exposure.

## Reproductive toxicity

Fertility studies with belzutifan have not been conducted. In the 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, irreversible testicular atrophy/degeneration and oligospermia was observed at exposures lower than the human exposure at the recommended dose of 120 mg daily. No testicular toxicity was observed in dogs up to an exposure similar to the human exposure. There were no findings in female reproductive organs in either rat or dog 3-month toxicity studies, but HIF2α has a f unctional role in the uterus during embryo implantation and establishment of pregnancy in mice. HIF2α inhibition by exposure to belzutifan has the potential to interfere with embryo implantation, leading to impairment of female fertility.

In a rat embryo-foetal development study, administration of belzutifan during organogenesis caused embryo-foetal lethality up to 100%, reduced foetal body weight, and foetal skeletal abnormalities at exposures similar to or below the human exposure at the recommended dose of 120 mg daily.

## 1. What WELIREG is and what it is used for

WELIREG is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance belzutifan. WELIREG is used to treat adults with:

- renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component, a type of kidney cancer. It is used when the cancer is advanced (has spread) f ollowing treatments that target the immune system (PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor) and cancer blood vessels (VEGF-targeted therapy).
- von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease (a genetic condition that causes tumours and cysts to grow in certain parts of the body) who need treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), tumours in the brain and spinal cord called central nervous system haemangioblastomas, or a type of pancreatic cancer called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, and for whom surgery or other local procedures are unsuitable.

The active substance in WELIREG, belzutif an, blocks a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2α). This protein helps control how cells and blood vessels grow, which can play a role in the development and spread of tumours in the body.

## 2. What you need to know before you take WELIREG

## Do not take WELIREG

- -if  you are allergic to belzutif an or any of  the other ingredients of  this medicine (listed in section 6). Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
- -if  you are pregnant and need to be treated f or von Hippel-Lindau disease (see section 'Pregnancy' ).
