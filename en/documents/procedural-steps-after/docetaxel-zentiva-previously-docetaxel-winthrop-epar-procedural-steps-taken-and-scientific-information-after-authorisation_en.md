Update of section 4.7.of the SmPC in order to update the information related to the risk of potential effects of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive and use machines, in line with the outcome of EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001152/201611. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data literature, and main pharmacovigilance textbooks, and medical plausibility, the weighted cumulative evidence is sufficient to support a causal association between enterocolitis, including enterocolitis with fatal outcome and Docetaxel. Section 4.8. of the SmPC under gastrointestinal disorder has been accordingly updated to indicate that rare cases of enterocolitis, including colitis, ischemic colitis, and neutropenic enterocolitis, have been reported with a potential fatal outcome (frequency not known) and that rare occurrences of dehydration have been reported as a consequence of gastrointestinal events including enterocolitis and gastrointestinal perforation.

Section 4.4. of the SmPC regarding gastrointestinal reactions has likewise been updated  on this respect and caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of docetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early as on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity.

Section 4.7. of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or use machines. Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact of the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use machines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data Medicinal product | 25/04/2014 no | 24/04/2015 SmPC, Annex II and PL longer | Study GEICAM 9805 was a pivotal, non-blinded, randomized, phase III study, designed to compare disease- free survival after adjuvant chemotherapy following primary surgery for breast cancer in high risk node negative patients receiving one of the following adjuvant combination chemotherapy regimens: TAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) or FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65- 1.08), p=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in favour of TAC. At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)). |

The updated safety data do not change the long- term safety profile of docetaxel in a combination regimen with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Overall, the CHMP concluded the benefit risk balance of docetaxel remains positive in its approved indications. authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| II/0039 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add a warning and update the safety information on interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors further to the PRAC assessment of a signal. In addition the MAH took the opportunity to correct inconsistencies on the number and grade of alopecia adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH product | 18/12/2013 31/01/2014 no longer | Based on available safety information from a literature review performed by the MAH, the CHMP considered that the current wording on the risk of interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be strengthened to reflect that concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole) should be avoided. In case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may increase, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a dose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. |

cases consistent with an increase in docetaxel toxicity that were reported when it was combined with ritonavir (section 4.5). The mechanism behind this interaction is a CYP3A4 inhibition, the main isoenzyme involved in docetaxel metabolism by ritonavir. In addition, based on extrapolation from a pharmacokinetic study with ketoconazole in 7 patients, section 4.5 now recommends considering a 50% docetaxel dose reduction if patients require co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as azole antifungals, ritonavir and some macrolides (clarithromycin, telithromycin).

Moreover, section 4.8 has been updated to include acute respiratory distress syndrome and cases of interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis sometimes fatal that have rarely been reported and cases of persisting alopecia. Cases of renal insufficiency and renal failure have also been reported and included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In about 20% of these cases there were no risk factors for acute renal failure such as concomitant nephrotoxic drugs and gastro-intestinal disorders. Finally, reference to the frequency of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodisplastic syndrome reported in association with doxetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy has been deleted.

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data Medicinal | 22/09/2011 24/10/2011 SmPC and Annex II The TAX 316 study has been conducted to support the extension of indication of Taxotere in the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes (EMEA/H/C/073/II/54, Commission Decision 5 January 2005). The primary objective of this parallel, nonblinded, randomized phase 3 study was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) after treatment with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) to 5 fluorouracil in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) in operable breast cancer patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. The secondary objective was to compare overall survival (OS), toxicity, and quality of life between the 2 above-mentioned arms, and to evaluate pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy. The 10-year follow-up visit was the last follow-up visit, occurring 120 months after the last administration of study drugs (a range of 4 months was allowed, meaning that it should have occurred at least 116 months after the last administration of study drugs). The final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer disease-free product no longer authorised |

Overall survival at 10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. Overall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC. With regard to safety in patients treated with the TAC regimen fo authorised   |

| II/0012   | Update of SPC section 4.1 to add a new indication for docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer. Adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer. This extension of indication is based on results of the Geicam 9805 study. Consequently, SPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 as well as the Package Leaflet have been updated. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to perform a correction in SPC section 6.6 and PL concerning the preparation guide for the 20mg/1ml, 80mg/4ml and 160mg/8ml concentrate for solution for infusion presentations.

| II/0009   | This type II variation concerns an update of SPC section 4.3 to remove the existing contraindication for pregnant and breast-feeding women as well as an update to sections 4.4 and 4.6 regarding the contraceptive measures for women and men for all strengths. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the expression of the strength for the two initially approved 20mg (20mg/0.5ml) and 80mg (80mg/2ml) strengths was amended in the SPC, labelling and package leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes throughout the SPC and package leaflet for the 20mg/0.5ml and 80mg/2ml strengths to further align with the 20mg/1ml and 80mg/4ml strengths. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Medicinal product | 19/11/2009   | 18/12/2009 no longer | and The current approved information on lactation states that docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. Therefore, when a woman has to be treated after delivery of the baby, docetaxel should be prescribed due to the severity of the disease and a lactating woman should stop breastfeeding instead of not being treated with docetaxel and continuing breastfeeding. This is justified by the benefit for the treated woman compared to the benefit of breastfeeding. Therefore, CHMP agreed that breast-feeding is removed as a contraindication from SPC section 4.3. In accordance with the Guideline on risk assessment of medicinal products on human reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005) as well as taking into account that an alternative safer treatment is not an option and as the treatment cannot be delayed, the MAH considered that an absolute contraindication for pregnant women is not justified. The CHMP agreed to the |

Contraceptive measures are indeed justified by the pharmacodynamic properties of docetaxel. Docetaxel acts on mitotic cells by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules and inhibits theirs disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. As spermatogenesis occurs during adulthood, male gamete could bear DNA aberrations that justify several spermatogenetic cycles after treatment in order to eliminate such gametes. Furthermore, docetaxel may pass into seminal fluid and may have effect on the foetus. This risk occurs only during 7 days after treatment, which is the duration of full elimination of docetaxel in faeces and urine. Taking into account authorised   |

Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals like ketoconazole or itraconazole). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. Sclerodermal-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema have been reported with docetaxel. authorised   |
