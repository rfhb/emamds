## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

In the updated EMA core SmPC for IVIGs EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 Rev. 5 (effective as of 1 st January 2019) the indication for SID is as follows

- Secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF)* or serum IgG level of &lt;4 g/l
* PSAF= failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide and polypeptide antigen vaccines

This indication is not yet part of the coreSmPC for SCIGs

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

As outlined above, in 2019 the SID indication in the coreSmPC for IVIGs was expanded from CLL, MM, and HSCT to encompass other entities that could lead to a secondary immunodeficiency, whilst also providing a clearer outline of what constitutes an antibody deficiency in this setting. As many patients with SIDs require prolonged treatment with Igs, it may prove beneficial to provide SCIG home treatment for these patients.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has provided literature both with their product Hizentra and from the class of SCIGs and IVIGs in support of this extension/modification of indication.

## Disease or condition

SID is an umbrella term for variety of diseases with secondary immune defects, including hematologic malignancies, HIV infections, prematurity, hypogammaglobulinemia associated with solid organ or bone marrow transplantation. Medications such as rituximab, CD19-targeting agents, CAR-T cell therapy, penicillamine, atacicept, imatinib, cyclophosphamide, anticonvulsant and antiepileptic drugs, mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, sulphasalazine, and gold can result in SID. Secondary antibody deficiencies, a humoral type of SID, can be up to 30 times more common than primary immunodeficiencies [Patel et al, 2019].

Currently, SID indications approved for IgPro20 and other SCIG products in the EU are limited to CLL, MM, and Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Similar to PID, SID can often manifest as increased frequency or unusual complications of common infections [Chinen and Shearer, 2010] and can benefit from IgG immune-replacement therapy in the same range of recommended doses regardless of the underlying cause, with adjustment to the individual response to treatment. However, unlike PID, SID can be reversible if the underlying cause is resolved.

## State the claimed the therapeutic indication

In analogy to IVIG the claimed SID indication for Hizentra would be:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF)* or serum IgG level of &lt; 4 g/l.

*PSAF = failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide and polypeptide antigen vaccines.

## Dosing for replacement therapy in PID/SID:

The dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG level (measured before the next infusion) of at least 6 g/l within the normal reference range for the population age. A loading dose of at least 0.2 to 0.5 g/kg (1.0 to 2.5 ml/kg) body weight may be required. This may need to be divided over several days. After steady state IgG levels have been attained, maintenance doses are administered at repeated intervals to reach a cumulative monthly dose of the order of 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg (2.0 to 4.0 ml/kg) body weight. Each single dose may need to be injected at different anatomic sites.

Trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the patient's clinical response. Depending on the clinical response (e.g., infection rate), adjustment of the dose and/or the dose interval may be considered in order to aim for higher trough levels.

## Infusion volumes and rates

## Device-assisted infusion

The initial infusion rate should not exceed 20 ml/hour/site.

If well-tolerated (see also section 4.4), the infusion rate can then gradually be increased to 35 ml/hour/site for the subsequent two infusions. Thereafter, if the patient tolerates the initial infusions at the full dose per site and maximum rate, an increase in the infusion rate of successive infusions may be considered at the discretion of the patient and based on the healthcare professionals' judgement.

## Manual push infusion

The recommended initial infusion rate should not exceed 0.5 ml/min/site (30 ml/hour/site).

If well-tolerated, the infusion rate can be increased up to 2.0 ml/min/site (120 ml/hour/site). Thereafter, if the patient tolerates the initial infusions at the full dose per site and maximum rate, an increase in the infusion rate of successive infusions may be considered at the discretion of the patient and based on the healthcare professionals' judgement.

A 24 or larger (i.e., lower gauge number) needle gauge may be required to allow patients to infuse at higher flow rates. Using smaller needles (i.e., higher gauge number) may make it more difficult to manually push Hizentra. Only one infusion site per syringe can be infused. If administration with an additional Hizentra syringe is required, a new sterile injection needle should be used, and the infusion site changed.

## Epidemiology

The epidemiology is difficult to assess as the umbrella term SID covers a wide range of underlying disorders. Here are some of the main categories:

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) worldwide (ww) incidence: 1-5.5 /100.000

Multiple myeloma (MM) ww incidence: 0.5 - 5.3/100.000

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in EU in 2017: 30.000 cases Solid organ transplantation (SOT) ww in 2014: 119.873

## Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis

Relevant in the context of this Variation Procedure is the aspect that in a number of SIDs with antibody depletion/deficiency the clinical presentation (and thus treatment) is similar to PIDs.

In CLL up to 80% of CLL patients experience infectious complications at some point during their disease, 20% of them severe/major infections. Up to 60% of overall mortality in CLL is caused by infectious complications.

In a study of more than 3,000 patients with multiple myeloma, infections were responsible for 45% of deaths within 6 months of diagnosis (SID - Secondary Immune Deficiency in Haematologic Malignancies » SID (secondaryimmunodeficiency.com)

## Management

Currently, treatment of primary diseases that cause SID includes antibiotics, steroids, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT). Protocols for IgRT in secondary antibody deficiency vary, and a 12-month use of IgRT (with infection monitoring) is recommended in case of antibody failure and a lack of an adequate response to prophylactic antibiotics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in association with a significant ongoing infection burden [Jolles et al, 2017]. Currently, IgRT is administered via either IVIG or SCIG routes [Perez et al, 2017]

Prophylactic non-live vaccinations such as influenza are recommended for patients with SID. Live vaccination is generally not recommended. Use of inactivated vaccines in patients with MM is allowed, unless they are actively receiving chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody therapy

Recent market research of secondary specialty pharmacy data from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Australia and Canada reported that the major secondary antibody deficiency indications leading to IgRT usage were CLL and MM, which represent 39.2-54.9% of all patients with secondary antibody deficiency receiving IgRT .

To extend the indication beyond the use of CLL and MM (which represent ~39 -55% of all patients with SID receiving IgRT) to encompass the suggested broader indication of SID, an increase in demand would be imminently expected.

## 2.1.2. About the product

IgPro20 (HIZENTRA) is a 20% ready-to-use liquid formulation of polyvalent human immunoglobulin G (IgG) for SC administration produced by CSL Behring. The IgG portion represents all IgG subclasses present in human plasma. IgG function (fragment crystallizable region and antigen binding fragment mediated activity) is retained. The sterile 20% IgG solution is stabilized with 250 mmol/L L-proline at pH 4.8. IgPro20 also contains 8 to 30 mg/L polysorbate 80. It has a low sodium content (&lt; 10 mmol/L), with an osmolality of approximately 390 mOsmol/kg, and does not contain any preservatives. The protein moiety of IgPro20 is highly purified IgG (≥ 98% purity). More than 90% of the IgG consists of monomers and dimers. IgPro20 is prepared from large donor pools and represents the antibody spectrum present in the donor population. The manufacturing process of the subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) solution Hizentra is based on the IgPro10 (Privigen: EMEA/H/C/831) process except for formulation and final protein concentration. Filling sizes include 5 mL (1 g), 10 mL (2 g), 15 mL (3 g) and 20 mL (4 g).

IgPro20 (marketed as Hizentra®) is a Human Normal Immunoglobulin product that belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of immune sera and immunoglobulins (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification code: J06BA01): immunoglobulins, normal human, for extravascular (subcutaneous [SC]) administration. It is approved for replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency (PID) and various other indications and has been marketed in many countries including the United States (US), the European Union (EU), Canada, Switzerland, Japan, and Australia. Currently, secondary immunodeficiency (SID) conditions approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) for IgPro20 are limited to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

## 2.1.3. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

No Scientific Advice was sought. But as the indication requested in this Variation Procedure is already an accepted indication in the coreSmPC for IVIGs, where no further studies are required for the Variation of the SID indication wording (apart from a PID study for the initial MAA). It is acceptable to use the IVIG coreSmPC as a basis for the approach to including the SID wording for an SCIG product, provided the questions posed are satisfactorily answered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

There are no changes to the risks of the product for the environment in relation to this application.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.

The updated data submitted in this application and the new/extended indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of human normal immunoglobulin.

- Considering the above data, human normal immunoglobulin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The Variation Application is based on literature studies either with Hizentra (IgPro20) or other SCIGs and/or IVIGs in the indication of SID.

As SCIGs can be viewed as a class of biologics that have shown similar efficacy in the PID setting and for CLL and MM, it is acceptable to base this application on a literature review, provided that sufficient data is evaluable for Hizentra in SID patients. Furthermore, any data from IVIG/SCIG studies in SID is considered supportive. Data from the various studies may also inform on dosing, keeping in mind that in immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) should be tailored to the individual patient's needs. Data on safety in the SID setting should be assessed against the backdrop of Hizentra's safety profile to date.

## GCP

The MAH has provided a statement on the literature studies and their accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Summary of main studies

Trials performed with Hizentra (IgPro 20) in SID encompassed:

- Vacca et al 2018, a prospective, controlled, randomised 18-month study in 46 multiple myeloma (MM) patients (24 on IgPro20 and 22 controls) with IgG &lt;500 mg/dL who received a monthly total dose of 0.4 to 0.8 g SCIg/Kg. Various patient characteristics were well-balanced between the 2 arms. Anti-myeloma therapy consisted of Bortezomib, IMIDs or chemotherapy, Approx 28% had received previous autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). None of the enrolled patients received ASCT during the study. No patient received antibiotic prophylaxis.

The primary endpoint was the annual rate of severe infections ( Table 2 ). Median IgG trough levels ranged from 8.3 to 9.5 g/L in the verum group and from 2.4 and 5.2 g/L in the control arm group. A significantly lower number of infections (p &lt; 0.001) were observed in the SCIg group. There were 16 major infections episodes in the SCIG group and 190 in the control group. The differences between the 2 arms were also significant for total number of infections, respiratory infections, days in hospital/y and days under antibiotic treatment/y.

- Campagno et al, 2014, single centre, retrospective study in 61 patients with rituximab-related SID. Mean duration of SCIG was 19 months; 35 pts on Subcuvia, 26 on Vivaglobin who then switched to Hizentra. Mean dose SCIG was 75 mg/week. 31/61 had been previously treated with IVIG (washout/wash-in of 15-22 days). Therapy was started at IgG &lt; 600 mg/dl and concurrent serious nonneutropenic infections (&gt; 2 episodes in 12 months). Serum trough levels were higher with SCIG compared to IVIG, which is to be expected. SCIG showed better general tolerability and safety, but more infusion site reactions. Serious infections (pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, sepsis) occurred in 24/61 patients pre-IG treatment (0.46 episodes/pt/y) and dropped 4-fold in 12/33 SBIs under IVIG (0.10 episodes/pt/y) and 11/61 SBIs under SCIG (0.11 episodes/pt/y).

Although efficacy and safety are shown for SCIG, it remains unclear from the Campagno study when the patients were switched from Vivaglobin to IgPro20 and how much of the latter they received. Thus, although the data are consistent and supportive, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions specifically for IgPro20. The MAH was requested to ascertain how many patients received which amount of Hizentra. In response, the MAH has quoted the information from the Compagno article on the 26 patients receiving Hizentra. Further details are not provided; the MAH could have contacted the author.

However, as mentioned above, the efficacy and safety data on the 61 patients treated with SCIG at a mean dose of 75 mg/kg/week (Subcuvia/Vivaglobin/Hizentra) are consistent with other SCIGs. Both IVIG and SCIG reduced yearly SBIs four-fold compared to pre-Ig treatment. The response was considered acceptable.

- Shankar et al 2013, retrospective analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement on 10 lung-transplant recipients. Hypogammaglobulinemia as defined by IgG below 500 mg/dl, but patients were also included if their level was below 750 mg/dl and they had recurrent infections (e.g., 2 episodes of pneumonia per year). 4 patients received Hizentra and 6 received Vivaglobin, but all eventually transitioned to Hizentra when production of Vivaglobin was discontinued. All 10 patients demonstrated an increase in IG levels at three months that was sustained at 6-12 months with SCIG replacement therapy, with the majority (70%) tolerating infusion without complications. 3 infusion site reactions were seen (2 with Vivaglobulin and 1 with Hizentra)

The data from the Shankar study are consistent with the other data provided, showing increases of IgG levels under SCIG therapy in lung-transplant recipients. As it was difficult to draw distinct conclusions for Hizentra due to the overlap of Vivaglobin. The MAH was requested to ascertain how many patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received which amount of Hizentra. In response, the MAH provided information from the Shankar article on the 4 patients receiving Hizentra. The MAH could have contacted the author. Nevertheless, the study suggests that SCIG therapy is well tolerated and leads to reliable increases in IgG levels. The response was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

- Spadaro et al 2016, a non-randomised cross-over study in 14 patients with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disease (12 with NHL and 2 with CLL) who had been treated for at least 6 months with a rituximab-including chemo-immunotherapy regimen. In all patients hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 400 mg/dl) was detectable for at least 12 months after discontinuation of rituximab. Patients were treated initially with IVIG at a mean dose of 400 (± 15.7) mg/kg/month, with an interval between each infusion of 3 weeks. Seven patients received IgVena (Kedrion), 4 patients used Kiovig (Baxter), and 3 patients Flebogamma (Grifols). After six months of IVIG therapy, all patients were switched to SCIG therapy at a mean dose of 100 (± 4.4) mg/kg/week, with an interval between each infusion of one week (10 patients received Hizentra and 4 patients Subcuvia). Mean serum levels increased under IVIG to within normal ranges and increased again under SCIG. Infections (both higher and lower respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal infections) were considerably reduced under replacement therapy. Previously, (i.e. before replacement therapy mean infections were 11.1±3 - this was reduced to 3±1.4 under replacement therapy.

These data support the above findings, showing increases of IgG levels under IVIG and further increases under SCIG. The definition of infections is slightly different in this study (i.e., not delineating SBIs) - however, the &gt;3-fold reduction of infections under both administration routes (IVIG and SCIG; 10 patients on Hizentra) is clear.

Trials with SCIG /IVIG either without Hizentra, or where the brand is not mentioned:

- Dimou et al 2018; in a retrospective single centre study, 33 SID patients with haematological malignancies were treated with HyQvia, 13/33 were already on IVIG before switching. All patients had ≥2 severe bacterial infections in the 12 months prior to treatment. The treatment goal for all patients was IgG trough levels around 600 mg/dl. The dose of fSCIg (10% IgG) was 0.4-0.8 mg/kg/month with dose intervals between 3-4 week. 29 patients remained on HyQvia, 3 patients died due to the underlying illness and 1 switched to IVIG due to a rash. 6 patients had infections (all had IgG levels &lt; 600 mg/dL), 5 were then put on shorter intervals and no new infections occurred. Data from 6 months after HyQvia administration shows trough levels in 17 patients above 600 mg/dL. The ADRs were generally mild and reflect those described in the product's SmPC.

Data from this small, retrospective study in patients with haematological malignancies treated with HyQvia are generally sparse esp. for 12 and 24 months, but they remain supportive for replacement therapy in SID patients.

- Reiser et al 2017; the SIGNS study was a prospective, long-term (FU 3y/pt) non-interventional study (NIS) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01287689). Forty-eight centres throughout Germany enrolled 307 SID patients (CLL, MM, indolent lymphoma, and other malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma or HIV). Particular focus of the study was the annual SBI rate. 31% were newly treated with IGs and 69% were on maintenance therapy. Significant differences in doses were seen between patients on IVIG (199 mg/kg per 4 weeks) compared those on SCIG (343 mg/kg per 4 weeks, p=0.003); however only 20 patients received SCIG (6.5%). Median plasma trough levels did not differ remarkably in the course between patients with recommended dosing and those with lower than recommended doses (threshold at 200 mg/kg every 4 weeks, p=0.274).

Before treatment with IVIG/SCIG the SBI/pt/y was 0.250, after treatment this dropped 7-fold to 0.036.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

15 reports on adverse events were received (see Safety Section)

This interesting NIS provides the largest current dataset of patients with SID treated with IG under real-life conditions and supports the data above, albeit in a small number of patients receiving SCIG (n=20/307). The IVIG dosing that was generally at the lower end of recommendations (mean: 205 mg/kg per month) and led to median trough levels of about 6 g/l, was nevertheless efficacious in decreasing infection rates. IgRT was interrupted in every fourth patient due to 'drug holidays' in the summer months when the risk of infections spontaneously decreases.

- Benbrahim et al 2019; this was a non-interventional, longitudinal, prospective French study (21 sites) in 160 patients starting IgRT (octagam (IVIG) and gammanorm (SCIG)) for hematological malignancies associated with SID. It was part of a larger study (Benbrahim et al 2018 in 238 patients), whereby this subgroup analysis for patients receiving octagam or gammanorm had been prospectively planned. The patients were followed-up for 8.7 ± 4.0 months. 17 patients died (5 of sepsis). lgRT was initiated with IVIg in 50 patients (31.3%) and with SCIg in 110 (68.8%) patients; with a total of 398 IVIg and 3421 SCIg infusions. Mean monthly doses were the same for both routes.

Treatment was discontinued in 9% of patients, stopped for futility in 31% (i.e the patient was no longer at risk of infection), temporally interrupted in 8%, suspended during summertime in 14% (drug holiday) and pursued without interruption in 38% of patients. In addition, IgRT was stopped by 15 patients (9.4%) for personal convenience (N = 9), lack of efficacy (N = 3), tolerance concern (N = I), organizational problem (N = 1).

Compared to baseline, lgRT increased serum IgG levels from 4.7 ± 3.4 g/L to 7.7 ± 2.8 g/L. The proportion of patients with serum lgG levels &lt;5 g/L decreased from 69.2% at baseline to 15.9% at last visit whatever the route of administration . 37% had ≥1 infection leading to hospitalisation in the 12 months prior to study entry. The annual incidence of infections dropped from 2.43 to 1.90. Infections leading to hospitalisation decreased from 0.58/pt/y to 0.31/pt/y (p= 0.04) this decrease was mainly seen in the relapsed or refractory patients. IgRT was well tolerated. No serious adverse events were recorded during the study, (see Safety Section).

In keeping with the other data, lgRT increased serum IgG levels (by 3.4±2.4 g/L) and decreased frequency and severity of infections compared to baseline. Overall, the products octagam or gammanorm were well-tolerated. Published SCIG doses are as shown in Table 3 .

CLL=Chroniclymphocyticleukemia,MM=multiplemyeloma,NHL=non-Hodgkinlymphoma,PID= Primary immunodeficiency,SCIG=Subcutaneous immunoglobulin,SID=Secondary immunodeficiency

Analysis of IgG doses used for treatment of 6000+ patients with PID and SID (of these, 845 were SID patients) in the United Kingdom [Shillitoe et al, 2018] demonstrates that mean doses of IgG products in 37 clinical centres were around 600 mg/kg/month, equivalent to 150 mg/kg/week.

The doses provided from the literature mainly lie within the range recommended for SCIG for PIDs, i.e., a cumulative monthly dose of the order of 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg. However, lower doses may be equally efficacious in SID e.g., Compagno also demonstrated efficacy at SCIG doses of 75 mg/kg/week (300/kg/month). As mentioned in the SCIG coreSmPC for PID patients, the dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG of at least 5- 6 g/L. This in turn will depend on tailoring to the patients' needs and should be assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. A similar approach should be taken with SID patients.

Interestingly, 2 studies mentioned 'drug holidays' when IgRT was interrupted in the summer months due to the lower risk of infections. This concept is not specifically mentioned in the coreSmPC or product specific SmPCs but may be considered as part of the approach of individual tailoring of doses and dosing intervals.

To a great extend these international Practice Guidelines recommend that SID patients with severe hypogammaglobulinemia and repeated infections receive doses of ~ 0.3 -0.5 g/kg every 3-4 weeks. A number of GLs do not recommend prophylactic immunoglobulin use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Background

For the initial Marketing Authorisation, the Applicant provided adequate PK, efficacy and safety data for Hizentra (IgPro20) in PID patients in both European and US studies. Under the stipulations of the SCIG GL (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/410415/2011 rev 1) the indication hypogammaglobulinemia due to the SIDs CLL, MM and HSCT were granted without further studies. The MAH now seeks to extend the latter indications to cover a wider group of SID syndromes as delineated in the IVIG coreSmPC.

## SID studies with Hizentra

The MAH submitted a literature review of studies both with Hizentra in SID patients and as supportive evidence studies with other IVIG/SCIG products. As mentioned above SCIGs can be viewed as a class of biologics that have shown similar efficacy in the PID setting and for CLL and MM. Thus, it is considered acceptable to base this application on a literature review.

A well-designed trial performed by Vacca et al (2018) and independently of CSL Behring, was a prospective, controlled, randomised 18-month study in 46 MM patients (24 on IgPro20 and 22 controls) with hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG &lt;500 mg/dL) who received doses of 0.4 to 0.8 g SCIg/kg/month. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of severe infections. Median IgG trough levels ranged from 8.3 to 9.5 g/L in the verum group and from 2.4 and 5.2 g/L in the control arm group. A significantly lower number of infections (p &lt; 0.001) were observed in the SCIg group. There were 16 major infections episodes in the SCIG group and 190 in the control group. The results unequivocally show that Hizentra administration to MM patients results in a reduced rate of infections, a shorter length of hospitalization and a lower number of days of antibiotic therapy. This prospective, controlled study clearly supports the efficacy of IgPro20 in MM patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Side-effects were in the range of those expected with SCIGs.

The other studies with Hizentra performed by Campagno, Shankar and Spadaro support these efficacy data. In addition to the indication MM of the Vacca study, these 3 studies included 61 patients with rituximab-related SID, 10 lung-transplant recipients and 14 patients with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and rituximab-related SID, respectively. Definitions of hypogammaglobulinemia varied slightly among the 3 studies (600 mg/dL, 500 mg/dL, 400 mg/dL respectively).

## Other supportive studies

Further studies either without Hizentra, or where the brand is not mentioned encompass those by Dimou, Reiser, and Benbrahim. The Dimou study was a retrospective study in 33 patients with haematological malignancies treated with HyQvia and aimed at providing IgG trough levels above 600 mg/dL (achieved in 17 pts at 6 months). However, the data are generally sparse, but could be considered supportive for replacement therapy in SID patients. The Reiser trial was a NIS in 307 patients with various underlying SID conditions; 20 patients thereof received SCIG, the other patients received IVIG. Median trough levels of about 6 g/l were reached, despite slightly lower dosing regimens (IVIG: 205 mg/kg per month); SBIs/pt/y dropped 7-fold after treatment to 0.036. The Benbrahim study was a NIS, prospective French trial in 160 patients receiving octagam (IVIG) and gammanorm (SCIG)) for hematological malignancies associated with SID. lgRT increased serum IgG levels (from 4.7 ± 3.4 g/L to 7.7 ± 2.8 g/L.) and decreased frequency and severity of infections compared to baseline.

## Dosing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The doses provided from the literature studies mainly lie within the range recommended for SCIG for replacement therapy, i.e., a cumulative monthly dose of the order of 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg. Some of the studies submitted, indicated that lower doses may be feasible. In general, an IgG trough level of above 600 mg/dL is considered protective for most serious infections for the majority of PID/SID patients. Tailoring of doses is deemed essential and should always be performed in conjunction with the infection rate of a given individual. Hence in studies in replacement therapy, regardless of the pathogenesis of the hypogammaglobulinemia (PID or SID), one of the aims is to achieve a trough level above 600 mg/dL.

## International Practice Guidelines

International Practice Guidelines support the use of IgRT for SID patients, at doses of approx. 0.4 g/kg every 3-4 weeks to be adjusted for individual IgG trough levels.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The total data set submitted by the MAH is considered sufficient to support the efficacy of Hizentra in SID patients.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

In the initial Marketing Authorisation, the Applicant provided adequate PK, efficacy and safety data for Hizentra (IgPro20) in PID patients in both European and US studies that led to the authorisation in 4/2011.

Literature review (as used for efficacy above)

Vacca et al showed in 46 multiple myeloma (MM) patients (24 on IgPro20 and 22 controls) that ADRs were predominantly mild, and in only 3 patients did their severity require the discontinuation of the SCIg infusion: 2 of them experienced pain and inflammatory reaction at the site of injection, and one showed an extensive allergic skin reaction after the second administration that resolved following steroid and antihistamine therapy.

In 61 patients (33 previously on IVIG) treated for SID secondary to B-cell lympoproloferative disorders Campagno et al showed that SCIG had better general tolerability and safety than IVIG, but more infusion site reactions. Only 2 patients (2/61) decided to return to the IVIG route of administration due to poor local tolerance and only 1/61 required pre-medication.

In the study by Shankar et al the majority (7/10 - 70%) tolerating infusion without complications. 3 infusion site reactions were seen (2 with Vivaglobulin and 1 with Hizentra)

In the Reiser study with various IVIGs and SCIGs there were 15 reports on adverse events (11 nonserious and 4 serious leading to hospitalisation) were obtained on the various lgG agents (all intravenous, none on subcutaneous preparations). Events were specified as allergic reactions (2 patients), chills (5), back pain (1), thoracic pain (1), (severe) nausea (3), pleuritis (1), dizziness (1), and mild proctitis (1).

In the octagam (IVIG) and gammanorm (SCIG) study by Benbrahim no serious adverse events were recorded during the study. Only 6 patients (3.7%) reported adverse events: pneumonia (IVIg), itching/ swelling/redness (2 patients, SCIg), blood pressure increase (IVIg), and rash (SCIg), cold sensation/asthenia (SCIG).

## Post marketing experience

During the reporting period of the latest PSUSA EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001633/202005 (01/06/2017 31/05/2020), safety related changes were made to the RSI. These included:

- Updates due to the completed clinical studies PATH (IgPro20\\_3003) and
- PATH Extension (IgPro20\\_3004) in CIDP patients.
- Updates due to the completed Phase IV safety and tolerability study on higher
- Infusion parameters (IgPro20\\_4004) in PID patients.
- Updates due to the completed Phase IV study on biweekly dosing regimen
- (IgPro20\\_4005) in PID patients.

Cumulatively 309 patients have been enrolled into the Hizentra clinical program, 222 subjects with PID (primary immunodeficiency), 82 subjects with CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy), 3 subjects with SSc (systemic sclerosis) and 2 subjects with DM (Dermatomyositis).

For Hizentra reporting rates of well-known adverse reactions, based on safety data from the current PSUSA interval stay in the expected range. For serious adverse reactions \"hypersensitivity\", \"thromboembolic events\", \"aseptic meningitis\", 'haemolysis' and 'renal failure' no increases in the reporting rate were documented.

Localized infusion site reactions and deep skin ulcerations (UL-ISR) represent a specific problem with the subcutaneous administration of Hizentra. A total of 25 suspected cases of UL-ISR (including 10 of infusion site necrosis) were identified during this reporting interval. These cases of UL-ISR occurred in 6 paediatric patients, 10 adult patients, and 4 elderly patients (5 unknown). At the time of reporting, the outcomes were as follows: resolved (3), resolving (4), resolved with sequelae (3), not resolved (5), unknown/not reported (10). Although underlying diseases and improper administration technique may contribute to these complications, it remains a serious adverse reaction, especially in paediatric patients.

## Safety in SID

CSL Behring performed a review to determine the safety profile of IgPro20 (Hizentra) when used in patients with SID, as compared to the known safety profile in patients with PID. All post-marketing and clinical trial cases received until 31 December 2020 reporting indications consistent with use in SID, per the Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) Haematological malignant tumours and / or the High-Level Term Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromes; as well as all cases reporting indications consistent with use in PID, per the High-Level Term Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes, were retrieved from the CSLB safety database.

## Most frequently reported AEs (SID vs PID)

A total of 1906 SID cases (with 5066 AEs) and 8697 PID cases (with 23724 AEs) were identified in patients treated with Hizentra. The vast majority of the SID cases originated from Canada (1537/1906,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

80.6%), where Hizentra is already indicated for the treatment of patients with PID and SID who require immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Almost all of these Canadian cases (1525/1537, 99.2%) were received from the local Patient Support Program.

An analysis of the most frequently reported adverse events ( ≥ 1% in either PID or SID) from all cases, compared by PID or SID indication, is presented in Table 4 . The events for the SID indication were consistent with the most frequently reported events for the PID indication.

The most commonly reported, relevant primary indication from this 1906 SID case subset were the PTs SID (1742 cases, 91.4%), CLL (33 cases), and Plasma cell myeloma (19 cases - the LLT Multiple myeloma feeds into the PT Plasma cell myeloma). However, based also on the reported secondary indication, concomitant diseases and comedication, a declared or reasonably suspected cause for SID could be identified in 1446 cases (75.9%, with 3766 AEs; thereof 1770 AEs in approved SID indications and 1996 in 'off-label' SID indications). About half of the cases with identifiable cause of SID (666 of 1446 cases, with 1770 AEs) included the already approved indications in EU of Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (430 cases, 22.6%), Plasma cell myeloma (210 cases, 11.0%), and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (26 cases, 1.4%). The second half of cases with identified causes of SID (780 of 1446 cases, with 1996 AEs) consisted of other haematological malignancies (372 cases, 19.5%), iatrogenic causes (radio/chemotherapy or immunosuppressant treatment, 194 cases, 10.2%), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (87 cases, 4.6%), other neoplasms (71 cases, 3.7%), solid organ transplant (35 cases, 1.8%), and other diseases (21 cases, 1.1%). Thus, this dataset contains safety data of the variety of SID conditions including several diagnoses not currently approved for IgPro20 in EU.

AE = adverse event, EU =European Union, SID = secondary immunodeficiency

Overall, the most frequently reported AEs for the SID indication (either approved in EU or not) are consistent with the known safety profile for Hizentra specified in the Reference Safety Information (Company Core Data Sheet, version 6.0, dated 12 June 2019) and the EU SmPC; or are expected events in the population of use which are likely attributable to the patient's underlying illness. This includes:

- Local reactions (infusion/injection site erythema, infusion site pain, infusion/injection site swelling, infusion site pruritus, infusion site bruising, infusion site mass)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, rash)
- General or nonspecific reactions (headache, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, malaise, chills)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Events consistent with patient's underlying immunodeficiency conditions (sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis).

Among the total of 5066 AEs, the case series for SID includes also coded PTs which represent outcomes (Death), efficacy (Drug ineffective), no events (No AE) or are not specific (Ill-defined disorder):

- -50 SID cases reported an event of Death. All were considered either unassessable due to insufficient information, or unlikely related/not related, due to more plausible alternative explanations such as advanced age or underlying conditions such as CLL or MM. The vast majority of source for these cases were Patient Support Programs (45/50), of which 30 received from a consumer reporter type. There is no new significant safety information identified from these events.
- -50 SID cases reported an event of drug ineffective. In general, a lack of effect is considered expected as 100% success rate cannot be reasonably assumed in every patient. Most were considered either unassessable due to insufficient information, or not related, due to more plausible alternative explanations such as complex underlying conditions. The vast majority of source for these cases were Patient Support Programs (44/50), of which 37 received from a consumer reporter type. There is no new significant safety information identified from these events.
- -In 84 SID cases the PT No Adverse Event was also coded (n = 86); the majority of these reports were due to therapy or posology compliance issues (therapy cessation or interruption, dose omission), medication errors, or use in unapproved indication. There is no new significant safety information identified from these events.
- -39 SID cases reported an event of Ill-defined disorder (n = 40), the majority of which were nonspecific reports of the patient being 'unwell' or 'sick'. There is no new significant safety information identified from these events.

Overall, there were no new safety concerns for the SID population identified from review of these cases in comparison to those of the PID population treated with Hizentra. Furthermore, the safety profile observed for Hizentra in SID does not significantly differ between the EU approved indication and the wide concept of SID, and it is largely consistent with the known safety profile of Hizentra, as described in the current RSI, EU SmPC, and Risk Management Plan.

Moreover, CSL Behring performs regular reviews of all safety data during routine signal detection, risk management planning and aggregate reporting activities. No differences in the safety profile between indications or any overall new safety concerns in the SID indication have been identified during these activities.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Although sparse in nature, the literature review shows that the side effects with SCIG therapy in SID reflect those depicted in the SmPC of Hizentra. Mostly the ADRs concerned infusion site reactions which were mainly mild, although some more severe skin reactions did occur

To further determine the safety profile of Hizentra when used in patients with SID, (as compared to the known safety profile in patients with PID), all post-marketing and clinical trial cases received until 31 December 2020 reporting indications consistent with use in SID were evaluated by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 1906 SID cases (with 5066 AEs) and 8697 PID cases (with 23724 AEs) were identified in patients treated with Hizentra. The majority of the SID cases originated from Canada (1537/1906, 80.6%), where Hizentra is already indicated for the treatment of patients with PID and SID who require immunoglobulin replacement therapy. A declared or reasonably suspected cause for SID could be identified in 1446 cases (75.9%, with 3766 AEs; thereof 1770 AEs in approved SID indications and 1996 in 'off-label' SID indications).

The comparison of this post-marketing data show that the safety profile of Hizentra in PID and SID patients is similar and that this also holds true within the SID indications (approved CLL, MM, HSCT indications vs. 'off-label' indications). The main ADRs were:

- Local reactions (infusion/injection site erythema, infusion site pain, infusion/injection site swelling, infusion site pruritus, infusion site bruising, infusion site mass)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, rash)
- General or nonspecific reactions (headache, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, malaise, chills)
- Events consistent with patient's underlying immunodeficiency conditions (sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis)

Detailed information is required regarding the reported 50 fatal SID cases. The MAH informed about 50 cases with fatal outcome, thereof 45 cases from a patient support program. Thirty of these were consumer cases, non-HCP-confirmed. For the remaining 15 cases, the MAH was asked to provide proportion of cases, which were un-assessable due to missing information as well as the proportion of cases not related or unlikely, related due to the assumption that underlying disease being a more plausible explanation for the cause of death. Detailed information was requested for those fatal cases that may be related to the treatment with Hizentra. In response to OC, the MAH provided information on the 50 SID fatalities as requested.

On review of the CIOMS Reports, we concur with the evaluation of the MAH: either relevant information on the fatalities is missing or in those cases where more data is provided, there does not seem to be a direct correlation with Hizentra treatment.

The MAH provided further information on the 15 non-HCP-confirmed fatal cases from a patient support program:

Cases unassessable due to missing information: 11/15 (73%)

Cases not related or unlikely related due to another, more plausible, explanation for death: 4/15 (17%)

The MAH states that there were no fatal cases considered by the company or reporter to be related to Hizentra: 0/15 (0%).

Of note, no detailed information on the death of an 11-year old female (non-HCP-confirmed) receiving Hizentra for treatment of SID was reported. The issue wasn't further pursued.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Given the totality of the dataset (literature review and post-marketing analysis of patients with SID receiving IgPro20), one can conclude that the product is overall well tolerated and safe and that the safety profile of Hizentra as described in the submitted SmPC is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of MS Slovenia and Northern Ireland.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

SID constitutes a large number of conditions resulting from immune system compromise due to a nongenetic factor, differentiating it from PID. SID is an umbrella term for variety of diseases with secondary immune defects, including hematologic malignancies, HIV infections, prematurity, hypogammaglobulinemia associated with solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, patients who have received B-cell-depleting agents for therapy, and protein-losing conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Currently, treatment of primary diseases that cause SID includes antibiotics, steroids, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies. IgRT administered via either IVIG or SCIG routes is the mainstay treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of infections in patients with PID or SID.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The MAH provided an overview of the literature regarding SCIG use in SID (the main studies were selected by the assessor - only IVIG studies or case reports were not included in this assessment)

Trials performed with Hizentra (IgPro 20) in SID encompassed:

- Vacca et al 2018, performed a prospective, controlled, randomised 18 month study in 46 multiple myeloma (MM) patients (24 on IgPro20 and 22 controls) with IgG &lt;500 mg/dL who received a monthly total dose of 0.4 to 0.8 g SCIg/Kg. Various patient
- Campagno et al, 2014, performed a single centre, retrospective study in 61 patients with rituximabrelated SID.
- Shankar et al 2013, did a retrospective analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement on 10 lung-transplant recipients
- Spadaro et al 2016, perfomed a non-randomised cross-over study in 14 patients with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disease (12 with NHL and 2 with CLL)

Trials with SCIG /IVIG either without Hizentra, or where the brand is not mentioned:

- Dimou et al 2018; did a retrospective single centre study, in 33 SID patients with haematological malignancies were treated with HyQvia, 13/33 were already on IVIG before switching.
- Reiser et al 2017; the SIGNS study was a prospective, long-term (FU 3y/pt) non-interventional study (NIS) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01287689). Forty-eight centres throughout Germany enrolled 307 SID patients (CLL, MM, indolent lymphoma, and other malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma or HIV). Particular focus of the study was the annual SBI rate.
- Benbrahim et al 2019; this was a non-interventional, longitudinal, prospective French study (21 sites) in 160 patients starting IgRT (octagam (IVIG) and gammanorm (SCIG)) for hematological malignancies associated with SID.

In keeping with the other data, lgRT increased serum IgG levels (by 3.4±2.4 g/L) and decreased frequency and severity of infections compared to baseline. Overall, the products octagam or gammanorm were well-tolerated.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

SCIG is currently approved for use in SID indications of CLL, MM, and HCST. Although the clinical aspects of the underlying disorders in both on-label and off-label indications differ, the SID symptoms as they are derived from insufficient or dysfunctional IgG resulting in an increased rate of infections. Therefore, an extension of indication to cover other disorders leading to SID (as is already implemented for IVIG) is seen as acceptable.

All studies mentioned above ( Summary of main studies ) showed increases in IgG trough levels and/or reduction in infection rates after receiving IgRT for SID. This was shown for Hizentra but also for other SCIGs. The results are comparable to those seen with IVIG treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While IVIG and SCIG are both recommended as IgRT, SCIG allows patients to self-treat at home and thus provides greater independence from the need for frequent hospital or infusion clinic visits. In addition, administration of IVIG can be difficult in patients with poor venous access- a problem avoided when SCIG is used.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Although there are not per se any uncertainties as to the favourable effects of IgRT treatment in SID patients, certain limitations arise from the data provided, concerning the optimal dosing. Some studies suggest that lower dosing (~ 300 mg/kg/month) could also lead to a reduction in infection rate; other studies mention 'drug holidays' in the summer months when the risk of infections spontaneously decreases. However, as the Hizentra SmPC outlines a broad range of possible doses for both PID and SID, this is currently acceptable.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The unfavourable effects are outlined in the SmPC and are adjusted according to PSUSA evaluations.

They mainly concern:

- Local reactions (infusion/injection site erythema, infusion site pain, infusion/injection site swelling, infusion site pruritus, infusion site bruising, infusion site mass) as well as infusion site necrosis in rare cases.
- Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, rash)
- General or nonspecific reactions (headache, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, malaise, chills)
- Events consistent with patient's underlying immunodeficiency conditions (sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis)

50 SID cases with a fatal outcome have been reported. Thirty of these were consumer cases, nonHCP-confirmed. For the remaining cases, the MAH was requested to provide detailed information, especially for those fatal cases that may be related to the treatment with Hizentra. Data was provided and considered adequately addressed by the CHMP.

## 3.4.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

In CLL up to 80% of CLL patients experience infectious complications at some point during their disease, 20% of them severe/major infections. Up to 60% of overall mortality in CLL is caused by infectious complications. In a study of more than 3,000 patients with multiple myeloma, infections were responsible for 45% of deaths within 6 months of diagnosis. In CLL and MM and in the setting of SID from other underlying disorders the risk of recurrent and possibly life-threatening infections can be alleviated by the administration of either IVIG or SCIG. This is clinically important.

The unfavourable effects of SCIGs are well-known and described in the SmPC; they mainly concern infusion site reactions and to a lesser extent general reactions (e.g. headache, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, malaise, chills). In most cases, these ADRs are mild to moderate and can in persistent cases be alleviated with pre-medication. Some severe cases of either local or general reactions may attain clinical importance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.4.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Given the totality of the data, the balance of efficacy to safety is positive

## 3.5. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Hizentra is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to expand the approved secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) indications to any symptomatic SID in accordance with the Guideline on core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/ 2007 Rev 5; CHMP, 2018). As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 4.6 of the RMP has been accepted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation
