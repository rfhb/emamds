| II/0019   | Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on two completed studies which investigated the safety and efficacy of up to four 3- month treatment courses of ulipristal acetate 10 mg. The limitation of a single 3-month treatment course has been removed and the prescription of a second 3-month treatment course has been allowed. In addition, 'alopecia' and 'dry skin' have been included in the 'uncommon' category of section 4.8 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet. C.I.6.b - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Deletion of a therapeutic indication product   | 21/11/2013   | 18/12/2013 no   | SmPC, Annex II and PL   | Further to the results of PGL09-027 and PGL09-026 studies (respectively PEARL III extension and PEARL III) the limitation of a single 3-month treatment course was removed and a second 3-month treatment course is allowed if deemed appropriate by the treating physician. This second 3-month treatment course should be separated from the first treatment course by a drug-free interval to allow return of menstruation and shedding of the endometrium. The treatment should not exceed two treatment courses of 3 months due to the lack of long term safety data. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were updated to reflect the new data. The PL was updated accordingly. In addition, the key elements of the educational material were amended to reflect a) the revised posology: 5 mg tablet once daily for up to 3 months. This 3-month treatment course can be repeated once. Re-treatment should start at the earliest during the second menstruation following the first treatment course completion. Treatments should always be started during the first week of menstruation, and b) absence of safety data on the endometrium for continuous treatment longer than 3 months longer authorised   |

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | product no     | Section 4.5 of the SmPC was amended to state that administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (300 mg twice daily for 9 days) to healthy female volunteers markedly decreased Cmax and AUC of ulipristal acetate and its active metabolite by 90 %or more and decreased ulipristal acetate half-life by 2.2-fold corresponding to an approximately 10-fold decrease of ulipristal acetate exposure. Concomitant use of ulipristal acetate and potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, StJohn´s wort, efavirenz, nevirapine, long term use of ritonavir) is not recommended. Section 5.3 of the SmPC was amended to include information related to carcinogenicity studies (in rats and mice) showing that ulipristal acetate is not carcinogenic.
