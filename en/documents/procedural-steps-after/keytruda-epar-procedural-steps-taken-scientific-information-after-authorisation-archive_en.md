RFS and DMFS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups, including tumour PD-L1 expression, BRAF mutation status, and stage of disease (using AJCC 7th edition).

| II/0094 | Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy information based on final results from study KEYNOTE-361 listed as a PAES in the Annex II; this is a Phase III Randomised, Controlled Clinical Trial of Pembrolizumab with or without Platinum-based Combination Chemotherapy versus Chemotherapy in Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma; Annex IID is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/03/2021 | 21/05/2021 | SmPC and Annex II | SmPC new text In KEYNOTE-361, a higher number of deaths within 6 months of treatment initiation followed by a long-term survival benefit was observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy (see section 5.1). No specific factor(s) associated with early deaths could be identified. Physicians should consider the delayed onset of pembrolizumab effect before initiating treatment in patients with urothelial carcinoma who are considered eligible for carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Results of KEYNOTE 361 for pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy did not show statistically significant improvement in PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1 (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93; p=0.0033), and OS (HR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.02; p=0.0407) versus chemotherapy alone. Per the pre specified hierarchical testing order no formal tests for statistical significance of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy could be performed. |

| II/0080 | To update sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC on the safety information for immune-related endocrinopathies following a safety review for Addison's disease/primary adrenal insufficiency. The updated RMP version 27.0 has also been agreed. The MAH also took the opportunity to include the changes in Annex II related to the new EMA QRD template version 10.1 and to update the details of the local representative of Portugal in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/10/2019 | 14/11/2019 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) has been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 46 (0.8%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 19 (0.3%), 20 (0.3%) and 3 (0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab, and the median time to onset was 5.4 months (range 1 day to 17.7 months). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and other causes excluded.

| II/0075   | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to reflect the updated results from study KEYNOTE-010 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP with a data cutoff of 16 March 2018. Study KEYNOTE-010 is a controlled phase II/III trial that randomized a total of 1034 previously-treated subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 to receive pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W or docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 Q3W. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to include additional instructions in section 4.5 of the SmPC to clarify the use of corticosteroids in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 27/06/2019   | 26/08/2019   | SmPC and PL         | The updated efficacy results from study KEYNOTE-010 with a median follow-up of 42.6 months are consistent with those reported at the time of initial approval. The safety results were also consistent with those reported at the time of initial approval and with the established safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy. Corticosteroids can be used as premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy, as antiemetic prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related adverse reactions. |

| II/0071             | To update sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on interim results from study KEYNOTE-051; this is an ongoing Phase I/II, single-arm study to evaluate the PK, pharmacodynamics, toxicity, safety, and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab in paediatric participants (Measure 2 of PIP01). Additionally, the results of study Study PD018 / PA- 0064; evaluation of expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in archival paediatric tumour tissues, were submitted (Measure 1 of PIP01). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 27/06/2019   | 26/08/2019 | SmPC        | In KEYNOTE-051, 154 paediatric patients were administered pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab concentrations in these patients were comparable to those of adults at the same dose. Participants were enrolled across 28 tumour types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumour types by histology were Hodgkin lymphoma (11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), osteosarcoma (6.5%) and melanoma (5.2%). In patients with solid tumours and other lymphomas, the ORR was 5.9%, no patient had a complete response and 8 patients (5.9%) had a partial response. In the Hodgkin lymphoma population, the ORR was 50.0%, 2 patients (11.1%) had a complete response and 7 patients (38.9%) had a partial response. The safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of paediatric patients) were pyrexia (31%), vomiting (26%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), anaemia (21%) and constipation (20%).

No new clinical or pre-clinical studies are being submitted as part of the current application. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 28/02/2019   | 28/03/2019   | SmPC and PL   | The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA as part of combination therapy is 200 mg every 3 weeks administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Pembrolizumab doses of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks were evaluated in melanoma or previously treated NSCLC clinical trials. Based on the modelling and simulation of dose/exposure relationships for efficacy and safety for pembrolizumab, there are no clinically significant differences in efficacy or safety among the doses of 200 mg every 3 weeks, 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 400 mg every 6 weeks as monotherapy.   |

| II/0054 | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC based on the final clinical study report (CSR) for KEYNOTE-045 (KN045); a phase III randomized clinical trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine in subjects with recurrent or progressive metastatic urothelial cancer. The submission addresses the post-authorisation measure 'ANX 020' and Annex IID has been updated accordingly.

Overall, the updated efficacy results with longer follow-up are consistent with the data provided at the previous cut-off date. The updated data from KN045 confirm the previous findings and support the currently authorised indication of Keytruda in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, regardless PD-L1 expression status. It is observed that the Overall Survival Kaplan-Meier curves tend to remain constantly separated also at later time points, confirming the benefit of pembrolizumab over standard chemotherapy with longer follow-up. No new safety signals were found in the updated safety data from KN045. |

| II/0037/G             | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to add information regarding the risks of encephalitis, sarcoidosis and graft versus host disease (GVHD), including the occurrence of fatal GVDH events that have been reported with pembrolizumab in patients with a history of allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), and update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add encephalitis as a 'rare' new ADR. Further, section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to include the recommendation to permanently discontinue pembrolizumab at the first occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 encephalitis and Grade 3 or 4 Guillain- Barré syndrome (GBS). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly as well as the Annex II; the information regarding educational material in the section 'additional risk minimisation measures'. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor changes in the SmPC section 5.1 and editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 14.0 was agreed during the | 22/02/2018   | 23/03/2018   | SmPC, Annex II and PL  | Clinically significant cases of sarcoidosis and encephalitis, including severe and fatal cases, have been reported in clinical trials or in post-marketing experience. Allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) after treatment with pembrolizumab: Cases of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and hepatic veno- occlusive disease (VOD) have been observed in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing allogeneic HSCT after previous exposure to pembrolizumab. Until further data become available, careful consideration to the potential benefits of HSCT and the possible increased risk of transplant-related complications should be made case by case. Allogeneic HSCT prior to treatment with pembrolizumab: In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD, including fatal GVHD, has been reported after treatment with pembrolizumab. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at an increased risk for GVHD after treatment with pembrolizumab. Consider the benefit of treatment with pembrolizumab versus the risk of possible GVHD in patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT. |

| II/0002 | Update of sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC with safety and PK data based on the CSR of Study P006v01. Further, the ADR Guillain-Barré Syndrome has been added to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to revise the text referring to fatal cases of pneumonitis in section 4.4 of the SmPC, to implement minor editorial changes in the annexes, to align the SmPC, Annex II, labelling and Package Leaflet with the latest QRD template version 9.1, and to update the contact details of the local representative in Luxemburg in the Package Leaflet. A revised RMP version 2.0 was provided as part of the application. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 01/04/2016 | 29/07/2016 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The new data and analyses confirm the previous immunogenicity, PK and exposure-response results for pembrolizumab. The new PK parameter estimates are very similar to those previously calculated. Immunogenicity is confirmed to be very low, with an observed incidence of treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects of 0.3% (1 out of 376). Exposure-response analysis confirmed the lack of a significant exposure-response relationship. Available efficacy results of Study P006 show a clinically meaningful advantage of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab in IPI-naive patients with unresectable advanced melanoma. Regarding efficacy results in subgroups, it is acknowledged that the study was not sufficiently powered. Efficacy data of study P006 are already included in the Keytruda SmPC. Based on comparative safety data from study P006, no differences between pembrolizumab and ipilimumab treated patients in the rate of Grade ≥3 AEs (36.7% vs 35.5%), but a lower rate of Grade ≥3 drug-related AEs (11.7% vs 19.9%), SAEs (25.2% vs 30.1%) and serious drug-related AEs (8.8% vs 17.6%) was reported with pembrolizumab. In addition, fewer patients in the pembrolizumab group discontinued treatment due to AEs (9% vs 13.3%). Since the exposure to pembrolizumab was three-fold longer than to IPI, comparison of arms during active treatment (i.e. week 0 - week 12) were provided showing a lower rate of drug-related AEs, including Grade ≥3 drug-related AEs and serious drug-related AEs, in patients treated with |

The safety profile of the 2 drugs was slightly different from a quantitative point of view, with a higher incidence of colitis with IPI and more commonly reported thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism) and pneumonitis with pembrolizumab. In addition, the time to Grade ≥3 AEs onset was shorter in the IPI arm and treatment interruption or discontinuation was required in a lower number of patients in the pembrolizumab arms. A new safety concern was identified based on data from study P006. At the cut-off date for safety analysis (3 Sep 2014), 1 case of Grade 4 Guillan-Barré syndrome was reported in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. Subsequently, one case of acute motor axonal neuropathy, a form of Guillan-Barré syndrome (Grade 2) was diagnosed in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm and remained ongoing at the time of the interim analysis 2. Based on these events, the Guillan-Barré syndrome is now considered as an Important Identified Risk. In addition, new AEs reported in the study, such as optic neuritis (Grade 2), scleritis (Grade 2), Sjogren's syndrome (Grade 1), ankylosing spondylitis (Grade 1), rheumatoid arthritis (Grade 2) and Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (1 Grade 1, 1 Grade 2 and 1 grade 3) are added to the   |
