Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 25 th   April  2022,  the  MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Valdoxan (agomelatine), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## About the product

Agomelatine is a melatonergic agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and 5-HT2C antagonist.

Valdoxan was first authorised via the centralised procedure in 2009.

## Approved indication

Valdoxan is indicated for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults.

Excerpt of the posology (for a view of the complete posology, please refer to the approved SmPC of Valdoxan):

Adults :  The  recommended  dose  is  25  mg  once  daily  taken  orally  at  bedtime.  After  two  weeks  of treatment, if there is no improvement of symptoms, the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily, i.e., two 25 mg tablets, taken together at bedtime.

Decision of dose increase has to be balanced with a higher risk of transaminases elevation. Any dose increase to 50 mg should be made on an individual patient benefit/risk basis and with strict respect of Liver Function Test monitoring. Liver function tests should be performed in all patients before starting treatment. Treatment should not be initiated if transaminases exceed 3 X upper limit of normal (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). During treatment transaminases should be monitored periodically after around three  weeks,  six  weeks  (end  of  acute  phase),  twelve  weeks  and  twenty-four  weeks  (end  of maintenance phase) and thereafter when clinically indicated (see also section 4.4). Treatment should be discontinued if transaminases exceed 3 X upper limit of normal (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). When increasing the dosage, liver function tests should again be performed at the same frequency as when initiating treatment.

Treatment  duration: Patients  with  depression  should  be  treated  for  a  sufficient  period  of  at  least  6 months to ensure that they are free of symptoms.

Elderly : No effect is documented in patients ≥ 75 years. Therefore, agomelatine should not be used by patients in this age group.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study CL3-20098-076, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of agomelatine in children (from 7 to less than 12 years) and adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years) with major depressive disorder, is part of a clinical development program. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by the end of September 2022. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of  note,  previously  study  CL2-075,  aiming  at  evaluating  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  of agomelatine in children (from 7 to less than 12 years) and adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years) with  depressive  or  anxiety  disorder,  has  been  submitted  and  evaluated  (procedure  EMEA/H/915916/P46/027). In the Assessment Report from that procedure, it was considered that the report on the study and the population PK model was sufficient at that stage. The PK database and the modelling approach had some limitations, however the model appeared reasonably robust to describe and predict the PK of agomelatine at the higher dosages &gt; 10 mg.

In the present procedure no SmPC changes are suggested.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Oral film-coated tablets of 10 and 25 mg strengths were used for agomelatine, as appropriate to the study population and already tested in the CL2-075 study (procedure EMEA/H/915-916/P46/027).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

-  Study CL3-20098-076

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## CL3-20098-076

A  double  blind,  12-week,  randomised,  multicentre,  two  dose  levels,  active  and  placebo-controlled Phase III trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of agomelatine to treat children from 7 to less than 18 years of age with major depressive disorder. An optional open-label 21-month extension period was also included.

## Description

The figure below shows the study plan:

<!-- image -->

- all patients who completed the extension period.

***During the extension period the dose could be adjusted at each visit (flexible dose, either to increase to 25 mg or decrease again to 10 mg) by the investigator based on the clinical picture of patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Excerpt of criteria for inclusion (not exhaustive):

- -Male or female, aged from 7 to less than 12 or from 12 to less than 18 years of age.
- -Primary diagnosis of MDD, single or recurrent episode, of moderate to severe intensity, as per Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Episode, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).
- -CDRS-R Raw score ≥ 45.
- -Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) rating score ≥ 4.
- -Patients considered as non-responder to Manualized Psychosocial Counselling during the run-in period.
- -Absence of hepatic impairment (e.g., patients with transaminases values [AST and/or ALT] ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal range [ULN] were excluded).
- -Absence of high suicidal risk.

At W012 visit, all patients who could benefit from a continuation of a treatment with agomelatine were offered to enter in the open-labelled safety extension period.

## Treatments

Test drug:

Agomelatine: 10 mg and 25 mg, one film-coated tablet taken once a day, orally, in the evening at bedtime.

Comparator (reference product and placebo), only during the double-blind period:

Fluoxetine: 10 mg (2.5 mL) with a possible increase to 20 mg (5 mL) at W002, oral solution taken once a day, in the morning at wake-up.

Placebo: one film-coated tablet taken once a day, orally, in the evening at bedtime or oral solution taken once a day, in the morning at wake-up.

Open-label  follow-up  extension  period  of  21  months  (from  W012  to  W104)  for  patients  who  could benefit  from  a  continuation  of  a  treatment  with  agomelatine:  from  W012  to  W014,  each  patient received agomelatine 10 mg. From W014 to W104, the dose could be adjusted at each visit (flexible dose, either to increase to 25 mg or decrease again to 10 mg). Finally, there was a follow-up period of 1 week on average (5 to 7 days) without any investigational medicinal product (IMP) after the last IMP intake (after W012, W104 or in case of premature withdrawal from the study at any moment).

## Objective(s)

The purpose of the study was to assess the short-term efficacy and the short-term safety of two doses of agomelatine in children and adolescent patients with Moderate to Severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

The primary objective was to demonstrate the antidepressant short-term efficacy of at least one of the two doses of agomelatine compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in children (from 7 to less than 12 years of age) and adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years of age) suffering from moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder using Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary objectives were:

- to assess the short-term and long-term safety of agomelatine (10 mg, 25 mg).

- to evaluate the long-term efficacy of agomelatine (10 mg, 25 mg). The secondary efficacy endpoints included  results  from  various  scores  such  as  Clinical  Global  Impression-Severity  and  -Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I, respectively), Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) total score and Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS) total score (only in adolescents of the FAS).

- to explore efficacy and safety in children and adolescents separately.

## Sample size

After amendment of the protocol, it was planned that overall, at least 390 patients (instead of 484) with at least 312 adolescents (divided in each treatment group) allowed to conclude that at least one dose  of  agomelatine  was  superior  to  placebo  with  a  power  of  89%  in  the  overall  population  and  a power of 80% in the subgroup of adolescents, assuming an effect size of 0.50.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

The treatment (agomelatine 10 mg, agomelatine 25 mg, placebo, fluoxetine) was assigned at inclusion (W000) by balanced (non-adaptative) randomisation, with stratification on the country and children/adolescents age set. It was done using an Interactive Response System (IRS).

The 12-week period of the study was conducted in double-blind conditions (i.e., in the agomelatine groups  5  ml  oral  solution  of  placebo  was  given  in  the  morning  and  1  tablet  of  agomelatine  in  the evening;  in  the  fluoxetine  group,  5  ml  oral  solution  of  fluoxetine  was  given  in  the  morning  and  1 placebo tablet in the evening while in the placebo group 5 ml placebo oral solution and 1 placebo tablet were given in the morning and evening, respectively).

## Statistical Methods

All  efficacy  analyses  were  carried  out  in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS).  The  Last  Observation  Carried Forward  (LOCF)  approach  was  used  to  handle  missing  data.  For  the  primary  analysis  a  three-way analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  was  used.  The  step-down  Dunnett  procedure  was  used  to control  the  familywise  error  rate,  since  2  doses  of  agomelatine  were  compared  to  placebo.  The estimate of the difference between adjusted treatment group means, associated standard error, twosided 95% confidence interval and Dunnett-adjusted p-value were provided.

Sensitivity analyses, assessing the robustness of the primary analysis, were performed in addition to subgroup analyses in adolescents (12-17 years). Due to the small sample size in children, no statistical comparison test was performed in this subgroup, only descriptive statistics were provided.

## Results

## Participant flow and number analysed

Four  hundred  (400)  patients  were  included;  among  them,  320  (80.0%)  were  adolescents  and  80 (20.0%)  were  children.  The  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  4  groups  (Modified Randomised Set; MRS): 102 patients (whereof 81 adolescents) in the agomelatine 10 mg group, 95 (whereof  76  adolescents)  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg  group,  103  (whereof  82  adolescents)  in  the placebo group and 100 (whereof 81 adolescents) in the fluoxetine group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  FAS  consisted  of  102  patients  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group,  94  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg group, 101 in the placebo group and 99 in the fluoxetine group.

## Recruitment

Forty-six (46) centres in 9 countries included 400 patients. The study was initiated on February 23rd, 2016 and completed on October 27th 2021.

## Main baseline data (not exhaustive)

## Age and gender:

The patients of the MRS were 7 to 17 years old with a mean age of 13.7 (SD: ± 2.7) years. Almost 2 thirds of patients in the study were female (62.5%).

## Condition:

Overall, according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria, 286 patients (71.5%) were in their first episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) with a higher rate in the agomelatine 10 and 25 mg groups (78.4% and 74.7%, respectively) than in the placebo (64.1%) and fluoxetine (69.0%) groups.

As required in the selection criteria, all patients had CDRS-R raw total score ≥ 45 with a mean of 65.5 ± 8.4.  CGI-S score was ≥ 4 with a mean of 4.9 ± 0.6. The mean CGAS score was 46.5 ± 8.2. The specific adolescents scale, ADRS, showed a mean score at baseline of 33.1 ± 6.0.

According  to  Columbia-suicide  severity  rating  scale  for  children,  23.0%  of  the  patients  had  suicidal ideation  in  their  lifetime  (highest  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group  with  25.5%).  Overall,  3.5%  had suicidal  behaviour  in  their  lifetime  with  a  higher  rate  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg  (6.3%)  than  in  the placebo (1.9%) groups.

The major depressive episode (MDE) was diagnosed (according to DSM-IV-TR criteria) as moderate in most of the patients (61.8%); and as severe without psychotic features in 153 patients (38.3%) with a lower rate in the agomelatine 10 mg group (27.5%) compared to the other 3 groups (between 41.0% and 43.7% according to treatment group).

The mean duration of current episode was 143.4 ± 153.2 days with a median of 96.0 days (range from 29 to 1463 days). This mean duration was higher in the agomelatine 10 mg group (181.2 ± 210.0 days)  compared  to  the  other  3  groups  (125.2  ±  109.2  to  137.0  ±  130.5  days),  mainly  due  to  a maximum equal to 1463 days (~4 years). A total of 114 patients (28.5%) already had a history of previous MDE (recurrent episode), with a lower rate in agomelatine 10 mg and 25 mg (21.6% and 25.3%,  respectively)  groups  than  in  the  placebo  (35.9%)  and  fluoxetine  (31.0%)  groups.  In  these patients, the number of episodes in their lifetime before the current episode ranged from 1 to 5 with a mean ± SD of 1.4 ± 0.7 episodes. The duration between the previous episode and the current episode start ranged from 24 to 1817 days (~5 years) (mean ± SD = 428.9 ± 395.4 days). The duration of last episode was between 1 and 852 days (mean ± SD = 150.9 ± 157.2 days).

As can be seen from the table above, the results were statistically significant only for agomelatine 25 mg  vs.  placebo.  Differences  between  placebo  and  agomelatine  10  mg  and  between  placebo  and fluoxetine were not statistically significant.

In  the children subgroup;  due  to  the  too  low  number  of  patients,  no  statistical  inference  was performed.

Short overview of some results from the secondary efficacy endpoints:

CGI-S: The difference of the means of CGI-S score of the last post-baseline value between placebo (3.8  ±  1.2)  and  each  agomelatine  dose  regimen  (3.5  ±  1.1  for  both  agomelatine  doses)  was  only statistically significant in favour of agomelatine 10 mg with the Mann-Whitney test (p = 0.035). In the adolescents of the FAS, no statistically significant difference between treatment groups was observed with any of the statistical tests (unplanned analysis).

CGI-I: Regarding the mean CGI-I score, no statistically significant difference of the last post-baseline value, between placebo (2.7 ± 1.1) and each agomelatine dose (2.6 ± 1.1 in the agomelatine 10 mg group and 2.5 ± 1.0 in the agomelatine 25 mg group) nor between placebo and fluoxetine (2.6 ± 1.0), was observed with any of the statistical tests. Similar results were observed in the adolescents of the FAS.

The proportion of patients with response to treatment (defined as CGI-I score = 1 or 2 as last postbaseline  value)  was  48.0%  in  the  agomelatine  10  mg  group  and  48.9%  in  the  agomelatine  25  mg group  versus  44.6%  in  the  placebo  group  and  47.5%  in  the  fluoxetine  group  without  statistically significant difference.

Children's  Global  Assessment  Scale  (CGAS):  In  the  FAS,  the  mean  CGAS  total  score  gradually increased with each visit between baseline and W012 to achieve a change from baseline to last postbaseline value of 13.2 ± 11.3 in the agomelatine 10 mg group, 14.4 ± 13.0 in the agomelatine 25 mg group, 12.1 ± 14.0 in the placebo group and 13.9 ± 12.5 in the fluoxetine group.

Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS): The means of ADRS total score of the last post-baseline value were 18.8 ± 10.1 in the agomelatine 10 mg group, 18.1 ± 10.6 in the agomelatine 25 mg group and 22.2 ± 10.7 in the placebo group. The difference of means between placebo and each agomelatine dose regimen was statistically significant in favour of agomelatine 10 mg with Student t-test (E (SE) = 3.40 (1.65); 95% CI [0.14; 6.67], p = 0.041) but not with Mann-Whitney test (p = 0.064) and in favour of agomelatine 25 mg with both statistical tests (E (SE) = 4.07 (1.72), 95% CI [0.68; 7.46], p = 0.019 and 0.032, respectively). The difference of means between placebo and fluoxetine were not statistically significant.

## Some efficacy results - open extension period:

Out of the 400 patients who were included in the study and randomly assigned to one of the 4 groups, 339  patients  (analysis-set  called  Sub-MRS),  including  271  adolescents  (79.9%  of  the  patients), entered the optional open-label extension period, during which all received agomelatine at flexible dose (10 mg during the first 2 weeks and then 10 or 25 mg). Overall, 187 patients (55.2%) completed the W012-W104  extension  period,  with  a  similar  frequency  in  each  group.  Of  the  adolescents,  53.5% completed the W012-W104 period. The treatment duration over the extension period ranged between 0.1 and 22.1 months with a mean of 15.5 ± 7.5 months.

The table below summarises the values at baseline (W012), W024, W040, W052, W104 and last postbaseline visit as well as the changes from baseline (W012) to each of these visits:

Considering only the patients receiving agomelatine all along the study , the mean CDRS-R raw total score decreased along the W000-W104 period. The mean changes from baseline were -29.5 ± 14.0 at W024, -41.6 ± 12.6 at W104 and -38.8 ± 13.2 when considering the last post-baseline value.

Focusing  on adolescents ,  efficacy  results  on  CDRS-R  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  total population during the W012-W104 period as well as during the W000-W104 period.

Regarding remission ,  the  table  below  summarises  the  rates  of  patients  in  remission  at  baseline (W012), W024, W040, W052, W104 and last post-baseline visit:

Regarding hepatic safety, 4 patients (one child on agomelatine 10 mg, one adolescent on agomelatine 25  mg  and  2  adolescents    on  fluoxetine)  reported  high  emergent  PCSA  values  (&gt;  3  ULN)  of  ALAT and/or ASAT.

Regarding suicidality, as evaluated by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), no signal was observed, according to the MAH. Few patients presented emergent suicidal ideations on treatment distributed (one patient in each group). Only the case in the agomelatine 10 mg group concerned a child (severity = 1). No emergent suicidal ideation was rated as serious (defined as score of 4 or 5). In addition,  a  total  of  7  patients  had  a  worsening  of  their  suicidal  ideation  on  treatment,  without meaningful difference between groups (2 patients and 1 patient in the agomelatine 10 mg and 25 mg, respectively vs. 3 patients in the placebo group and 1 patient in the fluoxetine group). No child was affected by these aggravations. One patient in the agomelatine 25 mg group and one in the placebo group  reported  emergent  self-injurious  behaviour  without  suicidal  intent  on  treatment.  A  suicide attempt was reported as a serious adverse event in one patient in the agomelatine 25 mg group.

## Some safety results - open extension period:

In  the  extension  period  (W012-W104,  i.e.,  a  21-month  follow-up),  a  total  of  212  patients  (62.5%) presented 620 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events under agomelatine: 61.8% of patients in the ago/ago group, 64.7% in the placebo/ago group and 61.9% in the fluox/ago group. Most events were rated as mild (68.9%) or moderate (26%), with more severe events in the placebo/ago group (12.9% of TEAEs) than in the ago/ago and fluox/ago groups (2.3% and 0.8% of TEAEs, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  most frequently  reported  TEAEs during  the  W012-W104  period  were  headache  (11.8%  of patients),  nasopharyngitis  (7.1%),  nausea  (5.3%),  weight  increased  and  decreased  appetite  (3.8% each), abdominal pain, blood prolactin increased, thirst and fatigue (3.5% each) and dizziness (3.2%), without relevant between-group differences. Similar results were observed in the adolescents (62.4% presenting TEAEs) with roughly the same most common TEAEs as in the total population.

Overall, 8.6% of patients presented at least one serious  TEAE during  the  extension  period,  with  a higher  rate  in  the  placebo/ago  (14.1%)  and  fluox/ago  (10.7%)  groups  than  in  the  ago/ago  group (4.7%).  The  most  common  serious  TEAE  was  depression,  reported  in  4  patients.  Platelet  count decreased, pneumonia, syncope, ALAT increased, ASAT increased, and suicidal ideation were reported by 2 patients each. All other serious TEAEs were reported only once. No serious TEAE was considered as related to IMP. Ten serious TEAEs in 6 patients (1.8%) led to IMP withdrawal, mainly Psychiatric disorders.

In the adolescents, 9.6% had serious TEAEs during the W012-W104 period.

Regarding liver acceptability , 3 patients (2 adolescents both in the placebo/ago group and one child in  the  fluox/ago group) reported high emergent PCSA values [&gt; 3 Upper Limit of normal laboratory reference  range  (ULN)]  of  ALAT  and/or  ASAT  on  treatment.  None  of  these  events  led  to  study withdrawal.

Regarding suicidality , the analysis of suicide risk using the C-SSRS-C showed that 12 patients (3.6%) [3 patients in the ago/ago group, 4 patients in the placebo/ago group and 5 patients in the fluxo/ago group] presented emergent suicidal ideations on treatment during the W012-W104 period. In addition, one  patient  (adolescent  in  the  placebo/ago  group)  had  a  worsening  of  his/her  suicidal  ideation  on treatment.

A  total  of  6  patients  (1.8%,  all  adolescents;  3  patients  in  the  ago/ago  group,  1  patient  in  the placebo/ago group and 2 patients in the fluxo/ago group) reported emergent self-injurious behaviour without suicidal intent on treatment. Two patients (both adolescents; one in each of the placebo/ago and fluxo/ago groups) presented 3 emergent suicidal behaviours: both made emergent actual suicide attempt on treatment; in addition, one of them also undertook emergent preparatory actions toward imminent suicidal behaviour.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In this report only very brief and non-comprehensive information and summaries are given of the data from the submitted study CL3-20098-076.

Furthermore, the data from the study have not been critically assessed by the CHMP in this Art. 46 procedure.  This  is  because  the  MAH  intends  to  submit  an  extension  of  the  indication  for  Valdoxan comprising  the  paediatric  population,  based  on  data  from  study  CL3-20098-076,  by  the  end  of September  2022.  This  intention  was  notified  to  EMA  24th  March  2022.  Consequently,  the  critical assessment of the data from study CL3-20098-076 is deferred and will be made during the procedure for the extension of the indication for Valdoxan.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

No critical assessment of the data from study CL3-20098-076 has been performed by the CHMP in the current Art. 46 procedure. This will rather be done later during the procedure for the extension of the indication for Valdoxan. The MAH has notified EMA (24 th  March 2022) that they intend to submit an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

application for extension of the indication by the end of September 2022. No changes are proposed in the SmPC in the present procedure.

The current PAM is therefore considered fulfilled solely based  on  the  fact  that  the  study  data  have been  provided.  However,  this  conclusion  is  based  on  the  prerequisite  that  the  MAH  applies  for  an extension of the indication for Valdoxan within a reasonable time frame. Consequently, it is therefore expected that an application for extension of the indication for Valdoxan will be submitted by the MAH within the end of September 2022 (as has already been notified by the MAH to EMA in March 2022).

## Fulfilled:

<!-- image -->

No further action required; however, the data are expected submitted in the context of an extension prior any conclusion on product information amendments is made. The MAH should commit to submit this extension application by the end of September 2022 as has already been indicated by the MAH and notified to EMA on 24 th  March 2022.
