## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Incline Therapeutics Europe Ltd submitted on 3 September 2014 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for IONSYS, through the centralised procedure under Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 March 2012. The eligibility to the centralised procedure under Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was based on demonstration of significant therapeutic innovation.

## Similarity

The applicant applied for the following indication: IONSYS is indicated for the management of acute moderate to severe post-operative pain in adults for use in a hospital setting only. The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application The applicant indicated that fentanyl was considered to be a known active substance. The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and clinical data based on applicants' own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0111/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0111/2014 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. Information relating to orphan market exclusivity Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid related to the phenylpiperidine class of compounds. It is a highly sensitive μreceptor  agonist  and  is  about  100  times  more  potent  than  morphine  as  an  analgesic.  Opioids  exert  their therapeutic effects by mimicking the action of endogenous opioid peptides at opioid receptors. Effects on both local neurons and intrinsic pain-modulating circuitry lead to analgesia and other therapeutic effects as well as undesirable side-effects, the most serious of which is respiratory depression.

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is an important technique which permits patients to self-administer small doses  of  opioids  such  as  fentanyl,  morphine,  hydromorphone  or  pethidine,  on  an  'on-demand'  basis  to manage  pain.  It  was  originally  conceived  and  developed  to  minimise  the  effects  of  pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic  variability  among  individual  patients.  Patient-controlled  analgesia  has  subsequently become a safe and effective mainstay of post-surgical maintenance analgesia worldwide, instituted once the initial control of the patient's post-operative pain has been achieved via other methods. IONSYS®  (fentanyl  transdermal  system)  is  an  iontophoretic  transdermal  system  containing  fentanyl,  a potent mu-receptor opioid agent commonly used for analgesia. Each IONSYS system consists of two parts that are snapped together by the health care professional (HCP) just prior to application to the upper outer arm  or  chest  of  the  patient.  Each  assembled  system  contains  10.8  mg  fentanyl  hydrochloride  (HCl) equivalent to 9.7 mg of fentanyl and delivers 40 μg fentanyl per dose. Each system is designed to deliver up to a maximum of 240 μg per hour (up to 6 doses each of 10 minutes duration) and up to a maximum of 80 doses within a 24-hour period. The clinical  development program for IONSYS was originally conducted with an integrated system product configuration,  initially  developed  by  ALZA,  a  subsidiary  of  Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  (J&amp;J),  in  which  both  the electronics  and  drug  hydrogels  were  contained  within  a  single  housing.  This  product  configuration  was referred  to  as  the  E-TRANS  System  or  ETS.  A  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  (MAA)  for  IONSYS  was originally submitted in July 2004 (EMEA/H/C/612) by Janssen-Cilag (a subsidiary of J&amp;J). In January 2006, IONSYS received a European marketing licence, based on a positive benefit and risk profile demonstrated in 2144 adult postoperative patients in 20 clinical studies and 340 healthy volunteers in 11 pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. The product was marketed in select European countries beginning in January 2008. However, the  product  was  voluntarily  recalled  by  J&amp;J  in  September  2008  due  to  observations  of  corrosion  on  the printed  circuit  board  that  could  have  potentially  resulted  in  overdose  due  to  self-initiation  (i.e.,  doses delivered without dose initiation by the patient). No instances of self-initiation were reported. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A second generation IONSYS was developed by J&amp;J to provide enhanced stability and to address the issue resulting  in  withdrawal  of  the  system  from  the  market  in  2008.  This  version  was  a  separated  system consisting of a Controller and a Drug Unit and is referred to as the E-TRANS Separated System or ETSS in the current MAA. The Controller contained the same core electronics as the ETS, and the Drug Unit contained the same formulation.  The  Controller  and  Drug  Unit  were  assembled  by  the  HCP  prior  to  use.  The  ETSS  was shown to be bioequivalent to the ETS in a crossover PK study (C-2006-036). The ETSS was never marketed anywhere in the world.

Incline Therapeutics, Inc. acquired the worldwide rights to IONSYS from J&amp;J in June 2010. Incline conducted a  comprehensive  Product Risk  Analysis  and  Fault  Tree  Analysis  to  identify  all  potential  failure  modes  that could lead to unintended fentanyl delivery to the patient. Incline has completed the development program to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

eliminate  corrosion  and  all  other  potential  causes  of  unintended  fentanyl  delivery.  The  Incline  product consists of a Controller with enhanced electronics and a Drug Unit which are assembled by the HCP prior to use. This enhanced version of IONSYS, for which approval is being sought, is referred to in the current MAA as the Separated System with Enhanced Controller or SSEC.

The Applicant asked for Scientific Advice on this issue and the CHMP agreed that the changes to the IONSYS system adequately mitigated the risks of corrosion assuming successful test results and compliance with appropriate regulatory standards (Scientific Advice letter EMA/CHMP/SAWP/424689/2011). It was also confirmed in subsequent correspondence (clarification letter dated 20 July 2011, Module 1.2, Annex 5.14.) that the controller would not be considered a medical device under the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC since it is to be placed on the market in such a way that the device and the medicinal product form a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable. IONSYS is therefore governed by Directive 2001/83/EC and CE marking is not required. As suggested by the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP in the Scientific Advice, study PK2011-001 was performed to provide evidence of equivalence of the SSEC with the ETS.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product is presented as a transdermal system which contains fentanyl hydrochloride, equivalent to 9.7 mg of fentanyl, and delivers 40 µg fentanyl per dose. It will operate for 24 hours after the system is assembled or for 80 doses (corresponding to 3.2 mg fentanyl /24 hours), whichever comes first, and then becomes inoperative.

Ionsys was previously authorised in January 2006 (EMEA/H/C/0612) but was recalled from the market in September 2008 following the detection of corrosion since this may have led to the product self-actuating. The marketing authorisation was suspended in January 2009 and expired in January 2011. This current application is for an improved presentation where the electronics and hydrogels are separated prior to use in order to remove the likelihood of corrosion and malfunction. The transdermal system is composed of an electronic controller and a drug unit with two hydrogels. The controller is white with the identifier 'IONSYS ® ' and has a digital display, a light window, and a recessed dose activation button. The drug unit is blue on the side that connects to the controller and has a red bottom housing containing the hydrogels, one of which contains the fentanyl hydrochloride active substance. The drug unit consists of four main elements: interface module; bottom housing assembly; skin adhesive; and release liner. Ingredients of the bottom housing assembly are: -bottom housing unit: glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate -anode hydrogel:  polacrilin, purified water, sodium hydroxide, polyvinyl alcohol -cathode hydrogel:  purified water, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, polyvinyl alcohol, anhydrous citric acid, cetylpyridinium chloride -anode electrode:  layers of silver foil and electrically conductive adhesive tape -cathode electrode:  layers of polyisobutylene/silver chloride/carbon black composite material, silver foil, and electrically conductive adhesive tape Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -skin adhesive:  polybutene, polyisobutylene, and rosin ester
-          protective liner:  polyester film coated on one side with silicone

Each transdermal system is packaged in a sealed thermoform tray. The tray contains one controller and one sachet containing a drug unit.  The sachet foil is comprised of a lamination of nylon, aluminium foil and a heat seal layer of a copolymer of polyethylene and polymethacrylic acid. Each tray is packaged in a folding cardboard carton.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

## General information

The chemical name of fentanyl hydrochloride is N -PhenylN -[1-(2-phenethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide hydrochloride and it has the following structure:

<!-- image -->

Fentanyl HCl is a white to off-white solid, soluble in water and methanol. As the drug is completely dissolved in the proposed formulation, studies of polymorphism and particle size were not deemed necessary. The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. Manufacture, characterisation and process controls The active substance is sourced from one supplier and manufactured by three manufacturing sites (two of them are alternative manufacturing sites for the intermediate FC1002). The active substance is synthesized in four main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. The structure of the active substance has been confirmed using elemental analysis, IR, H 1 NMR and C 13  NMR. The active substance has a non-chiral molecular structure. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities including genotoxic impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Genotoxic impurities are controlled in compliance with the Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The active substance is packaged in double low density polyethylene bags inside an HDPE container. The LDPE bag is in immediate contact with the active substance complies with the European Commission Regulation EC 10/2011 as amended and European Pharmacopoeia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Specification

The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC, chloride identification), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.).

There is no Ph. Eur. monograph for fentanyl hydrochloride although there are Ph. Eur.  monographs for the fentanyl citrate and fentanyl base.

The limits applied to the fentanyl hydrochloride related substances are within those set by the Ph. Eur. monographs for fentanyl citrate and fentanyl base.

The omission of a specific limit for diisopropyl ether solvents used in the manufacture of the drug substance has been adequately justified. However, the justification provided by the applicant at the time of opinion for the absence of control of the toluene and benzene content in the active substance specification is not considered fully acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP recommends the applicant to demonstrate on the first 3 consecutive industrial scale batches of the final active substance that the content of toluene is not more than 10 % of the acceptable concentration limit stated in the ICH/VICH guideline on impurities: residual solvents and that benzene content is not more than 30 % of the specified limit, using a validated analytical methods. Otherwise a control of toluene and/or benzene content should be included in the active substance specification with a variation. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. Three certificates of analysis of two active substance batches tested by the finished product manufacturer have been submitted. In addition, batch analysis data on six batches of the active substance tested by active substance manufacturer have been provided. The batch analysis results analysed by finished product manufacturer and active substance manufacturer are similar. All the results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  Therefore, it is considered acceptable that the finished product manufacturer analysed only two batches of active substance. Stability Stability data were provided on three batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Additional stability data performed on the active substance stored in the initial commercial packaging (not proposed for marketing) -amber glass bottles with a Screw Top with a phenolic lid with polyvinyl liner- were also provided.

The following parameters were tested : appearance, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (KF). The analytical methods used were the same as those used for release by the ASMF holder and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the proposed specifications except for one batch. For this batch the accelerated study was discontinued as it did not meet the specification for appearance at the 3-month time point. The long-term stability study for this batch, however, is still ongoing and has been successfully completed through the 24 month time point. This batch, manufactured in 2005 and originally packaged in amber glass, was re-packaged in the new HDPE packaging in 2011, and the stability study was re-initiated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

under long-term and accelerated conditions. Therefore it was concluded that the observed out of specification results is not significant and does not pose any concern.

The stability data is supported by a forced degradation study indicating that the active substance was stable to light, heat and alkali conditions. Degradation was seen when subjected to heat and acid, or heat and oxidising conditions.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed 24 month retest period in the proposed container.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Description of the product and pharmaceutical development

<!-- image -->

The proposed finished product is a transdermal system that consists of a controller (device component) and a drug unit containing fentanyl hydrochloride.

The drug unit contains:

- an interface module (IM)
- a bottom housing assembly that includes hydrogels with the fentanyl hydrochloride in the anode hydrogel
- a skin adhesive
- a release liner

The drug unit is packaged in a sealed aluminium foil sachet. The drug unit sachet and the controller are packaged in a sealed plastic tray along with two leaflets.

<!-- image -->

The purpose of the product development was to design a safe, non-invasive and convenient alternative to conventional intravenous (iv) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) by using iontophoresis-based transdermal delivery of fentanyl through intact skin.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The original Ionsys transdermal system, referred as ETS in this MAA, was authorised in January 2006 (EMEA/H/C/0612). It was developed to provide transdermal PCA over a period of 24 hours over which a maximum of 80 doses could be delivered. Each dose delivered 40μg of fentanyl over 10 minutes during which time the system was locked out. The system was deactivated after 24 hours or after 80 doses had been used up. The maximum nominal amount of fentanyl that could be administered from a single system over 24 hours was 3.2 mg. It was an integrated system in which the electronics were exposed to high humidity from the hydrogels during manufacturing and storage. Although the marketed product included a humidity regulating absorber to prevent condensation, after marketing it was noticed that this did not avoid exposure of electronics to high humidity during manufacturing and storage, and could pose a risk of corrosion and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

malfunction. As a result, the finished product was recalled from the market in September 2008. The marketing authorisation was suspended in January 2009 and expired in January 2011.

An enhanced version of the transdermal system, referred to as the Separated System with Enhanced controller (SSEC) was therefore developed to mitigate the risk of overdose due to corrosion or any other cause. The SSEC is a separated version of the ETS transdermal system in which the active substance unit containing the hydrogels and the device portion (electronics) are manufactured separately and packaged individually for storage. The SSEC operates on the same principle as the ETS. The SSEC drug unit contains the same formulation (hydrogels and electrodes) and the same skin-contacting materials as the ETS. In the SSEC, the top housing of the ETS is replaced by the interface module (IM) and a separate controller. The IM is a plastic injection molded part with gold plated connectors that provides electrical and mechanical connection between the drug unit and the controller. The controller of the SSEC was designed based on experience with the ETS. The electronics in the SSEC controller are different from the ETS which was used for the original clinical development program. Enhanced electronics were developed to eliminate the potential for unintended fentanyl delivery, and the blinking light of the ETS version was replaced with a digital display to show the number of doses delivered to the patient. A comparison of the SSEC and ETS electronics has been provided. The controller provides the same drug delivery parameters (dose current, dose duration, dose lockout, and maximum duration of use) as the ETS. Prior to use by the patient, the Health Care Professional (HCP) will remove the drug unit from the sachet and attach it to the controller. The HCP will then remove the protective plastic film (release liner) from the skin adhesive of the assembled SSEC before applying the SSEC to the patient. After the SSEC is assembled, the HCP and patient will use the system in the same way as the ETS system. Once assembled, the controller and drug unit cannot be separated. If forced apart, the controller electronics are automatically deactivated and are designed such that they cannot be used again. In this case, the device will shutdown rather than re-set. The differences between ETS transdermal system and SSEC transdermal system have been adequately described and justified. The risk of corrosion and malfunction associated with ETS version are considered to be addressed by this new SSEC version. The key components responsible for fentanyl delivery are: anode hydrogel, cathode hydrogel and controller. Compositions of the drug unit and controller parts have been provided. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The complete list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Controller technical documentation has been provided. The algorithm defining the use of the device has been described. The applicant has taken into account in an appropriate manner harmonized or equivalent international standards and other suitable methods to demonstrate compliance of the controller unit with the essential requirements of Directive 93/42/EEC.

Overall the data in the dossier related to ETS-SSEC comparability (pharmaceutical, electro-mechanical, manufacturing) demonstrate that the changes made to facilitate the SSEC design have resulted in the pharmaceutical equivalence of the SSEC with the ETS. Comparison of in-vitro drug release profile from ETS and SSEC was provided. These data were generated using the same in-vitro drug release equipment and test method that was validated for the ETS and for the SSEC. The results demonstrate that the drug release from the SSEC transdermal system is equivalent to that from the ETS transdermal system.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary packaging of the transdermal system is a thermoformed HDPE tray and a PET/Aluminium foil heat sealed lid. The tray contains one controller and one sachet containing a drug Unit.  The primary packaging of the drug unit is a sachet foil comprised of a lamination of nylon, aluminium foil and a heat seal layer of a copolymer of polyethylene and polymethacrylic acid. The material of drug unit primary packaging complies with EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: anode and cathode hydrogel mixing, bottom housing assembly including filling with hydrogels, hydrogel curing in the bottom housing assembly (BHA), drug unit assembly, drug unit packaging into sachet and drug unit co-packaging with the controller to produce the finished product. The drug unit is manufactured using the same process and equipment that was used to manufacture the ETS. The only new component in the drug unit of the SSEC compared to the ETS is the interface module. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. The critical process parameters and in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. Manufacturing of controller part has also been described. The manufacturing process of the drug unit has been validated on three production scale batches. Holding times were validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Product specification The finished product release specification include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form : appearance of drug unit and finished product, identification (TLC and HPLC), fentanyl assay (HPLC), fentanyl impurities (HPLC), cetylpyridinium chloride assay (HPLC) , adhesive testing (tensil tester), pH of hydrogels, conductivity of hydrogels, microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.), delivered dose (System Functionality Test Apparatus (SFTA), HPLC), Mean Interdose Current (SFTA), Number of Doses (SFTA), Dose charge (SFTA). Electrical  parameters  such  as  output  current  and  the  release  of  fentanyl  are  monitored  using  a  System Functionality Apparatus (SFTA).  The released fentanyl from each actuation is collected in a citrate/sodium chloride buffer containing polysorbate and is then determined by a HPLC method. All analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. Batch analysis results including results for three production scale batches are provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Stability of the product

Stability data were provided for several batches of finished product, including three  production scale batches, stored under long term conditions for 13 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Samples were tested according to the release specifications. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  No significant changes have been observed during stability studies in any of the parameters tested.

Based on available stability data, the 24 month shelf-life, with the storage precaution 'Do not store above 25°C.  Do not refrigerate or freeze' and the statement 'Use immediately after opening' as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects An enhanced version of the Ionsys ETS transdermal system (authorised in January 2006 (EMEA/H/C/0612), suspended in January 2009 and expired in January 2011) was developed to mitigate the risk of overdose due to corrosion and malfunction encountered with the ETS version. The Ionsys SSEC transdermal system is a separated version of the ETS transdermal system in which the active substance unit containing the hydrogels and the device portion (electronics) are manufactured separately and packaged individually for storage. The SSEC drug unit contains the same formulation (hydrogels and electrodes) and same skin-contacting materials as the ETS. In the SSEC, the top housing of the ETS has been replaced by the IM and a separate controller. The differences between ETS transdermal system and SSEC transdermal system have been adequately described and justified. The risk of corrosion and malfunction associated with ETS version are considered to be addressed by this new SSEC version. The SSEC operates on the same principle as the ETS. It provides transdermal patient controlled analgesia over a period of 24 hours over which a maximum of 80 doses could be delivered. Each dose delivers 40μg of fentanyl over 10 minutes during which time the system would be locked out. The system deactivates after 24 hours or after administration of 80 doses. The maximum nominal amount of fentanyl that can be administered from a single system over 24 hours is 3.2 mg. In-vitro drug release profiles of the SSEC and ETS were comparable. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue related to the active substance specifications having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

the applicant should demonstrate on the first three consecutive industrial scale batches of the final active

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

substance that the content of toluene is not more than 10 % of the acceptable concentration limit stated in the ICH/VICH guideline on impurities: residual solvents and, that benzene content is not more than 30 % of the specified limit, using validated analytical methods. Otherwise a control of toluene and/or benzene content should be included in the active substance specification with a variation.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

2.3.2. Pharmacology Primary pharmacodynamic studies Fentanyl  has  been  extensively  described  as  a  potent  opioid  analgesic  and  the  applicant  has  provided  a summary of the relevant non-clinical literature to establish the applicability of their transdermal product .  In vitro studies have demonstrated that fentanyl binds with a higher affinity to µ opioid receptors as compared to κ- or δ-opiate receptors.  In vivo pharmacodynamics has been described in mice and rats with clear antinociceptive and analgesic effects, with an increased margin for safety compared to other opioid analgesics such  as  morphine.  Given  the  well  characterised  pharmacology  of  fentanyl,  the  applicant's  review  is acceptable. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies No  dedicated  secondary  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  and  this  is  acceptable  given  the extensive clinical use of fentanyl. Safety pharmacology programme The safety pharmacology of fentanyl as a component of IONSYS has been extensively investigated.  As has been  highlighted  in  the  dossier  many  of  these  reports/studies  were  completed  prior  to  Good  Laboratory Practice  (GLP)  compliance  standards  and  are  in  many  instances  based  on  older  references.    A  number  of more recent  reviews  have  been  introduced  into  the  overall  discussion.    The  secondary  adverse  effects  of opioids are already well known and the review supplied further discusses the potential of fentanyl to cause respiratory  depression,  constipation,  physical  dependence,  and  euphoria.    No  new  safety  concerns  are expected in the use of fentanyl in the IONSYS product over and above that already established with other formulations and presentations for fentanyl. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No  pharmacodynamic  interaction  studies  have  been  completed.    The  use  of  fentanyl  with  concomitant medication is already well-established so the absence of these studies is acceptable.  Concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers,  skeletal  muscle  relaxants,  sedating  antihistamines  and  alcoholic  beverages  are  noted  to produce  additive  depressant  effects.    Hypoventilation,  hypotension  and  profound  sedation  or  coma  may occur.  Use of fentanyl with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors within 14 days is not recommended due to

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the potential for potentiation of the effects of opioid analgesics when administered MAO inhibitors.  There are appropriate warnings in the SmPC.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  fentanyl  delivered  by  transdermal,  subcutaneous  (SC)  and  intravenous  (IV) administration are well documented, and the applicant has described the PK characteristics using a variety of literature sources in addition to the use of legacy study reports with fentanyl.  With respect to transdermal delivery of fentanyl, studies have been completed previously using hairless rat skin, both in vitro and in vivo , exploring  the  advantages  of  using  iontophoresis  (application  of  an  electrical  field  across  the  skin)  and electroporation (application of high voltage external field pulses) on improving fentanyl drug absorption.

Literature references are provided to discuss the analytical methods used to detect plasma levels of fentanyl. These  published  studies  are  not  GLP  studies  however  are  based  upon  the  techniques  used  by  Janssen Research for the initial studies with fentanyl.  In addition the applicant has described methodology used to quantify fentanyl in the mouse dermal repeat-dose toxicity studies. Fentanyl  absorption  has  been  described  from  both  a  transdermal  and  intravenous  perspective.    The transdermal data are obviously more relevant for this product and this was examined using hairless rat skin preparations, examining the influence of iontophoresis on increasing skin penetration.  Penetration increased with  iontophoresis  compared  to  passive  diffusion  in  the in  vitro skin  model,  and  this  was  confirmed  with increased plasma levels of fentanyl when administered to hairless rats using iontophoresis.  Electroporation also led to increased exposure to fentanyl.  This data supports the concept of using an electrical current to deliver dosing of fentanyl via the transdermal route. Intravenous exposure of fentanyl demonstrates the rapid absorption and elimination of fentanyl, half-life in rats  was  8  minutes,  3  minutes  in  rabbits  and  dogs  and  &lt;2  minutes  in  humans.    The  rapid  reduction  in exposure is mainly due to rapid uptake to tissues and its metabolism in the liver. Distribution of fentanyl has been described using both in vitro and in vivo methods.  There is a high level of plasma protein binding ranging from 84% in humans to 69% in mice, although there is consistency of 7080%  binding  across  each  species.    Binding  is  predominantly  to  albumin,  but  is  also  seen  with  α1-acid glycoprotein  and  lipoproteins.    Fentanyl  appears  to  be  readily  taken  up  by  blood  in  a  dose-dependent manner, binding mainly to haemoglobin. Tissue distribution has briefly been reviewed; fentanyl is taken up rapidly, predominantly to the brain but is also  stored  in  fat,  muscle  and  liver.    Fentanyl  has  been  shown  to  pass  though  the  placenta  and  may  be distributed to breast milk.  Adequate warnings are included in the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the initial review there was little or no evidence has been supplied here to acknowledge the distribution of fentanyl  following  transdermal  delivery,  as  will  be  the  case  for  the  use  with  IONSYS.    The  applicant  has provided some further discussion on the issue of potential accumulation of fentanyl into fat tissue.  It has been described that delivery via the IONSYS device allows for an active iontophoretic transdermal delivery of fentanyl  resulting  in  rapid  migration  through  the  skin  and  into  the  systemic  circulation.    This  means  that there is no accumulation of fentanyl ions in the skin or subcutaneous fat tissue.  This is supported by the clinical  pharmacokinetic  data  that  suggests  that  parameters  are  similar  between  intravenous  and  IONSYS (transdermal) delivery with rapid absorption of the fentanyl dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The differences between traditional transdermal delivery systems and that provided by the IONSYS system have been given in more detail.  There is relatively rapid uptake of fentanyl when using the IONSYS delivery; similar pharmacokinetic parameters are suggested between IV and IONSYS delivery routes.  Half-lives are suggested to be 12.99 hr for IV and 11.04 hr for IONSYS.  As a result the applicant argues that a shorter period  of  24  hours  between  removal  of  the  device  and  the  initiation  of  breast-feeding  is  justified  as highlighted in the SmPC.

Metabolism of fentanyl has been examined in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, sheep and human liver microsomes.  Much of what has been described is from legacy study reports by Janssen from 20 years ago. Metabolism occurs mainly by oxidative N-dealkylation, but also occurs by hydroxylation and glucoronidation. No  detailed  discussion  of  metabolism  at  the  skin  has  been  provided  however  it  is  suggested  that  it  is absorbed  unchanged,  before  distribution  and  subsequent  liver  metabolism.    The  discussion  provided  for metabolism are relatively brief, however from the non-clinical perspective this could be accepted given the well established clinical use of this active substance and higher exposure levels.  Although briefly mentioned in the applicant's overview, it is unclear from the discussions provided what, if any, activity can be attributed to  any  of  the  metabolites  of  fentanyl,  however  this  was  further  discussed  in  the  pharmacology  written summary. Excretion has been adequately described.  Elimination is via urine and faeces, but has also been detected in animal breast milk. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been reviewed using to in vitro studies with human liver microsomes in which potential interaction with up to 55 compounds are described.  Fentanyl is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4  and  so  interactions  with  inhibitors  of  this  enzyme  have  potential  to  increase  fentanyl  plasma concentrations or extend exposure in vivo .  The applicant has included warning to this effect in the SmPC. 2.3.4. Toxicology Single dose toxicity For acute toxicity a number of legacy studies have been reported with fentanyl using a variety of routes of administration,  including  subcutaneous.    The  main  findings  relate  to  excessive  opioid-like  effects  -  CNS effects, decreased activity, convulsions, tremors, loss of righting reflex, sedation and respiratory depression. The  applicant  also  completed  two  GLP  compliant  studies  in  mice  and  rats  using  the  intravenous  route, confirming the effects already established with fentanyl.  These studies determined lethal dose in 50 percent of animals to be 12.3 mg/kg in mice and 2.3 mg/kg in rats. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Repeat dose toxicity

Repeat dose toxicity studies were presented from a variety of routes of administration, and species.  Dermal toxicity has been presented in the mouse and rabbit. Further studies are also provided in the rat (SC, IM and IV)  and  dog  (IV)  to  provide  added  support  for  systemic  exposure  with  fentanyl.    Concerning  the  dermal repeat dose toxicity studies, findings were related to pharmacological effects of opioids, with weight loss and CNS  effects  prevalent  in  the  mouse  and  in  the  rabbit  the  adverse  effects  were  limited  to  skin  changes hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and sub-acute dermatitis indicating more of an irritation potential.

## Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity was examined in a range of GLP in vitro and a single in vivo micronucleus study.  A variation was observed in the mouse lymphoma study in the presence of S9, however once repeated the increase concern  for  increased  mutation  could  not  be  replicated  to  the  same  extent.    Results  from  the  Ames  and chromosome aberration studies and the micronucleus test indicate that fentanyl is not mutagenic.  This is supported.

## Carcinogenicity

The  applicant  has  provided  a  long  term  carcinogenicity  study  with  fentanyl  in  rats  using  daily  SC administration  up  to  100  µg/kg/day.    Although  findings  of  pituitary  adenomas  (males  and  females),  and mammary gland fibroadenomas and carcinomas (females) were observed, these appeared in all dose groups at comparable levels so was not considered to be related to treatment.

To further support the rat study a 26 week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice has been reported.  No evidence of increased neoplastic risk was identified, and so it is agreed that fentanyl shows no carcinogenic potential, and the risks of short term treatment with the IONSYS product would in any case be negligible given the low dose and treatment duration (up to 72 hrs).

## Reproduction Toxicity

Two study reports are provided evaluating fertility and early embryonic development in rats following continuous intravenous infusion with fentanyl in both sexes.  There are no adverse effects for fertility for either male or female rats.  NOAEL in male rats is 0.4 mg/kg, and in females this is 0.025 mg/kg for maternal effects and 0.4 mg/kg for developmental effects.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition to these two studies, two published references are provided to further describe the in vitro effects of fentanyl on fertilisation and subsequent cell division in sea urchin eggs and an in vivo study in rats using SC continuous infusion using implanted osmotic minipumps.

Five study reports are provided evaluating embryo-fetal development in rats (IV, SC) and in rabbits (IV infusion).  No teratogenic effects were detected in any of the five studies completed in rats or in rabbits.  The most relevant finding is that of loss of maternal weight gain (rats and rabbits) and decreased pup weight (rats).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study all animals survived.  At dosages of 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg/day, neither maternal toxicity nor adverse effects on the litter were demonstrated.  At 0.4 mg/kg, slight maternal toxicity was evidenced by a marginal decrease in body weight.  NOAELs are 0.1 mg/kg for the F0 and F1 generation and 0.4 mg/kg for the F2 generation.  Margins of safety for the high dose 0.4 mg/kg/day; Cmax 6.2 ng/mL), is at least 3 fold the human plasma level (2 ng/mL), although this is less than one for the 0.1 mg/kg level (Cmax 1.5 ng/mL).

## Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetics (TK) was examined in a number of the legacy toxicity studies - these were conducted in mice (dermal), rats (SC and IV), and rabbits (dermal and IV).  The higher safety factors (&gt;1.5) are more apparent in the systemic exposure studies in rats, i.e. from the 5 week IV study and 3 month SC study, with the exception of the rat and rabbit developmental studies which either fentanyl plasma levels were too low to be detected or the safety factor to humans was below 1.  The TK data is far from ideally presented in the dossier, however it is acknowledged that previous clinical exposure to fentanyl over and exceeds anything that is expected in this IONSYS preparation. Local Tolerance Local tolerance has been studied with single and repeat-dose administration of IONSYS and using different anode and cathode hydrogel formulations and current densities. In addition, several studies were conducted in guinea pigs to evaluate the sensitisation potential of constituents of the IONSYS hydrogels and the adhesive. A number of skin irritation studies have now been completed to assess the potential of the hydrogel formulation to sensitise the skin.  Studies were completed in the rabbit and on hairless guinea pigs using a variety of formulations.  Most importantly the final clinical product was used on hairless guinea pigs, and rabbits in this study in which the hydrogel was detected to be a mild irritant in both species.  It was also established that use of a polymeric buffer - polacrilin - did not increase the skin irritation potential to any great extent.  Animals were treated with placebo hydrogel, fentanyl hydrogel and fentanyl hydrogel with an electrical current and were then topically induced.  All three preparations demonstrated mild irritation, and there was no increased discomfort in groups given electrically-assisted delivery of fentanyl. The excipients used in the hydrogel have been adequately characterised and described in the non-clinical overview.  Dermal sensitisation studies have been completed and reveal that the bactericidal agent (Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)), the buffer (Polacrilin) nor the adhesive act in a manner to exacerbate any skin irritation that may occur when administered IONSYS.

## Other toxicity studies

No non-clinical studies have been conducted in juvenile animals during the development of IONSYS.  No relevant studies have been identified in the published literature.

Tests to examine the biocompatibility of the IONSYS components (the silver foil used in the electrodes, the top (upper) housing: blue, and red, the bottom (lower) housing: red and blue, the electrically-conductive adhesive tape, PIB/silver chloride/carbon black electrode material and the adhesive were carried out.  No concerns raised in respect to any of the components used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Abuse liability has been reviewed and concerns related to the use of this product are limited given its intended clinical use.  Abuse potential of fentanyl has been adequately reviewed.

Literature data has been provided to examine the potential pharmacological activity of fentanyl metabolites, norfentanyl, α hydroxyfentanyl and para hydroxy fentanyl. α hydroxyfentanyl and para hydroxy fentanyl show some limited activity in an in vitro assay, and an in vivo tail withdrawal test (4-hydroxyphenethylfentanyl or para hydroxy fentanyl). Although activity is less than the parent compound, the minor metabolite, para hydroxy fentanyl demonstrates similar activity to morphine.  This metabolite is predominantly found in the guinea pig, rat and mouse and has not been detected as a human metabolite, and so a concern for clinical safety is negligible.

Two GLP studies were conducted to explore potential adverse effects of the impurity R004380.  These studies were completed following acute intravenous administration to mice and rats.  There was no evidence to suggest there was any additional adverse toxicity associated with the impurity R004380.

The applicant has provided a suitable review of the environmental risk implications of the use of fentanyl. The estimation of exposure (Phase I) of fentanyl does not raise concern with respect to the PEC action limit for surface water, this is 0.0004 µg/L, and so a Phase II assessment is not required.  LogKow is also below 4.5, and so fentanyl is not considered to be a PBT substance.  Therefore fentanyl is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  The ERA is acceptable.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The non-clinical development programme for IONSYS consists of a range of study reports and literature, mainly to compile a complete non-clinical safety profile of fentanyl.  Fentanyl (mostly as fentanyl base or as fentanyl citrate) has previously been extensively tested in non-clinical studies and many of these were conducted in the 1960's and 1970's.  These studies were all presented at the time of approval of the original IONSYS application, and included a selection of transdermal animal studies (safety pharmacology and topical pharmacokinetics), a 5-week repeat-dose study by continuous IV infusion in the rat, preceded by a dose range-finding study; a package of reproduction toxicity studies by continuous IV infusion; and an additional genotoxicity study.  A detailed package of local tolerance and contact hypersensitivity studies on ETS system has also been supplied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Many of the conducted non-clinical studies used the ETS fentanyl formulation; however the formulation of fentanyl used in the SSEC product is unchanged and so the only new non-clinical data provided to support this application are two new toxicology studies and one carcinogenicity study that were on-going at time of the original MAA submission.

The applicant was requested to discuss the potential risk deriving from accumulation of fentanyl in subcutaneous fat tissue following transdermal administration.  Based on the pharmacokinetic and toxicological data available for IONSYS, the applicant was asked to provide a scientific justification for the time period recommended to elapse before resumption of breast-feeding following removal of the medicinal product. Further to the review of the applicant position, the CHMP considered that the potential risk deriving from accumulation of fentanyl in subcutaneous fat tissue following transdermal administration had been properly discussed and that this risk was mitigated due to its rapid migration through skin to the systemic circulation, resulting also in a shorter time period recommended to elapse before resumption of breastfeeding following removal of the medicinal product.

During the review of the application, the CHMP considered that levels of the minor metabolite, para hydroxy fentanyl metabolite following clinical exposure had not been highlighted and thereby requested the applicant to further review this point, focusing on the potential consequences for clinical safety from the use of the IONSYS product. Having evaluated the responses provided by the applicant, the CHMP considered the levels of the minor active metabolite, para hydroxy fentanyl metabolite following clinical exposure to be negligible and predominantly seen in animal species and not for humans. 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects The CHMP considers that there are no objections to authorisation of this medicinal product from a non-clinical perspective. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies

No new clinical efficacy studies have been conducted as part of this application. However, the applicant has provided results of the studies conducted as part of the original development programme conducted for the original ETS system that was approved via the centralised route in 2006, but subsequently not renewed.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

Fentanyl is highly lipid soluble, as measured by the octanol-water distribution coefficient (log p of 2.98), and has greater access to the brain and central opioid receptors than morphine (log p of 0.0). Highly lipophilic agents  like  fentanyl  may  be  rapidly  absorbed  in  neural  tissues  or  through  the  nasal  and  buccal  mucosa. Opioids in general are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and act rapidly when administered via intravenous  (IV)  or  intramuscular  (IM)  injection.  The  bioavailability  of  fentanyl  after  oral  and  oraltransmucosal  administration  are  32%  and  52%,  respectively.  Approximately  92%  of  the  fentanyl  dose absorbed  from  a  passive  transdermal  system  reaches  the  systemic  circulation  as  unchanged  fentanyl; therefore, fentanyl biotransformation during passive transdermal penetration appears negligible.

Bioequivalence: The application is based on showing bioequivalence between the originally licenced system and the new system that is subject to this application. As the old system was discontinued due to malfunction concerns  in  the  electronics,  which  have  since  been  addressed  (please  see  quality  assessment),  it  was impossible for the applicant to perform a study directly comparing the old ETS system and their new SSEC system. They have therefore attempted to bridge across between the original system and the new system by taking  study  C-96-009  and  performing  an  identical  study-  PK2011-001.  From  this  the  applicant  then compared total dose delivered. A direct comparison of the 40µg dose was then performed with the results from study C-97-001. C-96-009: Study C-96-009 was a pilot BA study conducted during the development of the ETS product to evaluate  systemic  exposure  at  various  current  levels  with  the  intended  commercial  hydrogel  formulation containing fentanyl hydrochloride. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the amount of fentanyl absorbed by 10-minute on-demand doses from the ETS with various current settings. Medicinal product no longer authorised TreatnentA: TreatmentB: TreatimentC: TreatnentD: TreatmentE:

The results from Study C-96-009 indicated that a current of 170 μA (n = 16) provided an arithmetic mean dose (± standard deviation [SD]) of 39.5 (± 10.9) μg (refer to CSR C-96-009). The median dose was 35.6 μg, with twice as many subjects (n = 4) having a dose absorbed value between 35 and 38 μg, inclusive, than any other dose range interval.

## Distribution

Fentanyl is distributed rapidly from plasma to highly vascular tissues (heart, lung, and brain) following an IV bolus. More than 80% of the injected dose leaves plasma in less than 5 minutes and 98.6% within an hour. The large volume of distribution for fentanyl is related to its lipophilic characteristics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Fentanyl is metabolized primarily in the liver. It has a high extraction ratio and clearance ranges from values as  low  as  one-third  of  hepatic  blood  flow  to  those  equalling  hepatic  blood  flow.  In  humans,  the  drug  is metabolized mainly by N-dealkylation to norfentanyl [4-N-(N-propionyl-anilino)-piperidine] and by hydroxylation of both fentanyl and norfentanyl to hydroxypropionyl fentanyl and hydroxypropionyl norfentanyl,  respectively.  Fentanyl  amide  hydrolysis  to  despropionylfentanyl  and  alkyl  hydroxylation  to hydroxyfentanyl are comparatively minor pathways, and hydroxyfentanyl is subsequently N-dealkylated to hydroxynorfentanyl, another minor metabolite.

The elimination of fentanyl from the body is governed by its reuptake from storage sites and its metabolism in the liver. The serum fentanyl concentration profile is often best described by a three-compartment model. The half-life of fentanyl is approximately 4-8 hours following IV administration and renal elimination is low in humans.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

## Special populations

<!-- image -->

The effect of renal impairment on fentanyl PK is expected to be similar to that following intravenous dosing. Although it is accepted that renal impairment will have limited effect on the PK of fentanyl, Ionsys should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

The  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  fentanyl  PK  is  expected  to  be  similar  to  that  following  intravenous dosing. Fentanyl is a high hepatic extraction ratio drug; detailed data on the effect of decreased blood on pharmacokinetics  of  fentanyl  are  sparse.  Ionsys  should  be  administered  with  caution  to  patients  with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

## Genetic polymorphisms:

CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms may be associated with increased exposure to fentanyl. In one study,  plasma  fentanyl  concentrations  were  1.9  fold  higher  in  CYP3A5  *3/*3  patients  than  in  wild  type patients.  During  the  course  of the  procedure,  the  applicant was  requested  to  further discuss the consequences of possible genetic polymorphism and this information was included in the SmPC.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

In vitro: At therapeutic concentrations, ranitidine (CYP3A4 inhibitor) inhibited the disappearance of fentanyl from an in vitro microsomal preparation, indicating that it hinders microsomal drug metabolism. Feierman showed  that  fentanyl  metabolism  by  rat  and  human  microsomes  was  inhibited  by  acetaminophen (paracetamol); however, the inhibitory constant (Ki) was 20-fold greater than the typical therapeutic blood concentration of acetaminophen, making in vivo acetaminophen-fentanyl interactions unlikely.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

A wide variety of drugs given at potentially therapeutic plasma drug concentrations were tested in vitro and found to have negligible, if any, effect on fentanyl binding (0.6 and 40 ng/mL) to whole plasma. However, at drug concentrations higher than 20 μg/mL, aspirin, phenylbutazone, and quinidine were reported to cause inhibition  of  fentanyl  binding  (0.6  and  40  ng/mL)  to  whole  plasma.  Aspirin  and  phenylbutazone  inhibited binding of fentanyl to albumin, while quinidine caused inhibition of binding to lipoproteins but not to albumin. Estrogen and progesterone therapy have been shown to increase fentanyl binding. Since fentanyl has a high hepatic extraction ratio, its clearance is most sensitive to changes in hepatic blood flow and less sensitive to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

changes  in  intrinsic  hepatic  enzyme  activity  and  protein  binding.  However,  alterations  in  fentanyl  protein binding may influence its volume of distribution.

In vivo: Halothane and enflurane are strong inhibitors in the rat and are shown to delay fentanyl metabolism in  humans.  Schuttler  and  Ihmsen  reported  that  fentanyl  and  alfentanil  both  increased  the  volume  of  the central compartment and the clearance of propofol. Other investigators have shown that both fentanyl and alfentanil  decrease  the  propofol  requirements  for  induction  of  anaesthesia,  possibly  because  of  synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction between these drugs.

Since  the  metabolism  of  fentanyl  is  mediated  by  the  CYP3A4  isoenzyme,  co-administration  of  drugs  that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole) may decrease clearance of fentanyl. The expected clinical results would be increased or prolonged opioid effects. Thus, patients being treated with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be carefully monitored while they are receiving fentanyl so that dose adjustments may be  made  as  administration  of  ritonavir  and  fentanyl  resulted  in  a  67%  decrease  in  fentanyl  clearance,  a 174% increase of fentanyl AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), and a doubling of fentanyl half-life that was most likely due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.

The applicant was requested to provide a discussion of any potential interactions with topical medicines.  The applicant proposed that concomitant use of topical medicines should be avoided, which was agreed by CHMP and an appropriate warning was included in Section 4.5 of the SmPC. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics Mechanism of action Primary and Secondary pharmacology The  pharmacodynamics  of  fentanyl  is  well  known.  The  applicant  has  provided  a  summary  of  the pharmacodynamics  but  no  additional  studies.  In  this  case  this  is  acceptable.  The  data  presented  is summarised below. Fentanyl  acts  primarily  on  the  central  nervous  system  to  produce  analgesia  and  sedation.  Respiratory depression, changes in mood, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, and alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems may also result. Several studies have correlated fentanyl plasma concentration with analgesia (the desired effect) and respiratory depression (the most dangerous side effect). However, the intensity of the effects correlates with the drug concentration at the site of action (effect site) and not necessarily the plasma concentration. For opioids, the effect site (or biophase) is the opioid receptor in the brain and spinal cord. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetics:  The  applicant  has  provided  one  new  pharmacokinetic  study  that  is  designed  to  show bioequivalence to the old system. The rest of the data comes from the old system and as such confirms the pharmacodynamics of the system. The three main studies have been described above, whilst the others are listed with basic results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The need for the applicant to conduct a study without the direct comparison to the ETS system is understood. Availability  and  safety  concerns  means  that  it  was  impossible  to  conduct  a  study  with  the  ETS  system. Therefore  the  applicant's  decision  to  conduct  a  study  using  the  new  system  and  IV  fentanyl  is  accepted. Study  PK2011-001  was  well  conducted  the  bioavailability  parameters  were  in  line  with  those  seen  in  the previous studies with the old system.

Study  C-96-009  was  a  pilot  BA  study  conducted  during  the  development  of  the  ETS  product  to  evaluate systemic exposure at various current levels with the intended commercial hydrogel formulation containing fentanyl hydrochloride. The results from Study C-96-009 indicated that a current of 170 μA (n = 16) provided an  arithmetic  mean  dose  (±  standard  deviation  [SD])  of  39.5  (±  10.9)  μg (refer to CSR C -96-009).  The median dose was 35.6 μg, with twice as many subjects (n = 4) having a dose absorbed value between 35 and  38  μg,  inclusive,  than  any  other  dose  range  interval.  Since  only  16  subjects  completed  the  170  μA treatment, the estimate of the mean dose absorbed can be disproportionately influenced by individual values at the extremes of the distribution.

Study C-97-001 was a single-centre, open-label, randomised, 3-period, 3-treatment, 2-sequence crossover trial  in  naltrexone-blocked  subjects  designed  to  confirm  the  bioavailability  of  the  system.  The  mean  dose absorbed value for the ETS 170 μA (n = 35) was 68 μg following two consecutive doses at the 23rd hour of treatment.  However,  four  subjects  (#1011,  1031,  1039,  1040)  had  unexpectedly  high  fentanyl  serum concentrations (&gt; 10 ng/mL) at 1 to 4 observation time points in the reference IV treatment, resulting in reduced apparent dose absorbed values for the respective ETS treatment (even though typical AUC values were observed for the ETS treatments). The high IV concentration values (refer to CSR C-97-001; Display 7.1.2,  post-text  Table  3)  could  not  be  explained  by  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  drug.  When  these  four subjects are excluded, the mean dose absorbed for the two consecutive doses at 170 μA was 74.3 μg (n = 31). The median value was also 74.3 μg, with about one-third of all individual dose absorbed values falling in the 69 to 76 μg dose interval, or about 35 to 38 μg per dose. Dose absorbed values were similar across the two treatment periods in C-97-001 (i.e., no period effect). Study PK2011-001 was a single-centre, randomized, open-label, 3-period, 5-treatment, 6-sequence PK study in  healthy  adult  subjects.  A  total  of  54  eligible  subjects  were  to  receive  3  fentanyl  treatments,  one administered via intravenous (IV) infusion and 2 administered via the Study System. Exposure (Cmax and AUC23-24),  including  Dose  Absorbed  between  23  and  25  hours,  increased  with  increasing  current.  The median tmax ranged from 23.00 to 23.17 hours across the 4 Study System treatment groups, suggesting rapid absorption of fentanyl after each hourly dosing period through 23.33 hours. Mean t1/2 values ranged from 11.0 to 13.0 hours regardless of dose absorbed or route of administration. Comparisons of the ratio of the  geometric  least  squares  mean  for  Dose  Absorbed  for  the  test  (Study  PK2011-001)  versus  reference (Study C-97-001) 170 μA systems fell within the bounds of the CI limit interval of 80% to 125%, thereby meeting standard bioequivalence criteria.

Bioequivalence has been shown for 40µg between C-97-001 and PK2011-001. This holds true with both sets of data from C-97-001, with the subjects that had issues included or excluded. Dose normalisation across the studies also reflects this. The doses dispensed by the devices across studies are also very similar taking into account the high variability shown across the studies.

The data presented for the previous approved system in patients shows that the exposure is similar to that seen in the healthy subjects.

The data presented above shows that there are no significant differences in exposure with differing age, sex, weight or race.

Pharmacodynamics:  The  pharmacodynamics  of  fentanyl  is  well  known.  The  applicant  has  provided  a summary of the pharmacodynamics but no additional studies. In this case this is acceptable. The system and transdermal delivery are not expected to have any effect on the pharmacodynamics of the active.

Fentanyl  acts  primarily  on  the  central  nervous  system  to  produce  analgesia  and  sedation.  Respiratory depression, changes in mood, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, and alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems may also result. Several studies have correlated fentanyl plasma concentration with analgesia (the desired effect) and respiratory depression (the most dangerous side effect). However, the intensity of the effects correlates with the drug concentration at the site of action (effect site) and not necessarily the plasma concentration. For opioids, the effect site (or biophase) is the opioid receptor in the brain and spinal cord.

2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology Pharmacokinetics: In  conclusion,  the  bioequivalence  comparison  across  the  studies  is  accepted.  The equivalence between the devices is recognised and therefore bridging to the efficacy and safety data from the previously approved application and system is acceptable. Pharmacodynamics: The applicant's summary of the PD of fentanyl is adequate. 2.5. Clinical efficacy 2.5.1. Dose response study(ies) 2.5.2.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

None performed.

## Clinical studies in special populations

In  the  ETS  clinical  development program, there was a sufficient number of patients ≥ 65 years of age to adequately assess efficacy of ETS 40 µg for postoperative pain management in the elderly.  Overall, there were no meaningful differences in efficacy assessment outcomes in each of the elderly subgroups (65 to 74, 75 to 84, ≥ 85) compared to the non-elderly (&lt; 65) in the placebo- and active-controlled studies.

Supportive studies The  applicant  has  examined  system  adhesion  in  Study  AD2011-001  and  usability  studies  in  patients, healthcare professionals and healthy individuals in studies HF2011-002, HF2012-001 ad HF2013-001. AD2011-001 Adequate adhesion using the SSEC was demonstrated in AD2011-001. The SSEC exhibited good adherence at  the  2  application  sites,  upper  outer  arm  and  chest,  over  the  24-hour  wearing  period.  There  was  no significant  difference  in  the  extent  of  adherence  at  the  two  application  sites.  A  non-inferiority  comparison showed that the 24-hour mean adhesion scores at either location (arm or chest) for the SSEC evaluated in the current study were non-inferior to those observed for the previously approved product, the ETS system, evaluated in adhesion study C-2006-021. HF2011-002 In study HF2011-002, 29 of 30 patients were able to successfully self-administer a simulated treatment using the SSEC placebo system on the first attempt. The one participant who was unable to administer treatment understood how to do it, but had difficulty pressing the button on the device. The patient was successful in initiating a dose on the next attempt. All participants responded appropriately to a simulated system alert (audio and visual signals) by indicating that they would contact a nurse. Overall, patients found the system convenient and very easy to use at both application sites (arm and chest application areas). They liked the size and discreteness of the device and the ability to perform other necessary activities while wearing the device. Patients made no errors or near-misses that could lead to potential unsafe situations. Therefore, this study validated that patients were able to easily use the SSEC system safely. HF2012-001 Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study HF2012-001, no training was provided to the nurses or pharmacists. However, they had access to the Quick Guide that is provided with the SSEC system. Participants were able to assemble IONSYS usually in less  than  one  minute.  After  assembling and applying the SSEC system to a mannequin, participants were able to  correctly  determine  all  operational  states  (ready  state,  dosing  state,  end  of  use)  and  comprehend system  feedback  (light,  beeps,  display).  Though  some  had  minor  difficulty  comprehending  alerts,  all participants  were  able  to  respond  appropriately  to  system  errors.  Many  participants  noted  that  the  SSEC system would become even easier to use upon increased familiarity with repeated use. All participants were able to remove the SSEC system from the simulated patient and dispose of the system properly. There were no errors or near-misses that could lead to potential unsafe situations. Overall, healthcare providers found

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the SSEC system to be convenient and very easy to use. They liked the size of the product, benefits of a prefilled and pre-programmed product, and the perceived ease of use by patients. Five HCPs perceived the fixed dose as a limitation.

## HF2013-001

In study HF2013-001, the SSEC was used per the intended label. Taping the SSEC to the subject's skin with non-allergenic tape was allowed. However, no taping was used during the study. All 30 subjects were able to initiate all 48 doses with the Study System. There were no errors or close-calls made by the subjects that could potentially lead to unsafe events. Overall, the subjects found the SSEC to be very easy to use and easy to initiate doses. Overall, the staff members thought that the system was easy to use. On average the staff members  responded  that  the  subjects  had  well  to  excellent  understanding  of  the  system  and  were  very successful using it. Thus, the user groups were able to use the SSEC safely and effectively, without exhibiting any use errors or close calls that would result in potential harm. There is no significant residual risk from the system that requires further modifications to the system design, user interface, or the instructions for use.

C-95-016The primary objective of this trial was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETS 40 μg versus ETS placebo in the management of the first 24 hours of post-operative pain. The proportion of patients who discontinued the study prematurely because of inadequate pain relief ≥ 3 hours after treatment inception (the  primary  endpoint)  was  significantly  less  for  ETS  40  μg  than  the  ETS  placebo treatment  group  (7.8% versus  40.9%,  respectively,  p  =  0.0001).  In  this  well  conducted  study  the  40µg  ETS  system  was  clearly superior  to  placebo.  Fewer  patients  discontinued,  pain  relief  was  better  and  less  rescue  medication  was required.

2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy The  efficacy  studies  included  in  this  application  are  the  same  as  in  an  earlier  application  from  the  same applicant for a similar product (with a different administration device), which was voluntarily recalled by the company in September 2008 due to observations of corrosion on the printed circuit board that could have potentially  resulted  in  overdose  due  to  self-initiation  (i.e.,  doses  delivered  without  dose  initiation  by  the patient). The efficacy for the new SSEC system is therefore established based on the data on the ETS system, previously approved in 2006. This approach is deemed acceptable as the differences in this new submission concern only the improved administration device and as the bioequivalence between the two systems has been shown satisfactorily. Thereby the main clinical studies have been previously assessed in the context of the previous application. The applicant has also provided a summary of the efficacy data from studies conducted post-authorisation. All  studies  with  efficacy  endpoints  were  terminated  prematurely,  and  consequently,  efficacy  data  was  not generally reported. Study FEN-HYD-PAI-4012 demonstrated that patients randomised to Ionsys had a greater ability to mobilise than those randomised to morphine patient controlled analgesia (PCA).  Other measures such  as  patient  global  assessment  mean  pain  ratings  at  24  and  48  hours,  as  well  as  the  median  time  to fitness for discharge, showed a trend in favour of Ionsys.

C-2000-008The objective of this trial was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETS 40 μg versus ETS placebo  in  the  management  of  the  first  24  hours  of  post-operative  pain.  Results  from  this  study demonstrated  the  superior  efficacy  of  ETS  40  μg  to  placebo  for  patient-controlled  analgesia  once  postoperative pain control was established. In evaluable patients, those who completed ≥ 3 hours of treatment, a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significantly  lower  proportion  of  patients  on  ETS  40  μg  (25.4%) discontinued  due  to inadequate  analgesia than patients on placebo (40.4%, p = 0.049). In this well conducted study the 40µg ETS system was clearly superior  to  placebo.  Fewer  patients  discontinued,  pain  relief  was  better  and  less  rescue  medication  was required.

C-2011-011The objective was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETS 40 μg with the safety and efficacy of  ETS  placebo  for  the  management  of  the  first  24  hours  of  post-operative  pain.  Results  from  this  study demonstrated the superior efficacy of ETS 40 μg to placebo for patient-controlled analgesia once immediate post-operative  pain  control  was  established.  In  evaluable  patients,  those  who  completed  ≥  3  hours  of treatment, evaluation of the primary endpoint showed a significantly lower proportion of patients on ETS 40 μg than on placebo (27.2% versus 56.9%), discontinued due to inadequate analgesia (p &lt; 0.0001). In this well conducted study the 40µg ETS system was clearly superior to placebo. Fewer patients discontinued, pain relief was better and less rescue medication was required.

Active Controlled Studies C-2000-007The objective was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETS 40 μg treatment with IV PCA morphine treatment for the management of post-operative pain. Results from this study demonstrated the therapeutic equivalence according to the prespecified criteria, based on the primary efficacy endpoint, of ETS 40  μg  to  a  standard  IV  PCA  morphine  regimen  for  patient-controlled  analgesia  once  post-operative  pain control was established. In evaluable patients, those who completed ≥ 3 hours of treatment, 74.8% using ETS 40 μg and 77.8% using the IV PCA morphine pump rated their assigned treatment as a good or excellent method of pain control after 24 hours of wear. The 95% confidence interval (CI) on the difference for the proportions  was  -9.7%,  3.7%.  In  this  well  conducted  study  the  40µg  ETS  system  was  comparable  to  IV morphine PCA. Discontinuation rates, pain relief and rescue medication use were all comparable. CAPSS-319The objective was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETS 40 μg treatment versus IV PCA morphine  treatment  for  the  management  of  post-operative  pain  in  patients  who  had  undergone  primary unilateral  total  hip  replacement.  Additional  objectives  were  to  assess  the  safety  of  ETS  40  μg  for  pain management in this surgical population and to compare the clinical utility of the ETS 40 μg system to the IV PCA device. This study demonstrated that ETS 40 μg provided efficacy similar to IV PCA morphine in the management  of  post-operative  pain  following  unilateral  hip  replacement  surgery  according  to  the  prespecified  equivalence  criteria.  Equivalence  between  groups  was  demonstrated  for  the  protocol  specified primary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  24  hour  patient  global  assessment  of  method  of  pain  control.  In  this  well conducted study the 40µg ETS system was comparable to IV morphine PCA. Discontinuation rates and pain relief were all comparable. However, there was a small but statistically significant imbalance in the rates of discontinuation  due  to  inadequate  analgesia  in  favour  of  the  active  control.  Patients  and  healthcare professionals all considered the ETS system easy to use and were more satisfied with it than IV morphine PCA. Medicinal product no longer authorised

CAPSS-320The objective was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETS 40 μg treatment versus IV PCA morphine treatment for the management of post-operative pain in patients who had undergone abdominal or pelvic  surgery.  Additional objectives  were  to  assess  the  safety of  ETS  40  μg  for  pain  management in  this surgical population and to compare the clinical utility of the ETS 40 μg system to the IV PCA morphine pump. This study demonstrated that ETS 40 μg provided efficacy similar to IV PCA morphine in the management of post-operative pain following non-emergent abdominal or pelvic surgery. Equivalence between groups was demonstrated for the protocol specified primary efficacy endpoint, the24-hour PGA of method of pain control and  for  the  mean  pain  intensity  at24  hours.  In  this  well  conducted  study  the  40µg  ETS  system  was comparable to IV morphine PCA. Discontinuation rates and pain relief were all comparable. However, there

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was a small but statistically significant imbalance in the rates of discontinuation due to inadequate analgesia in favour of the active control. Patients and healthcare professionals all considered the ETS system easy to use and were more satisfied with it than IV morphine PCA.

FEN-PPA-401The objective was to evaluate the clinical use of ETS 40 μg treatment and IV PCA treatment for the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain in patients who had undergone an elective major abdominal or orthopaedic surgical procedure. Additional objectives were to assess pain control in both treatment groups, to compare the safety of ETS 40 μg versus IV PCA morphine, to explore the impact of care procedures of the ETS 40 μg system and the IV PCA morphine device, and to compare technical issues with both  systems.  This  randomised,  open-label,  active-controlled  trial  demonstrated  that  as  a  method  of  pain control  as  assessed  by  PGA,  ETS  40  μg  was  non-inferior  to  IV  morphine  PCA,  administered  in  a  fashion reflective  of  clinical  practice.  In  this  well  conducted  study  the  40µg  ETS  system  was  comparable  to  IV morphine  PCA.  Discontinuation rates and  pain relief were  all comparable.  Patients and  healthcare professionals all considered the ETS system easy to use and were more satisfied with it than IV morphine PCA. Of note, mobility was much better on the ETS system when compared to a traditional PCA.

Uncontrolled Studies C-93-023This study was conducted in two parts. Part 1: 25 μg on-demand dosing regimen: To determine if up to six 25 μg fentanyl on -demand doses per hour for 24 hours administered by the patient provided safe and effective management of post-operative pain. Part 2: 40 μg on-demand dosing regimen: To determine if up to six 40 μg fentanyl on -demand doses per hour for 24 hours administered by the patient provided safe and effective management of post-operative pain. Pain intensity scores showed that both the 25 μg and 40 μg on-demand dosing regimens were effective in managing post-operative pain. No patient withdrew from treatment with either regimen due to inadequate pain control. However, patients who received the 25 μg regimen required larger numbers of on-demand doses and substantial supplementation with IV fentanyl to attain  adequate  pain  control.  The  40  μg  regimen  provided  better  efficacy  than  did  the  25  μg  regimen  as indicated by lower pain intensity scores, a lower average number of on-demand doses delivered over the 24hour  treatment  period,  substantially  less  requirement  for  supplemental  analgesia,  a  higher  proportion  of patients  rating  the  quality  of  analgesia  as  good  or  excellent,  and  a  higher  percentage  of  patient  and investigator global assessment ratings of good or excellent. C-94-043The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  if  the  prescribed  regimen  of  up  to  six  40 μ g fentanyl  on-demand  doses  per  hour  administered  by  the  patient  from  the  ETS  system  provides  safe  and effective  management  of  post-operative  pain  on  Days  2  and  3  after  surgery.  On  Day  2  after  surgery, investigator  and  patient  global  assessments  indicated  that  ETS  provided  'good'  to  'excellent'  analgesia  for 97%-98% of patients. On Day 3, global assessments indicated 'good' to 'excellent' pain relief in 99%- 100% of patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

C-95-019The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and clinical utility (efficacy) of ETS 40 μg for  the  management of post-operative pain following short-stay surgical procedures, during both the time after surgery when the patient remained in the hospital and for an additional 24-hour period after the patient was discharged from the hospital to a medically supervised setting. During the hospital stay, 94% of patients and 96% of physicians reported that ETS provided good or excellent analgesia. During the 24 hours in the medically supervised setting, 100% of patient and physician global assessments were \"good\" or \"excellent.\"

## Adhesion and Usability

## AD2011-001

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adequate adhesion using the SSEC was demonstrated in AD2011-001. The SSEC exhibited good adherence at the 2 application sites, upper outer arm and chest, over the 24-hour wearing period.

## HF2011-002

In study HF2011-002, 29 of 30 patients were able to successfully self-administer a simulated treatment using the SSEC placebo system on the first attempt.

## HF2012-001

In  study  HF2012-001  participants  were  able  to  assemble  IONSYS  usually  in  less  than  one  minute.  After assembling and applying the SSEC system to a mannequin, participants were able to correctly determine all operational states (ready state, dosing state, end of use) and comprehend system feedback (light, beeps, display).

Overall, the efficacy of the original ETS system has been proven by the studies presented and this was also confirmed  during  its  approval  via  the  centralised  route  in  2006.  Post-authorisation  studies  with  efficacy endpoints  were  terminated  early  and  provide  little  additional  efficacy  data.  The  bioequivalence  shown between the  ETS  and  SSEC  system  allows  for  these  studies  to  be  used  in  the  new  application.  The  data shows efficacy as good as morphine IV PCA but with improvements in patient and healthcare professional acceptance, ease of use and also mobility. The SSEC studies looking at adhesion and utility confirm that the system is suitable for 24 hour application and is easily understood by patients and healthcare professionals alike.

HF2013-001 In study HF2013-001 all 30 subjects were able to initiate all 48 doses with the Study System. There were no errors or close-calls made by the subjects that could potentially lead to unsafe events. 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy The  presented  studies  show  that  the  ETS  system  had  good  efficacy  when  compared  to  placebo,  active comparator  (Morphine  IV  PCA)  and  in  the  uncontrolled  studies.  Pain  relief  as  judged  by  the  patients  and investigators was good, both in VAS measurements and global scales. Rescue medication use was good for the  ETS  system  and  patient  satisfaction  and  mobilisation  was  generally  improved.  The  studies  show  that efficacy is at least as good as morphine PCA and has better user satisfaction and mobilisation than with a traditional IV PCA. Adequate adhesion using the SSEC was demonstrated in AD2011-001, confirming that the device should stay in place in a clinical setting. In study HF2011-002, 29 of 30 patients were able to successfully self-administer a  simulated  treatment  using  the  SSEC  placebo  system  on  the  first  attempt,  showing  that  patients  in  a representative population found the system easy to use without any safety concerns. In study HF2012-001 it was demonstrated that healthcare professionals found the device easy to assemble, apply and could interpret all of the signals from the device correctly, showing that the device can be safety administered and used by healthcare professionals. In study HF2013-001 all healthy volunteers found the system easy to understand and use, again further reassuring safe use. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.6. Clinical safety

No  new  clinical  safety  studies  have  been  conducted  as  part  of  this  application.  However,  the  applicant provided the studies conducted as part of the original development programme conducted for the original ETS system that was approved via the centralised route in 2006, but subsequently not renewed.

## Patient exposure

Over 2,800 subjects have been exposed to a 40µg system in controlled trials and over 10,000 units of patient exposure post approval were also recorded.

Since submission of the MAA for the previous ETS system, the clinical safety database has been extended by 3  additional  active-controlled,  multicentre  studies  that  were  conducted  with  the  ETS (which  included  an additional 972 patients who used ETS 40 μg), marketed use of IONSYS, and subsequent studies of the ETSS and SSEC. This application provides a safety database more than twice the size of the original submission . The studies in the MAA for the previous ETS system plus the 3 additional active-controlled studies comprise Group 1. This group includes 7 controlled studies, 7 uncontrolled studies, 6 stopped studies (discontinued because of technical faults and not for safety reasons), 10 pharmacokinetic studies, 5 clinical pharmacology studies, 5 wearing studies and 1 dose-finding study. A total of 3980 subjects in Group 1 were exposed to ETS systems; of these subjects, 2336 used ETS 40 μg. The key safety data described in this overview is from the pooled analysis of the 7 controlled studies as they permit comparison against incidence rates from placebo and morphine use. These studies included 1763 patients treated with ETS 40 μg. Safety results for the other studies in Group 1 were consistent with those seen in the controlled studies. Treatment lasted up to 24 hours in the placebo-controlled studies and up to 72 hours in the active-controlled (IV  morphine  PCA)  studies.  Overall,  539  (30.6%)  patients  using  ETS  40  μg  in  the  controlled  studies completed the allowable number of hours on study. Adverse events The overall adverse event profile of the systems is as expected for an opioid used in post-operative pain. No untoward adverse event patterns are seen. When compared to IV morphine PCA, the adverse event profile is similar, if not better for the systems. Of particular benefit is the lower rate of adverse events that could be specifically described as opioid associated. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Medicinal product no longer authorised

The serious adverse event profile is as expected for fentanyl. The events judged to be related to the study medication are of the type that would be expected with an opioid. Of note the rates are no different to that of the morphine IV PCA.

No deaths occurred with ETS/ETSS/SSEC 40 μg treatment while on study in any of the Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3 studies. As already reported in the MAA for the previous ETS system, 3 deaths occurred after study termination in patients who received ETS 40 μg treatment in a Group 1 clinical trial, all judged not related to study medication by investigators.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Laboratory findings

Per protocol, clinical laboratory parameters were not assessed in the controlled, uncontrolled, and stopped studies in Group 1.

Scheduled laboratory assessments were performed in Group 2 (C-2004-016) and Group 3 (C-2006-036, FENPAI-1017) studies.

In study C-2004-016, clinical laboratory evaluations generally were within normal limits for subjects before the start of the study, and the Investigator did not consider any of the isolated instances of abnormal values to  be  clinically  significant.  No  notable  changes  in  the  mean  values  were  observed  at  the  end  of  study assessment compared with baseline.

In  study  C-2006-036, there were no consistent treatment-related changes from baseline in the laboratory parameters.  There  were  minor  changes  in  ALT,  alkaline  phosphatase,  bilirubin,  blood  urea  nitrogen,  and creatine kinase. These changes were not considered clinically significant and were not reported as AEs. In study FEN-PAI-1017, there were no consistent treatment-related changes from baseline in the laboratory parameters. One subject (No. 9013), who had abnormal values at screening, was reported with elevated ALT (82 U/L) and AST levels (40 U/L) during Sequence 1, Period 2 (Day -1). The subject was withdrawn from the study for this reason. The  applicant  has  also  referred  to  the  product  information  of  Durogesic®  (transdermal  fentanyl)  and Sublimaze®  (injectable  fentanyl).  No  laboratory-related  adverse  reactions  are  listed  for  either  product. Furthermore, a review of the literature did not reveal any clinical laboratory concerns. Safety in special populations No overall differences were observed in the safety of ETS 40 μ g between elderly patients (65 to 74, 75 to 84 and  &gt;  85  years)  and  adult  patients  (&lt;  65  years)  within  the  clinical  safety  database.  The  rate  of  AEs suggestive of CNS or respiratory depression appears to increase with age. At least one AE suggestive of CNS or respiratory depression was reported in 3.7 % of non-elderly patients, in 7.1 % of patients 65 -74 years, in 10.1 % of patients 75 -84 years, and in 18.8 % of patients ≥ 85 years of age.  This kind of AE profile is as would  be  expected  for  this  population  using  this  kind  of  medicinal  product.  The  contraindications  and warnings  included  in  the  proposed  SmPC  are  considered  adequate  to  address  the  risk  of  respiratory depression in the elderly. Confusion is included as an uncommon adverse reaction in Section 4.8. Different dosage instructions for the elderly patients are not considered necessary. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immunological events

No significant events or pattern of events was seen.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The postoperative use of potentially sedating medications and CYP3A4 inhibitors of fentanyl metabolism was common in the controlled studies. The incidences of nausea and hypoxia appear to differ in patients who used

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rescue  medication  compared  with  those  who  did  not  use  rescue  medication.  The  incidence  of  nausea appeared higher in the IV PCA group, lower in the ETS placebo group, and similar in the ETS 40 μg group for patients  who  used  rescue  medication  compared  with  those  who  did  not.  Hypoxia  was  more  frequently reported in those who used rescue medication compared with those who did not in both active treatment groups.

The CHMP requested the applicant to provide an analysis of adverse events according to concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitor. For the E-TRANS fentanyl group, the incidence of common AEs such as nausea and vomiting were comparable between the sub-group taking CYP3A4 inhibitors and the sub-group not taking CYP3A4 inhibitors. No additional safety signals were raised for concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors. Appropriate warnings regarding concomitant use of IONSYS and potent or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors were included in Section 4.5 of the SmPC.

A similar analysis of adverse events by potentially sedating medication was also provided. The incidence of hypoxia  was  marginally  increased  with  concomitant  potentially  sedating  medication  in  both  the  ETS  and morphine treatment groups, as identified by the applicant. Of note, an increased incidence of pruritis was also associated with concomitant potentially sedating medication in the ETS and morphine groups. However this was considered to be potentially due to the treatment of pruritis with sedating antihistamines. Discontinuation due to adverse events Group 1 studies: Less than 5% of patients in the controlled studies discontinued treatment with ETS 40 μg because of an AE: (77/1763 [4.4%] overall). A similar proportion of patients discontinued for AEs in the IV PCA  morphine  (86/1313  [6.5%])  and  placebo  treatment  groups  (7/316  [2.2%]).  The  most  frequently occurring  AEs  (in ≥ 5  patients)  resulting  in  study  termination  were  nausea  (1.2%);  pruritus  (0.5%);  and headache and confusional state (0.3% each) with ETS 40 μg, and nausea (1.7%); somnolence and pruritus (0.6% each); hypoventilation, vomiting, and dizziness (0.5% each); and hypotension (0.4%) with IV PCA morphine. 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety The  clinical  safety  studies  included  in  the  application  have  been  conducted  as  part  of  the  original development programme for the original ETS system that was approved in 2006. This approach is deemed acceptable as the differences in this new submission lie in the improved administration device and as the applicant  has  demonstrated  bioequivalence  between  the  original  ETS  system  and  the  new  SSEC  system. Therefore the CHMP has considered that the safety profile as shown for the previous product with ETS system can be inferred on the new system subject of this application. Medicinal product no longer authorised

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

The overall adverse event profile of the systems is as expected for an opioid used in post-operative pain. No untoward adverse event patterns are seen. When compared to IV morphine PCA, the adverse event profile is similar, if not better for the systems. Of particular benefit is the lower rate of adverse events that could be specifically described as opioid associated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The serious adverse event profile is as expected for fentanyl. The events judged to be related to the study medication are of the type that would be expected with an opioid. Of note the rates are no different to that of the morphine IV PCA.

No deaths were reported whilst on any of the systems. Those that occurred after are not attributed to study medication. This judgement is accepted as the events are not specifically linked to fentanyl but either the surgery or underlying medical conditions.

No overall differences were observed in the safety of ETS 40 μg between elderly patients and adult patients within the clinical safety database. The rates of AEs suggestive of CNS or respiratory depression appear to increase with age, and are adequately covered in the proposed SmPC.

The applicant has adequately summarised the interaction with rescue medication and sedating medication. The  applicant  has  also  provided  an  analysis  of  adverse  events  according  to  concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4 inducer or inhibitor. Spontaneous report data provided in the  J&amp;J  PSUR  submissions  further  characterised  local  tolerability.  No untoward pattern of events was seen in the reported data. When reviewed at CHMP, adverse events were recognised and the company added those to the SmPC. These were considered to be all local reactions to the system rather than concerning systemic events. 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety Overall, the safety profile of Ionsys is as expected for fentanyl used in post-operative pain. The large safety database of over 3800 subjects exposed to a 40µg system, as well as the post marketing experience of over 10,000 units sold provides adequate safety information for this application. The adverse events are related to the opioid activity of fentanyl and to the nature of the system itself in the application site events reported. Nothing untoward is seen when compared to morphine in a PCA and the events reported are similar to those seen with fentanyl in general. Considering that Ionsys is a novel PCA device and closer monitoring of this medicinal product in the initial stages of the post-marketing period is desired, t he MAH shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 months following authorisation . Therefore the safety profile of fentanyl and the system is accepted. 2.7. Risk Management Plan Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## 2.9. Significance of paediatric studies

Medicinal product no longer authorised

This MAA is intended to support the use of IONSYS in adult patients only. Planned clinical studies, as agreed with the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO), will evaluate safety of the SSEC to support dosing of paediatric patients. PIP no P/0111/2014.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.10. Product information

## 2.10.1. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

Overall, for each question, at least 90% of the participants were able to locate the requested information, of which at least 90% were able to understand the information.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits Beneficial effects

<!-- image -->

The applicant has shown bioequivalence between the new SSEC system and old ETS system. This allows for the efficacy profile of the original ETS system to be applied to the SSEC. The data for the ETS system is comprehensive and shows efficacy in post-operative pain relief when compared to placebo and IV morphine PCA. The system has also demonstrated ease of use from both a patient and healthcare professional standpoint and mobility is improved when compared to a traditional IV morphine PCA.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

The efficacy in the elderly, which is especially important as it would be expected to see high use in this age group was deemed not sufficiently discussed by the applicant. This was considered as resolved during the course of the procedure as a summary of data, including efficacy results from the studies that were conducted post authorisation, was provided and discussed satisfactorily by the applicant.

## Risks

Unfavourable effects

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The safety profile of Ionsys is as expected for fentanyl used in post-operative pain. The large safety database of over 3800 subjects exposed to a 40µg system, as well as the post marketing experience of over 10,000 units sold provides adequate safety information for this application. The applicant has demonstrated bioequivalence between the original ETS system and the new SSEC system (see pharmacokinetics section above) and therefore the safety profile from that application can be inferred on this new system.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

During the procedure a number of issues within the safety database were pointed out and further clarification was requested.  Namely, the applicant presented the overall SAE rates tabulated and discussed the results shown in a satisfactory way. The applicant also further discussed possible lab findings in the context of fentanyl treatment and looked at the potential interactions discussed in the PK and PD sections. Therefore these uncertainties were considered as resolved.

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The favourable effects are shown in this application. The efficacy is similar to the established treatment for post-operative pain- IV morphine PCA. However, patient and healthcare professionals rated acceptability and usability greater than that of the IV PCA and the Ionsys system also showed superior ratings of mobility, which is important in the recovery of the patient. The unfavourable effects, being the adverse event profile has been shown to be similar to the established treatment for post-operative pain- IV morphine PCA. Benefit-risk balance Discussion on the benefit-risk balance Given that bioequivalence has been shown between the original ETS system and the SSEC system, the efficacy and safety profile of the ETS system (approved via the centralised route in 2006) can be used for the SSEC system in this application. The efficacy seen with the system is similar to IV morphine PCA but with usability and acceptance by both patients and healthcare professionals. Of note, mobility was also improved with the ETS system. The adverse event profile is similar to IV morphine PCA and no unexpected events were seen. However, considering that Ionsys is a novel PCA device and closer monitoring of this medicinal product in the initial stages of the post-marketing period is desired, the MAH shall submit the first PSUR for this product within 6 months following authorisation. In addition, educational materials for healthcare professionals are required in order to ensure the adequate use of the product and minimise the risks of medication errors (including accidental exposure), Device malfunction/failure, Product Disposal and Misuse/abuse/diversion/addiction and dependence. The healthcare provider programme also provides more detailed information about the administration device, please see the details in section additional risk minimisation measures in part 4 below. Therefore, given the good efficacy and the potential benefit to patients of a non IV PCA system and the good adverse event profile, the benefit-risk assessment of this application is positive.
