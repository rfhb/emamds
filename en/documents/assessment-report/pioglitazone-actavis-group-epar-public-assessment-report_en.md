## 1.  Background information on the procedure

## 1.1 Submission of the dossier

The applicant Actavis Group PTC ehf  submitted on  1 June 2011 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Pioglitazone Actavis Group, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004- 'Generic of a Centrally authorised product'. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 May 2011.

After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained (see section 4.4).

The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC and refers to a reference product for which a Marketing Authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The applicant applied for the following indication: Pioglitazone  is  indicated  as  second  or  third  line  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  as  described below: as monotherapy  in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance, as dual oral therapy in combination with  metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin,  a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea, as triple oral therapy in combination with  metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Three strengths have been developed; 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg tablets. The reference medicinal product Actos has been centrally authorized on 13 October 2000 and is also available as 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg tablets. In addition to the presentations authorised for Actos, the applicant has added the 100 pack size. The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione compound that acts as a peroxisome proliferator activating receptor (PPAR)γ agonist with potential benefits on insulin resistance. Pioglitazone has a different mechanism of action compared to other drugs. It does not stimulate insulin secretion (unlike sulphonylureas), and it does not inhibit glucose absorption (unlike alpha -glucosidase inhibitors). It depends on the presence of insulin for activity.

The safety and efficacy profile of pioglitazone has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of which can be found in the EPAR for Actos. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

application referring to the reference medicinal product Actos, summary of the clinical data of pioglitazone hydrochloride is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted.

The approved indication for Pioglitazone Actavis Group is the same as the reference medicinal product Actos:

'Pioglitazone  is  indicated  as  second  or  third  line  treatment  of  type 2  diabetes  mellitus  as  described below:

## as monotherapy

-in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance, as dual oral therapy in combination with -metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin, -a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea, as triple oral therapy in combination with -metformin  and  a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained. During the evaluation of this marketing authorisation application, the applicant was asked to change the proposed invented name of this medicinal product. The proposed name Ogliton could be confused with Taliton, leading to potential safety issues. Therefore, the name was changed from Ogliton to Pioglitazone Actavis Group. 2.2 Quality aspects Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 2.2.1 Introduction

Pioglitazone Actavis Group is presented as tablets containing pioglitazone hydrochloride as active substance. Three strengths have been developed: 15, 30 and 45 mg. All strengths have the same proportional composition and bear sufficient features to differentiate. For a full list of excipients refer to the SmPC. The tablets are packaged into Alu/Alu blisters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.2 Active  Substance

Pioglitazone (INN) is an established active substance of chemical origin. Its chemical name is ( ± )-5[[4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-] thiazolidinedione monohydrochloride. The molecular formula is C19H20N2O3S.HCl, Mol.Wt. 392.90 g/mol.

The chemical structure of the molecule has been established by spectral (UV, IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectra) elemental and thermal (DSC) analyses.

Currently pioglitazone hydrochloride is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or pharmacopoeia of a Member State. However, a draft monograph has been published in PharmEuropa Vol. 22, No. 4.

The active substance specification is generally adequate to control the quality of the active substance. It includes tests for appearance, assay (HPLC), identification (IR, HPLC), identification of chlorides (Ph. Eur.), solubility (Ph. Eur.), related substances including potential genotoxic impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), residual reagents (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), ionic chloride (potentiometric titration), polymorphism (Ph. Eur., XRD) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction).

Full information about the active substance has been provided by the active substance supplier and the finished product manufacturer in the Module 3. Acceptable QP declarations confirming the active substance is manufactured in compliance with GMP have been provided in annex 5.22 of Module 1. Pioglitazone  hydrochloride  appears  as  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder  which  is  practically insoluble in water. Solubility is highly pH dependent. Pioglitazone hydrochloride exhibits stereoisomerism and the active substance is a racemic compound. Pioglitazone hydrochloride exists at least in two different crystal forms, referred to as polymorph I and polymorph II. Batch analysis data confirm that polymorph I is routinely produced by the synthetic process defined by both active substance suppliers, and it is used in the manufacture of the finished product. Manufacture At the time of the CHMP opinion pioglitazone hydrochloride is supplied by two manufacturers. Both manufacturers have provided an Active Substance Master File (ASMF). The active substance is synthesised in several steps using commercially available starting materials.  The process is adequately described and satisfactory specifications have been set for the starting materials, reagents and solvents used in the process. All critical in-process controls parameters are well established and justified. All relevant impurities (including potentially genotoxic impurities), degradation products and residual solvents have been investigated and appropriately characterized.  A number of genotoxic impurities have been identified and data have been provided to confirm that they are either not present in the active substance or they are appropriately controlled in an intermediate or the active substance itself. A justification of the limits applied has been provided. Specification Medicinal Product no longer authorised

All active substance specifications are considered adequately justified and the non-compendial analytical procedures have been satisfactorily described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Batch analysis data from three consecutive production scale batches from each active substance manufacturer have been provided. The results confirm batch-to-batch consistency and compliance with the proposed specifications.

## Stability

Data from stability studies on three production scale batches from each active substance manufacturer have been provided. Samples were stored  for up to 24 or 48 months under long term conditions (25°C/60% RH) and 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) in accordance with ICH requirements.   All batches have been tested for conformance with the specifications using stability indicating analytical methods.  The specifications tested were description, identification (IR), polymorphism (XRD), water content, related substances and assay (HPLC). In all cases the batch analysis data met the predefined specifications and no significant changes were observed.

In-vitro dissolution comparisons between the test and reference products have been provided. The reference product was sourced from the UK market. The test and reference products were observed to behave similarly for all strengths tested in all media. In media at pH 1.2 &gt;85% was released in 15 minutes for test and reference at all strengths. At pH 4.5 and 6.8 release is much slower and incomplete. The reduced dissolution at pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 is expected as pioglitazone hydrochloride is known to be insoluble at these pHs.

In addition stability data have been provided under stress conditions (heat, acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, photo degradation, water hydrolysis and hydrogen peroxide treatment). The stability data provided by both API manufacturers support the proposed re-test periods at the proposed packaging and storage conditions. 2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product Pharmaceutical Development The aim of the initial development was to formulate a tablet similar to the reference product.  Flow properties of the active and excipients, were considered for the selection of a suitable manufacturing method. The effect of binder concentration, water content and resistance to crushing were investigated and the final formulation was chosen. Pioglitazone hydrochloride is practically insoluble in water. It is classified as a class II (low solubility, high permeability) drug in the biopharmaceutics classification system. As a result of the low solubility a specification for particle size was set by the drug product manufacturer. Both suppliers have confirmed that they consistently manufacture the same polymorphic form. It has further been demonstrated that no change in the polymorphic form occurs during manufacture and storage. The choice of excipients was based on the qualitative composition of the reference product. The excipients used are well known and widely used within the pharmaceutical industry.  Compatibility of the active substance with the excipients has been demonstrated on stability. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Similarity factors have not been provided in line with the Guideline on the investigation on bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1). However it can be concluded that, given the known insolubility of the active at pH 4.5 and 6.8, and the similarity of the dissolution profiles of the test and reference products at those pH's, it is evident that the reduction in solubility observed at pH 4.5 and 6.8 is as a result of the intrinsic solubility issues with the active substance and is not related to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

formulation and no further information is requested in relation to the proposed biowaiver from the quality point of view.

Only one bioequivalence study was performed on the 30mg strength.  During the procedure, data on a second bioequivalence study with 45 mg tablets were provided; for further details see the clinical section of the AR. It is agreed that that bioequivalence studies are not required on the other strength since all of the conditions listed in section 4.6.1 of Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) are considered fulfilled. Refer also to the clinical AR for discussion on the acceptability of the biowaiver.\"

The impurity profiles of the 15mg, 30mg and 45mg test tablets were also compared with one batch of Actos 30mg tablets. All results complied with the proposed release specification limits. The manufacturing process is a conventional wet granulation process. Adventitious agents Lactose monohydrate is the only excipient that is derived from animals. As per the supplier statement it complies with the note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy (EMEA/410/rev 2). Manufacture of the product The manufacturing process is simple and consists of five steps. The information provided on in-process controls and process validation is acceptable. The proposed holding times have been defined and data have been provided to support them. Process validation has been successfully carried out on six pilot scale batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturer on two batches for each strength using active substance from one of the proposed suppliers.  Results show the product can be consistently manufactured. A process validation scheme for the production scale batches has been provided and agreed. Product Specification The drug product release and shelf life specifications include tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC-DAD), friability (Ph. Eur.), resistance to crushing (Ph. Eur.), Uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.- mass variation), average tablet mass (weighing), dissolution (UV, Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). Batch analysis data have been provided on four pilot scale batches of each strength. The active substance used in these batches was supplied both proposed suppliers. All of the results comply with the release specifications. Certificates of analysis for these batches have also been provided. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Stability of the product

Stability studies were undertaken on two pilot scale batches of each strength manufactured using active substance from one of the suppliers stored at 25±2°C/60±5% RH for up to 36 months and at 40±2°C/75±5% RH for six months. Results from two smaller scale batches for the 15mg and 45mg strengths one of each strength using active substance manufactured by the second supplier were also provided as supportive data. All batches were manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the container closure system was as that to be marketed. The testing conditions and intervals were according to ICH Q1A (R2).

In addition, two pilot scale batches from each strength using active substance manufactured from the second supplier (including the second biobatch) have been placed on stability. Only 3 months data have become available, but are in line with previous batches.

All results at both 25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH are within specification and no trends were observed. The results do however comply with the specifications and are acceptable for product manufactured with active substance from both manufacturers.

On the basis of the stability results provided the proposed shelf life and storage conditions are acceptable. 2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 2.3 Non- Clinical aspects A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product, Actos, which has been authorised for 10 years. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.1 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment An environmental risk assessment has been conducted. The ERA is dated March 2009 and concludes that since this is a generic product there will be no increase in environmental exposure to Pioglitazone hydrochloride following marketing authorisation. This was accepted by the CHMP. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## 2.4.1 Introduction

This  is  an  application  for  tablets  containing  pioglitazone  hydrochloride.    To  support  the  marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with cross-over design under

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

fasting  conditions  comparing  30  mg  tablets.  Since  this  dose  was  not  fully  justified,  the  applicant, during the procedure, provided data of a second bioequivalence study with 45 mg tablets as additional evidence to support the first study.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Exemption If the generic medicinal product has the same manufacturer, same qualitative composition, same ratio between active substance and excipients, comparable in vitro dissolution profile as the reference product, these aspects could be used to justify an exemption from the requirement to perform bioequivalence studies. However, for the (first) bioequivalence study, the applicant chose the dose of 30 mg and no clear justification was provided. The relevant guidance on Investigation of Bioequivalence states that with product with linear pharmacokinetics, the study should in general be conducted at the highest strength. To address the issue of testing with the highest dose the applicant therefore commissioned a new study using 45 mg as the dose. Clinical studies A bioequivalence study with 30 mg tablets has been submitted initially and a second study with 45 mg tablets has been submitted during the procedure. 2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics Methods Study design The initially submitted study was a randomised, open label, two treatment, two period, two sequence, single dose, crossover, bioequivalence study of Pioglitazone 30 mg tablets of Actavis Group hf, Iceland and Actos (Pioglitazone) 30 mg tablets of Takeda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited, London, UK, in healthy adult subjects of either sex, under fasting conditions. The study was performed at Lotus Labs Pvt, Mylapore, Chennai, India, in 2006. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

After an overnight fast (i.e. at least 10 hours of fasting), subjects were given the test or the reference product with 240 ml of water. Water was not permitted 1 hour before dosing and until 2 hours postdosing. The subjects were served a first meal (lunch) at t=4 h. in both periods.

Blood samples were collected at t= 0h and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-dose.

There was a washout period of 14 days between dosing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Test and reference products

The  test  product  was  Pioglitazone  30  mg  tablets  (Actavis  Ltd.,  Malta);  Batch  No.:  S09390.  The reference product was Actos 30 mg tablets (Takeda Ireland Ltd.); Batch No.: 9230021A.

## Population(s) studied

Thirtyeight adults subjects of either sex and 33 completed the study.

The log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax) were analyzed using the ANOVA model. The ratio of the Test and Reference product averages (Least Square Means) was estimated for the differences in the Least Square Means (LSM) of the log-transformed data then taking the anti-log of the estimates.  The 90% Confidence Interval for the ratio of the Test and Reference was estimated using the difference of least square mean between test and reference (estimate), the't' value at Mean Square Error Degrees of Freedom (df) and the Standard Error of Estimate.  The Standard Error of Estimate was calculated using the Mean Square Error and the number of reference subjects from the GLM - ANOVA Model. The number of subjects to be included was calculated to be 34 if the difference between test and reference is 5%. Taking into account possible dropouts, 38 subjects were considered for this study. The statistical considerations were considered as adequate by CHMP.

Healthy adult subjects of either sex between 18-55 years of age (inclusive), with a body mass index (BMI)  between  18.5  and  24.9  kg/m2;  subjects  who  have  no  evidence  of  underlying  disease  during screening medical history and physical examination and screening laboratory values. 5 subjects dropped out of the study: The reasons for the drop out were for 3 subject withdrawals of their consent; for 1 subject non-compliance, and for 1 subject a lower respiratory infection. Analytical methods The plasma product concentrations were determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of pioglitazone, hydroxy pioglitazone and keto pioglitazone in human EDTA K3 plasma over the range 10.06 to 2012.80 ng/ml for pioglitazone, 10.08 to 1008.20 ng/ml for hydroxypioglitazone and 2.00 to 400.00 ng/ml for ketopioglitazone. Pharmacokinetic Variables The following parameters were calculated: 1. AUC0-t using the linear trapezoidal rule 2. AUC0- by adding the quantity Clast /Kel to AUC0-t . 3.   C max Statistical methods The following summary statistics for the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for both the test product (A) and reference product (B): number of subjects, arithmetic mean (mean), standard deviation (S.D.), minimum, maximum, median and percentage coefficient of variation (CV%). Additionally, geometric means (GM) were estimated for AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall conduct of the bioequivalence study was acceptable. Patients were fasted overnight and received a single oral dose of 1 tablet containing 30mg of pioglitazone, with 240 mL of water.

This study suggests that the requirements for claiming bioequivalence of the described testformulation are fulfilled: for all key pharmacokinetic parameters listed in the relevant guidelines, the 90% CI of all ratio's are within the 80% - 125% range. Safety data A total of 12 adverse events were reported during the course of the study.  Two AEs were related to study products and were mild to moderate in intensity. Ten AEs were unrelated to study products out of which 05 were moderate and 05 mild in intensity. All the adverse events resolved completely without any sequelae. 1 subject experienced sweating with the test product and one subject experienced symptoms of hypoglycaemia also with the test product (moderate and resolved). There were no reports of hypoglycaemia with the reference. Glucose solution was administered to both subjects as 60ml 20% glucose. The CHMP did furhter question these cases and it was clarified by the applicant that there was no documented hypoglycaemic event and patients were treated rather on symptoms of hypoglycaemia.

Two open-label, single-dose, randomized, crossover bioequivalence studies were carried out to compare 30 mg tablets and 45 mg tablets, respectively. Overall, the design of the trial and the analytical methods used were adequate. Protocol violations were considered to be minor. The ratios and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (test versus reference) for AUCt, AUC ∞ and Cmax were successsfully used to demonstrate bioequivalence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.7 Conclusions on clinical aspects

Bioequivalence between Pioglitazone Actavis Group and Actos has been demonstrated as the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the test to reference product were found to lie within the prespecified range both for the 30 mg tablets and the 45 mg tablets.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The applicant did not submit a risk management plan because this application concerns a generic for a reference medicinal product for which no safety concern requiring additional risk minimisation activities had been identified when the Marketing Authorisation application was submitted. However taking into account the outcome of the Article 20 procedure on already authorised pioglitazone containing products and the potential increased risk of bladder cancer, the MAH shall submit within one month of the Commission Decision a risk management plan which will incorporate risk minimisation measures, as detailed in  the conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product in Annex II, in line with those required for the reference medicinal product. The MAH shall perform the Pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, to be agreed in the Risk Management Plan to be submitted and any consequent updates to the RMP agreed by the CHMP. As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal product for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next PSUR. In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: -When  new  information is received that may  impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities. - Within 60 days of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. - At the request of the European Medicines Agency. PSUR cycle The PSUR cycle for the product will follow the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product, which is on a 6 monthly cycle, having 1 February 2012 as its data lock point. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 2.6 User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3 Benefit-Risk Balance

This application concerns a generic version of Actos tablets. The reference product Actos is indicated for treatment of Type 2 diabetes.

'as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described below:

## as monotherapy

-  in  adult  patients  (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance, as dual oral therapy in combination with -  metformin,  in  adult  patients  (particularly  overweight  patients)  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin, - a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated,  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  monotherapy with a sulphonylurea, as triple oral therapy in combination with - metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. - Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained.' No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with an open-label, single-dose, randomized, crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical methods were validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The test formulation of Pioglitazone Actavis Group met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence Medicinal Product no longer authorised when compared with Actos. The results of the two bioequivalence studies suggested that the requirements for claiming bioequivalence of the described test-formulation are fulfilled: for all key pharmacokinetic parameters listed in the relevant guidelines, the 90% CI of all ratio's are within the 80% - 125% range.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, the available data on the chosen reference medicinal product and the outcome of the Article 20 procedure on the already authorised pioglitazone containing products and the potential increased risk of bladder cancer, is of the opinion that additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information as per the conditions of the Marketing Authorisation included in Annex II.

## 4 Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy and taking into account the opinions adopted by the CHMP on 21 July 2011 and 20 October 2011 in the framework of the procedures under Article 20 of Regulation 726/2004 for pioglitazone containing medicinal products and the subsequent Commission Decision, the CHMP considers by majority that the risk-benefit balance of Pioglitazone Actavis Group is favourable as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described below: as monotherapy  in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance as dual oral therapy in combination with  metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin  a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea. as triple oral therapy in combination with  metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Pioglitazone Actavis group (EMEA/H/C/2558)

## Divergent statement

We have a divergent opinion on the above mentioned Marketing Authorisation from that which has been adopted by the CHMP during its January 2012 session:

We consider that the benefit-risk balance of pioglitazone has become negative given the increased risk of bladder cancer in addition to the other well known adverse effects (especially heart failure and bone fracture in post menopausal women) of this medicine, its questionable long term benefit in terms of cardiovascular protection and the available alternative treatments in type 2 diabetic patients.

<!-- image -->

1. Pre-clinical data indicate an increased frequency of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone in male rats. Results of the PROactive trial show a significantly higher number of bladder cancer in patients treated with pioglitazone. Data provided by three epidemiologic studies (US, France and UK) provide very similar evidence of an increased risk of bladder cancer, even though the magnitude of such risk is low with a hazard ratio around 1.2, however, likely increasing with cumulative dose and duration of pioglitazone exposure. 2. This increased risk of bladder cancer includes invasive types of bladder cancer with major adverse impact on morbidity and mortality. No biomarker of bladder cancer is available which could provide effective screening and early treatment. Symptoms such as haematuria can occur late after the onset of tumour development and are not specific. Cystoscopy appears to be the only investigational procedure able to adequately establish the diagnosis of bladder cancer but its invasive nature precludes is use for systematic cancer screening. It appears impossible to define a subpopulation of diabetic patients where the benefits of pioglitazone would outweigh its risks. In addition, according to PROactive long term follow up and utilisation studies, a large proportion of patients stop pioglitazone treatment within the first years of treatment precluding potential long term benefit on prevention of cardiovascular events. The identified increased bladder cancer risk is likely to reduce adherence to pioglitazone long term treatment.
