## 1. Introduction

On 19 November 2019, the MAH submitted a completed study for Orkambi, that included a subgroup of 30 paediatric patients, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study 117  is a stand-alone study.

The  MAH  states  that  According  to  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is submitting information on a paediatric study completed  on  20  October  2017 .  Study Title: 'A Multicenter, Retrospective, Real-World, Observational Study on Orkambi Use'.

## CHMP comment

The submission was received on 19 November 2019, thus not within 6 months of study completion, this is not in accordance with the regulation.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Orkambi was not supplied by Vertex during this study; Orkambi was prescribed by a patient's physician in  accordance  with  the  US  prescribing  information  (USPI)  and  as  part  of  the  patient's  overall therapeutic strategy.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for: Study VX16 809 117, A Multicenter, Retrospective, Real-world, Observational Study on ORKAMBI Use .

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study VX16 809 117, A Multicenter, Retrospective, Real-world, Observational Study on Orkambi Use.

## Description

## Methods

## Objective(s)

To evaluate ORKAMBI treatment patterns, effectiveness, and initiation experience in patients aged 12 and older with CF F/F who initiated ORKAMBI between July 2015 and September 2015 (early initiators) or October 2015 and December 2015 (late initiators).

The outcomes of interest included whether the patient was an early or late initiator (months 1-3 vs. months  3-6  post-  ORKAMBI  market  uptake),  treatment  patterns  (e.g.,  ORKAMBI  discontinuation),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effectiveness, and site characteristics (e.g., availability of ORKAMBI treatment protocol). Early and late initiators  of  ORKAMBI were distinguished because the difference in the degree of disease severitybeing greater in the early initiators-might influence the effectiveness of ORKAMBI.

## Study design

This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study to explore real-world use and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years of age or older. The study was conducted at 8 US academic centers.

Up to 300 cases (approximately 150 early and 150 late initiators) were to be randomly selected by the contract  research  organization  (CRO)  for  inclusion  in  the  study;  selected  patients  had  de-identified, retrospective data abstracted from their patient medical records entered into an eCRF.

A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1.

## Case Ascertainment Period and Index Date

The case ascertainment period was from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Patients whose ORKAMBI index date occurred between July 2015 and September 2015 were considered to be 'early initiators'  and  patients  whose  ORKAMBI  index  date  occurred  between  October  2015  and  December 2015  were  defined  as  late  initiators.  For  patients  for  whom  fill  date  was  unavailable,  initiation  of ORKAMBI (i.e., index date) was based on the prescription date.

## Analysis Period

The analysis period was unique to each patient and comprised two main periods anchored to the index date:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Pre-index date period: from 12 months before the first day of the case ascertainment period (i.e., July  1,  2014)  to  one  day  before  the  case-specific  index  event  date.  A  minimum  of  12  months (maximum of 18 months) of pre-index data from each case was available.

• Post-index date period: from the case-specific index date to:

· Six months (June 30, 2016) after the last day (December 31, 2015) of the case ascertainment period for the first data abstraction; a minimum of six months (maximum of 12 months) of post-index data from each case was available

·  Twelve  months  (December  31,  2016)  after  the  last  day  (December  31,  2015)  of  the  case ascertainment  period  for  the  second  data  abstraction;  a  minimum  of  12  months  (maximum  of  18 months) of post-index data from each case was available

## Data Abstraction Period

Patient  medical  charts  were  reviewed  by  local  site  staff  for  relevant  study  data.  The  two  data abstractions for each case were:

· First data abstraction: occurred after June 30, 2016; data was collected from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016 (up to 24 months of data from each case)

· Second data abstraction: occurred after December 31, 2016; data was collected from July 1, 2016 through  December  31,  2016  (six  months  of  additional  data  to  the  first  data  abstraction;  up  to  30 months of total data from each case)

## Study population /Sample size

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Patients who met all inclusion criteria were eligible for enrolment into the study:

- have a confirmed diagnosis of CF,
- being homozygous for F508del (as documented in the patient's medical record),
- being 12 years or older on the index date (i.e., first filled ORKAMBI prescription or issue date of the prescription);
- have an index date within the case ascertainment period (July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015).

Patients who participated in any clinical study evaluating ORKAMBI as an investigational study drug within 12 months before the first day of the case-ascertainment period (i.e., between July 1, 2014 and July 1, 2015) were excluded from the study.

## Sample Size Considerations

This study was not powered for statistical comparisons, as the objectives were descriptive in nature. A target sample size of up to 300 cases was decided, stratified by timing of initiation of ORKAMBI:

- Early-patient initiation cohort (index date between July 1, 2015 and September 30, 2015)
- Late-patient initiation cohort (index date between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015)

## Treatments

Orkambi was prescribed by each patient's physician in accordance with the US Prescribing Information (USPI)  and  as  part  of  routine  clinical  care.  Per  the  Orkambi  US  Product  Information,  the  dosing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regimen for CF patients who are homozygous for F508del and aged 12 years and older is 2 tablets (each containing LUM 200 mg/IVA 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours (q12h).

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Data Sources

Data sources were patient medical records.

Site information was collected from a one-time, study-specific survey completed by site investigators (note: This is distinct from the feasibility survey administered during site selection.).

This survey collected general information specific to the site (e.g., size of site and treatment of adult and/or  pediatric  patients)  and  to  general  treatment  practice  by  investigators  at  the  site  (e.g., availability and timing of implementation of ORKAMBI treatment protocol [defined as site development and/or implementation of guidance regarding managing patients who initiated on ORKAMBI]).

## CHMP comment

It is unclear the reason why in the final-eva-18941-table file there are two Tables 1 reporting Study Specific Site Survey Summary with partially different data. The MAH should clarify.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study variables

## Patient-level Variables

## Demographic and Baseline Clinical Characteristics

The following variables were collected during the 12-month pre-index period up to date of ORKAMBI fill.

- Age (in years) on date of ORKAMBI initiation (12 to &lt;18 half age was collected [e.g., 12.5], ≥ 18), Sex, Weight (kg) and height (cm)
- CF comorbidities that occurred or were present during the pre-index period and whether these conditions were ongoing at ORKAMBI treatment initiation
- CF severity (i.e., ppFEV1), Lung function: FEV1 (L), forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25%-75% (L/second) for ppFEV1 (%) calculation
- Any positive results for mucoid or non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P aeruginosa)
- Pulmonary exacerbation (PEx), intravenous (IV) antibiotics, inpatient hospitalizations

## Orkambi utilization

- Prescription and fill dates (where known)
- Starting dose and dose changes including reasons for modification
- ORKAMBI discontinuations including reasons
- ORKAMBI re-initiation

## Orkambi effectiveness

## Clinical outcomes

Change in lung function (measures of ppFEV1) Nutritional status (body mass index [BMI] and weight)

PEx  (Note:  PEx  were  defined  as  IV  antibiotic  use  at  home  or  in  hospital  and/or  PEx-related hospitalizations).  Consecutive  courses  of  IV  antibiotics  or  PEx-related  hospitalization  with  less  than seven  days  from  the  end  of  prior  event  to  start  of  subsequent  event  were  considered  one  event. Outcomes were reported for all PEx, and separately for those requiring hospitalization, those requiring hospitalization  with  IV  antibiotics,  and  those  associated  with  outpatient  visits  requiring  IV  antibiotic therapy. The number and percentage of patients categorized by number of PEx was reported, as was the total number of PEx per patient per year.

## Healthcare resource utilization

Inpatient hospitalizations Outpatient visits related to CF Acute antibiotic use including IV antibiotic Other CF medications use (other than antibiotics)

## Other Outcomes

- Microbiology (e.g., Pseudomonas)
- Death. Cause of death was also provided for patients who died during the post-index event period

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Transplantation (overall and by type [i.e., liver, lung, heart, heart-lung, other])

## Site-level Variables

- Size of site (number of CF-treating physicians)
- Type of available treatment (adult and/or pediatric patients)
- Type of practice (academic- or community-based)
- Availability and timing of implementation of ORKAMBI treatment protocol
- Implementation of the ORKAMBI treatment protocol

## Statistical Methods

## Analysis Set

The All Subjects Set, also referred to as the overall population, was defined as all subjects included in this  retrospective  study,  and  who  met  all  eligibility  criteria.  The  All  Subjects  Set  was  used  for  all ORKAMBI utilization patterns and effectiveness analyses, unless specified otherwise, and included the following  exhaustive,  two  subpopulations:  1)  early-patient  initiation  population,  and  2)  late-patient initiation population.

## Data Analysis

The  final  analyses  were  performed  in  SAS®  v9.4  following  database  lock  All  data  analyses  were descriptive and based on observed trends over time. No hypothesis testing was performed.

## Missing Data

Missing data was expected due to the retrospective design of the study. The number and proportion of missing data was reported for each variable. Incomplete/missing data will not be imputed except for partially missing dates.

## Significance Levels and Multiplicity

As  the  study  was  descriptive  in  nature,  no  statistical  tests  or  significance  levels  were  calculated. However, mean within-group change from baseline scores for key continuous outcomes (e.g., FEV1 and BMI) were presented with 95% CI estimates to evaluate whether they differed from zero. There were no adjustments for multiplicity.

## Safety and Monitoring Reporting

This  was  a  non-interventional  study  based  on  the  retrospective  and  secondary  use  of  data,  thus, reporting of suspected adverse reactions as individual case safety reports (ICSR) was not required.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

## Study Population

## Study Sites

Eight sites participated in the study. The location of the sites was well distributed across the US with two each in the Midwest, Southeast, and Southwest, and one each in the Northeast and West.

## Patient Sampling

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sites identified the medical records of all patients at their site who had been prescribed ORKAMBI and who met the eligibility criteria (i.e., eligible cases). This list of cases constituted the sampling frame from which sampling into the study occurred. For patients for whom fill date was unavailable, initiation of ORKAMBI (i.e., index date) was based on the prescription date. The intent of sampling was to aim for balanced representation of cases in the early- and late-patient initiation cohorts (approximately 150 cases  per  group)  and  if  feasible,  to  ensure  balanced  representation  of  cases  within  each  group  by month  of  ORKAMBI  initiation.  Due  to  the  high  number  of  available  patients  in  the  early-initiation cohort,  a  random  sample  was  selected,  whereas  all  eligible  late-initiation  patients  were  enrolled. Ensuring balance of representation by month of ORKAMBI initiation was also not possible.

Sites  identified  an  overall  sampling  frame  of  419  potentially  eligible  patients  with  CF  who  initiated treatment with ORKAMBI during the case ascertainment period. Two hundred and one (201) patients (48.0%) were excluded from the study for the following reasons: 121 (28.9%) from the early initiator cohort were not randomly sampled into the study, 29 (6.9%) were selected for inclusion in the study but data abstraction was not completed and 51 (12.2%) were not eligible. Therefore, a total of 218 patients  were  enrolled  and  included  in  the  final  analysis.  In  the  final  enrolled  cohort,  131  patients (60.1%) were classified as early-initiators and 87 patients (39.9%) were classified as late-initiators. An overview of patient sampling is included in Figure 2.

Note:Patients whose first filled ORKAMBl°prescription occurred betweenJuly 2015 and September 2015were considered to be \"early initiators\" and patients whose first filled ORKAMBl prescription occurred between October 2015 and December 2015 were defined as late initiators. For patients for whom fill date was unavailable, initiation of ORKAMBl (i.e., index date) was based on the prescription date.

## CHMP comment

Out of 419 patients with CF who initiated treatment with Orkambi during the case ascertainment period at the 8 US Sites, only 218 patients were included in the final analysis (131/292 early initiators, 45%; and  87/127  late  initiators,  68.5%);  therefore,  a  balanced  representation  of  cases  within  the  two groups was not fully achieved.

Due  to  the  lower  than  expected  number  of  late  initiators,  all  eligible  late-initiation  patients  were enrolled. Conversely, in the early-initiation cohort, a random sample was selected.  Other exclusions were  due  to  the  following  reasons:  patients  find  to  be  ineligible  (28  early  initiators  and  23  late initiators), or with incomplete data (29 subjects).

The  MAH  identified  in  the  market  access  (most  patients  received  ORKAMBI  within  the  first  three months post-market uptake vs. three to six months post-market uptake) the main reason of having a lower  number  of  available  late-initiators  patients  as  compared  to  early-initiators.  However,  the distribution of enrolled subjects across sites and initiation group appears broad.

The topic of this variation is the submission of paediatric data (i.e. 12-17 years old patients enrolled in the study). The MAH should provide the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e., number eligible and enrolled) across sites.

## CHMP comment

Out of 218 patients enrolled in Study 117, only 30 (13.8%) were paediatric patients 12-17 years of age), including 17 (13%) early initiation patients and 13 (14.9%) late initiation patients. The focus of this submission is to provide data on real-world use and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years or older. For this reason, the assessment of results for the whole study population, as submitted by the MAH, is out of the scope of this AR.

## CHMP comment:

Comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics should be provided by the MAH for the paediatric setting, for the overall paediatric population, and by initiation cohort.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ORKAMBI Utilization

In the overall study population, the following results were observed:

- Overall, most patients received a full dose of Orkambi at treatment initiation (86.2%), with few patients receiving a half dose (12.4%) or quarter dose (1.4%)
- Of the total 217 participants with available discontinuation status data, 75 (34.6%) subjects discontinued the study, of which 39 (52.0%) were due to respiratory adverse events (AE). One additional patient had unknown discontinuation status.
- The most common reason for a dose decrease (57.1%) or treatment interruption (50.0%) was respiratory adverse event (AE); the most common reason for a dose increase was 'AE resolved' (21.1%)
- A higher discontinuation rate was observed in early initiator (53/131, 40.5%) versus late initiator (22/86, 25.6%) Group.
- A lower discontinuation rate was observed among patients with baseline ppFEV1 ≥ 40%.

## CHMP comment

Among the 30 paediatric patients, 27 subjects (90%) received the full dose (2 tablets twice a day) and 3 subjects (10%) received half dose (1 tablet twice a day) within 12-months post Orkambi initiation. All three subjects, who re-initiated after first discontinuation, received the full dose.

## Footnotes:

-All Subjects Set: All the subjects selected to take part in the retrospective study and who meet all eligibility criteria.

-N: Number of subjects in the All Subjects Set; n(&amp;): number and percentage of subjects; AE: Adverse event.

-Percentages are first calculated relative to the number of subjects (N) in the relevant population or sub-population, then using for the denominator the total number of subjects who discontinued after first initiation in the relevant population or sub-population, and so on. -A subject could contribute to more than one reason for dose adjustments.

- -An ORKAMBI dose adjustment is either an increase, a decrease or an interruption of the dose. -One subject in the &gt;=l8 sub-group did not have available finalized data on ORKAMBI dose adjustment.

## CHMP comment

Among the 30 paediatric subjects enrolled in the Study, 26 experienced no dose adjustment during the 12 months post-index period. 4 subjects experienced two dose adjustments, due to the followings (1 each): menstrual AE, AE resolving, other reason, unknown.

4 paediatric subjects experienced at least one dose increased; 2 subjects experienced at least one dose decreased, and 2 subjects had at least one Orkambi dose interruption.

8/ 30 (26.7%) paediatric subjects discontinued after index event: of these, 7/8 did not experience any Orkambi dose adjustment prior to discontinuation, 1 subject experienced at least 1 dose increase and one subject dose interruption.

One paediatric subject discontinued after first re-initiation.

## Footnotes:

-All Subjects Set: All the subjects selected to take part in the retrospective study and who meet all eligibility criteria.

-N: Number of subjects in the All Subjects Set;

Number of days on treatment, over the 12-months analysis period, was calculated regardless of whether patients had dose changes or interruptions.

-Duration of first use was calculated from index date until first discontinuation date or end of follow-up date as applicable i.e. 12 months after subjects's index date, regardless of changes in dose or interruptions. Duration of second use was calculated from the re-initiation date to second discontinuation date or end of follow-up

date as applicable.

-One subject in the &gt;=l8 sub-group with unknown discontinuation status was excluded from this table. Abbreviations: IQR = interquartile range; SD = standard deviation

## CHMP comment

Among the 30 paediatric subjects, the mean number of days on treatment, over the 12 months analysis period, was 317.1.

-All Subjects Set: All the subjects selected to take part in the retrospective study and who meet all eligibility criteria.

-The percentage of patients who discontinued after first (second.) initiation, listed by reasons, was calculated using for the denominator the number of subjects who discontinued after first (second.)initiation in the relevant population or subpopulation.

-The percentage of patients who re-initiated after first (second) discontinuation was calculated using for the denominator the number of subjects who cdiscontinued following first (second....) )initiation in the relevant population or sub-population. The percentage of patients who re-initiated after first (second) discontinuation, listed by reasons for previous discontinuation in the relevant population or sub-population.

-One subject in the Late Patient Initiation and &gt;=l8 sub-group with unknown discontinuation status was excluded from this table. Abbreviation: Ae = adverse event; ppFEVi = percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second

## Footnotes:

-All Subjects Set: All the subjects selected to take part in the retrospective study and who meet all eligibility criteria.

-The percentage of patients who discontinued treatment due to any reason was calculated lusing for the denominator the total number of subjects (N) in the relevant population or subpopulation.

-Time to discontinuation was based on the subset of subjects who discontinued due to any reason or due to Respiratory AEs, as applicable, within the relevant population or subpopulation.

-*The percentage of patients who discontinued treatment due to respiratory AEs was calculated twice, first using for the denominator the total number of subjects (N) in the relevant population or sub-population,then using for the denominator the total number of subjects who discontinued in the relevant population or sub-population.

-One subject in the &gt;=l8 sub-group with unknown discontinuation status was excluded from this table.

## CHMP comment

Among the 30 paediatrics patients, 4 early initiators and 4 late initiators (8/30, 26.7% overall) discontinued Orkambi following first initiation, due to the following reasons: lack of effectiveness 1 patient, Gastrointestinal AE 1 patient, other AE 4 patients and other reason 2 patients.

Among the 8 paediatric patients that discontinued Orkambi, 3 patients re-initiated Orkambi following the first discontinuation and one patient discontinued following second initiation.

In the majority of cases (6 out of 8, 75%), Orkambi was discontinued within four months of treatment initiation.

## Efficacy results

## ORKAMBI Effectiveness

In the overall study population, the following results were observed:

- Spirometry: The mean (SE) ppFEV1 value was 61.4 (1.77) at baseline. An absolute change of 0.4% (CI: -2.0, 1.3) was observed in ppFEV1 from baseline.
- BMI: The mean (SE) BMI was 21.2 (0.23) kg/m2 at baseline. An absolute change of 0.4 kg/m2 (CI: 0.2, 0.6) was observed in BMI from baseline.
- PEx: The annualized rate of PEx was reduced from 2.1 in the 12-month pre-index period to 1.9 in the 12-month post-index period. The percent of patients with at least 1 PEx event was 78.4% in the pre-index period versus 72.5% in the post-index period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Healthcare Resource Utilization: The percent of patients with at least 1 hospitalization was 61.0% in the pre-index period versus 54.1% in the post-index period.  A change of -1.3 (2.8 pre-index vs. 1.6 post-index) was observed in the annualized rate of hospitalizations.

The mean (SD) number of acute antibiotic prescriptions per patient per year was 6.9 (7.2) in the 12month pre-index period and 7.2 (8.76) in the 12-month post-index period. The percent of patients with at least 1 intravenous acute antibiotic was 61.5% in the pre-index period and 55.5% in the post-index period.

· Cultures: In  the  overall  cohort,  positive  cultures  for  any  mucoid  or  non-mucoid  Pseudomonas Aeruginosa were detected in about two-thirds of patients (66.1%) before ORKAMBI initiation compared to 64.2% after ORKAMBI initiation.

· Transplants: Seven patients (3.2%) required at least one transplant after ORKAMBI initiation (all seven  were  lung  transplants),  of  which  6  patients  were  early-initiators,  compared  to  no  patients requiring  transplant  prior  to  Orkambi  initiation  and  2  patients  with  unknown  prior  transplant  before Orkambi initiation.

· Deaths: There were 2 (0.9%) deaths observed during the post-index period, of which 1 occurred while on ORKAMBI treatment with unknown cause.

## CHMP comment:

Effectiveness study results stratified by age (12&lt;18 and ≥18) have not been provided.

Subgroup analyses in the  paediatric  patients  (12-&lt;18  years  old)  have  been  provided  only  for  drug utilization data (frequencies of study discontinuation, re-initiation and dose adjustments).

Among  the  effectiveness  variables  collected  in  the  study  the  following  are  considered  of  interest: Clinical outcomes  (BMI,  ppFEV1,  weight, and PEx), Healthcare resource utilization (Inpatient hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute  antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,  Other  CF  medications use); Other Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation].

The MAH is requested to submit descriptive data regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients.

Assessment of results referred to adult patients is out of the scope of this submission.

## Safety results

The aim of Study 117 was to evaluate treatment patterns, effectiveness and initiation experience. No safety data have been provided, apart from frequencies of discontinuations due to AEs (please refer to previous sections.)

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  MAH  states  that  According  to  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006, information on a paediatric study, a Multicenter, Retrospective,  Real-World,  Observational  Study  on  Orkambi  Use,  completed  on  20  October  2017  is being submitted. The study included 30 paediatric subjects (≥12 to &lt;18 years old) out of 218 total subjects enrolled. The submission was received on 19 November 2019, thus not within 6 months of study  completion,  and  therefore  not  in  accordance  with  the  regulation,  that  requires  submission  of study results within 6 months of study completion. Therefore, the PAM is not fulfilled.

The study was conducted at 8 US academic-based centres. Paediatric patients (n=30) were enrolled in four of the participating US sites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 117 was designed to explore retrospective data from patients' medical records to assess realworld Orkambi initiation experience during July 2015 to December 2015 following the approval in CF F/F patients aged 12 years and older in the United States. The outcomes that were evaluated included treatment patterns (e.g., Orkambi discontinuation), demographic characteristics, resource utilization, and descriptive 12-month effectiveness.

Qualified staff at each site identified the medical records of all patients who were prescribed Orkambi at their site and met the eligibility criteria. Eligible patients had the date of their first filled Orkambi prescription (referred to hereafter as the 'index date') within the case ascertainment period of 01 July 2015  through  31  December  2015.  Within  the  6-month  case  ascertainment  period,  patients  were divided into the following 2 initiation cohorts, solely by Orkambi initiation date:

• Early initiators: index date between 01 July 2015 and 30 September 2015

- Late initiators: index date between 01 October 2015 and 31 December 2015

The analysis period for each patient consists of a pre-index period of at least 12 months and a postindex period of at least 12 months.

A total of 218 patients who met all eligibility criteria were included in the study (N= 131 early and N= 87 late patients initiators), therefore a balanced representation of cases within the two groups was not fully achieved. The MAH identified in the market access (most patients received ORKAMBI within the first three months post-market uptake vs. three to six months post-market uptake) the main reason of having a lower number of available late-initiators patients as compared to early-initiators.

Orkambi was prescribed by each patient's physician in accordance with the US Prescribing Information (USPI) and as part of routine clinical care. Per the Orkambi US and EU Product Information, the dosing regimen for CF patients who are homozygous for F508del and aged 12 years and older is 2 tablets (each containing LUM 200 mg/IVA 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours (q12h).

The analyses were only descriptive, in line with the study objectives.

Out of 218 patients enrolled in Study 117, only 30 (13.8%) were paediatric patients 12-&lt;18 years of age), including 17 (13%) early initiation patients and 13 (14.9%) late initiation patients. The focus of this submission is providing data on real-world use and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years or older.

For this reason, an assessment of results for the whole study population, as submitted by the MAH, is out of the scope of this AR. In the initial submission, only data on drug utilization have been provided for the paediatric subgroup (30 subjects): 1) the great majority (27 subjects, 90%) received the full dose (2 tablets twice a day) and 3 subjects (10%) received half dose (1 tablet twice a day) within 12months post Orkambi initiation. All three subjects who re-initiated after first discontinuation, received the  full  dose.  2)  only  a  minority  of  subjects  (4  paediatric  subjects  at  least  one  dose  increased;  2 subjects  at  least  one  dose  decreased  and  2  subjects  at  least  one  Orkambi  dose  interruption) experienced  dose  adjustments  Therefore,  the  great  majority  of  pediatric  patients  received  the  full dose.

The MAH was requested to provide baseline clinical characteristics and descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients.

In the subgroup of paediatric patients, the mean (SD) age at the index date was 14.4 (1.80) years, mean (SD) weight was 47.0 (10.61) kg, mean (SD) height was 156.00 (11.00) cm, mean (SD) BMI was 19.1 (2.67) kg/m2, with no relevant differences between early and late initiators. The proportion of  male  patients  was  43.3%  (early  initiators:  47.1%;  late  initiators:  38.5%).  The  most  commonly reported CF comorbid conditions during the pre-index period or ongoing at index date were chronic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sinusitis  and  asthma,  followed  by  CF  related  diabetes.  However,  the  interpretation  of  these  data  is limited, as most baseline comorbid conditions were categorized as 'Others' (16/30, 53%). The mean (SD)  ppFEV1  was  89.5  (20.51)  percentage  points  (early  initiators:  84.8  [SD:  23.80]  percentage points; late initiators: 95.2 [14.42] percentage points). The proportion of paediatric patients with PEx was  16.7%  (early  initiators:  23.5%;  late  initiators:  7.7%).  The  proportion  of  paediatric  patients treated with IV antibiotics was 6.7% (early initiators:11.8%; late initiators: 0.0%) and the proportion of paediatric patients with CF-related inpatient hospitalizations was 6.7% (early initiators: 11.8%; late initiators: 0.0%).

Descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients 12 through 17 years of age from Study 117 present limitations and should be interpreted with caution due to the low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12-17  years  enrolled  (N=30,  among  them  N=17  'early initiators' and N=13 'late initiators'), the retrospective data collection from patient medical records and the exploratory nature of the study.

A  numerical  decrease  in  ppFEV1  was  observed  in  the  paediatric  subgroup  [-2.9  percentage  points (95% CI: -9.1, 3.4)] from baseline to the last available assessment within the 12-month post-index period. This rate of decrease is similar to the annualized rate of lung function decline reported in a published  analysis  of  US  Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation  (CFF)  registry  data  in  patients  homozygous  for F508del, aged 13 through 17 years, untreated with a CFTR modulator (-2.66 percentage points per year;  Wegener  et  al,  J  Cyst  Fibros.  2018;17(4):503-10).  However,  given  the  small  sample  size  of Study 117 paediatric subgroup and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made regarding the effect of Orkambi treatment on ppFEV1 in this subgroup.

In the larger, ongoing comparator-controlled PASS, a reduction in the rate of lung function decline was observed  over  4  years  in  the  subgroup  of  Orkambi-treated  patients  12  through  17  years  of  age, compared to an untreated cohort.

The paediatric subgroup analysis of 30 patients from Study 117 showed improvements in BMI [mean change from baseline: 1.1 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.6)] and weight [mean change from baseline 4.4 kg (95% CI: 3.3, 5.6)].

No  major  differences,  although  with  numerical  slight  decreases,  were  observed  in  the  paediatric subgroup between pre-index period and post index period for: annualized PEx rate [1.1 (SD 1.52) vs 0.9 (SD1.01)], rate of hospitalizations [1.2 (2.17) vs 0.8 (1.19)], outpatient visits [6.0 (4.62) vs 5.4 (2.81)], acute antibiotic prescriptions [3.4 (4.03) vs 3.1 (5.01)], and the proportion of patients with positive  P.  aeruginosa  after  Orkambi  initiation  (56.7%  vs  50%).  There  were  no  lung  transplants  or deaths in the paediatric subgroup.

Furthermore,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  Orkambi  discontinuation observed in the subgroup of paediatric subjects (8/30, 26.7%) and to provide further information on the reasons for discontinuation in the 4 subjects where the reported reason was 'other AE' and in the 2 subjects classified as 'other reason'. Of the 8 paediatric patients who discontinued Orkambi after the first  initiation  of  treatment,  3  reinitiated  Orkambi:  two  of  these  3  patients  remained  on  treatment through the end of the study; 1 subject discontinued after the second initiation of treatment. Thus, 6/30 paediatric patients (20%) permanently discontinued treatment in Study 117. This frequency of discontinuation is higher than the one observed in the same age range in pivotal clinical trials (1.0%, 3/290 subjects), and in another observational study conducted in France (8.2%) (Burgel et al, 2019). As regards to the types of AEs observed, the events were mostly known ADRs (2 subjects discontinued due to transaminase increase; one subject each discontinued due to headaches and rash). The other two subjects presented exacerbation of reflux symptoms leading to discontinuation and fever one hour after dose and rhinorrhea (1 patient each).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also, in the overall population enrolled in Study 117, a high frequency of discontinuation (35.8%) was observed. The most frequent reason for study discontinuation was respiratory AEs (39 subjects, 52% of subjects who discontinued). The frequency of discontinuation observed in Study 117 is considerably higher  than  the  frequency  of  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation    observed  in  the  overall population  enrolled  in  the  pooled  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  studies  (pivotal  Studies  103  and  104) (4.6%), as well as in the long term extension of pivotal studies up to 96 weeks treatment duration (6.8%).

In the  observational  study  conducted  in  France to evaluate  real-world treatment effects  of  Orkambi over  the  first  year  of  treatment  previously  cited  (Burgel  et  al,  2019),  the  overall  study  rates  of Orkambi discontinuation in adults was 23.5%.

The MAH was requested to discuss the high frequency of discontinuation (35.8%) and to discuss all available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population of patients enrolled in Study 117. The reasons for treatment discontinuation were respiratory AEs (39 patients [52.0%]), other reason (17 patients [22.7%]), other AE (9 patients [12.0%]), lack of effectiveness (5 patients [6.7%]), unknown (3 patients [4.0%]), and gastrointestinal AE (2 patients [2.7%]). Among the 17 patients that discontinued due to other reasons, most patients discontinued due to AEs. As regards to the types of AEs leading to discontinuation, the events were mostly known ADRs for Orkambi. Of note, one patients discontinued due to worsened depression and one patient discontinued due to Stevens Johnson's syndrome.

It  is  acknowledged  that  the  data  from  the  PASS  study,  given  the  larger  sample  size  and  longer duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience. In the annual interim analysis results from the larger, registry-based, 5-year post-authorization safety study (PASS) Study 108,  the proportion of patients in the Orkambi Safety Cohort who had no record of Orkambi use in the subsequent calendar year suggests a discontinuation rate of 10.1% for the 2016 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N= 5,553) and 12.2% for the 2017 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N = 6,664).

In the overall study population, seven patients (3.2%) required at least one transplant after ORKAMBI initiation (all seven were lung transplants), of which 6 patients were early-initiators, compared to no patients requiring transplant prior to Orkambi initiation and 2 patients with unknown prior transplant before Orkambi initiation.  There  were  2  (0.9%)  deaths  observed  during  the  post-index  period,  1  of which  occurred  while  on  Orkambi  treatment  with  unknown  cause.  The  MAH  has  been  requested  to provide  all  available  information  (including  age)  of  the  7  subjects  requiring  lung  transplant  after Orkambi initiation and of the 2 deaths observed during the post index period.

The age at the time that Orkambi was prescribed for the 7 patients who had a lung transplant ranged from 23 to 56 years of age. The 2 patients who died during the post-index period were aged 20 and 52 years old. The MAH clarified that no further information is available on these patients, given that for death and organ transplant, there was no option in the CRFs for the sites to provide any additional description regarding these events.

In Study 117, a higher proportion of patients (3.2%) required lung transplant after Orkambi initiation in  comparison  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  history  of  any  organ  transplant  (0.4%)  in  the Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108. It is acknowledged that the data from the PASS study, given the larger sample size and longer duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience. In the third interm analysis of the ongoing PASS, consistently with the previous 2 interim reports, the risk of death and organ transplant was statistically significantly lower in the Orkambi Cohort compared to the Comparator Cohort.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

On 19 November 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Orkambi. Study Title: 'A Multicenter, Retrospective, Real-World, Observational Study on Orkambi Use'. The study included 30 paediatric subjects (≥12 years old). The study was completed on 20 October 2017, thus not within 6 months of study completion. This is not in accordance with the regulation (Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as  amended).  Therefore,  the  PAM  is  not  considered  to  be  fulfilled  as  it  was  not submitted within the legal timelines (i.e. within six months of completion of each study).

The  focus  of  this  submission  is  providing  data  on  real-world  use  and  descriptive  effectiveness  of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years or older. For this reason, the assessment of results for the whole study population, as submitted by the MAH, is out of the scope of this AR. Data on drug utilization have been provided for the paediatric cohort (30 subjects) indicating that the great majority of subjects (90%) received the full Orkambi dose.

Descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients 12 through 17 years of age from Study 117 present limitations and should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of paediatric subjects aged 12-17 years enrolled (N=30), the retrospective data collection from patient medical records and the exploratory nature of the study.

A more severe pattern of baseline disease characteristics was observed in early initiators as compared to late initiators.

Results  seem  not  suggesting  a  positive  trend  on  ppFEV1.  However,  given  the  small  sample  size  of Study 117 paediatric subgroup and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made. Of note, supportive  results  of  Orkambi  effectiveness  on  ppFEV1  are  coming  from  the  larger,  ongoing comparator-controlled PASS.

Increases in weight and BMI were observed in the paediatric subgroup between pre-index period and post index period. There were no major differences for the other variables/outcomes, slight numerical decreases were observed.

A high frequency of discontinuation was observed in Study 117, both in the overall population (35.8%) and in the subgroup of paediatric subjects (8/30, 26.7%).

However, the types of AEs leading to discontinuation were mostly known ADRs for Orkambi.

In order to allow to contextualize the higher frequency of treatment discontinuation observed in Study 117 in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, compared to the one observed in the same age range in  pivotal  clinical  trials,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the subgroup  of  30  paediatric  subjects  included  in  Study  117  in  comparison  with  baseline  clinical characteristics of adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, enrolled in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104). It is of note that ppFEV1 value of patients 12 to 17 years of age enrolled in Study 117 is higher (mean 89.5, SD 20.51) in comparison to patients of the same age range enrolled in pivotal studies 103/104 (mean 67.3, SD 13.0) underlying a quite different lung function as measured by ppFEV1 at baseline surely limiting indirect comparability of study results but possibly not substantially contributing to a higher treatment discontinuation observed in Study 117 study.

7 subjects required lung transplant after Orkambi initiation and two 2 deaths were observed during the post index period. It is noted that a higher proportion of patients (3.2%) required lung transplant after Orkambi initiation in comparison to the proportion of patients with a history of any organ transplant (0.4%) in the Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108. No details on CRF were available. It

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is acknowledged that the data from the PASS study, given the larger sample size and longer duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience.

Not fulfilled. The submission was received on 19 November 2019, thus not within 6 months of study completion, and therefore not in accordance with the regulation, that requires submission of study results within 6 months of study completion. The MAH is requested to adhere to legal timelines when submitting article 46 paediatric study application(s).

## 4. Additional clarification requested

Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this procedure:

1. The  MAH  should  clarify  if  Study  117  was  a  stand-alone  study  or  a  study  part  of  a  clinical development program.
2. It is unclear the reason why in the final-eva-18941-table file there are two Tables 1 reporting Study Specific Site Survey Summary with partially different data. The Applicant should clarify.
3. Unexpectedly, only data on drug utilization have been provided for the paediatric subgroup (30 subjects). To allow the assessment of study 117 results, the MAH is required to submit
- i) the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;
5. ii) comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and by initiation cohort;
6. iii) descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric patients for the following variables: Clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx), Healthcare  resource  utilization  (Inpatient  hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,  Other  CF  medications  use);  Other  Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation].

## Assessment of the MAH's Response

The Applicant clarified that the second Table 1 (starting on page 2 of the FINAL\\_EVA\\_18941\\_Tables file) contains incomplete data from an interim analysis and was inadvertently included.

## Issue resolved

## Question 3

Unexpectedly, only data on drug utilization have been provided for the paediatric subgroup (30 subjects). To allow the assessment of study 117 results, the MAH is required to submit

- i) the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e., number eligible and enrolled) across sites;
2. ii) comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and by initiation cohort;
3. iii) descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients for the following variables: clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx), Healthcare resource utilization (Inpatient hospitalizations; Outpatient visit, Acute antibiotic use including IV antibiotic, Other CF medications use); Other Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation].

## MAH's Response:

Study 117 was an exploratory, retrospective chart study designed to explore the real-world utilization and treatment patterns in the indicated population for Orkambi in the months following the initial approval in the US. The indicated population, and those enrolled in the study, included cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for F508del who were 12 through 17 years of age. The study was not designed to evaluate the paediatric subgroup; therefore, subgroup analyses of these patients are not considered informative or appropriate.

Post hoc subgroup analyses of the paediatric population enrolled in Study 117 would not be informative or appropriate because:

- 1) this was an exploratory study using medical records abstraction;
- 2) the subgroup is not powered to detect changes in the requested endpoints; and
- 3) because the study was not designed or powered to assess this paediatric subgroup, there is a high likelihood of confounding from imbalanced baseline characteristics between the even smaller subgroups of early and late initiators.

For these reasons, analyses of the paediatric subgroup would have a high likelihood of not being representative of CF patients 12 through 17 years of age initiating Orkambi and would not be interpretable. In summary, the requested subgroup analyses are not considered appropriate for this study.

## Assessment of the MAH's Response

The focus of this study is providing data on real-world use and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US including adults and patients who were 12-17 years old. Of 218 patients enrolled in Study  117,  30  (13.8%)  were  paediatric  patients  12-&lt;18  years  of  age),  including  17  (13%)  early initiation  patients  and  13  (14.9%)  late  initiation  patients.  Only  data  on  drug  utilization  have  been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

provided for the paediatric subgroup (30 subjects). Baseline data and post-hoc analyses on pediatric patients (12-17 years old) were required however the MAH did not provide these analyses since were not  considered  to  be  informative  or  appropriate  for  the  following  reasons:  i)  the  study  design  was exploratory and medical records were used, ii) the study is not powered for the subgroup analysis and data from a small subgroup would be not interpretable.

It  is  acknowledged  that  the  study  is  exploratory  and  retrospective  and  that  the  main  aim  was  to explore the realworld utilization and treatment patterns of Orkambi in F/F CF patients ≥12 years in the US, however the requested data could have been an opportunity to gain some information on the subgroup, although limited, of pediatric patients included in the study. However, due to the limited number of patients and lack of complete baseline data, it is recognised that the results would not be sufficiently informative to allow inclusion of relevant information in the SmPC.

Not further pursued.

## MS comments

Reportedly, the main objective of this retrospective observational study was to «explore real-world use and effectiveness of ORKAMBI in CF F/F patients in the US who were 12 years of age or older». It is agreed that a low number of paediatric subjects aged 12-17 years was enrolled (N=30, among them N=17  'early  initiators'  and  N=13  'late  initiators')  and  that  the  retrospective  data  collection  and exploratory character of the investigation undoubtedly result in limitations.

However, the analyses presented by the MAH for the paediatric population are scarce, cursory, and mainly limited to drug usage data. It appears that effectiveness and safety data were collected, but not even descriptively analysed, let alone comprehensively evaluated. In the absence of such a descriptive analysis, the MAH's overall conclusion that the «results would not be sufficiently informative [anyway]» is an assumption which is not sufficiently corroborated by facts.

Additional comment in relation with the paediatric drug usage data: based on the tables presented in the AR, it appears that Orkambi treatment was discontinued in 8/30 children (26.7%) following first initiation, and not - as erroneously mentioned in the AR - in 4/30 children (13.3%). In the majority of cases (6 out of 8), Orkambi was discontinued within four months of treatment initiation. Moreover, the underlying reasons were not sufficiently specified or made transparent by the MAH: N=4 other AE, N=2 other reason.

## Additional clarification requested (2 nd  RSI)

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure

1. It  is  acknowledged that a low number of paediatric subjects aged 12-17 years was enrolled (N=30) and that the retrospective data collection and exploratory character of the investigation undoubtedly result in limitations. However, given that some effectiveness and safety data were collected,  in  the  absence  of  a  descriptive  analysis,  the  MAH's  overall  conclusion  that  the «results  would  not  be  sufficiently  informative  [anyway]»  is  an  assumption  which  is  not sufficiently  corroborated by facts. To allow the assessment of study 117 results, the MAH is required to submit
- i) the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;
3. ii) comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and by initiation cohort;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- iii) descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric patients for the following variables: Clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx), Healthcare  resource  utilization  (Inpatient  hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,  Other  CF  medications  use);  Other  Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation].

2.  Orkambi  treatment  was  discontinued  in  8/30  children  (26.7%)  following  first  initiation.  In  the majority of cases (6 out of 8), Orkambi was discontinued within four months of treatment initiation. The underlying reasons were the following: N=4 other AE, N=2 other reason, lack of effectiveness 1 patient, Gastrointestinal AE 1 patient. The Applicant should provide further information on the reasons for discontinuation in the 4 subjects where the reported reason was 'other AE' and in the 2 subjects classified as 'other reason'. The Applicant should discuss the high frequency of Orkambi discontinuation observed in this study.

## MAH responses to 2 nd  Request for supplementary information

## Question 1

2. It  is  acknowledged that a low number of paediatric subjects aged 12-17 years was enrolled (N=30) and that the retrospective data collection and exploratory character of the investigation undoubtedly result in limitations. However, given that some effectiveness and safety data were collected,  in  the  absence  of  a  descriptive  analysis,  the  MAH's  overall  conclusion  that  the «results  would  not  be  sufficiently  informative  [anyway]»  is  an  assumption  which  is  not sufficiently  corroborated by facts. To allow the assessment of study 117 results, the MAH is required to submit
2. iv) the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;
- v) comprehensive baseline clinical characteristics of the overall paediatric population and by initiation cohort;
4. vi) descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the  subgroup  of  paediatric patients for the following variables: Clinical outcomes (BMI, ppFEV1, weight, and PEx), Healthcare  resource  utilization  (Inpatient  hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,  Other  CF  medications  use);  Other  Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation].

## MAH's Response:

In  line  with  EMA  guidance,  the  outcome  of  an  Article  46  procedure  assessed  by  the  EMA  is  to determine  whether  an  update  to  the  SmPC  is  warranted  or  not.  Vertex  is  in  agreement  with  the Rapporteur's assessment that 'due to the limited number of patients and lack of complete baseline data, it is recognised that the results would not be sufficiently informative to allow inclusion of relevant information in the SmPC.'

Vertex acknowledges the request for additional analyses, but respectfully declines this request for the following reasons. Study 117 was an exploratory retrospective study that was not designed or powered to  assess  the  paediatric  subgroup  for  the  requested  endpoints.  While  some  data  relating  to  the utilization patterns of Orkambi were collected, the data were very limited.

Limitations for the requested subgroup analyses include:

- this was an exploratory, retrospective chart study using medical records abstraction
- the paediatric subgroup is not powered to detect changes in the requested endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- the small paediatric subgroup would have a high likelihood of not being representative of CF patients 12 through 17 years of age
- due to the small size of the paediatric subgroup, there is a high likelihood of imbalanced baseline characteristics  between  the  early  and  late  initiator  groups.  As  a  result,  the  requested  analyses  for baseline characteristics by initiation cohort would not provide representative data for this age group.

·  the large number of variables that would be analyzed for the requested subgroup analyses would lead to a high chance of misleading findings

For  these  reasons,  the  requested  subgroup  analyses  would  not  be  representative  of  CF  patients  12 through 17 years of age and are not considered appropriate for this study.

Study 117 was an exploratory study designed to explore the early treatment patterns following the initial  US  approval.  In  the  Orkambi  clinical  development  program,  Vertex  has  evaluated  Orkambi  in paediatric  patients  in  larger  and  more  comprehensive  studies,  such  as  placebo-controlled  Phase  3 studies  (Studies  VX12-809-103,  VX12-809-104,  and  VX14-809-109),  open-label  long-term  safety studies  (Study  VX12-809-105  and  Study  VX15-809-110  [Study  110]),  and  an  observational  postauthorization study (Study VX14-809-108); the data from these studies better represent the paediatric experience  with  Orkambi.  The  analysis  of  this  small  subgroup  would  not  be  likely  to  change  the positive benefit:risk profile in CF patients12 through 17 years of age.

## Assessment of the MAH's Response:

Despite  the  repeated  requests  to  provide  descriptive  results  regarding  Orkambi  effectiveness  in  the subgroup  of  30  paediatric  patients  included  in  Study  117  (first  request  by  e-mail  prior  to  first assessment report, second request through 1 st  RSI, third request following DE comments through 2 nd RSI) the MAH has not provided the requested data on the basis of the argumentation that Study 117 was an exploratory  retrospective  study,  that  was  not  designed  or  powered  to  assess  the  paediatric subgroup for the requested endpoints. While some data relating to the utilization patterns of Orkambi were collected,  the  data  were  very  limited  and  the  MAH's  opinion  is  that  the  analysis  of  this  small subgroup would not be likely to change the positive benefit/risk profile in CF patients 12 through 17 years of age.

The MAH refusal to provide the requested data is difficult to understand.

Even  though  it  is  acknowledged  that  a  low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12  -  17  years  was enrolled (N=30)  and  that  the  retrospective data collection and  exploratory character of the investigation  undoubtedly  result  in  limitations,  as  previously  commented  by  DE,  given  that  some effectiveness data were collected, in the absence of a descriptive analysis, the MAH's overall conclusion that 'the analysis of this small subgroup would not be likely to change the positive benefit:risk profile in CF patients 12 through 17 years of age' is an assumption which is not sufficiently corroborated by data.

Thus, the request to provide the following data is reiterated:

- i) the distribution of paediatric patients (i.e, number eligible and enrolled) across sites;
2. ii) comprehensive  baseline  clinical  characteristics  of  the  overall  paediatric  population  and  by initiation cohort;
3. iii) descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients for the  following  variables:  Clinical  outcomes  (BMI,  ppFEV1,  weight,  and  PEx),  Healthcare  resource utilization  (Inpatient  hospitalizations;  Outpatient  visits,  Acute  antibiotic  use  including  IV  antibiotic,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other CF medications use); Other Outcomes [Microbiology: (e.g., Pseudomonas); Death; Transplantation]

## Question 2

Orkambi treatment was discontinued in 8/30 children (26.7%) following first initiation. In the majority of  cases  (6  out  of  8),  Orkambi  was  discontinued  within  four  months  of  treatment  initiation.  The underlying  reasons  were  the  following:  N=4  other  AE,  N=2  other  reason,  lack  of  effectiveness  1 patient, Gastrointestinal AE 1 patient. The Applicant should provide further information on the reasons for discontinuation in the 4 subjects where the reported reason was 'other AE' and in the 2 subjects classified as 'other reason'. The Applicant should discuss the high frequency of Orkambi discontinuation observed in this study.

## MAH's Response:

As  requested,  additional  information  is  provided  in  Table  1  for  the  8  paediatric  patients  who discontinued after first initiation, including the patients where the reported reason for discontinuation was 'other AE' (n = 4) or 'other reason' (n = 2). The case report forms (CRFs) included an option for the sites to enter free text to specify the reasons for discontinuation; the free text is provided verbatim from the CRF in Table 15.

This patient discontinued after the first initiation of treatment due to “other AE\" (verbatim free text:

\"Headaches\"). Then, the patient subsequently discontinued after reinitiation of treatment due to “other AE\"

(verbatim free text: *\"increases in transaminases\").

With respect to the frequency of discontinuation, Vertex would like to clarify that of the 8 paediatric patients who discontinued Orkambi after the first initiation of treatment, 3 reinitiated Orkambi (Study 117 CSR/Table 44). Two of these 3 patients remained on treatment through the end of the study; 1 subject discontinued after the second initiation of treatment (see Patient 5 from Table 1). Thus, only 6 paediatric patients discontinued treatment in Study 117.

Furthermore,  as  discussed  in  the  response  to  Question  1,  Study  117  was  conducted  early  in  the Orkambi lifecycle. In the last 5 years, other larger studies have shown lower discontinuation rates in paediatric patients than that observed in Study 117. In an observational study conducted in France to evaluate real-world treatment effects of Orkambi, the overall discontinuation rate for adolescents 12 through 17 years of age was 8.2% (n = 292). 1  In addition, several Vertex clinical studies in paediatric subjects have shown that Orkambi is well tolerated with lower rates of discontinuation. For example, the  overall  discontinuation  rate  in  paediatric  subjects  who  initiated  Orkambi  treatment  between  6 through  11  years  of  age  (Study  110)  was  10.0%  (n  =  239),  with  AEs  leading  to  treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuation in only 3.8% of subjects. Taken together, these studies indicate that the discontinuation rate observed in Study 117 is not representative of real-world or clinical experience with Orkambi to date.

## Assessment of the MAH's Response:

The MAH provided the requested data for the 8/30 paediatric patients who discontinued Orkambi after first initiation.

Two  subjects  (2/30,  6.7%)  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  effectiveness/lack  of  perceived  therapeutic effect; one subject (1/30, 3.3%) discontinued due to inability to swallow the tablets, and 6/30 subjects (20%) discontinued due to AEs. Among the 6 subjects discontinuing due to AEs, the AEs leading to discontinuation were the following (verbatim text): increase in transaminase (2 patients), exacerbation of reflux symptoms, headaches, rash, fevers one hour after dose and rhinorrhea (1 patient each).

Of  the  8  paediatric  patients  who  discontinued  Orkambi  after  the  first  initiation  of  treatment,  3 reinitiated Orkambi: two of these 3 patients remained on treatment through the end of the study; 1 subject discontinued after the second initiation of treatment (this patient discontinued after the first initiation  of  treatment  due  to:  'Headaches'.  Then,  the  patient  subsequently  discontinued  after reinitiation of  treatment due to 'increases in transaminases'). Thus, 6/30 paediatric patients (20%) permanently discontinued treatment in Study 117.

The MAH states other larger studies have shown lower discontinuation rates in paediatric patients than that  observed  in  Study  117:  in  an  observational  study  conducted  in  France  to  evaluate  real-world treatment  effects  of  Orkambi  over  the  first  year  of  treatment,  the  overall  discontinuation  rate  for adolescents 12 through 17 years of age was 8.2% (n = 292); conversely in this study rates of Orkambi discontinuation were significantly higher in adults than in adolescents (23.5% vs 8.2%, p&lt; 0.0001) (Burgel et al, 2019). Thus, in the MAH's opinion, the discontinuation rate observed in Study 117 is not representative of real-world or clinical experience with Orkambi to date.

Of the 1108 subjects who received study drug in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104), 290 subjects were aged ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age. Among subjects ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years  of  age,  3  subjects  (1.0%)  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  during  the  6  months  study duration: 2 subjects on placebo (acne, n =1; haemoptysis, n = 1) and 1 subject in the LUM 400 mg q12h/IVA 250 mg q12h group (forced expiratory volume decrease).

In the overall pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, the incidence of adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation was higher in the total LUM/IVA group (4.2%) compared with the placebo group (1.6%).

In study 105 A, the long-term extension of pivotal studies up to 96 weeks treatment duration, a total of 70 (6.8%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation.

In  the  adult  population  enrolled  in  Study  117,  67/188  subjects  (35.8%)  discontinued  due  to  any reason. The most frequent reason for study discontinuation was respiratory AEs (39 subjects, 58.2% of subjects who discontinued).

## Conclusion:

6/30 adolescents 12 through 17 years of age (20%) permanently discontinued treatment in Study 117. This frequency of discontinuation is higher than the one observed in the same age range in pivotal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinical trials (1.0%, 3/290 subjects), and in another observational study conducted in France (8.2%) (Burgel et la, 2019).

As regards to the types of AEs observed, the events were mostly known ADRs (2 subjects discontinued due to transaminase increase; one subject each discontinued due to headaches and rash). The other two  subjects  presented  exacerbation  of  reflux  symptoms  leading  to  discontinuation  and  fevers  one hour after dose and rhinorrhea (1 patient each).

In order to better contextualize the higher frequency of treatment discontinuation (20%) observed in Study 117 in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, compared to the one observed in the same age range in pivotal clinical trials (1.0%, 3/290 subjects), baseline clinical characteristics of the subgroup of 30 pediatric subjects included in Study 117 are needed (please refer to assessment of question 2 for further aspects on this issue). Baseline clinical characteristics of the subgroup of 30 paediatric subjects included  in  Study  117  should  be  discussed  by  the  MAH  in  comparison  with  baseline  clinical characteristics of adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, enrolled in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104).

The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  discontinuation  (35.8%)  and  to  discuss  all available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population of patients enrolled in Study 117.

In the overall study population, seven patients (3.2%) required at least one transplant after ORKAMBI initiation (all seven were lung transplants), of which 6 patients were early-initiators, compared to no patients requiring transplant prior to Orkambi initiation and 2 patients with unknown prior transplant before Orkambi initiation.  There  were  2  (0.9%)  deaths  observed  during  the  post-index  period,  1  of which  occurred  while  on  Orkambi  treatment  with  unknown  cause.  The  MAH  has  been  requested  to provide  all  available  information  (including  age)  of  the  7  subjects  requiring  lung  transplant  after Orkambi initiation and of the 2 deaths observed during the post index period.

The higher proportion of patients requiring at least one organ transplantation after Orkambi initiation in Study 117 (3.2%) in comparison to the proportion of patients with a history of any organ transplant (0.4%) in the Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108 should be discussed.

## Additional clarification requested (3 rd  RSI)

The argumentations provided by the MAH are not agreed.

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure

1. It is acknowledged that a low number of paediatric subjects aged 12 - 17 years was enrolled (N=30) and that the retrospective data collection and exploratory character of the investigation undoubtedly result in limitations. However, given that some effectiveness and safety data were collected, in the absence of a descriptive analysis, the MAH's overall conclusion that the 'the analysis of this small subgroup would not be likely to change the positive benefit:risk profile in CF  patients  12  through  17  years  of  age'    is  an  assumption  which  is  not  sufficiently corroborated by data.

2. In  order  to  allow  to  contextualize  the  higher  frequency  of  treatment  discontinuation  (20%) observed  in  Study  117  in  adolescents  12  through  17  years  of  age,  compared  to  the  one observed  in  the  same  age  range  in  pivotal  clinical  trials  (1.0%,  3/290  subjects),  baseline clinical  characteristics  of  the  subgroup  of  30  paediatric  subjects  included  in  Study  117  are needed. Baseline clinical characteristics of the subgroup of 30 paediatric subjects included in Study 117 should be discussed by the MAH in comparison with baseline clinical characteristics of adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, enrolled in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104).
3. The MAH is requested to discuss the high frequency of discontinuation (35.8%) and to discuss available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population of patients enrolled in Study 117.
4. The  MAH is  requested  to  provide  all  available  information  (including  age)  of  the  7  subjects requiring lung transplant after Orkambi initiation and of the 2 deaths observed during the post index  period.

## MAH responses to 3 rd  Request for supplementary information

## Question 1

It is acknowledged that a low number of paediatric subjects aged 12 -17 years was enrolled (N=30) and that the retrospective data collection and exploratory character of the investigation undoubtedly result  in  limitations.  However,  given  that  some  effectiveness  and  safety  data  were  collected,  in  the absence  of  a  descriptive  analysis,  the  MAH's  overall  conclusion  that  the  'the  analysis  of  this  small subgroup would not be likely to change the positive benefit:risk profile in CF patients 12 through 17 years of age'  is an assumption which is not sufficiently corroborated by data.

## Summary of the MAH's Responses

After establishing the positive benefit-risk balance of Orkambi in F/F patients 12 years and older and receiving marketing approval for the adolescent and adult F/F population, Vertex conducted Study 117 to explore the real-world utilization and treatment patterns over 12 months after Orkambi initiation in the  indicated  population  who  initiated  treatment  shortly  after  approval  of  Orkambi  in  the  US.  Data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  extracted  from  medical  records  of  US  CF  subjects  only  and  are  subject  to  the  limitations  of uncontrolled observational real-world data, especially those of short duration. The subgroup analysis of paediatric subjects was not planned, as the number of subjects 12 through 17 years of age was small with significant limitations to interpretation of effectiveness outcomes.

As requested, Vertex has conducted post-hoc subgroup analyses of the paediatric patients 12 through 17 years of age from Study 117. The results from the paediatric subgroup analyses are summarized below. A list of the tables summarizing the paediatric subgroup data for the requested endpoints is provided in the Appendix.

These  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  exploratory  nature  of  this  study  and  the limitations of the data collected via medical record abstraction. The study was conducted in the US only and  was  not  designed  or  powered  to  assess  the  paediatric  subgroup  for  the  requested  endpoints. Limitations in the retrospective data collection from patient medical records include incomplete/missing data and inconsistencies due to differences in medical chart documentation.

Moreover, given the small sample size of 30 patients, it is not appropriate to infer that the results from the  requested  subgroup  analyses  are  generalizable  to  the  population  of  CF  patients  12  through  17 years of age or that it would change the established positive benefit-risk of Orkambi.

Pediatric Sub-Population: Subset of the overall patient population (All Subjects Set) aged 12 to 17 years of age.

N: Number of subjects in the Pediatric Sub-Population; n(&amp;): number and percentage of subjects.

Percentages are calculated relative to the Overall sample size in the relevant subpopulation.

For baseline continuous patient characteristics, results are at index date and if the information was not available on the index date, information from the closest preceding date prior to the index date was used. For the presence of CF comorbid conditions, the baseline evaluation period was defined as any time during the preindex period (July 1, 2014 until the index date, inclusively). For the status of CF index date.

PEx could be directly recorded as an event in the patient's chart or indirectly defined as a course of new Iv antibiotic therapy and/or PEx related hospitalizations. Courses of IV antibiotics or PEx-related hospitalization occurring within less than seven days from end of first event to start of next one were considered one event.

## iii. Orkambi Effectiveness Results

## Clinical outcomes

ppFEV1 (Ad Hoc Table 3): The mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the last available assessment within the 12-month post-index period was -2.9 percentage points (95% CI: -9.1, 3.4). Given the small sample size and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made regarding the effect of Orkambi treatment on ppFEV1 in this subgroup.

Pediatric Sub-Population: Subset of the overall patient population (All Subjects Set) aged 12 to 17 years of age.

N: Number of subjects in the Pediatric Sub-Population; n(&amp;): number and percentage of subjects.

Percentages are calculated relative to the Overall sample size in the relevant subpopulation.

PEx could be directly recorded as an event in the patient's chart or indirectly defined as a course of new IV antibiotic therapy and/or PEx related hospitalizations. Courses of IV antibiotics or PEx-related hospitalization occurring within less than seven days from end of first event to start of next one were considered one event.

## Other Outcomes

- Positive for P. aeruginosa (Ad Hoc Table 11): The proportion of patients with positive cultures for  P.  aeruginosa  (mucoid  or  non-mucoid)  in  the  pediatric  subgroup  was  56.7%  before  Orkambi initiation and 50% after Orkambi initiation.
-  Lung  Transplant  (Ad  Hoc  Table  11): No  patients  required  a  lung  transplant  after  Orkambi initiation in the paediatric subgroup.
- Death (Ad Hoc Table 11): There were no deaths in the paediatric subgroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH's Summary

The  paediatric  subgroup  analysis  of  30  patients  from  Study  117  showed  improvements  in  BMI  and weight, as well as a reduction in the annualized PEx rate, the rate of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, acute antibiotic prescriptions, and the proportion of patients with positive P. aeruginosa after Orkambi initiation. The rate of PEx, hospitalizations, outpatient visits, acute antibiotic prescriptions, and positive P.  aeruginosa status were all lower in the paediatric subgroup than in the overall population. There were no lung transplants or deaths in the paediatric subgroup.

A numerical decrease in ppFEV1 was observed in the paediatric subgroup, which can be expected of this  age  group  and  the  natural  progression  of  the disease.  These  results  should  be  interpreted with caution given that the confidence intervals cross zero, the small sample size, the lack of a comparator control, and other limitations of this exploratory chart review study. In the larger, ongoing comparatorcontrolled  PASS,  a  reduction  in  the  rate  of  lung  function  decline  was  observed  in  Orkambi-treated patients (n = 2,287) compared to untreated comparator patients (n = 3,527) across various age strata over a longer observational period. Specifically, in the subgroup of patients 12 through 17 years of age (n = 773), the decline in lung function change from the pre-treatment baseline was -3.84 percentage points versus -7.62 percentage points in the untreated comparator patients (n = 845).

The overall positive benefit-risk balance of Orkambi in F/F patients, including the 12- through 17-yearold age group, has been well established in pivotal and long-term clinical studies. Post-approval safety studies, real world evidence and post-marketing surveillance data continue to support the favourable efficacy and safety profile with Orkambi.

## Assessor's comment

The MAH provided the requested post-hoc subgroup analyses of the paediatric patients 12 through 17 years of age from Study 117.

Distribution  of  Paediatric  Patients  Enrolled  Across  Sites: paediatric  patients  (n=30)  were enrolled in four of the eight participating US sites.

Demographics  and  Baseline  Characteristics :  The  mean  (SD)  age  at  the  index  date  was  14.4 (1.80) years, mean (SD) weight was 47.0 (10.61) kg, mean (SD) height was 156.00 (11.00) cm, mean (SD) BMI was 19.1 (2.67) kg/m2, with no relevant differences between early and late initiators. The proportion  of  male  patients  was  43.3%  (early  initiators:  47.1%;  late  initiators:  38.5%).  The  most commonly reported CF comorbid conditions during the pre-index period or ongoing at index date were chronic  sinusitis  and  asthma,  followed  by  CF  related  diabetes.  However,  the  interpretation  of  these data is limited, as most baseline comorbid conditions were categorized as 'Others' (16/30, 53.3%). The  mean  (SD)  ppFEV1  was  89.5  (20.51)  percentage  points  (early  initiators:  84.8  [SD:  23.80] percentage  points;  late  initiators:  95.2  [14.42]  percentage  points).  The  proportion  of  paediatric patients  with  PEx  was  16.7%  (early  initiators:  23.5%;  late  initiators:  7.7%).  The  proportion  of paediatric patients treated with IV antibiotics was 6.7% (early initiators:11.8%; late initiators: 0.0%) and the  proportion  of  paediatric  patients  with  CF-related  inpatient  hospitalizations  was  6.7%  (early initiators:  11.8%;  late  initiators:  0.0%),  supporting  a  more  severe  pattern  of  baseline  disease characteristics in early initiators as compared to late initiators.

Effectiveness: The paediatric subgroup analysis of 30 patients from Study 117 showed improvements in BMI [mean change from baseline: 1.1 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.6)] and weight [mean change from baseline 4.4 kg (95% CI: 3.3, 5.6)].

A numerical decrease in ppFEV1 was observed in the paediatric subgroup, the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline to the last available assessment within the 12-month post-index period was -

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2.9 percentage points (95% CI: -9.1, 3.4). The observed decrease is similar to the annualized rate of lung function decline reported in a published analysis of US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) registry data  in  patients  homozygous  for  F508del,  aged  13  through  17  years, not  treated with  a  CFTR modulator  (-2.66  percentage  points  per  year;  Wegener  et  al,  J  Cyst  Fibros.  2018;17(4):503-10) therefore not suggesting a positive trend on ppFEV1 However, given the small sample size of Study 117 paediatric subgroup and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made regarding the effect  of  Orkambi  treatment  on  ppFEV1  in  this  subgroup.  Of  note,  supportive  results  of  Orkambi effectiveness on ppFEV1 are coming from the larger, ongoing comparator-controlled PASS, on average from 2014 to 2018 the ppFEV1 decreased by 3.7 percentage points in the Orkambi Disease Progression Cohort and decreased by 6.9 percentage points in the Comparator Disease Progression Cohort.

No  major  differences,  although  with  numerical  slight  decreases,  were  observed  in  the  paediatric subgroup between pre-index period and post index period for: annualized PEx rate [PEx per patient per year (SD) was 1.1 (1.52) in the pre-index period and 0.9 (1.01) in the post-index period]; rate of hospitalizations [hospitalizations per patient per year (SD) was 1.2 (2.17) in the pre-index period and 0.8 (1.19) in the post-index period], outpatient  visits [outpatient  visits  per  patient  per  year) (SD) was 6.0 (4.62) in the pre-index period and 5.4 (2.81) in the post-index period], acute antibiotic prescriptions [acute antibiotic prescriptions per patient per year (SD) was 3.4 (4.03) in the pre-index period and 3.1 (5.01) in the post-index period], and the proportion  of  patients  with  positive  P. aeruginosa after  Orkambi  initiation  (56.7%  before  Orkambi  initiation  and  50%  after  Orkambi initiation). There were no lung transplants or deaths in the paediatric subgroup.

As  regards  to Use  of  CF  Medications  Other  than  Antibiotics ,  most  categories  of  concomitant medications  other  than  antibiotics  remained  unchanged  or  decreased  between  pre  and  post-index period, apart from the categories 'anti-flammatory drug' and 'diabetes control' that showed a 3.3% increase; however the interpretation of these data is limited, as most concomitant medications were categorized as 'Others' (18/30, 60% in the pre index period and 15/30, 50% in the post index period).

## Conclusion:

The MAH provided the requested descriptive results regarding Orkambi effectiveness in the subgroup of paediatric patients 12 through 17 years of age from Study 117. These data present limitations and should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  aged  12-17  years enrolled (N=30, among them N=17 'early initiators' and N=13 'late initiators'), the retrospective data collection from patient medical records and the exploratory nature of the study.

A more severe pattern of baseline disease characteristics was observed in early initiators as compared to late initiators.

Results  seem  not  suggesting  a  positive  trend  on  ppFEV1.  However,  given  the  small  sample  size  of Study 117 paediatric subgroup and the wide CI that crosses 0, no conclusions can be made. Of note, supportive  results  of  Orkambi  effectiveness  on  ppFEV1  are  coming  from  the  larger,  ongoing comparator-controlled PASS.

Increases in weight and BMI were observed in the paediatric subgroup between pre-index period and post  index  period.  There  were  no  major  differences  for  other  variables/outcomes;  slight  numerical decreases were observed.

## Issue resolved

## Question 2

In order to allow to contextualize the higher frequency of treatment discontinuation (20%) observed  in  Study  117  in  adolescents  12  through  17  years  of  age,  compared  to  the  one

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed in the same age range in pivotal clinical trials (1.0%, 3/290 subjects), baseline clinical characteristics of the subgroup of 30 paediatric subjects included in Study 117 are needed. Baseline clinical characteristics of the subgroup of 30 paediatric subjects included in  Study  117  should  be  discussed  by  the  MAH  in  comparison  with  baseline  clinical characteristics of adolescents 12 through 17 years of age, enrolled in the pooled placebocontrolled Phase 3 studies (pivotal Studies 103 and 104).

## Summary of the MAH's Response

The  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  30  paediatric  patients  from  Study  117  are discussed in the response to Question 1 and provided in Ad Hoc Table 24.

As  discussed  in  the  response  to  Question  1,  Study  117  paediatric  subgroup  results  should  be interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  exploratory  nature  of  the  study  and  the  small  sample  size.  In addition, it is not appropriate to compare baseline characteristics between a real-world evidence study and randomized, controlled clinical studies that differ with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion in Study 117 was based on a treatment initiation date within 6 months of Orkambi approval, while Studies 103/104 had inclusion and exclusion criteria relating to CF disease status, comorbidities, medical history, and ppFEV1.

A brief summary of the available baseline characteristics for the paediatric subgroups for both Study 117 and Studies 103/104 is provided in Table 2. A few baseline characteristics that were collected in Study 117 were not collected in Studies 103/104, including CF comorbid conditions, PEx, intravenous (IV) antibiotics, inpatient hospitalizations for CF, and CF-related PEx.

## Assessor's comment

The MAH provided the requested data.

It  is  acknowledged that comparing baseline characteristics between a real-world evidence study and randomized,  controlled  clinical  studies  presents  limitations  and  that  Study  117  paediatric  subgroup results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.

Some baseline characteristics that were collected in Study 117 were not collected in Studies 103/104, such as CF comorbid conditions

It is of note that ppFEV1 value of patients 12 to 17 years of age enrolled in Study 117 is higher (mean 89.5, SD 20.51) in comparison to patients of the same age range enrolled in pivotal studies 103/104 (mean 67.3, SD 13.0) underlying a quite different lung function as measured by ppFEV1 at baseline surely limiting indirect comparability of study results but possibly not substantially contributing to a higher treatment discontinuation observed in the 117 study.

Conclusion: The issue is not pursued further.

## Question 3

## The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  high  frequency  of  discontinuation  (35.8%)  and  to discuss available data on the reasons for discontinuations observed in the adult population of patients enrolled in Study 117.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The reasons for treatment discontinuation after first initiation in the overall population in Study 117 were  (in  order  of  most  common  to  least  common):  respiratory  adverse  event  (AE)  (39  patients [52.0%]), other reason (17 patients [22.7%]), other AE (9 patients [12.0%]), lack of effectiveness (5 patients [6.7%]), unknown (3 patients [4.0%]), and gastrointestinal AE (2 patients [2.7%]) (Study 117 CSR/Table 6). Additional information from the study case report forms (CRFs) that was entered by the site as free text is provided in Table 3 for the adult subgroup ( ≥ 18 years of age), and provides additional  context  for  those  patients  who  had ' other  reason'  and  'other  AE'  listed  as  the  primary reason for treatment discontinuation. Overall, the distribution of the primary reasons for discontinuation was generally consistent with that observed in clinical experience, with respiratory AEs being the most common, consistent with the SmPC.

Annual interim analysis results from the larger, registry-based, 5-year post-authorization safety study (PASS) Study 108 represents a more robust data set and indicates a lower discontinuation rate than that  observed  in  Study  117.  The  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Orkambi  Safety  Cohort  who  had  no record of Orkambi use in the subsequent calendar year suggests a discontinuation rate of 10.1% for the 2016 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N= 5,553) and 12.2% for the 2017 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N = 6,664). The data from this study, given the larger sample size and longer duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience.

- b These patients discontinued Orkambi after the first initiation of treatment and had a second discontinuation after re-initiation of Orkambi duringStudy 117.

## Assessor's comment

The MAH provided the requested data.

A high frequency of discontinuation (35.8%) was observed in the overall population of Study 117.

The reasons for treatment discontinuation were respiratory AEs (39 patients [52.0%]), other reason (17  patients  [22.7%]),  other  AE  (9  patients  [12.0%]),  lack  of  effectiveness  (5  patients  [6.7%]), unknown (3 patients [4.0%]), and gastrointestinal AE (2 patients [2.7%]) (Study 117 CSR/Table 6).

As  regards  to  discontinuation  categorized  as  'Other  reason'  or  'Other  AE',  the  MAH  provided  the information from the study case report forms (CRFs) that was entered by the site as free text: 5 out of 9 patients categorized as 'Other AEs' discontinued due to the following reasons (one patient each): psych  issues  and  abdominal  pain  issues,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  urinary  hesitancy/  headaches/  leg cramps, worsened depression, rash/ chest tightness.  Among the 17 patients that discontinued due to other reasons, most patients discontinued due to AEs [n=10; the AEs were the following: respiratory AEs (2), dizziness (2), cutaneous AE (2, including one event of Steven Johnson), elevated LFT (2), side effects unspecified (2)]. Two discontinuation each were due to death and organ transplant.

As regards to the types of AEs leading to discontinuation, the events were mostly known ADRs for Orkambi.

In the annual interim analysis results from the larger, registry-based, 5-year post-authorization safety study (PASS) Study 108,  the proportion of patients in the Orkambi Safety Cohort who had no record of Orkambi use in the subsequent calendar year suggests a discontinuation rate of 10.1% for the 2016 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N= 5,553) and 12.2% for the 2017 Orkambi Safety Cohort (N = 6,664).

## Conclusion:

A  high  frequency  of  discontinuation  (35.8%)  was  observed  in  the  overall  population  of  Study  117, however the adverse events leading to  discontinuation  were  mostly  known  ADRs  for  Orkambi.  It  is acknowledged that the data from the PASS study, given the larger sample size and longer duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience.

## Issue resolved

## Question 4

The MAH is requested to provide all available information (including age) of the 7 subjects requiring lung transplant after Orkambi initiation and of the 2 deaths observed during the post index period. The  higher proportion of patients requiring at least  one  organ transplantation  after  Orkambi  initiation  in  Study  117  (3.2%)  in  comparison  to  the proportion of patients with a history of any organ transplant (0.4%) in the Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108 should be discussed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Summary of the MAH's response

Table 26 provides the age at the time that Orkambi was prescribed for the 7 patients who had a lung transplant and the 2 patients who died during the post-index period. For death and organ transplant, there  was  no  option  in  the  CRFs  for  the  sites  to  provide  any  additional  description  regarding  these events. As such, no further information is available on these patients.

Thelisted patient numbers do not reflect individual study identificationnumbers.

As  discussed  previously,  Study  117  was  an  exploratory  chart  study  to  explore  the  early  treatment patterns  following  the  initial  US  approval.  The  ongoing  PASS  Study  108  is  a  comparator  controlled, registry-based study that is collecting real-world data from a much larger population of CF patients and over  a  longer  observational  period.  The  results  from  the  ongoing  PASS  have  demonstrated  a significantly  lower  risk  of  death  and  organ  transplantation  in  Orkambi-treated  patients  and  will continue to provide real-world data on the Orkambi experience.

## Assessor's comment

The age at the time that Orkambi was prescribed for the 7 patients who had a lung transplant ranged from 23 to 56 years of age. There were 2 patients who died during the post-index period. The MAH clarified  that  no  further  information  is  available  on  these  patients,  given  that  for  death  and  organ transplant, there was no option in the CRFs for the sites to provide any additional description regarding these events.

In the third interim analysis of the ongoing PASS, cconsistently with the previous 2 interim reports, the risk of death and organ transplant was statistically significantly lower in the Orkambi Cohort compared to the Comparator Cohort.

## Conclusion:

In Study 117, a higher proportion of patients (3.2%) required lung transplant after Orkambi initiation in  comparison  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  history  of  any  organ  transplant  (0.4%)  in  the Orkambi Safety Cohort in 2018 in PASS Study 108.

It  is  acknowledged  that  the  data  from  the  PASS  study,  given  the  larger  sample  size  and  longer duration, may be considered more representative of the real-world Orkambi experience.

## Issue resolved.

Overall, the MAH has addressed all questions raised during the procedure satisfactorily. There are no further points. The benefit-risk assessment is considered favourable.
