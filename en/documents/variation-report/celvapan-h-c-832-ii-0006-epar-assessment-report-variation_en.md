## =Introduction

Celvapan is a pandemic H1N1v vaccine. The strain change of the mock-up vaccine from H5N1 to H1N1v  was  approved  on  06/10/2009  (EMEA/H/C/982/PU/02).  As  committed  by  the  marketing authorisation holder (MAH), preliminary safety data from the ongoing clinical trials in children and adults  (including  the  elderly)  evaluating  different  H1N1v  vaccine  formulations  was  submitted. Following assesment of this data, the MAH was requested to update the product information to reflect the current safety information available. The variation was submitted on 19 October 2009.

| Dose Level   |   Cohort |   Adults 18-59 Years |   Elderly ≥ 60 Years |
|--------------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 7.5 µg       |        1 |                  100 |                  100 |
| 3.75 µg      |        1 |                  100 |                  100 |

The safety data provided differentiate between the two administered dose groups 3.75 µg and 7.5 µg, but do not distinguish between the two age groups of adults and elderly subjects.

Clinical Assessment Study 820902 adults (including the elderly) Design and demographics of clinical study 820902 Study 820902 is a phase I/II prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre study designed to assess immunogenicity and safety of an investigational H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in healthy subjects aged 18 years of age and older. Primary Objective The  primary  objective  of  the  study  is  to  measure  the  immune  response,  as  determined  by  HI (haemagglutination inhibition) assay. Secondary Objectives · To assess the immune response as determined by microneutralisation (MN) assay · To identify the optimal dose level of an investigational H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine · To investigate the safety characteristics Subjects were recruited in equal numbers to two age strata of 18 to 59 years of age (Stratum A) and 60 years of age and older (Stratum B). Within each stratum, subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of the whole virion, Vero cell-derived influenza vaccine at the same dose level of either 3.75 µg or 7.5 µg of H1N1v (A/California/07/2009) HA antigen (Cohort 1) on Day 1 and Day 22. Cohort 1 consists of approximately 400 subjects (200 adults, 200 elderly). Enrolment started in August 2009 and 411 adult and elderly subjects were included in cohort 1. Subjects of cohort 1 were vaccinated with 7.5 µg or 3.75 µg HA of the pandemic vaccine. Currently only a snapshot of the safety data base is available. Snapshot of the safety data base 21 days after the first vaccination Medicinal product no longer authorised

The preliminary analysis of the safety data base throughout a 21 days observation period after the first vaccination demonstrates a favourable safety profile (Table 1).

headache 10 (5.1) malaise 5 (2.6) fatique 15 (7.7) muscle pain 4 (2.1) joint pain 3 (1.5) local reactions 16 (8.2) Local reactions occurred at a low rate, i. e. 8.2 % and 6.8 % in subjects vaccinated with the 3.75 µg and 7.5 µg doses, respectively. Local reactions  were  considered by  subjects  mostly  mild  and  only  for  one  case  it  was  recorded  as severe reaction. This event started on the day of the first vaccination and lasted for one day. The frequency of systemic reactions either combined or individually was low, i.e. 14.4 % and 17.7 % in subjects vaccinated with the 3.75 µg and the 7.5 µg dose. Only 4 fever cases were observed within 387  subjects  with  onset  days  3,  4,  5  and  8  days  after  the  vaccination.  The  three  cases  of  fever occurring  in  subjects  who  received  the  7.5  µg  dose  were  of  moderate  severity  (between  38.5°  and 38.9°C) whereas the fever case in one subject vaccinated with the 3.75 µg dose was of mild severity (between 38.0°C and 38.4°C). The fever resolved within 1-2 days. Systemic reactions (fatigue, sweating, headache, muscle pain and joint pain) were observed by 62 out of 387 subjects and were generally described as mild.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two serious adverse events (SAEs) considered unrelated occurred within 21 days after vaccination:

- pulmonary embolism (10 days after vaccination) and
- one case of dialysis of the retina of the right eye; the patient was hospitalised for surgery.

Some events, which might be summarised as allergic reactions were observed, such as burning eyes, warm sensation at vaccination site, exanthema and allergic rhinitis.

Study 820903 (6 months to 17 years) This  study  is  an  ongoing  open-label  phase  I/II  study  to  assess  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of 2 different  dose  levels  of  H1N1  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  in  healthy  infants,  children  and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years. Study  subjects  will  be  stratified  into  4  age  strata  with  each  stratum  consisting  of  approximately 100 subjects (Total N = 400). Planned number of subjects: Snapshot of the safety data base 7 days after the first vaccination The  analysis was  conducted  on the available data  from all subjects (N=146)  available on 22 September 2009. Enrolement started on 07 September 2009. In Cohort 1 of the study, a total of 101 children and adolescents aged 9 - 17 years were vaccinated in Stratum  A,  24  children  aged  3  -8  years  in  Stratum  B  and  21  infants  and  young  children  aged 6 - 35 months in Strata C and D. In all 3 age strata, children were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the 3.75 µg or the 7.5 µg dose of the vaccine.

Inconsolable  or  excessive  crying  occurred  in  one  child  in  the  3.75  µg  dose  group  only,  whereas shivering, nausea, sweating, irritability, loss of appetite and drowsiness were not reported at all in this age  group.  In  one  of  these  subjects,  fever  was  associated  with  additional  systemic  reactions  (mild disturbed sleep).

<!-- image -->

Sweating was not reported at all in both age groups. The single fever case in the age group of the 9-17 years  old  occurred  in  a  12-year  old  subject  and  was  not  associated  with  any  other  systemic symptom. Fever occurred in the age group of 3-8 years three times and was reported once in the 7.5 µg group associated with additional systemic symptoms (mild malaise). Only one child who received the higher dose, experienced local reactions in this age group. Summary of adverse experiences reported after the first vaccination in children 6-35 months Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The few reported fever  cases  did not  show temperatures  above  38.9°C  in  all  dose  and  age  groups. Mostly the fever persisted for less than 24 hours. Two fever cases in children aged 6-35 months lasted 3  days  (one  in  each  dose  group).  The  day  of  onset  of  the  fever  cases  varied  in  all  strata  between day 0 and day 4.

No SAE occurred within the first 7 days after the vaccinations.

CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION The MAH was requested to update the product information to include the following statement: SPC (summary of product chracteristics): Clinical Trials with Celvapan (H1N1) Limited preliminary safety data after the first  dose  from  clinical trials in  adults  aged  over  18  years (N=387) and children aged  from  9  to  17  years  (N=101),  3  to  8  years  (N=24)  and  6  to  35  months (N=21)  investigating  two  different  dose  levels  (3.75µg  or  7.5µg)  of  Celvapan  H1N1v  suggest  a comparable safety profile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation. PL (package leaflet): From ongoing clinical trials, where a first dose of Celvapan (H1N1) was given to a limited number of adults, elderly and children similar adverse events were observed in the first days after vaccination to those previously seen with Celvapan (H5N1) vaccine. Annex  II  was  amended  to  reflect  the  fulfilment  of  the  appropriate  specific  obligations,  reflecting submission of the requested data. The MAH submitted updated annexes including the above mentioned change and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. OVERALL DISCUSSION AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT The CHMP noted that the preliminary data reported for the ongoing studies in children  and adults (including  the  elderly)  are  only  a  snapshot  the  safety  data,  which  were  not  audited  and  cleaned. Notwithstanding this fact, the data suggest a comparable safety profile to that reported for the mock-up vaccine and this should be reflected in the product information. Adults (including the elderly) The data demonstrate a comparable safety profile to that observed for seasonal flu vaccines and in previous clinical trials with the H5N1 mock-up vaccine. The analysis stratified into the respective age strata of the adults and elderly revealed that in general regardless of the vaccine formulation administered slightly more adverse reactions were reported for adults compared with elderly subjects. Only headache occurred more frequently in adults (~ 12%) than the elderly (5.2%). The  information  on  the  preliminary  day  21  safety  data  reported  was  included  in  the  product information. Children Medicinal product no longer authorised

The majority of subjects who experienced symptoms reported symptoms of mild severity in all age groups regardless of the dose used. Very few symptoms of moderate severity were reported and local or systemic adverse reactions of severe severity were not reported.

Although data on a very low number subjects, especially in the lower age groups, is available, overall the  safety  database  involving  146  subjects  might  suggest  a  favourable  safety  profile  with  regard  to systemic reactions. This limited and preliminary information was included in the product information.
