<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Eligible participants were healthy Japanese boys aged 9 to 15 years or girls aged 9 to 14 years who had not yet had coitarche and had not previously received an HPV vaccine.

## Treatments

HPV Type 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 vaccine contains L1 VLP 30/40/60/40/20/20/20/20/20 μ g respectively in 0.5 mL per dose. A total of 3 vaccinations were given on Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6 or 2 vaccinations on Day 1 and Month 6.

## Objectives/ endpoints

Primary immunogenicity objectives: To estimate percent seroconversion for the vaccine HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58) at Month 7 in Japanese aged 9 to 15 years who received the 9vHPV vaccine.

- -Boys after 3 doses
- -Boys after 2 doses
- -Girls after 2 doses

Endpoints: Serum antibody titer to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 measured using cLIA binding assay

Safety primary objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 9vHPV vaccine in Japanese boys aged 9 to 15 years who received 3 doses and Japanese boys and girls aged 9 to 14 years who received 2 doses of the 9vHPV vaccine.

Endpoints: -Solicited injection-site adverse events

- Systemic adverse events
- Serious adverse events

Secondary immunogenicity objectives: To estimate the immune response for the vaccine HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58) at Month 7 including geometric mean titers (GMTs) in Japanese aged 9 to 15 years who received the 9vHPV vaccine for the same subgroups named above.

Exploratory objective: to assess the persistence of anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 antibody responses at Month 18 and 30.

## Sample size

The planned enrolment total was 300 participants (100 in the 3-dose boy arm, 100 in the 2- dose boy arm, 100 in the 2-dose girl arm). A total of 314 participants were allocated/randomized (105 allocated/randomized to the 3-dose boy arm, 104 allocated/randomized to the 2-dose boy arm, 105 allocated to the 2-dose girl arm).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

The study was open labelled. IRT system was used to allocate participants to either the 3-dose or 2dose regimen arms based on gender and age at the time of providing the informed consent.

Fifteen-years-old boys were assigned to the 3-dose regimen arm until the boys 3-dose regimen arms reaches 100 participants. Girls aged 9 to 14 years were assigned to the 2- dose regimen arm without randomization until the girls 2-dose regimen arm reaches 100 participants.

## Statistical Methods

The primary population for the analysis of immune response was per protocol population (PPI), which consisted of participants who received study vaccine with the correct dose within acceptable day ranges, had provided blood samples for serology testing within 21 to 49 days post last dose, was seronegative to the appropriate HPV type(s) at Day 1, and had no other protocol violations that could interfere with the evaluation of participant's immune response to the study vaccine.

The primary immunogenicity endpoints were seroconversion to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 at 1 month post last dose (Month 7) following 3 doses and 2 doses of the 9vHPV vaccine. Seroconversion to a specific HPV type was defined as changing serostatus from seronegative at Day 1 to seropositive at 1 month post last dose (Month 7). Percent seroconversion was evaluated by computing point estimates and constructing 95% CI of the percentage of participants who seroconvert at 1 month post last dose (Month 7). Calculation of the 95% CI of percent seroconversion was based on the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson.

The key secondary endpoints were cLIA GMTs for anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 at 1 month post last dose (Month 7) following 3 doses and 2 doses of the 9vHPV vaccine. GMTs and corresponding 95% CIs were derived by taking the anti-logarithm of the mean and corresponding 95% CI of the mean of the log-transformed anti-HPV titers.

The key safety endpoint was to summarize for each study arm the incidence of solicited injection-site Adverse Events (AEs) (redness/erythema, swelling, and tenderness/pain) occurring Days 1 to 5 following any vaccination, systemic AEs occurring Days 1 to 15 following any vaccination, SAEs, and serious vaccine-related AEs occurring any time during the study.

Safety analysis was conducted in the all participants as treated (APaT) population, which consisted of all participants who received at least 1 dose of 9vHPV vaccine and have provided safety data at any time during the study. Participants were included in the study arm corresponding to the study vaccination regimen they actually received for the analysis of safety data using the APaT population.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 105 participants (9- to 14-year-old girls) were randomized to receive 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine at Day 1 and Month 6; 104 participants received at least 1 dose of 9vHPV vaccine, completed 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine, and completed the study. One participant was allocated/randomized but did not receive the study intervention due to withdrawal by participant prior to vaccination [Table 1].

A total of 104 participants (9- to 14-year-old boys) were randomized to receive 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine at Day 1 and Month 6; all 104 participants received at least 1 dose of 9vHPV vaccine, received 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine, and completed the study [Table 1].

A total of 105 participants (9- to 15-year-old boys) were randomized to receive 3 doses of 9vHPV vaccine at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6; 104 participants received at least 1 dose of 9vHPV vaccine,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

103 participants received 3 doses of 9vHPV vaccinations, and 101 participants completed the study. One participant was allocated/randomized but did not receive the study intervention due to physician decision prior to vaccination. One participant received only 2 doses of the study vaccine (at Day 1 and Month 2) and did not complete all doses of protocol-specified study intervention. Two participants discontinued during the Extension Phase after completion of the specified number of vaccinations. The reasons of study discontinuation after vaccination were all withdrawal by participants.

## Immunogenicity analysis population

The primary immunogenicity analyses (Table 2.) of the Base Phase and Extension Phase were conducted in the PPI population consisting of individuals who:

- -Received all required vaccinations of 9vHPV vaccine with the correct dose within acceptable day ranges
- -Provided blood samples for serology testing within 21 to 49 days post last dose
- -Were seronegative to the appropriate HPV type(s) at Day 1
- -Had no other protocol violations that could interfere with the evaluation of participant's immune response to the study vaccine.

Positive by serology is defined as having an anti-HPV cLIA titer ≥ the serostatus cutoff values of 65, 37, 79, 85, 46, 26, 21, 30 and 31 milli Merck Units/mL for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33,45,52 and 58, respectively.

Percentages are calculated as 100*(m/n).

The Cls are computed based on exact binominal methods proposed by Clopper and Pearson.

N = Number of participants enrolled to the respective vaccination group who received at least 1 injection.

n = Number of participants contributing to the analysis.

m = Number of participants seropositive to the relevant HPV type.

CI =Confidence interval; cLIA =Competitive Luminex immunoassay;

Positive by serology is defined as having an anti-HPV cLIA titer ≥ the serostatus cutoff values of 65, 37, 79, 85, 46, 26, 21, 30 and 31 milli Merck Units/mL for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, respectively.

Percentages are calculated as 100*(m/n).

The CIs are computed based on exact binominal methods proposed by Clopper and Pearson.

N = Number of participants enrolled to the respective vaccination group who received at least I injection.

- n = Number of participants contributing to the analysis.

m = Number of participants seropositive to the relevant HPV type.

CI = Confidence interval; cLIA = Competitive Luminex immunoassay;

## Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses

In the PPI population, GMTs in 9- to 14-year-old girls and boys who received 2 doses and 9- to 15year-old boys who received 3 doses increased substantially for all 9 vaccine-targeted HPV types at Month 7 following completion of the assigned 9vHPV vaccine regimen.

## Tertiary/Exploratory Analyses

Administration of a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine to boys 9- to 15-years-old and a 2-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine to boys and girls 9- to 14-years-old induced antibody responses to all 9 vaccinetargeted HPV types that generally persisted through Month 18 and Month 30.

Percentages of participants who were seropositive at Month 30 ranged from 93.0% to 100.0% in girls 9- to 14-years-old (2-dose regimen), 82.1% to 99.0% in boys 9- to 14-years-old (2-dose regimen), and 89.1% to 99.0% in boys 9- to 15-years-old (3-dose regimen), depending on the HPV type (Table 5).

## Safety results

## Safety population

Safety analysis was conducted in the APaT population, which consisted of all participants who received at least 1 dose of 9vHPV vaccine and have provided safety data at any time during the study. Participants were included in the study arm corresponding to the study vaccination regimen they received for the analysis of safety data using the APaT population (ie, 3 doses [Day 1, Month 2, Month 6 regimen] or 2 doses [Day 1, Month 6 regimen] of 9vHPV vaccine).

## Overall Adverse Events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Injection-site Adverse Events

Overall, 88.5% of the 9- to 14-year-old girls who received 2 doses (2-dose girl arm), 81.7% of the 9to 14-year-old boys who received 2 doses (2-dose boy arm), and 84.5% of the 9- to 15-year-old boys who received 3 doses (3-dose boy arm) reported at least 1 injection-site AE from Days 1 to 5 following any vaccination visit. The most frequently reported (≥5%) injection -site AEs were pain, swelling, erythema, and pruritus across all participants.

Most injection-site AEs from Day 1 to Day 5 following any vaccination visit were mild or moderate in intensity. One participant each in the 2-dose girl arm and 2-dose boy arm reported injection-site pain of severe intensity. Both events resolved by 4 days or less following vaccination.

Of the participants with solicited injectionsite AEs of erythema and swelling, the majority were 0 to ≤1 inch in size.

- Injectionsite erythema &gt;1 inch to ≤3 inches in maximum size was reported for 4 participants each in the 2-dose girl arm and the 3-dose boy arm, and 1 participant in the 2-dose boy arm.
- Injectionsite swelling &gt;1 inch to ≤4 inches in maximum size was reported for 14 participants in the 2-dose girl arm, 8 participants in the 2-dose boy arm, and 15 participants in the 3-dose boy arm.
- All injectionsite swelling or erythema of &gt;2 inches to ≤4 inches in size resolved within 1 week in the 2-dose boy and girl arms and the 3-dose boy arm.

## Systemic Adverse Events

Overall, 31.7% of participants in the 2-dose girl arm, 39.4% of participants in the 2-dose boy arm, and 53.4% of participants in the 3-dose boy arm reported at least 1 systemic AE from Days 1 to 15 following any vaccination visit. The most frequently repor ted (≥5.0%) systemic AEs were pyrexia and headache. In addition, nasopharyngitis was also reported for 5.8% of participants in the 3-dose boy arm.

Overall, 15.4% of participants in the 2-dose girl arm, 20.2% of participants in the 2-dose boy arm, and 29.1% of participants in the 3-dose boy arm reported at least 1 vaccine-related systemic AE from Days 1 to 15 following any vaccination visit. The most frequently (≥5.0%) reported vaccine -related systemic AEs were pyrexia and headache. Headache was reported for 4.8% of participants in the 2-dose boy arm.

Overall, the majority of systemic AEs from Day 1 to Day 15 following any dose of vaccine were mild or moderate in intensity. One participant in the 3-dose boy arm experienced a severe vaccine-related systemic AE (malaise) as assessed by the investigator. The event occurred on the day of Vaccination 2 (Day 50) and resolved within 5 days.

## Elevated Temperatures

No participants had a maximum temperature ≥38.0°C in the 2 -dose girl arm.

No participants in the 2-dose boy arm or the 3dose boy arm had a maximum temperature ≥38.5°C.

## Serious Adverse Events

No deaths and no vaccine-related SAEs were reported during the entire study.

From Day 1 through end of study, SAEs were reported for 3 participants (2.9%) in the 2-dose girl arm and for 2 participants (1.9%) in the 2-dose boy arm. All reported SAEs resolved; no SAEs were reported in the 3-dose boy arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discontinuations Due to an AE

There were no discontinuations from study vaccination due to an AE during the entire study.

## Summary of Safety Results

- The most common injection-site AEs were pain, swelling, erythema, and pruritus. Most injection-site AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Most injection-site AEs of erythema and swelling were ≤1 inch in size.
- The most common systemic AEs were pyrexia and headache. Most systemic AEs were mild or moderate in intensity.
- No vaccine-related SAEs were reported. No participant died during the study. No participant discontinued the study vaccination due to AEs.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Administration of the 3-dose and 2 -dose regimen of the 9vHPV vaccine to 9-to 15-year-old Japanese boys and girls demonstrated 100% seroconversion percentages for all vaccine included HPV types at 1 month post last dose and induced durable immune responses for 18 and 30 months post- vaccination.

The results are in agreement with previously reported studies. No concern regarding lacking efficacy is raised from this study.

The study population was relatively small (about N=100 in each arm, altogether N=300) and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low. The safety results are also in agreement with previously reported studies. No new safety concern is raised from this study.

## 3. Rapporteur's CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concern. The P46 procedure is considered fulfilled.
