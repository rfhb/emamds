## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Intelence, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In line with published data, etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin were found to decrease by 23%, 24% and 29%, respectively, when co-administered with boceprevir. Boceprevir AUC and Cmax increased by 10% and Cmin decreased by 12% in this combination. Co-infections with hepatitis C virus and HIV are frequent. The clinical significance of reductions in etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters and boceprevir Cmin, especially in the setting of the combination therapy with HIV antiretroviral medicines, which also affect the pharmacokinetics of etravirine and/or boceprevir, is unknown. This warrants introduction of a corresponding warning in the SmPC of etravirine, in line with the already existing warning in the SmPC of boceprevir.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

In addition, minor editorial changes are made in the recommended wording on interactions with boceprevir, in order to improve consistency with other parts of the Product Information of Intelence.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Intelence, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance etravirine is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
