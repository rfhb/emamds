## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (P/277/2011) for the following condition(s):

- Treatment of autoimmune arthritis

on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Tocilizumab  (RoActemra)  is  a  recombinant  humanized  anti-human  monoclonal  antibody  of  the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) sub-class directed against the soluble and membrane-bound interleukin 6 receptor (sIL-6R and mIL-6R).

RoActemra is authorised for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists and for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

In both indications for adult RA patients, RoActemra can be given as in combination with MTX or as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

Juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  is  arthritis  of  at  least  6  weeks  duration  of  unknown  aetiology  that begins  in  children  less  than  16  years  old.  Although  less  common  than  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in adults,  JIA  is  one  of  the  most  common  systemic  autoimmune  systemic  autoimmune  diseases  in children and adolescents. According the ILAR scheme JIA is classified in 7 categories

Figure 1. Frequency, age at onset and gender distribution of ILAR categories of JIA

| Subset                       | Frequency   | Onset Age                                                                   | Gender Ratio   |
|------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Systemic JIA                 | 4% - 17%    | Throughout childhood                                                        | F = M          |
| Oligoarthritis               | 27% -56%    | Early childhood; peak at 2-4 years                                          | F >>> M        |
| RF-positive polyarthritis    | 2% - 7%     | Late childhood or adolescence; peak at 10-14 years                          | F >> M         |
| RF-negative polyarthritis    | 11% -28%    | Biphasic distribution; early peak at 2-4 years and later peak at 6-12 years | F >> M         |
| Enthesitis-related arthritis | 3% - 11%    | Late childhood or adolescence                                               | M >> F         |
| Psoriatic arthritis          | 2% - 11%    | Biphasic distribution; early peak at 2-4 years and later peak at 9-11 years | F >> M         |
| Undifferentiated Arthritis   | 2% - 15%    |                                                                             |                |

* Reported frequencies refer to percentage of all juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

F: female; M: male; RF: rheumatoid factor.

In the present submission, the polyarticular JIA (pJIA) population studied in the phase III clinical study WA19977  consists  of  three  subsets:  rheumatoid  factor (RF)-positive polyarthritis,  RF-negative polyarthritis, and extended oligoarthritis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The current submission aims to extend the indication of RoActemra to the treatment in combination with methotrexate (MTX) of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX.

## 2.2.2. Clinical Pharmacology

Data on the PK and PD characteristics of TCZ have been previously submitted as part of the initial MAA and as part of variation II/15 to extend the indication of TCZ to the treatment of sJIA. This submission includes new data in pJIA patients. The TCZ clinical pharmacology program for pJIA was conducted to characterize the PK and PD of TCZ as well as the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships. These  data  are  presented  below  and  are  based  on  studies  WA19977,  MRA318JP  and  MRA319JP. Population PK analyses were performed for studies WA19977 and MRA318JP.

## 2.2.2.1. Pharmacokinetics

## Methods of analysis

In Part I of the pivotal study, blood samples for PK (TCZ serum concentrations) and PD (IL-6 and sIL6R)  analysis  were  collected  pre-dose  and  post-dose  (within  15  minutes  following  the  saline  flush marking the end of infusion) on Day 1; at the Week 4, 8, and 12; at any time during Weeks 1, 2, 6, and 10; and pre-dose at Week 16. In part II of the study,  pre-dose  blood  samples  for  PK  and  PD analysis were collected at the Week 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 visits, and additional samples were taken at any time during Weeks 18 and 22.

The presence of anti-TCZ antibodies was assessed at baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and at Week 40. In part II of the study, the visit when JIA ACR30 flare relative to Week 16 had occurred was designated 'the flare visit'. At the first visit when the flare definition was met, an additional sample was obtained for assessment of potential anti-TCZ antibodies.

## PK Results

Nonlinear  mixed  effects  modeling  was  used  to  analyse  the  serum  concentration-time  TCZ  data collected in study WA19977. The population PK dataset consisted of 2631 TCZ serum concentrations from 188 pJIA patients. The serum concentration-time course for TCZ in patients with pJIA was best described  by  a  two-compartment  disposition  pharmacokinetic  model  with  parallel  first-order  and Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics.

A trend towards lower exposures in non-responders compared with responders, across JIA ACR30/50/70/90  was  observed.  This  is  even  more  pronounced  for  JIA  ACR30  and  JIA  ACR50. Comparing the mean PK exposures across non-responders for JIA ACR30/50/70/90, there is a trend towards lower exposures in the least responsive patients (i.e. JIA ACR30 non-responders).

In  contrast,  when  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  exposures  were  compared  across  responders  for  JIA ACR30/50/70/90, there was no trend observed.

## Immunogenicity (Part I and II)

One patient (patient 2342) developed positive neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies at Week 20. Available post  dose  PK  concentrations  from  baseline  through  week  12  were  comparable  to  those  from  other patients. Because this patient did not receive TCZ dosing at Week 8, she did not have model-computed PK exposure results from the study.

## 2.2.2.2. Pharmacodynamics

Following  TCZ  dosing,  pronounced  changes  were  observed  in  the  inflammatory  markers  C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The decline in median CRP concentrations and median ESR occurred rapidly, within the first two weeks of TCZ dosing. The observed changes in CRP and ESR were similar between the 10 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (≥30 kg) treatment groups, but were smaller in magnitude in the 8 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) group. The median CRP levels stabilized by week 8 for the 10 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (≥30 kg) groups but not until week 16 for the 8 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) group. The median ESR was lower in the 10 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (≥30 kg) treatment groups compared to the 8 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) group from week 2 through week 16.

## 2.2.2.3. Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

Data on the PK and PD characteristics of TCZ have been previously submitted as part of the initial MAA and as part of variation II/15 to extend the indication of TCZ to the treatment of sJIA. This submission includes new data in pJIA patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Comparable exposure between the 10 mg/kg dose in the lower bodyweight patients (&lt;30 kg) and the patients in the 8 mg/kg (≥30 kg) was observed, although a trend to somewhat lower exposure even in the higher dose for the lower bodyweight patients (&lt;30 kg) was observed. Exposure in patients (&lt;30 kg) dosed with 8 mg/kg was consistently lower compared to the other two dose groups. Of note, a different dosage was selected for the sJIA study. In this study it was demonstrated that doses of 8 and 12 mg/kg in the respective body weight groups lead to almost 100% bioequivalent exposure (shown for the two-weekly application). However, it is reassuring that the 8 and 10 mg/kg have demonstrated comparable efficacy in the respective patient groups.

Comparing the PK exposure to the JIA ACR30/50/70/90 response, a trend towards lower exposures in non-responders compared with responders, across  JIA  ACR30/50/70/90  was  observed.  This  is  even more  pronounced  for  JIA  ACR30  and  JIA  ACR50.  Comparing  the  mean  PK  exposures  across  nonresponders for JIA ACR30/50/70/90, there is a trend towards lower exposures in the least responsive patients (i.e. JIA ACR30 non-responders).

In  contrast,  when  the  mean  pharmacokinetic  exposures  were  compared  across  responders  for  JIA ACR30/50/70/90,  there  was  no  trend  observed.  The  Applicant  suggested  that  lower  exposures  are associated  with  complete  non-response  (failure  to  achieve  JIA  ACR30),  whereas,  in  responders, variability  in  degree  of  response  (between  JIA  ACR30  and  90)  is  explained  by  factors  other  than variability  in  PK  exposure.  However  there  is  an  overlap  of  patients  in  the  responder  groups.  The relationship  was  based  on  cumulative  AUC  rather  than  single  dose  interval  AUC.  The  MAH  was requested  during  the  evaluation  to  provide  the  percentage  of  ACR  30/50/70/90  response,  the percentage  of  'ACR30  flare:  no'  reached  and  the  percentage  of  dosage  regimen  applied  (8  or  10 mg/kg) for each of the exposure quartile groups.

From  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  it  seems  there  is  no  straight  relationship  between  single-dose exposure  data  and  responder  rates.    Paradoxically  the  responder  rates  of  the  lowest  and  highest Ctrough quartiles are similar and between them the responder rates are somewhat lower. Due to the small sample size it cannot be decided that the observed U type relationship is a chance finding or a real phenomenon. This statement is particularly true for the &lt;30 kg weight group where are very few observations or sometimes even zero observations per cells.

Comparing the PK exposure to the safety profile no consistent trend of an increased risk of AEs with increased  exposure  was  observed.  A  relationship  between  TCZ  exposure  and  neutrophil  loss  was demonstrated in adult RA patients and in sJIA patients. Thus the higher incidence of infections in the highest exposure quartile (Q4) compared to the other quartiles is not unexpected.

Observed and model-computed PK parameters for the 10 mg/kg dose in patients weighing &lt;30 kg to PK exposures, in both part I and part II, were more comparable to the 8 mg/kg dose in pJIA patients weighing ≥30 kg than for the 8 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) group. Especially comparable efficacy outcomes (JIA ACR response and JADAS27 change from baseline) for the 10 mg/kg dose in patients weighing &lt; 30 kg and the 8 mg/kg dose in patients weighing ≥ 30 kg was demonstrated.

In contrast, no clear PK / safety relationship was observed. Thus the recommended dose of 10 mg/kg for pJIA patients weighing less than 30 kg and 8 mg for patients weighing &gt;30 kg is acceptable.

## 2.2.2.4. Conclusions on Clinical Pharmacology

The MAH submitted with this extension of indication population PK analyses for studies WA19977 and MRA318JP.

The results for PK, PD, and exposure-response relationship from study WA19977 demonstrate that the lower exposure observed in patients who received the dose of 8 mg/kg in the low weight band was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

associated  with  less  marked  change  in  PD  markers  and  sub-optimal  efficacy.  Conversely,  in  the exposure range corresponding to the dose of 10 mg/kg in the lower weight band and to 8 mg/kg in the upper  weigh  band,  the  PD  and  efficacy  were  constant  indicating  a  plateau  of  the  TCZ  exposure response curve was reached. In contrast to the evident PK-PD and PK-efficacy relationship, there was no clear exposure-safety relationship. These results demonstrate that optimal benefit can be achieved without an increased safety risk. Therefore, the dose of TCZ for the treatment of pJIA should be 10 mg/kg for patients weighing &lt; 30 kg and 8 mg/kg for patients weighing ≥30 kg is supported by the CHMP.

## 2.2.3. Clinical Efficacy

## Study WA19977

## Methods

Study WA19977was a 24-week randomized double-blind, placebo controlled withdrawal trial with a 16week open-label lead-in phase, and 64-week open-label follow-up, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Figure 2. Overview of Study Design

<!-- image -->

104 weeks

Part I consisted of a 16-week active treatment lead in period, followed by Part II a randomized blinded withdrawal  for  a  maximum  of  24  weeks  or  occurrence  of  JIA  ACR30  flare  (compared  to  week  16). Beginning  at  week  16,  patients  with  at  least  a  JIA  ACR30  response  compared  to  baseline  were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to enter the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) to either receive placebo or continue on active tocilizumab treatment at the same dose received in Part I.

No  reductions  or  changes  of  concomitant  NSAIDs,  corticosteroids  or  methotrexate  dosing  were permitted during Part I and II, except for documented safety reasons.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Part III which is currently ongoing is a 64 week open-label period beginning at week 40 to examine the long  term  use  of  tocilizumab  on  safety  and  efficacy.  In  patients  not  receiving  corticosteroids  with inactive  disease  for  at  least  6  months,  methotrexate  tapering/discontinuation  was  considered  if applicable.

## Study participants

The target patient population of study WA19977 was patients of 2 to 17 years of age with documented evidence for at least 6 months prior to study entry of RF-positive or RF negative pJIA or of extended oligoarticular  arthritis  according to  ILAR  criteria.  Disease  had  to be  active  at  screening  and  baseline with  at  least  five  joints  with  active  arthritis  (joints  that  were  swollen  or  if  no  swelling  was  present limitation of movement accompanied by pain, tenderness or both), with at least 3 of the active joints having  limitation  of  motion.  The  patients  also  had  to  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to methotrexate  (MTX)  or  inability  to  tolerate  MTX.  Patients  previously  treated  with  any  cell  depleting therapy, including any investigational agents (e.g. anti-CD19 and anti-CD20) were not permitted in the study.

The  following  JIA  subtypes  were  not  included  in  the  study  population:  systemic  arthritis,  persistent oligoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis.

## Treatments

Part I: Active treatment lead-in period, every 4 weeks for 4 doses. The total duration was 16 weeks with dosing at baseline, Weeks 4, 8 and 12.

- &lt;30 kg randomized 1:1 to either TCZ 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion
- ≥30 kg TCZ 8 mg/kg IV infusion

Part II: Double-blind withdrawal period. All subjects were randomized to either:

- TCZ (at the same dose as Part I)
- Placebo

This withdrawal period lasted from Week 16 through Week 40 with the last dose at Week 36.

Part III: Open-Label (Part I dose resumed)

Concurrent use of DMARDs and immunosuppressants other than methotrexate was not permitted in the study. Oral corticosteroids were allowed concomitantly during the study.

In Part III of the study concomitant medications were allowed to be reduced for efficacy only according in the following order: oral corticosteroids first, methotrexate second and NSAIDs last.

## Objectives

## Primary Objective (from Part II)

The primary objective of the study was to compare the proportion of patients on tocilizumab (TCZ) versus placebo who developed a juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology 30 (ACR30) flare (compared to Week 16) by Week 40.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary Objectives

- To evaluate the efficacy of open-label TCZ therapy (Part I)
- To evaluate the long-term effect of TCZ on the maintenance of clinical response and safety in patients with polyarticular JIA (pJIA) (Parts II and III)
- To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 8 mg/kg vs. 10 mg/kg in patients &lt;30 kg (Parts I, II and III)

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Part I (not exhaustive)

- JIA ACR Core set

Clinical  measures  of  efficacy  were  evaluated  by  comparing  the  following  JIA  ACR  core  outcome variables to baseline values. JIA ACR responses were defined as follows:

- o JIA ACR30 response was defined as 3 of any 6 core outcome variables improved by at least  30%  from  the  baseline  assessments,  with  no  more  than  1  of  the  remaining variables worsened by more than 30%
- o JIA ACR50/70/90 responses were defined in a similar manner for 50%, 70% and 90% improvements.
- JADAS-27

Juvenile  Arthritis  Disease  Activity  Score  (JADAS-27),  a  composite  disease:  derived  from  6  variables including:

- Parent/patient global assessment of overall wellbeing
- Physician global assessment of disease activity
- Normalised ESR
- Arthritis activity at 27 selected joints Number of joints with limitation of movement
- ESR
- Functional Ability determined by CHAQ Disability Index.

The patient were deemed to have responded if 3 of the 6 core variables have improved by at least 30% at week 16 and not more than one of the other core variables has worsened by 30% or more.

## Part II

JIA ACR30 flare was defined for Part II of the study as a change from Week 16 of:

- At least 3 of the 6 JIA ACR components worsening by at least 30% and
- No more than 1 of the remaining JIA ACR components improving by no more than 30%.

Additional  criteria  addressing  worsening  in  patients  with  a  very  low  Week  16  score  (ie,  30% improvement had to be substantive) were also specified.

## Sample size

Assuming a 35% flare rate in the TCZ arm and a 65% flare rate in the placebo arm, 60 patients with polyarticular-course JIA were to be randomized per arm in Part II to achieve at least 80% power to detect this difference applying a Type I error of 0.05 (2-sided). In order to achieve these numbers 185 patients were to be recruited into Part I of the study.

## Randomisation

Randomization in part II to TCZ or placebo in a 1:1 ratio was stratified by concurrent methotrexate use and concurrent corticosteroid use.

## Blinding

Part II of the study was a 24-week double-blind withdrawal period. Patients entering the withdrawal period of the study (Part II) were randomized equally to receive either TCZ or placebo, stratified by methotrexate and oral corticosteroid use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To  preserve  the  blind,  various  vial  combinations  based  on  the  patient's  weight  with  identical appearance for both treatments were used. To prevent potential blind breaks due to observed efficacy or laboratory changes a 'dual assessor' approach was used to evaluate efficacy and safety during Part I and Part II of the study. The joint assessor performing all joint examinations in Part I and Part II was blinded.  CRP  results  after  the  first  dose  of  study  drug  remained  blinded  to  all  study  participants  in order to preserve the blind during Part II.

## Statistical methods

For  study  parts  I  and  II  all  efficacy  parameters  were  summarized  by  statistical  characteristics, depending of the type of data, stratified by treatment and visit (if appropriate).

The main efficacy analysis population was the ITT population in Part II (ITT-2) consisting of all patients who were randomized into Part II and received at least one dose of study drug.

For  Part  II  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  adjusted  for  the  stratification  factors  used  for randomisation was used to compare the rate of JIA ACR30 flares between TCZ and placebo. Secondary parameters  were  analysed  by  means  of  CMH-tests  (in  case  of  dichotomous  outcomes)  or  ANOVAmodels  (continuous  data).  To  control  the  Type  I  error  a  pre-defined  hierarchical  fixed  sequence approach was applied. Each endpoint in the sequence had to be significant (p&lt;0.05) in order for the subsequent endpoint in the chain to be tested. To account for missing data the following approach was used:  for  categorical  endpoints,  patients  with  missing  data  were  classified  as  'non-responders'.  For continuous data the 'observed data' approach was used for Part I and LOCF imputation was used for Part II.

## Results

## Participants flow

Figure 3. Patient Disposition (Part I)

<!-- image -->

Twenty two patients withdrew in Part I the majority of which were due to lack of therapeutic effect (15 patients) and were not permitted to continue to Part II. Other withdrawals during Part I were due to AEs (3 patients), refusal of treatment (3 patients) and lost to follow-up (1 patient).

The majority of patients were RF-negative (126 [67%]) at baseline compared to 54 (29%) patients who were RF-positive; 8 (4%) patients had missing RF status at baseline.

## Numbers analysed

All  188  patients  enrolled  received  at  least  1  infusion  of  TCZ  and  were  therefore  included  in  the  ITT population, which was used in the analyses of efficacy data.

## Outcomes and estimations

## Primary endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was difference in JIA ACR30 flare rate between Week 16 and Week 40 in patients receiving placebo and those receiving TCZ.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 8. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Analysis of the Proportion of Patients with JIA ACR30 Flare (Withdrawal Phase Study Part II, ITT Population - Study Part II)

<!-- image -->

There  was  also  a  statistically  significant  treatment  difference  (p-value  0.0003)  in  the  robustness analysis  of  JIA  ACR30  flare  (withdrawn  patients  assigned  as  not  flared).  The  12  patients  who  were randomized at Week 16 but withdrew or took escape medication prior to Week 40 without experiencing a JIA ACR30 flare were not influential in determining the treatment effect.

## Secondary endpoints

To  control  for  the  Type  I  error  rate  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed sequence  approach.  Each  endpoint  in  the  sequence  had  to  be  significant  (p&lt;0.05)  in  order  for  the subsequent endpoint in the chain to be considered significant.

Seventy-eight patients had an elevated CRP concentration (&gt;10 mg/L) at baseline. The concentration had normalized 2 weeks after their first dose of TCZ in the majority of these patients (76/78 [97.4%]). The  proportion  with  a  normalized  CRP  increased  to  Week  16.  The  proportion  of  patients  with normalized CRP at 16 weeks was lower for the lighter children (&lt;30 kg) who were receiving the lower dose (8 mg/kg) of TCZ than the heavier children (&gt;30 kg) or than those receiving the higher dose (10 mg/kg) of TCZ.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From Week 16 to Week 40, patients randomized to TCZ maintained their Week 16 response. Patients randomized  to  placebo  experienced  a  dramatic  increase  in  mean  ESR  as  soon  as  they  stopped receiving TCZ.

## Ancillary analyses

Gender : There were no differences in the JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 response rate profile of subgroups.

Age: A  smaller  proportion  of  patients  aged  ≤7  years  achieved  JIA  ACR  30/50/70  responses  than patients aged ≥8 years.

MTX use: At  baseline  79%  of  patients  were  taking  concurrent  MTX.  From  Week  16  to  40,  a  lower proportion of patients experienced JIA ACR30 flares in the subgroup who were taking concurrent MTX (Table 20). However, regardless of MTX use, the incidence of JIA ACR30 flare was lower for patients receiving TCZ to those receiving placebo.

Oral  corticosteroid  use: Oral  corticosteroid  use  at  baseline  was  also  a  stratification  factor  in  the randomization of patients at Week 16. There was no consistent trend in the JIA ACR30 flare rate at Week 40 based on concurrent corticosteroid use.

Previous Biologic Use: The number of patients who received previous biologics was 32% with the remaining 68% being biologic-naïve.

JIA ACR30 flare rate was higher and JIA ACR responses were lower at Week 40 in patients that had previously been exposed to a biologic (TCZ and placebo groups) compared to biologic-naïve patients (Table  21).  However,  patients  randomized  to  TCZ  responded  better  than  patients  receiving  placebo whether they had prior biologic use or not.

## Supportive Studies

## Study MRA318JP

This study was a phase III open-label study of TCZ in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis involving multiple active joints. 5 sites enrolled subjects in Japan. Patients who met all the criteria below were included as subjects of this study:

1. Patients diagnosed as having RF-positive or RF-negative polyarticular JIA or oligoarticular JIA using the ILAR criteria (1997)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Patients between 2 and 19 years of age
3. Patients who were under 16 years of age at onset
4. Patients  who  met  all  the  following  criteria  at  enrolment  (within  2  weeks  before  the  start  of treatment with the investigational product)
5. Pain/tenderness and limited range of motion in 3 or more of the 74 joints examined
6. Inflammatory swelling in 5 or more of the 74 joints examined
7. ESR (Westergren method) ≥30 mm/hr or CRP ≥1.0 mg/dL
8. Patients  for  whom  written  informed  consent  for  participation  in  the  study  had  beenobtained from the parents (or legal guardian). (Written informed consent was also obtained from the patient personally if the patient had the necessary level of understanding.)

TCZ was intravenously infused at a dose of 8 mg/kg three times at 4-week intervals.

## Primary endpoint

Percentage of patients showing 30% improvement in the JIA core set on the last observation day.

## Secondary endpoints

- Time courses of percentage of patients showing 30%, 50% and 70% improvement in the JIA core set up to the last observation day
- Time courses of the JIA core set components up to the last observation day
- Time course of CRP up to the last observation day
- Time course of pain up to the last observation day

The  serum  TCZ  concentration  and  pharmacokinetic  parameters  (e.g.,  Cmax,  time  course  of  trough value, AUC, kel, CL, Vd, Vdss, t1/2) were evaluated. Patients who received one or more doses of the investigational  product  formed  the  analysis  set  for  the  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  The  patients  were handled as shown in the figure below. The patients were classified according to the following criteria. In this clinical study, the PPS (population complying with protocol) formed the main analysis set for efficacy.

## Results

Nineteen  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  In  all  19  patients,  the  investigational  product  was administered three times as specified and the last observations were completed. None of the patients was withdrawn.

The  patients  were  made  up  of  4  males  and  15  females.  Their  age  (mean  ±  SD  [range];  same hereinafter) was 11.6 ± 5.3 (3 to 19) years, age at onset of the underlying disease was 6.2 ± 4.0 (0 to 14) years and the disease duration was 5.3 ± 4.5 (1 to 17) years. At baseline, CRP was 2.657 ± 1.985 (0.06 to 8.2) mg/dL, ESR was 46.5 ± 19.9 (18 to 83) mm/hr, the number of joints with active arthritis was 14.3 ± 9.5 (5 to 43) and the number of joints with limited range of motion was 9.4 ± 6.8 (1 to 21). Fifteen patients were  being  treated with corticosteroids at the start of  treatment.  The prednisolone-equivalent dose (the daily dose on the day treatment was started) was 0.141 ± 0.071 (0.02 to 0.30) mg/kg and 4.73 ± 2.98 (1.0 to 10.0) mg/body.

## Time courses of the percentage of patients showing 30%, 50% and 70% improvement in the JIA core set up to the last observation day

The time courses of the percentage of patients showing 30%, 50%, 70% improvement in the JIA core set are shown in the figure and table below.

The JIA core set variables improved rapidly as a result of treatment with TCZ. The 0% improvement rate on the last observation day (primary endpoint) was 94.7% (18 of 19 patients), which was high. The 50% and 70% improvement rates were 94.7% (18 of 19 patients) and 57.9% (11 of 19 patients), respectively.

## Study MRA319JP

This study was a phase IV study to investigate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of long-term treatment with TCZ in the 19 patients examined in the Open-label Clinical Study of TCZ in Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (hereinafter, 'the previous study'), who were administered 8 mg/kg TCZ, as a rule, by intravenous infusion at 4- week intervals. 5 sites enrolled subjects in Japan. Patients who met all the criteria below were included as subjects in this study:

- Of the patients who received three infusions of TCZ in the previous study and for whom a last observation was conducted, those who did not have problems with safety and whose CRP or ESR level had improved with administration of TCZ
- Patients  who  wished  to  be  treated  with  TCZ  and  whose  parent/legal  guardian  gave  written consent for participation in the study (written consent was also obtained from the patient if the patient had the capacity to understand.)

Dosage and administration: TCZ at a dose of 8 mg/kg, as a rule, at 4-week intervals by intravenous infusion. The dose and interval between infusions could be adjusted depending on changes in clinical signs and laboratory test values. However, the upper limit for one infusion was to be 8 mg/kg, and the shortest interval between infusions was to be two weeks (14 days). Duration of treatment: A target of at least one year from the first infusion in the previous study.

## Primary endpoint:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients showing 30% improvement in the JIA core set compared with the baseline value of the previous study.

## Secondary endpoints:

- Time courses of the percentages of patients showing 30%, 50% and 70% improvement in the JIA core set from the baseline value of the previous study
- The time course of each variable of the JIA core set from the baseline value of the previous study
- The time course of CRP from the baseline value of the previous study
- The time course of pain from the baseline value of the previous study.

The patients were handled as in the figure below. Patient classification was determined in accordance with the following criteria. Patient classifications were decided before data locking. In this study, the full analysis set (FAS) was the primary analysis set for efficacy.

## Results

Nineteen patients were enrolled in the present study: 15 of them completed the study, and the other four were withdrawn. The 19 patients in the previous study were all enrolled in the present study. Four patients (21.1%) were withdrawn from the study. The reason for withdrawal was 'absence of change in  or  aggravation  of  symptoms'  for  two  patients  (10.5%,  Patient  Nos.  05  and  18),  'adverse  event occurrence' for one patient (Patient No. 15) and 'confirmation of appearance of anti-TCZ antibodies' for one patient (Patient No. 13). The continuation rate was high-94.7% (18 of 19 patients) after one year, 84.2% (16 of 19 patients) after two years and 78.9% (15 of 19 patients) after three years.

There were four male patients and 15 female patients. The age of the patients was 11.6 years ± 5.3 years  (3-19  years)  [mean  ±  SD  (range),  same  below];  the  age  of  the  patients  at  onset  of  the underlying disease was 6.2 years ± 4.0 years (0-14 years); and the duration of the disease was 5.28 years ± 4.46 years (0.8-17.1 years). Baseline test values were as follows: CRP, 2.66 mg/dL ± 1.99 mg/dL (0.1-8.2 mg/dL); ESR, 46.5 mm/h ± 19.9 mm/h (18-83 mm/h); number of active joints, 14.3 joints ± 9.5 joints (5-43 joints); and number of joints with limited range of motion, 9.4 joints ± 6.8 joints  (1-21  joints).  In  addition,  15  patients  were  being  treated  with  corticosteroids  at  the  start  of treatment  with  TCZ,  and  the  prednisolone-equivalent  dose  (daily  dose  on  the  first  day  of  TCZ treatment) was 0.11 mg/kg ± 0.09 mg/kg (0.0-0.3 mg/kg) and 3.74 mg/body ± 3.29 mg/body (0.010.0 mg/body).

## Outcomes and estimations

The percentages of patients showing 30%, 50% and 70% improvement in the JIA core set every 24 weeks  compared  with  the  respective  values  before  the  start  of  treatment  in  the  present  study  are shown  in  the  table  below.  The  percentage  of  patients  showing  30%  improvement  (the  primary endpoint) was 94.1% (16 of 17 patients) after 24 weeks and 100.0% after each 24-week period from 48 weeks to 168 weeks (17 of 17 patients, 16 of 16 patients, 14 of 14 patients and 15 of 15 patients). The percentage of patients showing 50% improvement was 94.1% (16 of 17 patients) after both 24 weeks  and  48  weeks,  100.0%  after  each  24-week  period  from  72  weeks  to  144  weeks  (16  of  16 patients and 14 of 14 patients), and 93.3% (14 of 15 patients) after 168 weeks. The percentage of patients showing 70% improvement was 94.1% (16 of 17 patients) after 24 weeks, 88.2% (15 of 17 patients) after 48 weeks, 93.8% (15 of 16 patients) after both 72 weeks and 96 weeks, 100.0% (14 of 14 patients) after both 120 weeks and 144 weeks, and 93.3% (14 of 15 patients) after 168 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the clinical study report of the previous study, the percentages of patients showing 30%, 50% and 70% improvement at 12 weeks after the start of treatment were 94.7% (18 of 19 patients), 94.7% (18 of 19 patients) and 57.9% (11 of 19 patients), respectively. At 24 weeks after the start of treatment, the percentages of patients showing 30%, 50% and 70% improvement were all 94.1% (16 of 17 patients); thus, not only were the percentages of 30% and 50% improvement greater than 90%, the percentage of 70% improvement was also greater than 90%. In subsequent long-term treatment as well, percentages of about 90% or higher were maintained for 30%, 50% and 70% improvement.

## 2.2.3.1. Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

The pivotal phase III study WA19977 consisted of 3 parts. An initial 16-week open label lead in period (Part I) is followed by a randomized double blind withdrawal phase for a maximum of 24 weeks. Part III, a 64 week open-label period to examine the long term use of tocilizumab on safety and efficacy is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

currently ongoing. The design of this study is considered acceptable: the withdrawal phase enables to evaluate the efficacy in a controlled manner, while using an escape endpoint, reducing the exposure to poor  response  for  a  relative  short  period.  The  approach  is  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (CHMP/EWP/422/04).

Juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  is  a  heterogeneous  group  of  disease,  ILAR  has  introduced  a  new nomenclature and classified the disease and distinguishes 7 subgroups. The MAH included patients with active  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (RF-positive  or  RF  negative  pJIA,  and  extended oligoarticular arthritis) in the study. The 3 subgroups can be considers as homogenous population since the disease characteristics are similar.

Given the small numbers in the subsets, the data are pooled for analysis. This approach is consistent with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis  (CHMP/EWP/422/04).  The  patients  were  divided  into  two  body  weight  categories.  TCZ  was dosed according the body, patients weighing at least 30 kg received 8 mg/kg TCZ q4w; patients with a body weight below 30 kg were randomized to either 10 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg q4w.

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  developing  JIA  ACR30  flare  between Week 16 and Week 40 in patients receiving placebo and those receiving TCZ. The JIA ACR30 flares relative  to  week  16  in  patients  receiving  TCZ  was  statistically  significantly  lower  than  the  rate  in patients receiving placebo (25.6% vs. 48.1%). The primary endpoint was met.

This result was supported by a predefined set of secondary analyses, controlling for multiple testing. To  control  for  the  type  I  error  rate,  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed sequence  approach.  The  chain  of  statistical  significance  in  the  hierarchical  testing  of  secondary endpoints  was  broken  after  the  seventh  of  13  endpoints.  The  patients  improved  rapidly  following dosing with TCZ

Thus it can be considered that the results demonstrated a clinically relevant effect in patients treated with TCZ.

In Part I of the study the onset of efficacy was observed after the first dose of TCZ.

There was no gender effect on the efficacy observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A smaller proportion of patients aged ≤7 years achieved JIA ACR 30/50/70 responses than patients aged ≥ 8 years, while proportions of patients achieving JIA ACR90 are comparable in all age groups. This observation is not unexpected and is partly due to the lower exposure to TCZ in younger patients. Patients with younger age had lower body weight and thus had lower drug exposure and associated lower efficacy scores. There was a trend of a better response in children with body weight of less than 30  kg  receiving  the  higher  dose  of  10  mg/kg,  supporting  the  proposed  dose  of  10  mg/kg  in  lower weight  children.  Generally  the  &lt;30  kg  treatment  groups  included  a  lower  proportion  of  RF  positive patients than the ≥ 30 kg group. The MAH argued that the observed difference in the different age groups might also be linked to the fact that the proportions of rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and RF negative patients differed between treatment groups. This claim is not supported by the data so far. The MAH will initiative a collecting of long term efficacy and safety data in pJIA treatment through a registry also covering the efficacy of 10 mg/kg for patients &lt;30 kg. This paediatric registry is described in the risk management plan.

The MAH provided a subgroup analysis of JIA ACR response rates between RF positive and RF negative patients. The efficacy of  TCZ in terms of JIA response rates was generally similar regardless of the patients' RF status; however the groups are too small to detect meaningful differences.

During the evaluation the MAH was requested to provide subgroup analysis for patients with extended oligoarthritis.  According  to  the  ILAR  diagnostic  criteria  oligoarticular  JIA  is  characterized  by  1  to  4 active joints in the first six months of disease. Oligoarticular JIA that does not progress after 6 months is  termed  persistent  oligoarticular  JIA  and  is  not  included  in  WA19977.  If  there  is  progression  of oligoarticular  JIA  to  affect  ≥5  joints  after  six  months  it  is  classified  as  extended  oligoarticular  JIA (eoJIA) while pJIA is characterized by ≥5 joints in the first six months of disease. After 6 months of disease (the minimum disease duration required for entry into WA19977) the polyarticular course of eoJIA  is  no  different  to  that  observed  in  patients  originally  diagnosed  with  pJIA.  Patients  with oligoarticular disease onset, including eoJIA, are almost exclusively RF- at diagnosis and maintain their RF- status throughout their disease course.

Therefore the analysis of efficacy by RF status captures eoJIA patients along with RF- pJIA patients in the RF population.

Of the 188 patients enrolled in WA19977 54 were RF+, 126 were RF- and no RF status was recorded in 8 patients.

The MAH interpretation of these data is that patients with an initial diagnosis of eoJIA or RF- pJIA are at neither a therapeutic advantage or disadvantage relative to those patients with an initial eoJIA or RF- pJIA. The MAH's arguments were considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study WA19977 was designed to evaluate a population of patients with an inadequate response to MTX due to lack of efficacy or toxicity, patients were required either not be taking MTX, or be on a stable dose of MTX for 12 weeks prior to baseline. Patients on MTX had lower JIA ACR flare rates and higher JIA ACR response rates regardless of assignment to TCZ or placebo treatment. It has been shown in a logistic  regression  analysis  of  JIA  ACR30  flares  that  MTX  use  had  a  significant  influence  on  the response independent of TCZ treatment. Patients taking concomitant MTX have better outcomes than those who do not, regardless of assignation to TCZ or placebo. Of note, in patients not taking MTX 53.3% of patients treated with TCZ achieved a JIA ACR70 response at week 40 compared with 23.5% of patients treated with placebo.

Oral corticosteroid use at baseline was also a stratification factor in the randomization of patients at Week 16, and patients were required to maintain oral corticosteroid use at a constant level until Week 40 unless a change was required for safety reasons. There was no consistent trend in the JIA ACR30 flare rate at Week 40 based on concurrent corticosteroid use, and the oral corticosteroid use term was not statistically significant in the confirmatory logistic regression analysis. The interaction of TCZ with oral corticosteroid use was assessed and was found non-significant (p-value 0.3267), suggesting that the benefit from TCZ was independent of corticosteroid. However this conclusion might be hampered by the small sample size.

The inclusion criteria specified that disease had to have been present for 6 month or more with still 5 active joints. Consequently patients with disease duration from 6 month to several years are included in  the  study.  As  mentioned  by  the  MAH  treatment  outcome  was  poorer  in  children  with  disease duration of more than 2 years. During the evaluation the MAH was requested to provide a separate analysis  of  the  efficacy  data  in  those  receiving  treatment  late  versus  earlier  in  the  disease  course. Effective  control  of  JIA  disease  activity  early  in  the  disease  course  is  being  advocated  as  a  way  of improving  longer  term  outcomes  (1).  While  the  cut-off  for  distinguishing  early  vs.  late  disease  is somewhat arbitrary,  the MAH  considers  a  2  year  cut-off  to  be  reasonable  since  it  distinguishes  the diagnosis, assessment and first line therapy phases from the second and further line phases of patient management.

JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses at Week 16 were summarised by the subgroups of patients with disease duration &lt;2 years and ≥2 years. The data are provided in the table below.

At  the  end  of  Part  I  of  the  study  JIA  ACR  response  rates  were  numerically  lower  in  patients  with disease duration of ≥2 years.

JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses at Week 40 and JIA ACR30 Flare rates were also presented by the subgroups of patients with disease duration &lt;2 years and ≥2 years. The data are provided in the table below.

At the end of Part II of the study JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 response rates were lower in patients with disease duration of ≥2 years. Similarly, JIA ACR30  Flare rates were higher in patients with disease duration of ≥2 years. Efficacy was better in TCZ patients compared to Placebo patients, regardless of disease duration. Due to smaller sample sizes, data should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, these data are consistent with the notion that effective treatment earlier in the course of disease can contribute to better efficacy outcomes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No comparative analyses were provided on therapeutic efficacy of TCZ and other biologic for treatment of patients with pJIA used in MTX combination or as monotherapy in the submitted documentation. The MAH was requested during the evaluation to provide such comparative analyses in which at least data of published clinical studies would be used as the source of information.

At  the  time  of  submission,  three  biologics  are  approved  for  use  in  pcJIA  in  the  EU:  etanercept, adalimumab and abatacept. Of these three both etanercept and adalimumab are TNF inhibitors while abatacept  is  T-cell  activation  inhibitor  (through  action  on  CD28).  Abatacept  and  adalimumab  are approved for use in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in MTX-IR patients and as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate MTX. Etanercept is approved for monotherapy use only.

The  pcJIA  studies  for  all  three  molecules  were  of  a  randomized  withdrawal  design  similar  to  that utilized in WA19977 although the duration of study phases and study populations differed between the studies (see table below).

Due to the fact that the etanercept and abatacept studies enrolled patients with all subtypes of JIA, including sJIA, and due to differences in the statistical methodologies utilized in both studies, the MAH considers  it  inappropriate  to  directly  compare  the  results  of  these  two  studies  with  TCZ  study WA19977. The etanercept and abatacept studies allowed patients who flared during the double blind phase to be counted as JIA ACR responders while WA19977 (and the Lovell at al. adalimumab study) counted flare patients as JIA ACR non-responders, regardless of JIA ACR response achieved prior to flare. Despite the greater similarities in study design and statistical analyses between WA19977 and the  adalimumab  study  the  MAH  considers  it  methodologically  flawed  to  make  direct  comparisons between these studies.  Firstly,  the  adalimumab  study  included  MTX  naïve  patients  with  less  severe disease whereas all of the patients enrolled in WA19977 had prior MTX exposure and had more severe disease. Secondly, 32% of patients enrolled in WA19977 had a prior inadequate response to another biologic drug. No such prior biologic exposure in the adalimumab population was reported by Lovell et al.  (2008)  which  could  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  WA19977  patient  population  may  also  have more  refractory  disease  compared  to  those  in  the  adalimumab  study.  These  patients  tend  to  have higher flare rates and lower JIA ACR response rates in comparison with biologic-naïve patients. Efficacy of TCZ stratified by prior biologic use at both Week 16 and Week 40 has been provided in the original TCZ submission but is not available in the Lovell et al publication. Thirdly, the all-TCZ summary data includes the 8 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) dose group which showed suboptimal efficacy relative to the other two doses investigated whereas the adalimumab study was a non-doseranging study in which all patients received the recommended dose.

Nevertheless, on the basis of an indirect and qualitative comparison of the data presented above it is the  opinion  of  the  MAH  that  tocilizumab  is  at  least  as  effective  as  adalimumab,  etanercept  and abatacept in pcJIA patients.

The  MAH's  argumentation  is  considered  acceptable.  Unfortunately  there  are  no  comparative  data available of face to face trials biological products in patients with pJIA available for the time being. Still it can be established, based on the data presented by the MAH, that the therapeutic effects which can be achieved by TCZ in patients with pJIA are similar to those produced by adalimumab, etanercept or abatacept, as stated by the MAH.

The MAH was requested during the evaluation to propose how efficacy and safety of re-treatment with TCZ will be evaluated in patients who are experiencing flares during treatment holidays.

The randomized withdrawal design of study WA19977 allows for assessment of efficacy and safety in patients randomized to placebo in part II. Those that did not flare were retreated with TCZ in part III (from week 40) whilst those that experienced a JIA ACR30 flare during part II were re-treated with TCZ as escape therapy. Part III of the study is currently ongoing.

Of  the  188  patients  that  were  enrolled  in  study  WA19977  166  entered  the  double-blind  withdrawal period with 82 TCZ; 84 randomized with placebo. Of 81 out of these 84 placebo patients in the ITT Population, 39 (48.1%) experienced a JIA ACR30 flare while off TCZ between Week 16 and Week 40 and re-initiated TCZ treatment. In terms of the efficacy of re-treatment with TCZ, the MAH will provide the final study report after completion of part III of study WA19977. The submission of the final study report for study WA19977 is part of the RMP

## 2.2.3.2. Conclusions on Clinical Efficacy

In the pivotal phase III study WA19977, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients developing  JIA  ACR30  flare  between  Week  16  and  Week  40.  Patients  receiving  placebo  and  those receiving  TCZ  were  compared.  Three  subsets  of  the  JIA  population  were  included  in  the  study:  RFpositive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular arthritis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The JIA ACR30 flares relative to week 16 in patients receiving TCZ was statistically significantly lower than the rate in patients receiving placebo (25.6% vs. 48.1%). The primary endpoint was met.

This result was supported by a predefined set of secondary analyses, controlling for multiple testing. To  control  for  the  type  I  error  rate,  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed sequence  approach.  The  chain  of  statistical  significance  in  the  hierarchical  testing  of  secondary endpoints  was  broken  after  the  seventh  of  13  endpoints.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  JIA ARC/30/50/70  improvement  was  statistical  significant  higher  in  the  TCZ  group  than  in  the  placebo group. Change from baseline in number of active joints, in Physician's global assessments VAS and in pain VAS also demonstrated statistical significant superiority of TCZ over placebo.

The treatment effect is independent of initial diagnosis of eoJIA or RF- pJIA. Furthermore, the data are consistent with the notion that effective treatment earlier in the course of disease can contribute to better efficacy outcomes. Although patients taking concomitant MTX have generally better outcomes adequate  response  was  also  demonstrated  for  patients  treated  with  TCZ  without  MTX  compared  to placebo-treated patients. Available data suggests that the treatment effect from TCZ is independent of corticosteroid  use  although  the  small  sample  size  was  too  small  to  draw  firm  conclusions.  Overall, tocilizumab  appears  to  be  at  least  as  effective  as  adalimumab,  etanercept  and  abatacept  in  pcJIA patients  even  though  unfortunately  no  direct  comparative  data  of  different  biological  products  in patients  with  pJIA  are  available  for  the  time  being.  Information  on  re-treatment  after  flare  will  be coming from part III of the ongoing study.Thus it can be considered that the results demonstrated a significant clinical benefit in patients with RF-positive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular arthritis.

Impairment of growth is a common problem in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in children with active disease. So far no data on the potential impact on TCZ therapy on growth retardation of in the  paediatric  population  are  available.  Furthermore  there  is  evidence  that  JIA  is  associated  with increased risk for atherosclerosis, yet the data are scare. The MAH will initiative a collecting of long term efficacy and safety data in pJIA treatment through a registry also covering the impact of TCZ therapy on the increased risk of atherosclerosis and growth development, respectively. This paediatric registry is described in the risk management plan.

## 2.2.4. Clinical safety aspects

## Patient exposure

The database supporting the safety of TCZ for treatment of pJIA includes the pivotal phase III study (WA19977), and is supported by the data from studies MRA318JP and MRA319JP.

In addition post-marketing safety data with TCZ for pJIA patients are provided in a tabulated overview in comparison with the paediatric data.

Study WA1997 consists of thee part, a 16-week active-treatment lead-in period (Part I), a 24-week double-blind,  placebo-controlled  withdrawal  period  (Part  II)  followed  by  a  64-week,  open-label, extension  period  (Part  III).  During  Part  I  177/188  patients  (94%)  received  all  four  planned  TCZ infusions  and  during  Part  II,  57/82  patients  (70%)  and  43/81  (53%)  received  all  six  scheduled infusions of TCZ and placebo, respectively. At the time of the data cut, the median exposure to TCZ across Parts I, II, and III was 48 weeks (0.92 years). The total duration of exposure to TCZ was 184.4 patient-years; this is the total exposure used to determine the rate of adverse events per 100 patient years

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 188 patients had at least 1 safety assessment following the first infusion of TCZ and were therefore included in the safety population, which was used in the analyses of safety data. The ITT and safety populations were therefore equivalent.

The safety results in this report have been presented using the all exposure population; this includes all the patients until their last visit before 04 November 2011.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Death

There were no deaths during the study.

## Serious adverse events

Seventeen patients (9.0%) reported 22 SAEs with a rate of 12.5 SAEs per 100 patient-years (in the all exposure population).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  SOC  that  had  the  most  patients  reporting  at  least  1  SAE  in  the  all  exposure  population  was infections and  infestations (9 patients [4.8%]),  followed by injury, poisoning and  procedural complications (3 patients [1.6%]).

The  majority  of  SAEs  were  individual  cases  occurring  in  individual  patients  with  the  exceptions  of pneumonia, bronchitis and cellulitis. Pneumonia was reported in 4 patients (3 patients receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg  [≥30  kg]  and  1  patient  receiving  TCZ  10  mg/kg  [&lt;30  kg]).  Bronchitis  was  reported  in  2 patients receiving TCZ 10 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg) and cellulitis was reported in 2 patients receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg (≥30kg).

Individual  serious  cases  of  varicella,  neck  injury,  synovial  rupture,  upper  limb  fracture,  sclerosing cholangitis,  hypertransaminasemia,  back  pain,  osteoporosis,  familial  mediterranean  fever,  uveitis, constipation,  benign  intracranial  hypertension,  psychosomatic  disease  and  urinary  calculus  were reported.

Of  the  22  SAEs  reported,  5  SAEs  that  occurred  in  5  patients  (2.7%)  were  considered  remotely, possibly  or  probably  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  The  5  events  reported  were  benign intracranial hypertension, uveitis, urinary calculus, pneumonia, and cellulitis.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Infections

Over half of the patients in the all-exposure population in study WA19977 had at least one infection AE (115/188 [61.2%]). With a total of 302 infection AEs, the rate of infections was 163.7 per 100 patient years.

The  most  common  types  of  infections  include  infections  of  the  upper  respiratory  tract  or  the  ears. There was one case of a primary pulmonary tuberculosis infection in an endemic region.

(1 of 1)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nine patients (4.8%) had a serious infection, including four with pneumonia, two each with bronchitis and  cellulitis,  and  one  with  varicella  (hospitalised  with  varicella  pneumonitis).  All  infection  SAEs resolved without squeal.

There  was  no  indication  that  patients  who  received  concomitant  oral  corticosteroids  or  MTX  had  an increased risk for infections.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

In  order  to  identify  events  that  may  indicate  hypersensitivity,  analyses  of  infusion  related  AEs  were performed. Infusion-related AEs were defined as any AEs occurring during or within 24 hours after the infusion of TCZ and that were not judged 'unrelated' to treatment by the investigator.

A total of 40 events were reported in 33/188 patients (17.6%). The rate of infusion related AEs was 23.3 events per 100 patient years. The most frequent individual AE terms were dizziness, headache, and hypotension (each at a rate of 2.2 AEs per 100 patient-years). None of the events were serious, and no patient was withdrawn as a result of an infusion-related event.

There were no cases of anaphylaxis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Gastrointestinal Perforations

There were no gastrointestinal perforations reported in the study.

## Malignancies

There  were  no  malignancies  reported  in  study  WA19977.  A  total  of  four  events  of  papilloma  were reported. All were described as warts.

## Immunogenicity

Almost all patients (185/188 or 98.4%) were tested for screening assay at any time point. Of these, 20  patients  (10.6%)  had  positive  baseline  anti-TCZ  assay  results,  3  patients  (1.6%)  had  positive screening assay results post-baseline, and 1 patient (0.5%) had positive confirmation and neutralizing assay  results  post-baseline.  This  patient  did  not  experience  infusion  reactions.  The  patient  was withdrawn as she did not achieve a JIA ACR30 response at the end of Part I and was therefore not eligible to continue in Part II.

## Laboratory findings

## Neutropenia and abnormal neutrophil count

There  were  no  neutropenia  AEs  reported  during  the  study,  however  decreases  in  neutrophil  counts were observed during the study.

In  two  patients  infections  (both  non-serious)  were  reported  in  a  temporary  relation  with  the neutropenia was reported (gastroenteritis [Patient 2496, TCZ 8 mg/kg, ≥30 kg] and tracheitis 3 days prior  to  the  neutropenia  [Patient  2611,  TCZ  10  mg/kg,  &lt;30  kg).  Both  events  were  reported  as unrelated to study drug and the patients continued in the study.

## Platelet count

During study treatment, mean platelet counts decreased in most subgroups of patient. There were few bleeding events with the most common being epistaxis in 7 patients.

One non-serious event of vaginal haemorrhage described as pre-menstrual red spot occurred in patient with a platelet count of 114 × 109/L. No serious bleeding events were reported.

## Hepatic events and liver function test parameters

One  event  with  preferred  term  'hepatotoxicity'  was  reported  in  one  patient  in  the  TCZ  8  mg/kg (≥30kg) group on day 357. The event was recorded as mild in intensity and was attributed to MTX therapy.

ALT  values  remained  within  the  normal  range  throughout  study  treatment  in  126/187  patients (67.4%). The highest CTC grade ALT elevation in the study was one grade 3 event in one patient. AST concentrations  remained  within  the  normal  range  throughout  study  treatment  in  152/187  patients (81.3%). There was one shift to a grade 3 AST value in a patient who had a grade 2 baseline value. There was no shift in total bilirubin to grade 3 or 4 values.

## Lipid parameters

In  general,  mean  lipid  parameters  including  total  cholesterol,  LDL-cholesterol,  HDL-cholesterol,  and triglyceride  concentrations  were  within  normal  ranges  for  the  duration  of  the  study.  For  total cholesterol  and  LDL-cholesterol,  the  highest  post  baseline  values  were  &gt;1.5-2  ×  ULN  and  were reported in 0.5% of patients each. There were no clinically relevant findings in other laboratory safety parameters.

## Comparison of TCZ safety in PJIA, SJIA and adult RA patients

The overall safety profile of TCZ was similar between the paediatric pJIA and adult RA patients. There were some differences in rates of AEs per 100 PY by SOC. The most notable difference was the rate of infections,  which  was  higher  in  the  pediatric  population  (see  table  below).  This  was  to  be  expected since the age of onset is much younger in pJIA, affecting a population more prone to infection. The rate  of  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  was  also  higher  in  pJIA  when  compared  to adult RA. This is considered largely a result of the different study designs and reporting practices in the paediatric  and  adult  clinical  studies.  As  discussed  above,  the  high  number  of  events  in  this  system organ class in study WA19977 was the result of AEs reported as 'juvenile arthritis' (59 of 98 events; rate per 100 patient years: 32.0), which were attributed to flares of the underlying disease. In the adult RA studies, AEs of 'rheumatoid arthritis' were reported at a lower rate (723/4824 events; rate per 100 patient years: 4.8) . The rate of SAEs was not higher in pJIA than in adult RA. The number of individual SAEs in study WA19977 was too small to make a meaningful comparison to the adult data.

The rate of AEs and SAEs in sJIA patients treated with TCZ in study WA18221 was higher than that observed in pJIA or in adult RA patients. This was also true for most SOCs. The systemic form of JIA involves  additional  complications  that  are  less  common  in  pJIA  or  adult  RA,  such  as  multi-organ involvement. Other factors contributing to the higher rates of AEs and SAEs observed in sJIA include the  more  systemic  nature  of  this  illness.  The  pattern  of  changes  in  laboratory  data  (neutrophils, platelets, AST, ALT and total bilirubin) was consistent with changes observed amongst the pJIA, adult RA  and  sJIA  populations  (see  table  below).  The  majority  of  shifts  were  to  CTC  Grade  1  or  2 classifications.

## Discontinuation due to AES and dose interruptions

Seven  patients  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  an  AE.  This  included  1  patient  who  was withdrawn  following  an  event  reported  as  juvenile  arthritis,  which  indicated  that  the  reason  to discontinue  treatment  in  this  patient  was  insufficient  efficacy.  One  of  the  7  patients  was  withdrawn

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from treatment due to an event of gastroenteritis that started while the patient received placebo in Part II of the study.

Of  the  7  events  leading  to  withdrawal  from  study,  2  events  (hypertransaminasemia  and  benign intracranial hypertension) were serious.

## Dose interruption

In  the  all  exposure  population,  12.8%  of  patients  experienced  TCZ  dose  interruptions  because  of safety concerns. There was a higher incidence of AEs leading to dose interruptions in patients receiving TCZ  10  mg/kg  (&lt;30  kg)  (28.6%)  than  patients  receiving  TCZ  8  mg/kg  (&lt;30  kg)  (5.9%).  The  AEs under the SOC of infections and infestations were the leading cause of TCZ dose interruption (9.0%), followed  by  AEs  under  the  SOC  of  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (1.6%)  and gastrointestinal disorders (1.1%).

## Supportive Studies

## Study MRA318JP

Thirty-eight adverse events occurred in 17 of the 19 patients (89.5%) who were included in the safety evaluation  set.  Thirty-six  of  the  events  were  mild  and  2  were  moderate.  None  of  the  events  was assessed as severe. The incidences by SOC were as follows: 12 events of infections and infestations in 11 patients (57.9%), 9 events of gastrointestinal disorders in 7 patients (36.8%), 5 events of injury, poisoning  and  procedural  complications  in  4  patients  (21.1%),  4  events  of  skin  and  subcutaneous tissue disorders in 4 patients (21.1%), 2 events of investigations in 2 patients (10.5%) and 2 events of nervous system disorders in 1 patient (5.3%). For all of the other SOCs with adverse events, there was 1 event of each.

Twenty-one  adverse  drug  reactions  occurred  in  13  of  the  19  patients  (68.4%).  Twenty-one  of  the adverse drug reactions were mild. None was assessed as moderate or severe. The incidences by SOC were  as  follows:  10  events  of  infections  and  infestations  in  10  patients  (52.6%),  5  events  of gastrointestinal disorders in 5 patients (26.3%), 3 events of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in 3 patients (15.8%) and 2 events of investigations in 2 patients (10.5%). For the other SOC with an adverse drug reaction, there was 1 event.

Adverse  events  (PT)  with  an  incidence  of  ≥10%  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (26.3%,  5 patients),  nasopharyngitis  (21.1%,  4  patients),  diarrhoea  (15.8%,  3  patients)  and  arthropod  sting (10.5%, 2 patients).

Three  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  3  patients.  Those  events  (PT)  were  gastroenteritis, gastroenteritis bacterial and sensory disturbance. The causal relationship to the investigational product was 'unrelated' for gastroenteritis bacterial and 'unlikely' for the other 2 events. The outcome was 'improved' for sensory disturbance and 'resolved/recovered' for the other 2 events.

None of the patients died and none was withdrawn from the study because of adverse events.

Twelve adverse events classified under the SOC infections and infestations occurred in 11 of the 19 patients  (57.9%).  Those  (PT)  with  an  incidence  of  ≥10%  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection (26.3%, 5 events) and nasopharyngitis (21.1%, 4 events).

Infusion reactions consisted of 1 event each of nausea (at 1st infusion) and dizziness (at 3rd infusion) in 2 patients (10.5%).

Changes in laboratory test values were within the reference range or were changes in the direction of normalisation, except for increased ALP. The only patients in whom laboratory test values changed by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

two or more NCI-CTC grades were 1 patient for the neutrophil count and 2 patients for the lymphocyte count, and the change in the neutrophil count was transient. Adverse events involving laboratory test values were 1 event each of lymphocyte count decreased and blood urine present.

One of the patients became positive for anti-TCZ antibodies (neutralising antibodies) on the last test day.

There were no changes in vital signs.

## Study MRA319JP

There were a total of 142 adverse events in all 19 patients (100.0%) in the safety evaluation. As for severity,  136  events  were  'mild',  five  events  were  'moderate'  and  one  event  was  'severe'. Occurrence  of  adverse  events  by  system  organ  class  (SOC)  in  order  of  incidence  was  as  follows: 'infections and infestations', 60 events in 18 patients (94.7%); 'gastrointestinal disorders', 18 events in 12 patients (63.2%); 'skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders', 14 events in 12 patients (63.2%); 'injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications',  16  events  in  10  patients  (52.6%);  'respiratory, thoracic  and  mediastinal disorders',  six  events  in  six  patients  (31.6%);  'immune  system  disorders' and 'musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders', each five events in five patients (26.3%); 'eye disorders',  five  events  in  four  patients  (21.1%);  'nervous  system  disorders',  five  events  in  three patients (15.8%); 'investigations', three events in three patients (15.8%); and 'blood and lymphatic system disorders' and 'ear and labyrinth disorders', each two events in two patients (10.5%). In the other SOCs, the incidence was less than 10%.

There were 100 adverse drug reactions in 18 of the 19 patients (94.7%). As for severity, 98 of the adverse drug reactions were 'mild', one was 'moderate' and one was 'severe'. Occurrence of adverse drug  reactions  by  SOC  was  as  follows:  'infections  and  infestations',  52  reactions  in  17  patients (89.5%); 'skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders', 11 reactions in 10 patients (52.6%); 'gastrointestinal disorders', 13  reactions in nine patients (47.4%);  'respiratory, thoracic  and mediastinal  disorders',  six  reactions  in  six  patients  (31.6%);  'immune  system  disorders',  five reactions in five patients (26.3%); 'eye disorders', four reactions in three patients (15.8%); 'nervous system  disorders' and  'investigations', each three reactions in three  patients  (15.8%);  and 'musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders',  two  reactions  in  two  patients  (10.5%).  The incidence was less than 10% for the other SOCs.

In  order  of  decreasing  incidence,  the  events  (PTs)  with  an  incidence  of  at  least  10%  were nasopharyngitis,  78.9%  (15  patients);  pharyngitis,  42.1%  (eight  patients);  gastroenteritis,  upper respiratory  tract  infection  and  arthropod  sting,  31.6%  (six  patients)  each;  seasonal  allergy  and eczema,  21.1%  (four  patients)  each;  bronchitis,  impetigo,  influenza,  conjunctivitis  allergic,  upper respiratory  tract  inflammation,  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis  and  urticaria,  15.8%  (three patients) each; and pneumonia, headache, rhinitis allergic, constipation, enterocolitis, musculoskeletal stiffness and joint sprain, 10.5% (two patients) each.

Six  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  four  patients.  Those  events  (PTs)  were  gastroenteritis, influenza, pneumonia, gastroenteritis bacterial, myasthenia gravis and sensory disturbance. The causal relationship to TCZ was assessed as 'unrelated' for influenza and gastroenteritis bacterial, 'unlikely' for gastroenteritis and sensory disturbance, and 'possibly' for pneumonia and myasthenia gravis. The outcome was 'improved' for myasthenia gravis and 'resolved/recovered' for the other five events.

There were no adverse events that resulted in death.

One adverse event, myasthenia gravis in one patient, resulted in withdrawal of the patient from the study; the causal relationship to TCZ was assessed as 'possibly'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were 60 occurrences of adverse events classified as the SOC 'infections and infestations' in 18 of the 19 patients (94.7%). Of those, the events with an incidence of at least 10% were as follows: nasopharyngitis, 78.9% (15 patients); pharyngitis, 42.1% (eight patients); gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infection, 31.6% (six patients) each; bronchitis, impetigo and influenza, 15.8% (three patients) each; and pneumonia, 10.5% (two patients) each.

There  were  two  infusion  reactions  in  two  patients  (10.5%);  those  events  were  nausea  (at  the  first infusion) and dizziness (at the third infusion) in one patient each.

Except for elevation of ALP, the changes in laboratory test values were either within the normal range or tended toward normal. The laboratory test values whose NCICTC grade changed by two or more grades  and  the  numbers  of  patients  affected  were  as  follows:  neutrophil  count,  seven  patients; lymphocyte count and total bilirubin level, two patients; and haemoglobin level, WBC count, ALP value and CK value, one patient. Of those, changes of three grades (Grade 0 to Grade 3) were seen for the neutrophil count and CK value in one patient each. The three-grade exacerbations of the neutrophil count and CK value were both transient.

Regarding anti-TCZ antibodies, one patient (5.3%) became positive for neutralizing antibodies before the fourth infusion; and positive for IgE antibodies after the fifth infusion 657 days after the fourth infusion; and was withdrawn from the study.

Regarding  vital  signs,  large  changes  were  not  observed  in  blood  pressure,  pulse  rate  or  body temperature.

## Post-marketing data

Post-marketing data is available from several sources:

- Japanese post-marketing study ML21939 for pJIA
- Japanese post-marketing study ML21940 for sJIA
- Spontaneous  reports  received  globally,  including  those  from  non-interventional  studies  for patient  treated  for  pJIA,  sJIA,  JIA  that  are  unspecified  by  classification,  and  in  paediatric patients under the age of 18 years treated with tocilizumab for unknown indications.

Tocilizumab  has  a  marketing  license  in  Japan.  Tocilizumab  has  been  available  for  treatment  of multicentric Castleman's disease in Japan since 2005 through a closed distribution program, and for treatment of RA, pJIA and sJIA since April 2008.

The MAH provided updated post-marketing data through 31 July 2012.

Consistent with study WA19977, the most common types of SAEs reported were infections. The safety profile  of  TCZ  in  patients  with  pJIA  remains  unchanged  from  the  profile  presented  in  the  original submission and is consistent with that expected for a biologic agent in the pJIA population.

Additional safety data from study WA19977 will be reviewed and summarized in the final clinical study report  with  the  conclusions  of  part  III  of  this  study.  The  MAH  will  review  safety  data  in  the  pJIA population as part of ongoing Pharmacovigillance as well as within the  context of a post-marketing registry (paediatric patients is included as important missing information in the RMP).

The  table  below  shows  the  distribution  of  spontaneous  reports  across  the  pJIA  population,  patients enrolled in the Chugai Japanese Post-Marketing Surveillance (JPMS) study ML21940, and spontaneous reports  received  across  sJIA  patients,  patients  treated  for  unspecified  JIA  conditions,  and  other paediatric patients &lt;18 years of age treated for unknown indications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The events identified from the updated search, and the numbers and proportion of these events by system  organ  class  (SOC)  are  summarized  in  the  table  below.  Across  all  populations,  the  most common  types  of  events  reported  in  &gt;5%  of  patients  were  infections  (26.6%),  followed  by gastrointestinal  disorders  (8.7%),  investigations  (7.7%),  musculoskeletal  disorders  (7.5%),  general disorders (7.3%), neoplasms (7%), and blood disorders (5.3%). Among individual patient groups, the frequencies of these types of events varied from those seen across all populations.

Within the post-marketing SAEs previously presented, the most frequently reported events reported in &gt; 5% of patients across all patient groups were similar to those in the updated data cut. The most common events were infections (30%), followed by investigations (11.2%), gastrointestinal disorders (8.9%),  neoplasms  (8.9%),  musculoskeletal  disorders  (6.7%),  blood  disorders  (5.8%),  and  general disorders (5.1%).

## 2.2.4.1. Discussion on Clinical Safety

Due to the design of study WA19977, the placebo controlled withdrawal part was preceded by a lead in phase were all subjects were treated with TCZ. Thus all patients were exposed to TCZ which precludes a comparative assessment of the safety data.

The safety of TCZ was previously assessed in the paediatric population in sJIA patients.

Study WA1997 did not reveal any new safety signal. The safety between the pJIA and sJIA patients is similar  with  a  trend  to  lower  AE  rates  in  the  pJIA  population  compared  to  the  sJIA  population.  This could be explained through more severe diseased sJIA population.

The most frequent AEs occurring were juvenile arthritis (which were underlying disease flares reported as  AEs),  nasopharyngitis,  headache,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  cough,  pharyngitis,  nausea, diarrhoea, rhinitis, vomiting, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, and rash. The most common types of infections were those typically seen in children i.e. infections of the upper respiratory tract or viral infections.

The rate of SAEs was similar in the pJIA and adult population but lower than in the sJIA population. Again, this could explain by the generally more severe diseased sJIA population.

One patient experienced uveitis under treatment with TCZ, which is a known complication for JRA. The impact on the prevention/outcome of uveitis  under  treatment  with  TCZ  should  be  addressed  in  the post-marketing setting. The overall prevalence of uveitis is estimated to be around 10-15% in the JIA population, with a higher prevalence in the extended oligoarthritis subgroup (around 20%). Additional risk factors for the development of uveitis include female gender, a young age of diagnosis and ANA positive status (about 30%). Thus, in spite of the exclusion of patients with prior uveitis on the basis of slit-lamp  examination  at  screening,  the  report  of  uveitis  in  the  WA19977  study  is  not  unexpected. However, the paucity of literature on the incidence of uveitis means that an analysis of the relationship between TCZ usage and uveitis using WA19977 data is not possible. The MAH is planning to record the occurrence of uveitis in pJIA patients treated with TCZ in the post-marketing setting in the context of a registry. Independently, an investigator sponsored trial (supported via a financial grant by the MAH) is planning to treat  five  patients  with  JIA  and  uveitis  with  open-label  TCZ;  the  design  of  the  trial  will preclude the results from making definitive conclusions, and given the independence of the sponsor from  the  MAH,  whether  and  when  these  data  are  collected  is  uncertain.  The  plan  to  record  the occurrence of uveitis in pJIA patients treated with TCZ in the post-marketing setting in the context of a new paediatric registry is endorsed. As per the RMP, the MAH should submit the outline of the registry for review by the CHMP.

There was one case of a primary pulmonary tuberculosis infection in an endemic region. This is not unexpected for the product class.

One event with preferred term ' hepatotoxicity ' was reported in one patient treated concomitant with MTX. The event was attributed to MTX therapy.

Hepatic transaminases remained within the normal range throughout study treatment in the majority of the patient. There was no shift in total bilirubin to grade 3 or 4 values. The rate of patients with normal liver enzymes was higher than in the adult study and in the sJIA population.

Three patients (1.6%) had positive screening assay results post-baseline, and 1 patient (0.5%) had positive confirmation and  neutralizing assay results post-baseline without evidence  of clinical consequence.

## 2.2.4.2. Conclusions on Clinical Safety

The safety profile of TCZ in the paediatric population with pJIA is comparable with the safety profile in the adult RA population. No new safety signals were identified. The rates of adverse events, including SAEs, infections, serious infections and haematological abnormalities e.g. neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are lower than in the sJIA population. This might be partly explained by the less diseased population.

The long term safety profile of TCZ in the paediatric population is currently limited. Additional data will be provided through the final report of the last part of study WA19977 (part III). Furthermore, the MAH was requested to initiate a new paediatric registry to collect long term efficacy and safety data in pJIA treatment. Both data colleactions are documented in the risk management plan.

## 2.3. Risk management plan

The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a risk  minimisation  plan.  The  key  principles  of  the  existing  education  material  have  been  updated  to include the new pJIA indication.

| Serious infections | • Routine pharmacovigilance • Special CRF for events of special interest: implemented in clinical trials as of Q4 2007/Guided Questionnaire (post-marketing data) • Ongoing clinical trial programme (see Section Error! Reference source not found. ) • Regular review by Roche Pharmacoepidemiology Board • Epidemiology data: o US claims database o EU registries (BSRBR, ARTIS, RABBIT) | Routine risk minimization by means of labelling SPC Section 4.3 Contraindications Active, severe infections (see section 4.4) SPC Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including RoActemra (see section 4.8). RoActemra treatment should not be initiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of RoActemra should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of RoActemra in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, diabetes, and interstitial lung disease) which may predispose patients to infections. Vigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving biological treatments for moderate to severe RA or sJIA as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened, associated with suppression of the acute phase reaction. The effects of tocilizumab on C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evaluating a patient for a potential infection. Patients (which includes younger children with sJIA who may be less able to communicate their symptoms) and parents/guardians of sJIA patients, should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms suggesting infection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment. |

In the all exposure population, the overall rate of infections with RoActemra was 108 events per 100 pt-yrs exposure. In 6-month, controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs was 5.3 events per 100 pt-yrs exposure compared to 3.9 events per 100 pt-yrs exposure in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the monotherapy study the rate of serious infections was 3.6 events per 100 pt- yrs of exposure in the tocilizumab group and 1.5 events per 100 pt-yrs of exposure in the MTX group. In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) was 4.7 events per 100 pt-yrs. Reported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included active tuberculosis, which may present with intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary disease, invasive pulmonary infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis.

In the 12 week controlled phase the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. At one year in the on- going open label extension phase the overall rate of serious infections remained stable at 11.3 per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections were similar to those seen in RA patients with the addition of varicella and otitis media. pJIA: The rate of infections in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21.4%) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (7.6%). |

Take special care with RoActemra If you have any kind of infection, short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. RoActemra can reduce your body's ability to respond to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new infection. If you have had tuberculosis, tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting RoActemra. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. Section 4 POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS Possible serious side effects include serious infections and allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, that may, in a small number of cases, be life- threatening If you notice any of the following signs of: …infections, tell your doctor as soon as possible: -fever and chills -mouth or skin blisters -stomach ache -persistent headaches Additional risk minimization: Alert card to advise patients and health care providers that RoActemra increases the risk of getting infections which can become serious if not treated and of the need for timely diagnostic and treatment measures on the first signs of infection.

RoActemra should be used with caution in patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients presenting with symptoms potentially indicative of complicated diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage and/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early identification of diverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation.

Reference source not found. ) • Regular review by Roche Pharmacoepidemiology Board • Epidemiology data: o US claims database o EU registries (BSRBR, ARTIS, RABBIT) | Hypersensitivity reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with infusion of RoActemra in approximately 0.3% of RA patients (see section 4.8). A patient with a previous infusion reaction and premedicated with steroids and antihistamines experienced a fatal anaphylactic reaction during a subsequent treatment with RoActemra in the post marketing setting. Appropriate treatment should be available for immediate use in the event of an anaphylactic reaction during treatment with RoActemra. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of RoActemra should be stopped immediately and RoActemra should be permanently discontinued. SPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects Infusion reactions In the 6-month controlled trials, adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during the infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting. The rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 6/3778 patients) was several fold higher with the 4 mg/kg dose compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. |

The safety profile in post marketing experience is consistent with clinical trial data with the exception of a case of a fatal anaphylactic reaction that has been reported during tocilizumab treatment (see section 4.4). sJIA: Infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of patients from the tocilizumab group experienced events occurring during infusion. On event (angioedema) was considered serious and life- threatening, and the patient was discontinued from study treatment. In the 12 week controlled phase, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab group and 5.4% of patients in the placebo group experienced an event within 24 hours of infusion. In the tocilizumab group, the events included, but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment |

Haematological abnormalities

Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in patients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist.

Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of RoActemra treatment in patients with a low neutrophil or platelet count (i.e. ANC &lt; 2 x 10 9 / l or platelet count below 100 x 10 3 / μl). In patients with an ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10 9 / l or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10 3 / μl treatment is not recommended.

In RA patients, eutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2. In sJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of the second infusion and thereafter according to good

The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in increased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab monotherapy patients and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of whom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increase in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment. During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevations in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials. During the double-blind controlled period, the incidence of indirect total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A total of 5.8% of patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin |

Undesirable effects Immunogenicity A total of 2876 patients have been tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies in the controlled clinical trials. Of the 46 patients (1.6%) who developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies, 6 had an associated medically significant hypersensitivity reaction, of which 5 led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. Thirty patients developed neutralising antibodies. sJIA: All 112 patients were tested for anti- tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies with one of these patients having a hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. The incidence of anti- tocilizumab antibody formation might be underestimated because of interference of tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug concentration observed in children compared to adults. pJIA: One patient in the 10 mg/kg < 30kg group developed positive anti-tocilizumab                                                                                         |

Routine risk minimization by means of labelling: SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Lipid parameters Elevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in total cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of RoActemra therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia. Cardiovascular Risk RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors (eg. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

| CYP450 enzyme normalisation | • Routine pharmacovigilance • Ongoing clinical trial programme (see Section Error! Reference source not found. ) • Regular review by Roche Pharmacoepidemiology Board | Routine risk minimization by means of labelling: SPC section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by the cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as tocilizumab, is introduced. In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalises expression of these enzymes. When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 or 2C19 (e.g. atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy. |

## SPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Haematological abnormalities Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in patients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist.

Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of RoActemra treatment in patients with a low neutrophil or platelet count (i.e. ANC &lt; 2 x 10 9 / l or platelet count below 100 x 10 3 / μl). In patients with an ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10 9 / l or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10 3 / μl treatment is not recommended.

In RA patients, eutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2. In sJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of the second infusion and thereafter according to good clinical practice, see section 4.2.

## SPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects/Laboratory evaluations Haematological abnormalities Neutrophils

In the 6-month controlled trials, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 / l occurred in 3.4% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to &lt; 0.1% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC &lt; 1 x 10 9 / l did so within 8 weeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 10 9 / l were reported in 0.3% patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. There was no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious

The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in increased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab monotherapy patients and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of whom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increase in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment. During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevations in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials. During the double-blind controlled period, the incidence of indirect total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A total of 5.8% of patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin |

Of the 46 patients (1.6%) who developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies, 6 had an associated medically significant hypersensitivity reaction, of which 5 led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. Thirty patients developed neutralising antibodies. sJIA: All 112 patients were tested for anti- tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies with one of these patients having a hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. The incidence of anti- tocilizumab antibody formation might be underestimated because of interference of tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug concentration observed in children compared to adults. pJIA: One patient in the 10 mg/kg < 30kg group developed positive anti-tocilizumab                                                                |

In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in total cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of RoActemra therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia.

| CYP450 enzyme normalisation | • Routine pharmacovigilance • Ongoing clinical trial programme (see Section Error! Reference source not found. ) • Regular review by Roche Pharmacoepidemiology Board | Routine risk minimization by means of labelling: SPC section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by the cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as tocilizumab, is introduced. In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalises expression of these enzymes. When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 or 2C19 (e.g. atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy. |

investigated in the longterm extension. In addition, investigations into dose reductions / treatment interruptions will be reported in upcoming PSURs.

- On-goingStudy WA19977 (pJIA)
- The efficacy of 10 mg/kg dosing for patients weighing less than 30 kg, will be substantiated via a paediatric registry.This registry will also be used to capture the occurance of uveitis and growth impairment in pJIA patients treated with tocilizumab in a post marketed setting.

patients below 2 years of age has not been established. No data are available.

The recommended posology is 8 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg. The dose should be calculated based on the patient's body weight at each administration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time.

Dose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in sJIA patients.

Section 2 What you need to know before you use RoActemra RoActemra is not recommended for use in patients under 2 years of age.

| Effects during pregnancy          | • Routine pharmacovigilance • Ongoing clinical trial programme (see Section Error! Reference source not found. ) • Regular review by Roche Pharmacoepidemiology Board • Registry study with OTIS • Pregnancy data from BSRBR and RABBIT   | Routine risk minimization by means of labelling: SPC section 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of tocilizumab in pregnant women. A study in animals has shown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/embryo-foetal death at a high dose (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during (and up to 3 months after) treatment. RoActemra should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## 2.4. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed (new text shown as underlined, deleted text as strikethrough):

## Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications of the SmPC

RoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. RoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

## Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration of the SmPC

Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA or sJIA or pJIA. All patients treated with RoActemra should be given the Patient Alert Card.

[…]

## pJIA patients

The safety and efficacy of RoActemra in children below 2 years of age has not been established.

No data are available.

- The recommended posology is 8 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 10 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg. The dose should be calculated based on the patient's body weight at each administration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time.
- Dose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in pJIA patients in the tables below. If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications should be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation has been evaluated. As there are many co-morbid conditions that may effect laboratory values in pJIA, the decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of the individual patient.

1.  Infusion related reaction events in pJIA patients included but were not limited to headache, nausea and hypotension
2.  Infusion related reaction events in sJIA patients included but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache

## pJIA Patients

The safety of tocilizumab in pJIA has been studied in 188 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. The total patient exposure was 184.4 patient years. The frequency of ADRs in pJIA patients can be found in Table 2. The types of ADRs in pJIA patients were similar to those seen in RA and sJIA patients, see section 4.8. When compared to the adult RA population, events of nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, and decreased neutrophil count were more frequently reported in the pJIA population. Events of cholesterol increased were less frequently reported in the pJIA population than in the adult RA population.

## Infections

The rate of infections in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing &lt;30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing &lt;30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21.4%) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (7.6%).

## Infusion Reactions

In pJIA patients, infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab all exposure population, 11 patients (5.9%) experienced infusion reactions during the infusion and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occuring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension and within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and sJIA patients, see section 4.8.

No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported.

## Immunogenicity

One patient in the 10 mg/kg &lt; 30kg group developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies without developing a hypersensitivity reaction and subsequently withdrew from the study.

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 3.7% of patients.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, 1% of patients had a decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × 10 3 /µL without associated bleeding events.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in ALT or AST ≥3xULN occurred in 3.7% and &lt;1% of patients, respectively.

## Lipid parameters

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in total cholesterol &gt;1.5-2 x ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%) and elevation in LDL &gt;1.5-2 x ULN in one patient (0.5%).

## sJIA Patients

The safety of tocilizumab in sJIA has been studied in 112 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled phase, 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab (8 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of switching to tocilizumab, due to disease worsening, patients were treated in the ongoing open label extension phase.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In general, the ADRs in sJIA patients were similar in type to those seen in RA patients, see section 4.8. The frequency of ADRs in sJIA patients can be found in Table 2. When compared to the adult RA population, patients with sJIA experienced a higher frequency of nasopharyngitis, decrease in neutrophil counts, hepatic transaminases increased, and diarrhea. Events of cholesterol increased were less frequently reported in the sJIA population than in the adult RA population.

## Infections

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the tocilizumab group was 344.7 per 100 patient years and 287.0 per 100 patient years in the placebo group. In the ongoing open label extension phase (Part II), the overall rate of infections remained similar at 306.6 per 100 patient years.

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. At one year in the ongoing open label extension phase the overall rate of serious infections remained stable at 11.3 per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections were similar to those seen in RA patients with the addition of varicella and otitis media.

## Infusion Reactions

Infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of patients from the tocilizumab group experienced events occurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life-threatening, and the patient was discontinued from study treatment.

In the 12 week controlled phase, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab group and 5.4% of patients in the placebo group experienced an event within 24 hours of infusion. In the tocilizumab group, the events included, but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious.

Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation, were reported in 1 out of 112 patients (&lt;1%) treated with tocilizumab during the controlled and up to and including the open label clinical trial.

## Immunogenicity

All 112 patients were tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies with one of these patients having a hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. The incidence of anti-tocilizumab antibody formation might be underestimated because of interference of tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug concentration observed in children compared to adults.

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /l occurred in 7% of patients in the tocilizumab group, and no decreases in the placebo group.

In the ongoing open label extension phase, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /l, occurred in 15% of the tocilizumab group.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, 3% of patients in the placebo group and 1% in the tocilizumab group had a decrease in platelet count to ≤100 x 10 3 /µl.

In the ongoing open label extension phase, decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 10 3 /µl, occurred in 3% of patients in the tocilizumab group, without associated bleeding events.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group, and 0% in the placebo group.

In the ongoing open label extension phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 12% and 4% of patients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunoglobuilin G

IgG levels decrease during therapy. A decrease to the lower limit of normal occurred in 15 patients at some point in the study.

## Lipid parameters

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in total cholesterol &gt; 1.5 x ULN to 2 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of the tocilizumab group and none in the placebo group. Elevation in LDL &gt; 1.5 x ULN to 2 x ULN occurred in 1.9% of patients in the tocilizumab group, and in 0% of the placebo group.

In the ongoing open label extension phase, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with the 12 week controlled phase data.

## SJIA Patients

The safety of tocilizumab in sJIA has been studied in 112 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled phase, 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab (8  mg/kg or 12 mg/kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of switching to tocilizumab, due to disease worsening, patients were treated in the ongoing open label extension phase.

## Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC

## PJIA Patients

Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of tocilizumab was assessed in a three-part study WA19977 including an open-label extension in children with active pJIA. Part I consisted of a 16-week active tocilizumab treatment lead-in period (n=188) followed by Part II, a 24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal period (n=163), followed by Part III, a 64-week open-label period. In Part 1, eligible patients ≥ 30 kg received tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeksfor 4 doses. Patients &lt; 30 kg were randomized 1:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. Patients who completed Part I of the study and achieved at least a JIA ACR30 response at week 16 compared to baseline were eligible to enter the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) of the study. In Part II, patients were randomized to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by concurrent MTX use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR30 flare criteria (relative to Week 16) and qualified for escape to tocilizumab therapy (same dose received in Part I).

## Clinical response

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR30 flare at week 40 relative to week 16. Forty eight percent (48.1%, 39/81) of the patients treated with placebo flared compared with 25.6% (21/82) of tocilizumab treated patients. These proportions were statistically significantly different (p=0.0024).

At the conclusion of Part I, JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were 89.4%, 83.0%, 62.2%, and 26.1%, respectively.

During the withdrawal phase (Part II), the percentage of patients achieving JIA ACR 30, 50, and 70 responses at Week 40 relative to baseline are shown in Table 7. In this statistical analysis, patients who flared (and escaped to TCZ) during Part II or who withdrew, were classified as non-responders. An additional analyses of JIA ACR responses, considering observed data at Week 40, regardless of flare status, showed that by Week 40, 95.1% of patients who had received continuous TCZ therapy, had achieved JIA ACR30 or higher.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 7. JIA ACR Response Rates at Week 40 Relative to baseline (Percentage of Patients)

| Response Rate   | Tocilizumab N=82   | Placebo N=81   |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|
| ACR 30          | 74.4%*             | 54.3%*         |
| ACR 50          | 73.2%*             | 51.9%*         |
| ACR 70          | 64.6%*             | 42.0%*         |

## * p&lt;0.01 , tocilizuma b vs. placebo

The  number  of  active  joints  was  significantly  reduced  compared  to  baseline  in  patients  receiving tocilizumab  compared  to  placebo  (adjusted  mean  changes  of  -14.3  vs  -11.4,  p=0.0435).  The physician's global assessment of disease activity, as measured on a 0-100 mm scale, showed a greater reduction in disease activity for tocilizumab compared to placebo (adjusted mean changes of -45.2 mm vs -35.2 mm, p=0.0031).

The adjusted mean change in the pain VAS after 40 weeks of tocilizumab treatment was 32.4 mm on a 0-100 mm  scale  compared  to  a  reduction  of  22.3  mm  for  placebo  patients  (highly  statistically significant; p=0.0076).

The ACR response rates were numerically lower for patients with prior biologic treatment as shown in Table 8 below.

| JIA ACR90 Response | 2 (8.7)   | 17 (29.3) | 5 (18.5)  | 32 (58.2) |

Patients randomized to tocilizumab had fewer ACR30 flares and higher overall ACR responses than patients receiving placebo regardless of a history of prior biologic use.

## Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the SmPC

## PJIA Patients:

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on a database composed of 188 patients with pJIA.

The following parameters are valid for a dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight ≥ 30 kg) given every 4 weeks. The predicted mean ( ± SD) AUC4weeks, Cmax and Cmin of tocilizumab were 29500 ± 8660 µg ⋅ hr/mL, 182 ± 37 µg/mL and 7.49 ± 8.20 µg/mL, respectively.

The following parameters are valid for a dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight &lt; 30 kg) given every 4 weeks. The predicted mean ( ± SD) AUC4weeks, Cmax and Cmin of tocilizumab were 23200 ± 6100 µg ⋅ hr/mL, 175 ± 32 µg/mL and 2.35 ± 3.59 µg/mL, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The accumulation ratios were 1.05 and 1.16 for AUC4weeks, and 1.43 and 2.22 for Cmin for 10 mg/kg (body weight &lt; 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (body weight ≥ 30 kg) doses, respectively. No accumulation for Cmax was observed.

In pJIA patients, the central volume of distribution was 50 ml/kg, the peripheral volume of distribution was 53 ml/kg, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 103 ml/kg. The linear clearance estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was 0.146 ml/hr/kg.

The half life of tocilizumab in pJIA patients is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight ≥ 30 kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight &lt; 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state.

## Section 1. What RoActemra is used for of the PL

- RoActemra is also used to treat patients 2 years of age and older with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( pJIA ), an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints. RoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of pJIA and can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone.

## Section 2. What you need to know before you take RoActemra of the PL

Due to lack of clinical experience, RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological medicines for the treatment of RA or sJIA or pJIA.

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

RoActemra is not to be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, may be pregnant, or intend to become pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.

Stop breast-feeding if you are to be given RoActemra , and talk to your doctor. Leave a gap of at least 3 months after your last treatment before you start breast-feeding. It is not known whether RoActemra is passed into breast milk.

Available non-clinical data does not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment

## Section 3. How RoActemra is given of the PL

## Children with pJIA

The usual dose of RoActemra depends on your weight.

- If you weigh less than 30kg: the dose is 10mg per kg
- If you weigh 30kg or more: the dose is is 8 mg for every kilogram of body weight

The dose is calculated based on your body weight at each administration.

Children with pJIA will be given RoActemra once every 4 weeks through a drip in your vein (intravenous infusion) over one hour.

## Section 4. Possible side effects of the PL

## SJIA Patients

In general, the side effects in sJIA patients were similar in type to those seen in RA patients as stated above.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

In the pivotal phase III study WA19977, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients developing  JIA  ACR30  flare  between  Week  16  and  Week  40.  Patients  receiving  placebo  and  those receiving  TCZ  were  compared.  Three  subsets  of  the  JIA  population  were  included  in  the  study:  RFpositive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular arthritis.

The JIA ACR30 flares relative to week 16 in patients receiving TCZ was statistically significantly lower than the rate in patients receiving placebo (25.6% vs. 48.1%). The primary endpoint was met.

This result was supported by a predefined set of secondary analyses, controlling for multiple testing. To  control  for  the  type  I  error  rate,  the  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  fixed sequence  approach.  The  chain  of  statistical  significance  in  the  hierarchical  testing  of  secondary endpoints  was  broken  after  the  seventh  of  13  endpoints.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  JIA ARC/30/50/70  improvement  was  statistical  significant  higher  in  the  TCZ  group  than  in  the  placebo group. Change from baseline in number of active joints, in Physician's global assessments VAS and in pain VAS also demonstrated statistical significant superiority of TCZ over placebo.

Thus it can be considered that the results demonstrated a clinically relevant benefit in patients with RF-positive or RF negative pJIA, and extended oligoarticular arthritis.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Impairment  of  growth  is  a  common  problem  in  juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis  (JRA),  particularly  in children  with  active  disease.  So  far  no  data  on  the  potential  impact  on  TCZ  therapy  on  growth retardation of in the paediatric population are available. Data on growth development are collected in part  III  of  study  WA19977  and  will  be  provided  with  the  final  study  report.  The  MAH  should  also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

include  monitoring  the  growth  development  in  the  paediatric  registry  as  described  in  the  risk management plan.

An increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease is documented in adult RA patients, it is suggested that chronic inflammation and impaired immune system are increasing the risk for atherosclerosis in this population. In paediatric patients there is also evidence that JIA is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis, yet the data are scare. The MAH will collect post marketing data on the efficacy and safety of TCZ in children with pJIA in a paediatric registry as described in the risk management plan.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  unfavourable  effects  of  TCZ  are  established  and  include  infection,  allergic  reactions  including anaphylaxis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, AST/ALT/bilirubin elevation and hypercholesterolaemia.

No new safety signals were identified. The safety profile of TCZ in paediatric population with pJIA is comparable with the safety profile in the adult RA population. The rates of adverse events, including SAEs, infections, serious infections and haematological abnormalities e.g. neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are lower than in the sJIA population.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavorable effects

The long term safety data of TCZ in the paediatric population is limited. The final report of the part III of study WA19977 is will provide further information. In addition, the MAH was requested to initiate a paediatric registry to generate long-term efficacy and safety data. This registry specifically addresses the  occurrence/treatment  of  uveitis  in  pJIA  patients  as  one  patient  experienced  this  event  under treatment  with  TCZ.  These  measures  are  defined  in  the  risk  management  plan  and  considered appropriate.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

JIA is a major cause of disability in children. The prognosis depends on the adequacy of therapy. The aim the treatment is rapid suppression of inflammation in order to prevent organ damage, maximise physical function and promote normal growth and development.

The important clinical benefit of TCZ observed in the pivotal study WA19977 was a rapid alleviating of signs and symptoms in children with JRA in children which are unresponsive to MTX or who intolerant to MTX. The primary endpoint was met at the end of the placebo controlled withdrawal period at week 40.  Furthermore,  at  the  end  of  the  active  lead  in  period  (week  16)  clinically  meaningful  JIA  ACR response rates (week 16) were achieved.

The safety profile of TCZ in the paediatric population with pJIA is comparable with the safety profile in the adult RA population. No new safety signals were identified. Appropriate risk minimisation measures (routine or additional) are included in the RMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-risk balance

The demonstrated clinical benefit of TCZ therapy in children with RF-positive or RF negative pJIA, and extended  oligoarticular  arthritis  who  are  unresponsive  or  intolerant  to  MTX  outweighs  the  risks. Appropriate  risk  minimisation  measures  (routine  or  additional)  are  included  in  the  RMP.  Additional long-term efficacy and safety data in pJIA will be provided with the final results of study WA19977 and information from a new paediatric registry, as described in the risk management plan. The benefit risk balance in the proposed indication and patient population is positive.
