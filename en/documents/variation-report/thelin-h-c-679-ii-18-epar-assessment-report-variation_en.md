## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Thelin contains sitaxentan sodium, which is an endothelin receptor antagonist, with higher selectivity for  the  ETA  receptor  than  the  ETB  receptor  subtype.  Endothelin-1  (ET-1)  is  a  potent  vascular paracrine and autocrine peptide in the lung, and can also promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, and is pro-inflammatory. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH),  as  well  as  other  cardiovascular disorders  and  connective  tissue  diseases,  including  scleroderma,  acute  and  chronic  heart  failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension, and atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of ET1  in  these  diseases.  In  PAH  and  heart  failure,  in  the  absence  of  endothelin  receptor  antagonism, elevated ET-1 concentrations are strongly correlated with the severity and prognosis of these diseases. Additionally, PAH is also characterised by reduced nitric oxide activity. ET-1 actions are mediated through endothelin A receptors (ETA), present on smooth muscle cells, and endothelin B receptors (ETB), present on endothelial cells. Predominant actions of ET-1 binding to ETA are vasoconstriction and  vascular  remodelling,  while  binding  to  ETB  results  in  ET-1  clearance,  and  vasodilatory/ antiproliferative effects due in part to nitric oxide and prostacyclin release.

Thelin was granted a marketing authorisation by the European Commission on 10 August 2006 and is indicated  for  the  Treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  classified  as  WHO functional  class  III,  to  improve  exercise  capacity.  Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  primary  pulmonary hypertension and in pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease of the small pulmonary arteries, characterized by vascular  proliferation  and  remodelling.  It  results  in  a  progressive  increase  in  pulmonary  arterial resistance  and,  ultimately,  right  ventricular  failure  and  death.  The  functional  classification  (FC)  of PAH  according  to  clinical  parameters  modified  from  the  New  York  Heart  Association  (NYHA) classification of patients with cardiac disease, is as follows:  Class  I:  PAH  without  a  resulting  limitation  of  physical  activity.  Ordinary  physical  activity does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope.  Class II: PAH resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at rest,  but  ordinary  physical  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  near syncope.  Class III: PAH resulting a marked limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at rest,  but  less  than  ordinary  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  near syncope.  Class IV: PAH resulting in an inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. The patient has signs of right heart failure. Dyspnoea, fatigue, or both may be present even at rest, and discomfort is increased by any physical activity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It has been shown that patients who improve from functional class III or class IV to functional class II after treatment have significantly improved survival. Therefore, it might be reasonable to expect that early  treatment  of  WHO  functional  class  II  patients  might  provide  an  improvement  in  survival  as progression to functional class III might be delayed. Furthermore, early treatment of functional class II patients is supported by the finding that not all patients respond to treatment and if treatment initiation is delayed until the patient progresses to functional class III or IV, a significant proportion will remain in functional class III or class IV.

Until recently, no therapeutic options were available in the EU for WHO/NYHA functional class II patients. In 2008, ambrisentan (Volibris) was approved as a new chemical entity for both functional class II and III patients, and bosentan (Tracleer) had its functional class III label extended to include benefit in functional class II patients. The basis to include WHO functional class II patients were on two grounds:

1. The  functional  class  II  subjects  recruited  into  the  trials  were  a  demonstrably  different population from the functional class III subjects;
2. Efficacy was demonstrated for both functional class II and class III subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sildenafil (Revatio) and tadalafil (Adcirca) have also received recent approvals in functional class II.

In this type II variation, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied to extend Section 4.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) with the statement ' Some improvements have also been shown in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) WHO functional class II (see section 5.1) '  and  to  amend  Section  5.1  of  the  SPC  with  updated  information  by  functional  class  (FC)  and updated long term survival data.

Further to the assessment of the data submitted in the variation application and in the responses to the CHMP requests for supplementary information, the CHMP considered that efficacy data to support an extension of the indication in section 4.1 of the SPC to WHO FC II patients was insufficient. Results of  the  6-minute  walk  test  were  not  statistically  significant,  while  data  on  the  effect  on  clinical worsening  were  based  from  a  post-hoc  analysis  which  also  failed  to  show  statistical  significance. Benefit  seen  on  FC  and  haemodynamics  are  supportive,  but  insufficient.  However,  the  CHMP considered  acceptable  to  include  relevant  haemodynamic  data  in  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  as  the information can be useful to the prescriber.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

No new clinical studies were included to support this type II variation. The MAH re-evaluated data from  two  previously  submitted  pivotal  studies:  STRIDE  1  (FPH01)  and  STRIDE  2  (FPH02),  to support  the  requested  changes  with  regard  to  WHO  FC  II.  The  MAH  believed  that  WHO  FC  II subjects have been adequately studied in these trials.

The MAH also referred to two other medicinal products, namely ambrisentan and bosentan, which are indicated for WHO FC II patients. The MAH was convinced that the considerations of ambrisentan and bosentan can now be similarly applied to the sitaxentan data.

## 1.2.1. Clinical efficacy

## 1.2.1.1. Main studies

Data from two pivotal studies, STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2 with supporting safety information from the extension study STRIDE 2X (FPH02X) and long term survival data for subjects in STRIDE 2 were included in the submission.

Patients  from  study  STRIDE  2X  were  eligible  to  enter  a  long-term  open-label  study  STRIDE  3 (FPH03). Survival status in this study together with the survival status of patients who were included in studies STRIDE 2 and STRIDE 2X but did not enter study STRIDE 3 was also included.

At the request of the CHMP, the MAH also submitted the results of study STRIDE 4.

##  Methods and baseline

Medicinal product no longer authorised

STRIDE-1 included 3 groups (sitaxentan 100 mg, sitaxentan 300 mg, placebo dosed orally once daily) of approximately 60 subjects with FC II-IV per group, treated in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 12 in percent of predicted peak oxygen uptake (VO2). According to the MAH, the primary endpoint was chosen at the time (early 2001) in order to address the concern that the standard use of the 450-meter upper limit for 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) would exclude many of the functional class II from the study. At the time, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was felt to be a more sensitive indicator of change in PAH patients; however, it remains a difficult endpoint in a multicenter trial due to technical difficulties in performing and standardizing the testing.

The secondary endpoints included the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), WHO functional class, time to clinical worsening and haemodynamic measures. The inclusion/exclusion criteria did not include any constraint on distance walked in the 6-MWT.

STRIDE-2 included 4 arms of approximately 60 subjects with FC II-IV per arm: placebo, sitaxentan 50 mg, sitaxentan 100 mg, treated in a double-blind fashion for 18 weeks; in addition, a fourth arm of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

open-label bosentan 62.5 mg for 1 month, followed by 125 mg for the duration of the study, consistent with the approved labelling for bosentan, was included. The 6-MWT was the primary endpoint, while WHO  functional  class,  time  to  clinical  deterioration,  and  Borg  Dyspnoea  Score  were  secondary endpoints. Subjects were included in STRIDE 2 if they could walk between 150 and 450 meters at baseline on the 6-MWT.

The key features of the two studies are summarized in Table 1.

## Representativeness of FC WHO II

At  the  time  when  sitaxentan  was  evaluated  for  approval,  concerns  were  raised  in  relation  to  the representativeness  of  patients  included  in  WHO  functional  class  II  and  the  magnitude  of  the  effect achieved in the  measurement of 6-MWT. As a result, only WHO functional class III labelling was considered for sitaxentan. The concerns regarding the representativeness of the WHO FC II population in the sitaxentan study population were based on a publication in 2000 by Miyamoto et al .  in which patients with PAH WHO FC II should walk approximately 450 m in 6 minutes.

Later, Humbert, et  al .  published results from the French National PAH Registry in 2006, indicating that patients of WHO FC II, were expected to walk about 415 m (±86 m) in 6 minutes.

## Baseline 6-MWT and Functional Class

As shown in Table 4, WHO functional classes II and III were comparably differentiated, with respect to  baseline  walking  distance,  in  STRIDE  1,  STRIDE  2  (Sitaxentan  studies),  AMB-320,  AMB-321 (Ambrisentan studies) and the EARLY Study (Bosentan study). The 6-MWT observed in STRIDE 1 and  STRIDE  2  was  also  comparable  with  the  expected  6-MWT  according  to  the  walking  distance reported in the French registry.

## Baseline 6-MWT by Cut-off Point

In  the  ambrisentan  application,  400m  was  used  as  a  cut-off  point  for  the  6-MWT  to  show  that  a substantial number of less severe patients (class II) could have been included in its two clinical trials. When both clinical studies are combined, nearly half of the patients (47%) with functional class II had a 6MWD&gt;400m compared with 26.9% of patients with functional class III (when both clinical trials are  combined).  This  data  suggests  that  a  substantial  number  of  less  severe  patients  (class  II)  could have been included in both clinical trials (Volibris EPAR).

In STRIDE 1, 75% of functional class II subjects walked &gt; 400m at baseline; 42% of functional class III  subjects  walked  &gt;400m  at  baseline.  In  STRIDE  2,  38%  of  class  II  subjects  walked  &gt;  400m  at baseline; 17% of class III subjects walked &gt;400m at baseline. The difference between STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2 here is likely due to the difference in entrance criteria in these studies, i.e. while no upper limit was set for 6MWD in STRIDE 1; it was limited to 450m in STRIDE 2.

## Haemodynamics

In  STRIDE-1 ,  there  were  differences  between  WHO  functional  classes  II  and  III  with  respect  to baseline  Pulmonary  Vascular  Resistance  (PVR),  Mean  Pulmonary  Artery  Pressure  (mPAP),  Heart Rate, Right Atrial Pressure (RAP), and Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) (Table 5).  No significant differences  for  Wedge  Pressure  (PCWP),  Cardiac  Index  (CI),  Cardiac  Output  (CO),  Mean  Arterial Pressure (MAP) were detected.

In  STRIDE-2, haemodynamic  parameters  were  only  collected  at  the  baseline  visit  and  no  posttreatment assessments were taken. Based on the key haemodynamic parameters in PAH, there is clear differentiation  between  subjects  assessed  as  FCII  and  FC  III  at  baseline  with  respect  to  baseline pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac index (CI), the key haemodynamic parameters for diagnosis of PAH (Table 6). As expected, no significant difference in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) were evident.

##  Efficacy Results

The 6-MWT, haemodynamics, WHO FC and survival results presented below are based on the intentto-treat population ITT defined as all randomized subjects who received any dose of study drug, and subjects were analyzed by the group to which they were randomized regardless of which treatment they  received.  One  subject  in  STRIDE  1  and  one  in  STRIDE  2  did  not  receive  the  treatment randomized: the subject in STRIDE 1 was randomized to placebo but received sitaxentan 100 mg; the subject in STRIDE 2 was randomized to sitaxentan 100 mg but received sitaxentan 50 mg. Only data for the approved dose sitaxentan 100 mg are presented in the following sections.

In STRIDE 4, there was no significant different in the 6-MWT in the whole cohort, or those with FC II at  baseline  (Table  8).  The  MAH  attributed  this  to  the  higher  variability  in  the  placebo  group  in STRIDE 4 compared to that in the other 2 studies.

Sitax: sitaxentan; pbo: placebo; N; number of subjects

Differences between treatments for each functional class were assessed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Hodges-Lehmann estimates of treatment effect.

Statistically significant improvement in 6MWT was observed in the more severe PAH patients after sitaxentan 100 mg treatment by both cut-off points. However, no statistically significant improvement or  clinically  relevant  improvements  were  seen  after  sitaxentan  100 mg  treatment  in  WHO  FC  II subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the small number of placebo subjects with baseline 6MWD &gt;400m in the STRIDE 2 study, STRIDE 2 results were not analyzed for this endpoint. Presenting the 6-MWT results of STRIDE-4 with baseline cut-off values of above and below 400 m, did not reveal any significant difference for either group.

Only subjects who have been randomised to placebo or sitaxentan 100 mg and for whom both baseline and Week 12 data are available are included. PVR: pulmonary vascular resistance; PVRI: pulmonary vascular resistance index; CI: cardiac index Sitax: sitaxentan; N: number of subjects. PVRI has been derived as PVR*BSA.

Only baseline haemodynamics were collected in STRIDE-2 and -4.

## Functional Class Changes

WHO functional class data from STRIDE-1, -2 and -4 over 12 weeks and 18 weeks of treatment with sitaxentan 100 mg compared to placebo  are presented in Table 11.

The number of patients who showed a worsening of FC was lower in the sitaxentan sodium 100 mg treatment  group  compared  to  placebo.  This  benefit  was  observed  across  all  studies  and  was independent of baseline FC severity.

There was a statistically significant improvement in FC following sitaxentan sodium 100mg treatment for baseline FCIII patients in STRIDE-1 and baseline FCII patients in STRIDE-2 (Table 12).

Pooling  data  from  the  three  studies,  it  appears  that  FCII  patients  treated  with  sitaxentan  sodium 100 mg were 3.26 (p=0.0140) times more likely to show improvements in FC than those on placebo. This is  similar  to  data  for  FCIII  patients,  in  which  the  odds  ratio  estimate  was  2.78  (p=0.0037)  for improvements in FC (Table 13).

Given the known association of survival with FC in PAH, the long-term survival of the 145 patients treated with sitaxentan sodium 100mg was further analysed for its association with FC in STRIDE-2X. The results indicate that the long term survival was associated with FC at baseline (Hazard ratio 2.12; p=0.0246). However, an improvement in FC did not appear to improve survival. This suggests that an improvement in FCIII to FCII does not afford the  same  survival  benefit  as  maintaining  patients  in FCII.

The Kaplan-Meier rates of clinical worsening events are presented for individual studies in Table 14 and Table 15 and a pooled analysis of STRIDE-1, -2 and -4 in Table 16.

Figure 1 - Improvements in Functional Class with sitaxentan sodium 100 mg Time to clinical worsening At  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  presented  results  on  time  to  clinical  worsening.  The  MAH conducted an analysis using a consistent definition of time to clinical worsening (TTCW) from the Draft  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigations  of Medicinal  Products  for  the  Treatment  of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008), which is the first occurrence of 1) death; 2) hospitalisation due to worsening of PAH; 3) a 15% reduction from baseline in 6MWD in two consecutive visits; and 4) worsening in FC from baseline in two consecutive visits. TTCW was assessed  in  pooled  analysis  of  data  from  all  three  randomised,  controlled  clinical  trials  comparing sitaxentan sodium 100mg vs placebo in the treatment of PAH (STRIDE-1, - 2 and -4). Additionally, TTCW in patients treated with sitaxentan sodium 100mg was compared to bosentan-treated patients enrolled in STRIDE-2/-2X. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A  relatively  low  number  of  clinical  worsening  events  would  be  expected,  given  this  observation period,  and  a  disproportionately  greater  number  of  events  would  be  anticipated  in  FCIII  patients compared to FCII.  A numerical benefit in the time to clinical worsening was observed in STRIDE-2 and STRIDE-4 (non-significant). There was no difference observed in the event rate in the 12-week STRIDE-1 study. This could be due to a combination of few FCII patients and short study duration.

In  patients  classified  as  FCII  at  baseline  the  majority  of  clinical  worsening  events  were  due  to deterioration in FC in both the sitaxentan sodium 100mg (92%) and bosentan (60%) treatment groups. There was one death and one case of hospitalization due to worsening of PAH in the bosentan arm and one case of hospitalisation in the sitaxentan sodium 100mg arm. In FCIII patients the proportion of patients  who  were  hospitalised  was  50%  and  35%  in  the  bosentan  and  sitaxentan  sodium  100mg treatment groups, respectively.

## 1.2.1.2 Discussion on clinical efficacy

No new clinical studies were submitted to support this application.

Ambrisentan and Bosentan (both endothelin receptor antagonists) are currently registered for PAH FC II based on the results of studies ARIES-1/ARIES-2 and the EARLY study, respectively. The ARIES studies were 12 week double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter studies in 394 PAH patients (both FC II  and  III)  with  as  primary  endpoint:  6-MWT.  The  EARLY  study  was  a  6  month  double-blind placebo-controlled  study  in  168  PAH  WHO  FC  II  patients  with  as  primary  endpoints:  pulmonary vascular resistance (% from baseline), 6-MWT (% from baseline). One of the secondary endpoints was time to clinical worsening.

In both sitaxentan studies, the placebo-corrected changes in the 6-MWT at week 12 for WHO FC II were not statistically significant, which constitutes a major objection to the extension of the indication to this FC. STRIDE-1 and STRIDE-2 recruited 16 and 35 patients in FC II respectively. The results of the 6-MWT presented at EOT (+20 m and +11.3 for STRIDE-1 and STRIDE-2 respectively) compare better than the results at week 12 for both studies (+20m and +6m respectively). Still the results are not reassuring considering that STRIDE-2 was the larger study. The results of the sitaxentan arm in general (inclusive FC II and III) and specifically for WHO FC III as shown in Table 7 on the other hand are statistically and clinically significant, which is the basis for the registration of sitaxentan for the corresponding class.

The  rationale  for  extending  the  indication  to  WHO  FC  II  for  both  bosentan  and  Ambrisentan  is presented  above.  Extrapolating  efficacy  from  one  endothelin  receptor  antagonist  to  the  other  is  not possible. With the publishing of the French Registry of PAH patients (Humbert et al., 2006) based on data from 674  patients,  lower  6-MWT  values  were  assigned  for  FC  II  than  those  previously  reported  in  the article  by  Miyamoto  et  al.,  2000:  415m  vs  450  m  respectively.  The  values  reported  in  the  French Registry are currently the accepted ones. Accordingly, re-evaluating data shown above from STRIDE1 and STRIDE-2 provides evidence that PAH FC II and III subjects were clinically distinguishable populations regarding the 6-MWT, comparable to those recruited in the Ambrisentan and Bosentan studies. The use of concomitant medications in FCIII was more than in FC II, which further supports the  differentiation  of  these  functional  classes  at  baseline  in  STRIDE-1  and  STRIDE-2  studies.  The submitted  data  support  that  recruited  PAH  patients  in  STRIDE-1  and  STRIDE-2  had  statistically different haemodynamic values for WHO FC II and III.

Analysis of the 6-MWT using different cut-offs support the previous results. There is a statistically and clinically relevant improvement in the 6-MWT test in patients in the more severe PAH patients after 12 weeks in the sitaxentan treatment group, but not in the patients with milder disease. This again supports the previous conclusion. On the other hand, the administration of Ambrisentan consistently resulted in significant improvements whatever the cut-off used.

In STRIDE-1, sitaxentan administration resulted in statistically significant haemodynamic changes in WHO  FC  II,  though  obviously  less  than  those  achieved  for  WHO  FC  III.  Haemodynamic measurements are not generally accepted as primary endpoints in PAH clinical studies and their role are mainly in Phase II studies to investigate the mechanism of action or the dose response relationship.

In  PAH  patients  with  FC  II  at  baseline,  improvements  in  FC  were  only  significant  in  STRIDE-2; sitaxentan did not show significant improvements in FC in STRIDE-1 and -4. However, pooling of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3  studies  improve  the  results,  leading  to  significant  improvement  in  FC.  The  robustness  of  such pooling/results is questioned specially in light of the opposite direction of the results of the 6-MWT. The results are generally supportive as the improvement of WHO FC is not considered as a robust primary endpoint. In addition, no formal statistical analysis was conducted.

TTCW was assessed in STRIDE-1,-2 and -4 as a secondary endpoint, though with different definitions in each study. For the sake of consistency, the MAH conducted an analysis using a single definition in line with that defined in the draft CHMP guideline for PAH.  The results generally show significant benefit in the whole cohort studied, but this was primarily due to a benefit in FC III.  For FC II, no statistical significance can be shown using any method of analysis (individual studies or pooled data). This could have been expected considering the relatively short duration of the studies (STRIDE-1,-2 and  -4)  which  varied  between  12  and  18  weeks.  The  numerical  benefit  that  was  noted  in  FC  II compared to  placebo  (overall  6  vs.  2  events)  are  mainly  driven  by    less  worsening  of  FC  as  other endpoints  (death,  hospitalisation)  did  not  occur.  No  robust  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  such  data considering the post-hoc analysis.

## 1.2.2 Clinical safety

Safety  database  for  WHO  FC  II  patients  is  based  on  patients  recruited  in  STRIDE  1  and  STRIDE 2/STRIDE 2X studies. The use of sitaxentan in these patients was well tolerated. Generally, sitaxentan 100 mg was better tolerated in WHO FC II subjects compared with the overall populations in these studies.  There were no deaths and no treatment-related SAEs among WHO FC II patients who had received sitaxentan 100 mg. There were no discontinuations due to AE or laboratory test abnormalities among WHO FC II patients in STRIDE 1 or STRIDE 2. In the 1-year extension study STRIDE 2X, few subjects (&lt;4%) in the sitaxentan 100 mg group discontinued from study due to treatment-related adverse events compared with 11-12% of subjects in the bosentan group. In STRIDE 2X, there were no discontinuations due to laboratory test abnormalities among functional class II patients treated with sitaxentan, and there was one subject with transaminases elevation &gt;8x ULN requiring discontinuation of bosentan treatment.  Long Term Survival Data Patients completing STRIDE 2 were eligible to enrol in STRIDE 2X, an open-label extension study of sitaxentan 100 mg and bosentan. Subjects randomized to sitaxentan 50 mg or 100 mg in STRIDE 2 received sitaxentan 100 mg in STRIDE 2X. Subjects randomized to bosentan in STRIDE 2 continued their bosentan treatment in STRIDE 2X. Subjects randomized to placebo in STRIDE 2 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (in blocks of 2) to receive 1 of the 2 study treatments in STRIDE 2X (sitaxentan 100mg or bosentan). STRIDE 2X ended when the last subject had completed one year in the study. Day 1 for the survival analysis was the first day of sitaxentan treatment, i.e., Day 1 in STRIDE 2 for subjects randomized to sitaxentan 100 mg or sitaxentan 50 mg and Day 1 of STRIDE 2X for subjects who  had  been  randomized  to  placebo  in  STRIDE  2.    The  Kaplan-Meier  method  was  used  for  the survival analysis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After 1 year, the 145 patients treated with sitaxentan 100 mg in STRIDE 2 or STRIDE 2X were either entered into a long-term open label study (STRIDE 3) or followed up, and survival information was collected  through  3  years.    For  the  145  subjects  who  received  sitaxentan  100 mg  in  STRIDE  2  or STRIDE 2X, the Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 95.9%, 84.7%, and 77.5% at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively (Table 18), compared to the expected historical survival rate of 68%, and 48% of untreated PPH patients at 1 year and 2 years, respectively.

Day 1 for the survival analysis was the first day of sitaxentan treatment.

Efforts were made to assess survival status; subjects were censored when lost to followed up.

For the subgroup of patients with PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD), the KaplanMeier survival rates were similar to the overall population (98%, 78%, and 67% at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively).

A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  in  which  survival  data  were  analyzed  by  treatment  group  in STRIDE 2; the Kaplan-Meier survival rate for the sitaxentan 100 mg group was 96.7%, 87.5%, and 78.0% at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively, similar to rates observed for all subjects who had received sitaxentan in STRIDE 2 or STRIDE 2X.

##  Survival Analysis by Baseline Functional Class

Long term survival for WHO functional class II subjects was considerably better than for functional class  III  subjects.  The  Kaplan-Meier  survival  estimate  for  functional  class  II  patients  was  100%, 94.4%, and 82.8% at 1 year, 2 and 3 years, respectively, and for WHO functional class III patients, it was 93.8%, 79.1%, and 74.9% at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively (Table 19).

Day 1 for the survival analysis was the first day of sitaxentan treatment.

When analyzed by original treatment group in STRIDE 2 for sensitivity analysis, the Kaplan-Meier survival rate for sitaxentan 100 mg group was 100%, 100%, and 87.0% at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively, for the functional class II patients and 94.1%, 77.8%, and 71.0% at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively, for the functional class III patients

##  Functional Class and Long Term Survival

Given the known association of survival with WHO functional class in PAH, the long term survival of the 145 subjects treated with sitaxentan 100 mg was further analysed for its association with functional class  in  STRIDE  2.  The  results  indicate  that  the  long  term  survival  was  associated  with  functional class at baseline (Hazard ratio 2.12; p=0.0246). However, an improvement in WHO functional class did not appear to improve survival. This implies that an improvement in WHO functional class III to functional class II does not afford the same survival benefit as maintaining patients in WHO functional class  II.  Therefore  patients  should  be  offered  efficacious  therapy  whilst  still  in  functional  class  II before they deteriorate to WHO functional class III.

This evidence suggests that administration of sitaxentan 100 mg to functional class II subjects delays disease progression and subsequent deterioration to class III, and survival is improved.

##  Discussion on clinical safety

The  presented  safety  data  do  not  indicate  a  safety  signal  when  sitaxentan  is  used  in  WHO  FC  II, however the numbers are too low to draw robust conclusions.

Both  the  6-MWT  and  TTCW  are  considered  relevant  primary  endpoints  in  PAH  trials.  Sitaxentan administration did not result in a significant improvement in 6 MWT in patients with FC II in any of the STRIDE studies. Only a trend was observed in STRIDE-1 (+20 m) and STRIDE-2 (+11.3 m) and no difference in STRIDE-4. Regarding TTCW, events were very low, differences with placebo not significant and  primarily related to less worsening  in FC.  Sitaxentan resulted in significant improvement of functional class in FC II in only one study (STRIDE-2) or when all data were pooled. Haemodynamic data were positive in  the  one  study  in  which  it  was  investigated  (STRIDE  1),  and event-free survival was shown to be better than bosentan based on exploratory data. No safety issues were  identified  with  long  term  use  of  sitaxentan  in  PAH  patients  in  WHO  FC  II.  However,  the numbers are too low to draw robust conclusions.

1.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment and Recommendation PAH is a rare and devastating disease. Owing to the difficulties associated with the diagnosis, many patients  will  have  progressed  to  WHO FC III or even IV before treatment is offered. Nevertheless, about  25%  of  PAH  patients  seen  in  the  clinic  are  classified  as  WHO  FC  II  or  less  at  the  time  of diagnosis.    Recently,  it  has  been  recognized  that  PAH  patients  in  WHO  FC  II  may  benefit  from specialized PAH therapy. Ambrisentan, bosentan, sildenafil and tadalafil have been recently approved for this indication (ref. respective EPARs). The MAH did not submit new clinical data. Clinical data from previously submitted studies were reevaluated. This data showed that patients with WHO FC II were adequately distinguished from WHO FC III in the STRIDE-1 and STRIDE-2 studies, mainly based on the baseline values of the 6-MWT and haemodynamic measurements. The recruited WHO FC II patients appeared comparable to those recruited in the corresponding ambrisentan and bosentan trials and the French Registry. The  benefit  in  FC  II  was  re-assessed  based  on  the  STRIDE-1,  -2  and  -4  studies,  in  addition  to STRIDE-2x.  The  6-MWT  was  the  primary  endpoint  in  most  of  these  studies;  time  to  clinical worsening, improvement in functional class and haemodynamic data were assessed in some studies as secondary endpoints. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  summary,  the  totality  of  the  data  with  respect  to  FC  II  did  not  support  a  positive  assessment, considering  that  the  main  efficacy  endpoints  were  not  significantly  improved  and  only  some improvement in FC did occur. This was further complicated by the inconsistency of the results across studies precluding any robust conclusions on efficacy. It should be noted that for the other endothelinreceptor  antagonists  registered  for  FC  II,  the  indication  was  approved  on  the  basis  of  a  significant improvement in the 6 minute walking distance (ambrisentan) or a positive trend in this test, together with improvement in haemodynamic data and time to clinical worsening (bosentan).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, the extension of indication in section 4.1 to include FC II was not acceptable. Based on the above post-hoc analysis, the results for TTCW were shown to be significant for FC III and the MAH proposed to include such data in section 5.1 of the SPC. This was not considered acceptable. Data in section 5.1 of the SPC should be balanced and based on sound statistical methods, which was not  the  case  as  neither  pooling  nor  hierarchical  analysis  of  secondary  endpoints  were  pre-specified. The presented data are considered descriptive but not robust enough to be included in section 5.1 of the SPC.

However,  the  CHMP  considered  acceptable  to  include  in  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  of  the  results  of STRIDE  4  study,  relevant  haemodynamic  data,  effect  on  functional  class  and  updated  long-term survival data as the information can be useful to the prescriber.
