## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Hypertension  has  been  identified  as  a  major  risk  factor  for  cardiovascular  diseases  such  as  stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. It is widely recognised that an adequate control of hypertension is important  to  significantly  decrease  cardiovascular  mortality  and  morbidity.  For  most  hypertensive patients, the management of hypertension with a general target blood pressure (BP) of &lt; 140/90 mm Hg is recommended. A lower BP target (&lt;130/80 mm Hg) is recommended in high-risk patient populations, such as those with target organ damage, diabetes, or renal disease.

Several  therapeutic  choices  are  currently  available  to  lower  blood  pressure,  including  diuretics, β -blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and calcium channel antagonists. Furthermore,  the  inhibition  of  renin-angiotensin  system  (RAS)  is  an  effective  way  to  intervene  in  the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disorders. Renin is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Then the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) transforms angiotensin I  into  the  active  octapeptide  angiotensin  II,  which  acts  via  type-1  angiotensin  II  receptors  (AT1)  to increase arterial tone, adrenal aldosterone secretion, renal sodium reabsorption, sympathetic neurotransmission,  and  cellular  growth.  Some  of  currently  used  antihypertensive  drugs  intervene  at different  points  of  renin-angiotensin  system,  e.g. β -blockers,  ACE  -inhibitors,  angiotensin-receptor antagonists or renin-inhibitors. Despite the availability of several therapeutic choices, not all hypertensive patients achieve adequate control of blood pressure with a single antihypertensive drug. For the majority of patients a combination of two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to reach adequate blood pressure control. Thus, the development of fixed-dose combinations of different antihypertensive drugs  helps  to  improve  patient  compliance  over  the  free  combination  of  the  single  monotherapies  and might contribute to the improvement of their safety profile. Aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  fixed  combination  was  developed  to  achieve  target  blood  pressure  in hypertensive  patients  not  adequately  treated  with  either  aliskiren  or  hydrochlorothiazide  monotherapy. Aliskiren (ALI) is the first renin-inhibitor authorized in EU via the centralized procedure in August 2007. Aliskiren inhibits renin, the enzyme responsible for the production of angiotensin I. Renin inhibitors like aliskiren do not block renin-like enzymes, such as cathepsin D or tonins, which are present in the vascular wall and which release angiotensin I from angiotensinogen. Renin has a unique specificity for its only known  physiological  substrate,  angiotensinogen.  This  specific  inhibition  of  the  renin  system  by diminishing renin activity has the advantage to not interfere with other metabolic pathways. Hydrochlorothiazide  (HCTZ)  is  a  well-known  thiazide  diuretic  commonly  used  for  the  treatment  of hypertension, thanks to its effect on volume/sodium  depletion. Hydrochlorothiazide is used as monotherapy and in combination with other antihypertensive medicinal products such as angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and β -blockers.

The  development  programme  is  based  on  non-clinical  studies  and  clinical  trials  demonstrating  the claimed therapeutic benefits of the proposed combination. Bridging studies were conducted in order to demonstrate bioequivalence between the free combination used in definitive clinical efficacy and safety studies to the new fixed combination film-coated tablet product. Studies included the relevant population and were conducted in accordance with the GCP requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Adequate in-process controls have been applied as well as controls of the reagents, solvents, catalysts, starting materials, and intermediates used in the manufacture of aliskiren hemifumarate. Materials used in the manufacture of aliskiren hemifumarate active substance are all of synthetic origin; therefore do not pose a risk of TSE/BSE contamination.

Active Substance Aliskiren hemifumarate Aliskiren hemifumarate  of Novartis has already been authorized via the centralised procedure. Information submitted in the original and supplementary documentations were evaluated and accepted by the CHMP Aliskiren  hemifumarate  has  four  chiral  centres,  but  is  obtained  as  a  single  diastereoisomer,  all  Sconfigured. Sufficient  scientific  information  has  been  presented  on  physicochemical  properties  such  as appearance,  solubility  in  standard  aqueous  buffers  and  non-aqueous  solvents,  pKa,  specific rotation, log P, melting point and thermal behaviour. This  molecule  shows  polymorphs.  Satisfactory  identification  was  performed  by  X-ray  powder  spectra, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and ThermoGravimetric Analysis (TGA).  Manufacture The synthesis of the active substance can be summarized in 10 main steps. The  process  predominantly  involves  the  construction  of  an  appropriately  substituted  octanamide backbone with controlling the stereochemistry. The manufacturing process has been fully detailed, including operating conditions, quantities of solvents, reagents, catalysts. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Critical  steps  include  the  step  where  the  four  chiral  centres  are  stereochemically  formed  and  the crystallisation of aliskiren hemifumarate, and relevant intermediates have been controlled accordingly.

Adequate specifications have been included for the starting materials, solvents, and intermediates. Validation data are available and the robustness of the process has been demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  structure  of  aliskiren  hemifumarate  has  been  fully  elucidated  with  usual  techniques  such  as elementary analysis, Infra-Red (IR) spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR) spectroscopy,  mass  spectroscopy  and  X-ray  powder  diffractometry  (XRPD),  optical  rotation  (single diasteroisomer), particle size analysis.

##  Specification

Appropriate  specification  has  been  set  up  and  includes  appearance,  particle  size,  appearance  of  the solution, identification (IR, XR and optical rotation), residual solvents (GC), water content, sulfated ash, heavy  metals,  related substances, assay (titration and  HPLC),  assay  of  the  salt  (fumaric acid), microbiological quality. The  skip-testing approach  for the microbiological quality is considered acceptable.

<!-- image -->

General properties such as solubility in various aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, dissociation constants, distribution  coefficients,  optical  rotation  (inactive  since  does  not  possess  an  asymmetric  center),  water sorption properties (non-hygroscopic) and polymorphism.

Specification  of  the  active  substance  including  residual  solvents  (in  line  with  ICH  requirements)  and impurities (justified by toxicological data) are appropriately justified. Analytical methods have been adequately detailed and non-compendial methods validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The  bulk  of the active substance  is packed  in  sealed  triple  bags  (polyethylene  PE/aluminium/ polyethylene  terephthalate  PET)  or  quadruple  bags  (PE  /PET/aluminium/PET).  The  bags  are  stored  in drums with a tamper resistant seal. Analysis of 36 batches has demonstrated the uniformity and the consistency of the synthesis.  Stability Stability  data  on  three  pilot  batches  have  been  carried  out  under  ICH  long  term  (24  months, 25°C/60%RH) and accelerated conditions (6 months, 40°C/75%RH) as well as photostability and stress testing under different conditions. All  parameters  were  found  in  accordance  with  the  specification  and  no  major  degradation  could  be observed. Based on the discussion above it can be concluded that the active substance is stable under long-term and accelerated  storage  conditions.  The  proposed  retest  period  is  supported  by  the  results  of  the  stability studies. Active Substance Hydrochlorothiazide or HCTZ Hydrochlorothiazide or HCTZ (INN) is a white to almost white powder and fulfils the requirements of the current  PhEur monograph. Its chemical structure is represented as follow: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

##  Manufacture

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Commercially available hydrochlorothiazide from two suppliers, one with a CEP and one with an ASMF is further processed by the applicant. The final HCTZ is tested against the applicant's testing monograph.

Satisfactory  control  of  reagents  and  solvents  has  been  presented.  No  critical  process  steps  have  been identified and no intermediate product is formed during manufacture of hydrochlorothiazide. No process validation was deemed necessary.

The  structure  of  hydrochlorothiazide  is  supported  by  the  synthetic  route  and  has  been  elucidated  by elemental analysis, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, proton ( 1 H-NMR) and carbon ( 13 CNMR) nuclear magnetic resonance. A comprehensive analysis of polymorphism was carried out using Xray powder diffraction spectra, Raman spectra, DSC curves and thermogravimetry.

Rasilez  HCT  film-coated  tablets  are  immediate  release  solid  dosage  forms  for  oral  administration containing fixed combinations of the drug substances aliskiren hemifumarate (SPP100) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).

 Specification Appropriate specifications have been set and include appearance, physico-chemical properties, identification (IR and UV), assay (HPLC and titration), related substances, loss on drying, sulfated ash, heavy  metals,  microbial  contamination,  fulfilling  the  requirements  of  the  current  Ph.  Eur.  Analytical methods have been satisfactorily described and in-house methods have been validated in accordance with ICH requirements. Analytical  results  of  six  batches  of  hydrochlorothiazide  obtained  from  the  different  suppliers  were presented  and  in  line  with  the  retained  specification.  Results  confirm  batch  to  batch  consistency  and uniformity of the quality of the substance and indicate that the process is under control. Bulk hydrochlorothiazide is stored in metallic drums lined with two polyethylene bags which are sealed with a plastic closure. For stability hydrochlorothiazide is packed in polyethylene bags sealed with a cable binder in mini metal drums. Appropriate specification for primary packaging material including identification test by IR, appearance, size and microbiological tests was provided along with certificate of analysis.  Stability Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  eight  production  batches  of  micronized  hydrochlorothiazide under long term storage conditions (up to 5 years, 25°C / 60% RH), accelerated conditions (6 months data, 40°C / 75% RH) and photostability testing. The long term testing (real time testing) and accelerated testing conditions are set according to ICH and cover temperate and subtropical climates, as well as hot and tropical climates. The quality characteristics (e.g. physical characteristics like clarity and absorbance of the solution in dimethyl sulfoxide, impurity profile and assay) of the active substance are unchanged as demonstrated by comparative analytical data. The proposed re-test period is supported by the results of the stability studies. Medicinal Product Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The film-coated tablets have the same shape (biconvex ovaloid tablet) but different colours and sizes.

- 150/12.5 mg: white
- -300/25 mg: pale yellow
- 150/25 mg: violet white
- 300/12.5 mg: light yellow

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The different strengths have the same qualitative composition with regard to the active substance and the excipients in the cores whereas the coatings are slightly different.

-  Pharmaceutical Development

The main objectives for technical development of these film-coated tablets were:

- to develop an immediate release film-coated tablet
-  to  utilize  a  suitable  manufacturing  process  to  achieve  a  high  drug  load  whilst  keeping  an  acceptable tablet size.

· to achieve product bioequivalent to the selected mono-component products. The  key  physico-chemical  characteristics  have  been  adequately  described  for  the  active  substances aliskiren  hemifumarate  (SPP100)  and  hydrochlorothiazide  (HCTZ).  Compatibility  between  the  active substances has been studied as well as compatibility with common pharmaceutical excipients during the development  of  SPP100  (Rasilez)  film-coated  tablets.  Studies  demonstrated  compatibility  with  all excipients tested. The  choice  of  excipients  is  based  upon  their  suitability  for  use  in  the  manufacturing  process,  on compatibility  results  and  on  pharmaceutical  technological  experience  gained  from  development  of  the existing SPP100 and HCTZ 'mono-' tablet formulations. The excipients are common excipients used for oral dosage formschosen for the ALI/HCTZ tablet formulation are all components of granulates or final blends of either the existing SPP100 or HCTZ 'mono-' tablet formulations. Formulation  development  has  been  appropriately  described  including  the  homogeneity  of  this  highcontent drug formulation. The film-coated tablet was chosen as the most convenient and suitable dosage. A film-coating was needed to mask the bitter taste of the aliskiren hemifumarate, and to achieve dose differentiation of the strengths by different colors. Biowaiver request The  biowaiver  request  for  the  150/12.5  mg  aliskiren/  hydrochlorothiazide  fixed  combination  tablet  is based  on  the  rationale  of  the  CHMP's  'Note  for  guidance  on  the  investigation  of  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence'.  Comparative  dissolution  data  for  different  media  are  presented.  Dissolution  profiles proved  similar  by  the  calculated  f2  factors.  The  composition  proportionality  of  the  150/12.5  mg  and 300/25 mg aliskiren/HCT fixed combination tablets, the similar manufacturing process for these tablets, and the acceptable in vitro dissolution results do fulfil the requirements for waiver of a bioequivalence study at 150/12.5 mg strength. Manufacturing Process Development The manufacturing process development of the drug product has been appropriately described.  Adventitious Agents None of the materials used for the synthesis presented TSE risk. Magnesium stearate is declared to be of vegetable origin. Lactose monohydrate is of animal origin, but is of pharmaceutical grade derived from milk sourced from healthy animals and under the same conditions as milk fit for human consumption, therefore the risk is negligible in accordance with TSE Note for Guidance (EMEA/410/01Rev.2).

##  Manufacture of the Product

The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  is  considered  a  standard  manufacturing  process involving standard technology such as mixing, granulation tabletting and film-coating.

Adequate in-process controls for the manufacture of the drug product have been provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The manufacturing process is considered as standard. None of the process steps are considered as critical.

The  excipients  selected  are  commonly  used  for  oral  pharmaceutical  dosage  forms  and  include  for  the tablet  core:  microcrystalline  cellulose,  crospovidone,  lactose  monohydrate,  wheat  starch,  povidone, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, and for the coating: iron oxide, ferric oxide, macrogol and  talc.  All  excipients  are  described  in  PhEur.,  except  basic  coating  premixes  that  are  commercially available mixtures of standard components (in line with food directive EC 95/45).

The film-coats are described as non-functional with respect to the product dissolution and stability and are needed to mask the bitter taste of the aliskiren and to differentiate the several strengths. Each excipient possesses a certificate of analysis in compliance with the proposed specification.

Parameters tested included: appearance, dissolution, water content, assay and degradation products. The tests cover features susceptible to change during storage and likely to influence quality and/or efficacy of the product.

Rasilez HCT film-coated tablets are produced according to standard manufacturing processes: mixing, granulation, screening, drying, blending, tabletting and film-coating.  Product Specification Appropriate release and shelf-life specifications for the finished product have been set, and parameters tested include appearance, identification (TLC, UV and HPLC), identification of colorants, mean mass, dissolution (HPLC), loss on drying, residual solvents, related substances, microbial contamination, assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (PhEur. mass uniformity and content uniformity). All  the  analytical  procedures  are  Ph  Eur.  methods  except  for  assay  of  isopropanol  in  ethanol  with  5% isopropyl alcohol for which an in house monograph is presented. All the non-compendial methods have been fully validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Five representative batches (production and pilot-scale) for each dosage strength have been tested. All batches complied with the proposed specification. The primary packaging consists of PA/AL/PVC blister packs and PCTFE/PVC blister packs with a heat sealable lacquered aluminum foil. PA/AL/PVC blisters (Alu blisters) are double-sided aluminium blisters consisting of an aluminium forming foil (PA/AL/PVC foil) and an aluminium lidding foil. The components of the blisters are tested for cleanliness, total thickness and identity (IR). In addition certificates of analysis for packaging components comply with PhEur. requirements (where applicable, e.g. PVC, PA) and foodstuff legislation.  Stability of the Product Primary stability testing was performed on nine pilot scale batches of film-coated tablets (3 batches of each dosage strengths) kept in the commercial packaging (PCTFE/PVC and Alu blister packs) under ICH conditions. The stability program included long term (up to 18 months, 25°C/60 % RH and 30°C/75 % RH), accelerated testing (6 months, 40°C/75 % RH), other temperatures (e.g. 5°C, 50°C and -20°C) and ICH photostability testing. A bracketing approach has been applied, meaning testing only the three dosage strengths 75/12.5 mg, 300/12.5 mg and 300/25 mg to cover the extremes. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

No significant change in the physical properties could be observed under long-term conditions, with the exception  of  the  water  content  increase  with  the  PCTFE/PVC  blister  pack.  Degradation  products increased when tested under accelerated conditions. The film-coated tablets are not sensitive to light. The investigations  show  that  the  higher  the  water  content  of  the  tablets  the  more  chemical  degradation  is formed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based  on  the  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  can  be  granted  when  the  product  is  kept  in  the commercial packaging (PCTFE/PVC and Alu blister packs) with the following precautions 'Do not store above  30°C.  Store  in  the  original  package  in  order  to  protect  from  moisture'  as  described  in  product information

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Aliskiren 150 mg  and 300 mg  received marketing authorisation in the EU  in August 2007. Hydrochlorothiazide  is  already  used  as  monotherapy  and  in  combination  with  other  antihypertensive medicinal products such as angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium  channel  blockers  and  beta-blockers.  The  preclinical  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic properties  from  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  are  known.  Information  is  also  available  in  the scientific  literature  as  well  as  from  the  use  of  these  medicinal  products  as  monotherapy.  No  specific preclinical  pharmacodynamic  or  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  with  ALI/HCTZ  fixed-dose combination. Toxicity studies were conducted with aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide as free

The active substance aliskiren hemifumarate is optically active with four chiral carbons but exists as a single diastereoisomer. It is manufactured via a 10 steps stereochemically controlled synthesis. Control of stereochemistry, polymorphism and impurities have been fully discussed. Appropriate specification has been  presented.  Stability  studies  conducted  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  showed  that  aliskiren hemifumarate is  stable  and  support  the  re-test  period,  in  very  tight  packaging  (due  to  the  hygroscopic nature of the substance), protected from light, at temperature not above 25°C can be granted. The  active  substance  HCTZ  has  been  adequately  described  and  characterised.  Commercially  available hydrochlorothiazide from 2 suppliers, one with a CEP and one with an ASMF, is further processed by the applicant. Appropriate specification has been presented. Stability studies conducted according to the ICH guidelines  showed  that  HCTZ  is  stable  and  support  the  re-test  period  of  4  years  re-test  period  when protected from light. ALI/HCTZ  film-coated  tablets  are  formulated  as  an  immediate  release  formulation  with  well-known excipients. The film-coated tablets have the same shape (biconvex ovaloid tablet) but different colours and  sizes:  150/12.5  mg:  white,  300/25  mg:  pale  yellow,  150/25  mg:  violet  white,  300/12.5  mg:  light yellow. The four strengths have the same qualitative composition with regard to the active substance and the excipients in the cores; the coatings are slightly different Compatibility with regard to excipients is justified by stability results. The pharmaceutical development is comprehensive and adequate. Manufacturing method has been described and allows the production of a consistent and homogeneous product. The tablets are kept in blister packs. The description and choice of the container is acceptable based on stability data. Drug product specification are satisfactory and in line with  ICH  guidelines.  Stability  data  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  under  the  precautions  of  storage described in the Product Information. 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Introduction Rasilez HCT is a fixed-dose combination of two antihypertensive drugs; aliskiren (ALI) which is an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of renin and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) a well-known thiazide diuretic. Preclinical development program is aimed to support the use of ALI/HCTZ at doses of 150 mg/12.5mg, 150  mg/25  mg,  300  mg/12.5  mg  and  300  mg/25  mg  for  the  treatment  of  hypertensive  patients  not adequately treated with either aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.

combinations in the rat and included a 2 week oral dose range finding study and a 13 week study toxicity study.  The  structure  of  the  programme  was  detailed  and  sufficiently  justified  and  thus,  is  considered appropriate for the characterisation of the preclinical safety profile of the fixed dose combination. The strategy of the non clinical development of ALI/HCTZ was in line with the available CHMP guidelines on  fixed  dose  combinations  CPMP/EWP/240/95  Rev.1:  'Guideline  on  fixed  combination  medicinal products', CPMP/SWP/258498/2005: 'Guideline on the non clinical development of fixed combinations of medicinal products'.

The 2 week oral (gavage) dose range finding toxicity study in rats is a 'GLP like' study: study, not fully comply with GLP but performed at the highest standards of scientific quality. The 13 week oral gavage toxicity study in the rat followed by a 4 week recovery and is full compliant with the GLP requirements. Pharmacology Preclinical  studies  to  determine  the  primary  pharmacodynamics  of  ALI/HCTZ  combination  were  not performed. The investigations on the mechanism of action of aliskiren were conducted during the non clinical development of aliskiren. The non clinical data for hydrochlorothiazide are based on the available review of literature data.  Primary pharmacodynamics Aliskiren is a human renin inhibitor and has been investigated in relevant species expressing human renin gene.  The  studies  employed  double  transgenic  rats  (dTGR)  that  express  human  genes  for  renin  and angiotensinogen, rats that express mouse  renin, and mice. These  studies aimed  to provide an understanding of the basic pharmacodynamic effects of aliskiren. The rennin inhibitory potency of aliskiren was tested in vitro . It was demonstrated that there is a species dependent inhibition  of  human  recombinant  renin  (IC 50 =  0.6  nmol/L)  and  marmoset  renin  (IC 50 =  2 nmol/L)  with  specificity  and  selectivity  to  renin vs other  proteases.  Aliskiren  was  inactive  against  the other human proteinases and HIV-1 proteinase tested (IC 50 &gt;5000 nM). Aliskiren, as a human renin inhibitor has a comparatively lower potency against rat renin in comparison with humans, although the compound is effective in mice. As a result of this species specificity, the in vivo non clinical studies employed double transgenic rats (dTGR) that express human genes for renin and angiotensinogen, rats that express mouse  renin, and mice. These  studies aimed  to provide an understanding of the basic pharmacodynamic effects of aliskiren with respect to its ability to inhibit the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  (RAAS),  to  reduce  blood  pressure,  and  to  ameliorate  organ damage in settings of hypertension with or without diabetes.

Inhibition of the RAAS in vivo in renovascular hypertensive hypercholesterolemic mice at a dose of 50 mg/kg was demonstrated by lowering PRA by 94% (p&lt;0.05) compared with vehicle-treated hypertensive controls.  In  dTGR,  aliskiren  inhibited  plasma  Ang  I  forming  capacity  and  lowered  renal  Ang  I  and  II content. Moreover, aliskiren 0.3 mg/kg completely inhibits plasma renin activity in normotensive sodium depleted marmosets.  Plasma renin activity was inhibited by 87% at 6 hours after dosing. Higher doses resulted in prolonged responses. Aliskiren is capable of lowering mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in spontaneously  hypertensive  rats  (SHR)  when  given  as  monotherapy.  When  ALI  was  combined  with benazepril or valsartan, a synergistic blood pressure lowering effect was seen in SHR. In dTGR, aliskiren lowered MAP in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Aliskiren exhibited a rapid onset of action (&lt; 15 min), and a prolonged duration of effect. The recovery of MAP to baseline required at the highest orally administered  doses  up  to  48  hours.  The  concurrent  administration  of  valsartan  and  enalaprilat  with aliskiren  dose-dependently  lowered  arterial  pressure  of  dTGR.  ALI  administered  intravenously  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately equipotent with intravenously administered valsartan and enalaprilat, but was less potent when all three agents were given by oral administration, due to its lower oral bioavailability. In addition, aliskiren  showed  antihypertensive  effects  in  dTGR  and  in  diabetic  hypertensive  TG(mRen-2)27  rats. Single  or  repeated  oral  and  intravenous  doses  of  ALI  dose  dependently  lowered  blood  pressure  in normotensive sodium depleted marmosets.

Aliskiren protected against cardio-renal damage in dTGR, preventing albuminuria in diabetic hypertensive TG(mRen-2)27 rats, normalizing serum creatinine, and inhibiting left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. It displayed anti-fibrotic effects, reducing renal collagen IV immunostaining  in  dTGR  and  decreasing  collagen  histochemical  (trichrome)  staining  in  diabetic  TG (mRen-2)27  rats.  In  dTGR  and  hypertensive-diabetic  TG(mRen-2)27  rats,  aliskiren  inhibited  the  renal gene  expression  of  the  profibrogenic  growth  factor  TGFβ .  The  renin  inhibition  resulted  in  antiinflammatory  effects  in  dTGR,  reducing  renal  inflammatory  cell  infiltrates  and  inhibiting  complement activation in the renal vasculature.

Studies  on  secondary  pharmacodynamics  were  not  conducted  largely  due  to  the  lack  of  appropriate models.  Aliskiren  is  a  human  renin  inhibitor,  and  as  such  it  has  only  limited  efficacy  in  standard  rat models of hypertension. While  transgenic  models  are  accepted  as  being  suitable  for  establishing  renin inhibitors as antihypertensive and organ protective agents, they are artificial systems: the interactions of renin-angiontensin system components, and their activation and regulation are likely to differ from those in  humans.  Thus,  more  relevant  conclusions  regarding  secondary  pharmacodynamics  could  be  drawn from studies conducted in humans.

Literature data for hydrochlorothiazide are provided to summarise its antihypertensive effects in the preclinical  models as monotherapy or in combination with RAAS blocking agents. When administered as monotherapy,  hydrochlorothiazide normalized arterial pressure in the rat model  of renovascular hypertension, and was cardioprotective in stroke-prone SHR, attenuating cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte hypertophy,  as  well  as  interstitial  and  periarterial  fibrosis.  In  conventional  SHR,  hydrochlorothiazide repressed aortic hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis. While the combination of aliskiren with hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in the preclinical models, experiments, in which hydrochlorothiazide  was  combined  with  angiotensin  converting  enzyme  inhibitors  or  angiotensin  II receptor blockers provide a rationale for expecting similar benefits from ALI/HCTZ in the treatment of hypertension. The combination of hydrochlorothiazide with either of these products lowered the MAP of the SHR, and depending on the doses, these decreases were synergistic. In SHR treated with L-NAME to induce  renal  injury,  modest  improvements  were  seen  in  renal  hemodynamics,  renal  function,  and morphological indices of glomerular and arteriolar injury with hydrochlorothiazide vs vehicle controls. In contrast, combination of the diuretic with either enalapril or losartan markedly improved these parameters when compared with the vehicle controls. Aliskiren,  the  first  in  class  renin  inhibitor,  has  been  studied  in  clinical  trials  as  a  monotherapy  or  in combination  with  hydrochlorothiazide  for  the  treatment  of  hypertension,  thus  the  pharmacodynamic interaction rationale is already clinically documented and non clinical pharmacodynamic bridging study is not  needed.  The  number  of  studies  performed  with  monotherapy  as  well  as  the  submitted  scientific literature is considered sufficient. The information on effects of fixed combination is already known in humans  and  therefore,  no  further  animal  studies  are  required.  In  summary,  the  data  demonstrate  the benefit of combining hydrochlorothiazide with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and by supposition, with a renin inhibitor, for effective lowering of blood pressure and protection against organ damage.  Secondary pharmacodynamics Medicinal Product no longer authorised

##  Safety pharmacology programme

The safety of hydrochlorothiazide on the nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory or renal systems has been demonstrated in extensive clinical trials and post-marketing programs. Aliskiren does not interact with a variety of other targets involved in the regulation of blood pressure and it had no significant effects in a standard battery of non clinical safety pharmacology studies that included in vivo assessments of central nervous system, respiratory and renal function and in vitro and in vivo cardiovascular investigations. The cardiovascular  safety  of  aliskiren  has  also  been  confirmed  in  many  clinical  trials  including  a  specific assessment of cardiac conduction and re-polarization. As the combination of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide  was  not  expected  to  display  concerns  in  safety  pharmacology  assays,  further investigations were not conducted for aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination.

Hydrochlorothiazide  is  well  absorbed  in  animal  species  and  humans.  Systemic  exposure  in  humans increases proportionately with the dose. Bioavailability is 65% to 75% of the administered dose. Food reduces the bioavailability by approximately 10% and the C max by 20% and increases the t max from 1.6 to 2.9 hours.

 Pharmacodynamic drug interactions The drug-drug interaction potential of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide when given as monotherapy has been  assessed  and  characterised  during  their  development.  The  interaction  potential  of  aliskiren  and hydrochlorothiazide, as discussed in the current literature, shows that there is no overlapping substrate as well as inhibition profile on the identified active enzyme and transporter-related processes between the two compounds. This was seen in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. The combined data on aliskiren and  hydrochlorothiazide  monotherapies  indicate  a  low  potential  for  interactions.  Furthermore,  the potential for drug-drug interaction between aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide was studied clinically and the  study  results  indicate  that  there  were  no  significant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  the  two drugs after multiple doses. Pharmacokinetics The  non  clinical  and  clinical  pharmacokinetic  and  metabolism  profile  of  aliskiren  was  thoroughly evaluated  during  its  development  as  monotherapy.  Hydrochlorothiazide  is  a  marketed  product  and  its pharmacokinetics and metabolism were extensively studied in non clinical and clinical studies. Therefore, overviews  on  pharmacokinetic  of  hydrochlorothiazide  available  form  the  published  literature  were provided. This was considered appropriate. Absorption The rate of absorption of aliskiren in mice, rats, and moderate in dogs, marmosets and human was rapid. The  oral  bioavailability  was  in  the  low  percentage  range.  Systemic  exposure  was  close  to  being  dose proportional, with no gender differences observed in the tested species. The concentrations of aliskiren in plasma  declined  slowly,  the  elimination  half-life  being  23.1  and  36  hours  in  rats  and  marmosets, respectively.  Plasma  concentrations  in  rats  and  marmosets  accumulated  about  2-fold  after  multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren is nonlinear. The binding to plasma proteins was moderate with free fractions (fu) between 29% in mouse and distinctly higher in marmosets (fu = 8%). The distribution between blood cells and plasma was concentration independent for rat, rabbit and human. Bioavaliability of aliskiren si low in all studied species (1-3%). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Distribution

The volume of distribution of aliskiren at steady-state was high in the rat, moderate in human and mice, and low in the marmoset. The binding of aliskiren to plasma proteins was moderate with free fractions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between 29% in mouse and 50% in humans. Bio-distribution study after single and repeated (10 days) oral dose of 100 mg/kg to rats showed a low radioactivity tissue levels, which is expected considering the poor and moderate absorption rate. Radioactivity was eliminated within 24 hours from most organs and tissues. Aliskiren and/or its metabolites were not taken up into the brain. Accumulation of radioactivity in organs and tissues after multiple dosing was moderate and about 4-fold compared to single dose. Highest concentrations of aliskiren were observed in the liver and kidney. Considering that the kidney is a target organ of both compounds, the CHMP  expressed  a concern regarding the potential effect of hydrochlorothiazide on aliskiren exposure in this organ. In response, the low likelihood of accumulation of  aliskiren  and  its  metabolites  in  kidney  tissues  after  multiple  oral  administration  of  aliskiren  was demonstrated in a single  and  multiple  dose  administration  studies  to  rats.  For  the  parent  compound  in plasma,  the  accumulation  factor  was  between  0.6  and  1.3  indicating  that  repeated  administration  of aliskiren led to no apparent increase of its exposure when compared to a single oral administration. Since aliskiren  is  predominantly  eliminated  unchanged via the  biliary  route  and  hydrochlorothiazide  is predominantly eliminated unchanged via the renal route, the different clearance mechanisms as well as routes  of  elimination,  and  the  lack  of  relevant  interaction  among  the  individual  components  of  this combination,  the  overall  drug-drug  interaction  potential  within  this  combination  is  not  foreseen  to  be clinically significant. An interaction between aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide in the kidney appears to be very unlikely. Exposure  of  the  foetuses  to  drug-related  compounds  could  be  demonstrated  after  single  oral  doses  of radiolabelled aliskiren at gestation Day 7 to rats and Day 17 to rabbits. Foetuses were exposed to aliskiren and/or its metabolites. The mean total radioactivity concentrations at 24 hours post-dose were similar to those in maternal blood. Comparable total radioactivity concentrations were found in the placentas and the amniotic fluid. Aliskiren and/or its metabolites were excreted in the milk of lactating rats (100 mg/kg, p.o.) to a very low extent (0.08% of dose in 6 days). Concentrations of the product in milk were similar to or higher than those in plasma of the mother, indicating that suckling pups are exposed to aliskiren and/or its metabolites. Hydrochlorothiazide is  moderately  distributed  in  body  tissues  and  its  volume  of  distribution  following oral administration corresponds to 0.83 l/kg. Hydrochlorothiazide binds to plasma proteins only to a low extent  (40%-60%)  and  hence,  its  potential  to  interact  with  co-administered  medications via protein binding  is  negligible.  Hydrochlorothiazide  crosses  the  placental  barrier.  Concentrations  of  the  parent compound in maternal plasma and umbilical core plasma were similar. The drug was excreted into the breast milk of nursing mothers, but no measurable concentrations were found in nursing infants. Metabolism Aliskren  was  metabolised  to  a  low  to  moderate  extent  in  rats,  mice,  pregnant  rabbits  and  marmosets, (about  15%  to  25%  of  dose).  The  most  abundant  component  in  plasma  and  excreta  was  unchanged aliskiren.  Primary  metabolic  pathways  involved  oxidations  on  the  phenol  moiety  of  aliskiren,  like  Odealkylation and further oxidation to the carboxylic acids. These oxidation processes were found to be catalysed mainly by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 isoenzymes. Minor metabolic pathways were the formation of glucuronide metabolites and hydrolytic cleavage of aliskiren amide bond. All metabolites observed in plasma were also found in the excreta either in free or conjugated form. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Based on the data available from the literature, hydrochlorothiazide is not significantly metabolised and the majority of the dose (approximately 95%) is excreted unchanged in urine.

## Excretion

In  mice,  rats  and  marmoset,  aliskiren  and  its  metabolites  were  predominantly  eliminated  into  faeces (generally ≥ 88% after oral dose) indicating a high biliary excretion of the absorbed fraction of the dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Renal excretion was generally low in all investigated species ( ≤ 4.5%, p.o. and ≤ 15%, i.v.). Elimination was complete within 7 days, with the main part of a radioactive dose excreted within 24-48 hours.

Orally administered hydrochlorothiazide is excreted largely unchanged with urine. In humans, &gt;95% of the absorbed HCTZ was excreted in urine. The elimination of the product from plasma is bi-phasic with elimination half-lives of 1-4 hours, and 5-15 hours.

## Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

Aliskiren  has  not  shown  relevant  interactions  with  cytochrome  P450  isoenzymes,  substrates  and/or inhibitors  of  uptake  transporters  or  with  co-administered  medication  during  clinical  use.  Virtually  no pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs via CYP450 enzymes have been reported in the literature for hydrochlorothiazide. Since hydrochlorothiazide is excreted largely unchanged  into urine, no significant  effect  on  hydrochlorothiazide  pharmacokinetics  is  expected  by  inhibitors  of  metabolism  or biliary excretion. Both compounds have moderate plasma protein binding and no significant interaction is expected due to competition for plasma protein binding sites. In rat and human hepatocytes, apart from the  passive  diffusion,  a  substantial  part  of  hepatic  uptake  was  shown  to  be  achieved via the  active transport.  Thus,  if  aliskiren  is  a  substrate  of  number  drug-transporters,  compounds  with  a  strong inhibitory potential on these transporters may increase aliskiren concentrations. Overall, the pharmacokinetic CYP-dependent drug interaction potential between aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, and other drugs is considered to be relatively low. Clinically significant interactions due to common enzymes in the metabolic pathway or due to competition to plasma protein binding sites are therefore unlikely. Toxicology Preclinical  safety  characteristics  of  aliskiren  were  established  during  its  development  as  monotherapy. General toxicity in rats and marmosets as well as genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive effects were evaluated.  Safety pharmacology assessments of aliskiren did not reveal significant effects on the central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular or renal system. Premature deaths were encountered at doses ≥ 200  mg/kg/day  in  repeat-dose  rat  oral  gavage  studies.  As  aliskiren  is  a  local  irritant  and  can  cause necrosis of the respiratory epithelium, the deaths were attributed to aspiration of the dosing solution into the respiratory tract rather than systemic toxic effects. In marmosets, two incidences of urinary stasis in decedent animals were attributed to hypotension and poor renal perfusion. Other changes in marmosets included  reductions  in  erythropoietic  parameters  probably  due  to  the  effect  of  the  renin-angiotensin system on the production of erythropoietin in the kidney. Similar findings have been previously observed with  a  variety  of  inhibitors  of  the  renin-angiotensin  system.  Aliskiren  had  no  significant  effects  on reproductive  or  immune  function.  Extensive  genotoxicity  assays  showed  no  evidence  of  a  genotoxic potential. Carcinogenic potential was assessed in rats and transgenic mice. Inflammatory and proliferative changes  were  observed  in  the  lower  gastrointestinal  tract  at  doses  of  750  or  1500  mg/kg/day  in  both species.  One  colonic  adenoma  and  one  caecal  adenocarcinoma  recorded  in  rats  at  the  dose  of  1500 mg/kg/day  were  not  statistically  significant.  These  findings  were  attributed  to  the  known  irritation potential  of  aliskiren.  Appropriate  exposure  margins  between  rat  and  human  faecal  and  mucosal gastrointestinal  concentrations were demonstrated. However, in the rat carcinogenic study, no NOAEL was  identified.  The  evaluation  of  the  results  of  the  cellular  markers  of  proliferation  and  apoptosis following administration of aliskiren to healthy volunteers showed that aliskiren had no significant effect on epithelial cell proliferation as measured by MIB-1 immunostaining following daily oral administration of  300  mg  for  8  weeks  in  healthy  subjects.  In  addition,  lack  of  effect  of  aliskiren  on  hyperplasia  and mitotic activity was observed. Daily oral administration of ALI 300 mg for 8 weeks in healthy subjects did not alter apoptotic index from baseline to post-treatment. The extent of apoptosis was very small in Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both placebo and aliskiren treated groups. The data presented are considered reassuring in relation to a possible risk posed by aliskiren on cell proliferation of mucosal epithelia.

Hydrochlorothiazide literature provides data on evaluation of general toxicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity.  Toxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats by dietary administration for 15 days, 13 weeks and 2 years.  No rats died during the 15-day or 13week studies at dietary concentrations of up to 50,000 ppm.  Increased nephrosis and mineralisation at the renal corticomedullary junction were the primary toxic effects in rats. Deaths of male mice in the high dose group in the 13 week study were likely to be related to compound administration and resulted from nephrosis,  calculi,  inflammation  and  epithelial  hyperplasia  in  the  urinary  bladder.  Administration  of hydrochlorothiazide to pregnant mice and rats did not result in any evidence of embryo or foetal toxicity. Based on all the available literature, the in vivo genotoxic potential of hydrochlorothiazide is low.  There was no treatment-related effect on the survival of rats and mice or on the body weights of mice in the carcinogenicity studies. Treated rats were uniformly lighter than controls throughout the studies. In rats, severe chronic renal disease with secondary parathyroid hyperplasia and fibrous osteodystrophy of bone were found to be related to the compound.  No neoplasms in rats or female mice or non-neoplastic lesions in mice were treatment-related.  In high-dose male mice, the incidence of liver tumours was higher than that of concurrent controls. This was not considered to be treatment-related because of an unusually low incidence in the control group  relative to historical controls.  The  SPC  for  hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy reflects the finding on non clinical studies. Preclinical  safety  studies  conducted  with  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  combination  include  a  2  week dose range-finding study and a 13 week study in rats. Based on the proposed therapeutic dose strengths of 150/12.5, 150/25, 300/12.5, 300/25 mg (ALI/HCTZ), a ratio of approximately 12:1 (aliskiren:hydrochlorothiazide)  was  used  in  the  non  clinical  safety  studies.  This  was  believed  to  be adequate. The principal 13 week study was conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice and currently accepted guidelines with respect to animal numbers and dose levels used. The 2 week study was considered well designed although did not full comply with GLP.  Single dose toxicity No single dose toxicity studies were conducted with the combination aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide. Nevertheless, studies investigating the toxicity of aliskiren administered to rat as a single dose did not provide any information regarding the signs of an acute intoxication in humans.  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 2 week toxicity study in rat Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The  study  was  designed  to  establish  the  toxicological  effects  of  the  combination  of  ALI/HCTZ  when administered to rats  for  2  weeks,  the  no  observable  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  and  to  estimate  the toxicokinetic  profile  of  the  combination.  The  results  of  this  study  were  used  for  dose  selection  in  a subsequent 13 week toxicity study in this species. The MTD of ALI/HCTZ was 300/25 mg/kg and all animals  were  sacrificed  on  day  8  of  treatment  following  a  marked  deterioration  in  condition  which included  abdominal  distention,  decreased  locomotor  activity,  piloerection,  rales  and  decreased  body weight.  The  severity  of  pathological  changes  in  multiple  tissues  of  these  animals,  notably  kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow and lymphoid organs indicate that a dose of 300/25 mg/kg would not be tolerated in a longer term study. Minimal tubular basophilia present in the kidneys of some animals treated with 100/8 mg/kg/day may reflect reduced renal perfusion. The toxicological significance of the minimal  lymphocytic  infiltration  in  the  medulla  of  the  thymus  in  two  males  is  unclear.  Based  upon minimal microscopic pathology findings in the absence of overt toxicity, the NOAEL is considered to be 100/8 mg/kg/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 13 week toxicity study in rat

ALI/HCTZ administered at doses of 50/4, 100/8 or 150/12 mg/kg/day  induced slight reversible decreases in body weight gains and food consumption in males given ≥ 100/8 mg/kg/day. Reversible decrease in potassium was seen in animals given the combination and hydrochlorothiazide alone. Reversible decrease in  serum  chloride  levels,  which  was  considered  to  reflect  hydrochlorothiazide  treatment  related  effect, was noted in all animals treated with the combination and with hydrochlorothiazide. There were minimal to  mild  increases  in  mean  AST (38% compared to control group) and ALT (31% compared to control group) in two females given ALI/HCTZ at dosage 150/12 mg/kg/day. These changes were not observed with  concurrent  hepatic  histopathologic  lesions.  After  four  weeks  of  recovery  period,  ALT  and  AST increases  (40%)  were  still  observed  in  one  female  given  150/12  mg/kg/day  compared  to  the  control group. Treatment-related microscopic changes recorded as minimal increased cellular vacuolisation in the zona glomerulosa was seen in all animals treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone (12 mg/kg/day) or in combination with aliskiren at a doses ≥ 50/4 mg/kg/day. In addition, the toxicological significance of the observed  minimal  lymphatic  infiltration  in  the  thymus  medulla  of  two  males  is  not  clear.  Further uncertainty  derived  from  the  absence  of  studies  longer  than  13  weeks  is  the  fact,  that  it  cannot  be excluded that these effects would became more severe after chronic treatment. Thus, the CHMP requested the toxicity information observed in the rat studies to be included in the SPC. The relevant SPC section appropriately states that the findings observed in the 2 week and 13 week toxicity studies were consistent with  those  observed  previously  with  aliskiren  or  hydrochlorothiazide  monotherapies  and  that  the increased cellular vacuolation of the adrenal gland zona glomerulosa was observed during the 13-week toxicity study in rats in animals treated with hydrochlorothiazide but not with aliskiren alone. Toxicokinetics Exposures to aliskiren on day 1 and in week 13 were higher in aliskiren group than in ALI/HCTZ 150/12 mg/kg/day. Higher aliskiren concentrations in females than in males were observed in animals dosed at 100/8 mg/kg/day both on day 1 and in week 13. Concentrations in females were also higher than in males dosed with aliskiren alone at 150 mg/kg/day on day 1. Based on AUC (0-24h) , a trend to higher exposure to aliskiren in week 13 than on day 1 was observed in males. No trend to accumulation was observed in females with the exception of 150/12 mg/kg group where exposure in week 13 was higher than on day 1. Exposure  to  hydrochlorothiazide  was  similar  in  the  hydrochlorothiazide  treated  group  and  ALI/HCTZ 150/12 mg/kg/day on day 1, whereas it was slightly lower in the hydrochlorothiazide alone group than in the combination group in week 13. Dose proportionality of exposure of each single compound could not be assessed in this study. Based on AUC(0-24h) , no significant difference in exposure to hydrochlorothiazide was observed for animals given hydrochlorothiazide in combination with aliskiren between on day 1 and in week 13 in males. However, in females, a slightly higher exposure was seen in week 13 than on day 1. In the group given hydrochlorothiazide alone, exposure in week 13 was lower than exposure on day 1. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

At  the very beginning  and  end  of the  13  week  study  the  exposure figures for aliskiren  and hydrochlorothiazide  in  the  100/8  mg/kg  (ALI/HCTZ)  group  (the  only  common  dose  group  for  both toxicity studies) were generally well below those found on day 15 of the 2 week study. Exceptions were the day 1 and day 15 hydrochlorothiazide exposures in the females. These differences were attributed to the  general  animal  husbandry  and  blood  sampling  condition,  which  can  amplify  the  variability  of toxicokinetic data especially in a short term study.

##  Genotoxicity

Aliskiren  alone  gave  negative  results  in  a  battery  of in  vitro and in  vivo tests.  Based  on  literature references,  hydrochlorothiazide  gave  ambiguous  evidence  of in  vitro genotoxicity:  positive  test  results were obtained only in the in  vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations ranging from 43 to 1300 mcg/ml, and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration. No genotoxicity studies with the combination product were conducted.

-  Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenic  effects  were  reported  in  mice  and  rats  receiving  aliskiren.  No  equivocal  evidence  of hepatocarcinogenicity was found in male mice at high doses of hydrochlorothiazide administered for 2 years, or of an increase in tumours in female mice or rats of either sex given hydrochlorothiazide for 2 years. Hydrochlorothiazide has been used extensively as a diuretic and antihypertensive agent since 1957 and  despite  the  equivocal  non  clinical  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  findings,  no  evidence  of carcinogenicity  in  humans  have  been  reported.  No  specific  carcinogenicity  study  has  been  carried  out with the ALI/HCTZ. It is, however, likely that this study would have provided no significant contribution to  the  safety  evaluation  of  the  combination.  Nevertheless,  in  the  13  wk  repeated  toxicity  study  a  40% increased  ALT  and  AST,  without  histopathology  alteration  was  observed  at  the  end  of  the  recovery period, for which an ALI/HCTZ treatment-related effect cannot be ruled out. Vacuolisation of adrenals was observed as an effect apparently not seen ever with either aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide alone. No chronic  toxicity  study  in  rats  with  ALI/HCTZ  has  been  performed  and  taking  into  consideration  the uncertainty about the eventual progression of the liver and adrenal damage, explanation of the lack of the chronic study was requested by the CHMP. In response, it was proposed that the histopathology findings during the 2 or 13 week toxicity studies were attributable to expected pharmacological effects or were incidental in origin. However, there are no definitive data, which would exclude the presence of increased kidney damage due to the fixed combination and, indeed, confirm the reversibility of renal changes after repeated  treatment,  and  therefore,  the  CHMP  recommended  to  include  an  appropriate  statement  in  the SPC.  Reproduction Toxicity Aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies are not recommended for use during pregnancy or for nursing mothers. There are no adequate data on the use of aliskiren during pregnancy but based on the available literature, the administration of drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system during the second or  third  trimester  has  been  associated  with  foetal  malformations  and  neonatal  deaths  in  humans.  Intrauterine exposure to thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is associated with foetal or neonatal thrombocytopenia,  and  may  be  associated  with  other  adverse  reactions  that  have  occurred  in  adults. Available non-clinical or clinical data indicate that aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide will be excreted into breast milk. A thorough evaluation of reproductive organs in male and female animals during 2 week and 13 week toxicity studies for ALI/HCTZ revealed no significant effects. Medicinal products affecting the RAAS are contraindicated in the EU during second and third trimesters of pregnancy and additional reproductive toxicity studies to assess the effects of ALI/HCTZ on female fertility are therefore considered not to be justified and would be of limited value as the results would not alter the risk benefit analyses for the proposed patient population.

Based  on  the  available  preclinical  and  clinical  data  for  aliskiren,  hydrochlorothiazide  and  ALI/HCTZ combination,  there  were  no  findings  that  would  require  special  studies  to  investigate  antigenicity, immunotoxicity  or  dependency.  All  metabolites  and  drug  substance  impurities  for  ALI/HCTZ  were assessed during the individual preclinical investigations of the monotherapy components. The evaluated impurities were within specified limits in the ALI/HCTZ drug substances and the drug product. Further toxicological  evaluations  of  metabolites  or  drug  substance  impurities  were  therefore  not  considered necessary.  No  additional  toxicities  were  identified  for  the  combination  product  that  required  further investigation in a mechanistic toxicology program.

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment According to Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended) and EMEA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/447/00) the environmental risk assessment is required for all new marketing authorisation applications for a medicinal product.  The  placement  of  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  on  the  EU  market  in  form  of  the  fixed combination might not constitute any significant risk to the environment. However, the CHMP does not agree that no further environmental risk assessment is required for hydrochlorothiazide because of the low contribution of ALI/HCTZ on total hydrochlorothiazide use in the EU. The absence of further studies on hydrochlorothiazide could not be justified. Therefore, in order to provide information on the additional environmental  exposure  and  size  of  the  population  that  will  contribute  to  the  increased  environmental exposure of the combination product possibly due to use of the product in patients inadequately controlled by aliskiren, the following studies for hydrochlorothiazide will be performed as follow up measures: -Transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308) -Adsorption/Desorption (OECD 106) -Algae Growth Inhibition Test (OECD 201) As with all  non-readily  biodegradable  human  medicines,  patients  should  are  advised  not  to  dispose  of unused aliskiren via the domestic sewage. 2.4 Clinical aspects Introduction The clinical development program supporting the registration of the fixed combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  consisted  of  a  multifactorial  design  study  with  adequate  doses  of  each monotherapy components and the combination of the components, studies of the combination therapy in patients who do not adequately respond to aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, and a long-term safety and efficacy study. Overall, the clinical program included a total of 8 472 patients. Since some of the studies were conducted with the free combination of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, a bioequivalence development program was included to bridge the clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with  free  combination  drugs  with  those  obtained  with  the  final  fixed  dose  combination  product.

The regulatory requirements relevant for fixed dose antihypertensive drug combinations are described  in the following regulatory guidance documents:

1. Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, CPMP/EWP/238/95 Rev. 2.

2. Note for Guidance on fixed combination medicinal products, NfG/CPMP/EWP/240/95 Rev.1. 3.

Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). The design and conduct of the clinical studies  followed  the  relevant  regulatory  authority  guidelines  in effect at the time of study initiation. The clinical development program for aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and study designs were discussed with the National Health Authorities of France, Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, 2005. There is no paediatric development programme. According to the European legislation valid at the time of submission, there was no need to submit a paediatric investigation plan before July 2008. GCP The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  The assessment of the clinical data did not raise concerns about their compliance with GCP. No inspection was requested. Pharmacokinetics This  application  is  based  on  clinical  trials  demonstrating  the  claimed  therapeutic  advantages  of  the proposed aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide combination. However, in the clinical trials the two components were administered separately and it was necessary to prove that the new fixed dose combination product is the same in terms of rate and extent of absorption of each therapeutic moiety administered concurrently as  the  separate  monotherapy  products.  In  order  to  bridge  the  information  obtained  with  the  free combination  used  in  definitive  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  studies  to  the  new  fixed  combination  filmcoated  tablet  product,  a  bioequivalence  development  program  was  designed  as  part  of  the  registration application. Three definitive bioequivalence studies were conducted with the dose strengths, 150/25 mg, 300/12.5 mg, and 300/25 mg of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide. Based on the compositional proportionality and similarity in in vitro dissolution properties, a bio-waiver was requested for the fourth dose strength, 150/12.5 mg of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide. All bioequivalence studies were carried out in fasting state. However, it is known that aliskiren has pronounced food effect. Thus, investigations whether the fixed combination  product  has  the  same  property  were  conducted,  and  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide plasma concentrations in fasting and fed states were compared in a fourth study. Details of these new four pharmacokinetics studies are summarized below: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

During the development of aliskiren as a monotherapy it became apparent that meals with high fat content reduce the C max by more than 85%, the AUC by approximately 70% and the bioavailability by more than 60%. Therefore, study ALI/HCTZA 2104 aimed to evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide  pharmacokinetics  after  administration  of  300/25  mg  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide tablet under both fasting and fed conditions to 30 volunteers. The meal of a high fat breakfast (2 eggs fried in butter, 2 strips of bacon, 2 slices of toast with butter, 4 oz (100 g) of hash brown potatoes, 8 fl oz (200  ml)  of  whole  milk)  was  recommended  by  the  FDA.  For  administration  under  fed  conditions,  the tablet was administered 5 min after completion of the meal. This study employed a classical single dose, two-period, two-treatment, crossover design. A fixed inter-dose interval of 16 days was observed by all subjects.

CSPH100A2102 CSPH100A2103 CSPH100A2104  Absorption No new pharmacokinetic studies were performed with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination. Based on studies previously conducted with the mono component, the oral bioavailability of aliskiren was greater following administration of capsules (2.6 ± 0.8%) than oral solution (1.9 ± 0.7%). It is unusual that  oral  biovailabilty of  solution  is  less  than  that  of  the  capsule  (or  tablet).  The  low  bioavailability  of aliskiren  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  aliskiren  has  a  low  intrinsic  permeability  and  that  it  is effectively pumped out by multi drug resistance 1 (MDR1) transport proteins present in the gut epithelial cells.  It  is  supposed  that  aliskiren  undergoes  an  active  efflux  in  the  gut  and  an  effective  first  pass excretion into bile. The observed double peaked plasma aliskiren profiles remain unexplained, but they suggest an involvement of active transporters in the liver. Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide following the  oral  administration  is  rapid  with  t max about  2  hours,  with  similar  absorption  profiles  for  both suspension and tablet formulations.  Absolute bioavailability of the compound is 60-80%. Effect of food Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The  study  confirmed  that  a  high  fat  meal  markedly  reduces  aliskiren  rate  and  extent  of  absorption. Bioavailability was reduced by 60-70%. Based on the geometric mean ratios, Cmax and AUC under fed conditions were reduced by 82% and 60%, respectively, as compared with under fasted conditions.   The effect  of  food  on  hydrochlorothiazide  bioavailability  was  not  statistically  significant.  Intra-subject coefficients of variation of Cmax, AUC0-tlast and AUC0inf for aliskiren were 61.67%, 34.16% and 34.47% respectively. Therefore, the CHMP was concerned about the proposed recommendation for administration of the product with a light meal. No supportive scientific data exists at present and the effect of meals with  different  composition  to  that  of  high  fat  breakfast  remains  unclear.  The  data  analyses  provided during  the  procedure  reasonably  demonstrate  that  the  food  effect  is  most  probably  independent  of formulation and the results of the bioequivalence study under fasting conditions could be extrapolated to fed  conditions.  In  addition,  there  are  follow  up  measures  to  conduct  a  post  approval  studies  to  further assess food effect of a light meal on aliskiren. Bioequivalence In order to bridge the clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with free combination drugs to the fixed combinations,  a  bioequivalence  development  programme  consisting  of  three  definitive  bioequivalence studies with the dose strengths 150/25 mg (study CALI/HCTZA2101), 300/12.5 mg (study CALI/HCTZA2102), and 300/25 mg (study CALI/HCTZA2103) of ALI/HCTZ. As mentioned above, a bio-waiver was requested for dose strength 150/12.5 mg of ALI/HCTZ. Bioequivalence studies are summarised in the following table Bioequivalence studies are summarised in the following table Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The design and conduct were the same in all three  bioequivalence  studies.  The  studies  were  correctly designed and sample sizes were adequate. Bioequivalence was evaluated after single dose, under fasting conditions. Washout periods between treatments allowed complete elimination of drugs before the next treatment period. Because food markedly reduces the bioavailability of aliskiren, and bioequivalence may depend on fed/fasting status, the studies do not allow concluding on bioequivalence under fed conditions. In  addition,  the  recommendations  of  the Note for Guidance on the investigation of bioavailability and bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) were not fully followed, since the document indicates that if the  SPC contains specific recommendations in relation with food intake, the study should be designed accordingly (see section Effect of food ).  Nevertheless, the results of the studies show that under fasting conditions, the fixed combination tablets are bioequivalent to the free combinations (aliskiren tablets + hydrochlorothiazide  capsules)  used  in  the  clinical  studies.  An  additional  issue  was  the  source  of hydrochlorothiazide  in  the  clinical  trials  conducted.  In  the  pivotal  clinical  studies,  so  called  clinical service form (CSF) hydrochlorothiazide capsules were used to prove the additional benefits of ALI/HCTZ compared to aliskiren. The CSF hydrochlorothiazide capsules were used to keep patients blinded to the treatment and this is an acceptable justification. Therapeutic equivalence between the clinical development formulation and the final market formulation was proved via bioequivalence studies. The HCTZ CSF used in ALI/HCTZ clinical trials were proven to be bioequivalent  to  a  medicinal  product approved in the EU (Co-Diovan ® ). A bio-waiver was requested for the 150/12.5 mg ALI/HCTZ dose. This recommendation was based on the following justifications: -The composition of the 150/12.5 mg ALI/HCTZ fixed combination tablet is proportional in its active and  inactive  ingredients  to  the  300/25  mg  ALI/HCTZ  fixed  combination  tablet,  for  which  the bioequivalence was established, -Aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide exhibit linear and/or dose proportional pharmacokinetics -In  vitro dissolution  of  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  is  similar  in  three  pH  media  between  the 300/25 mg and 150/12.5 mg fixed combination products. The argument of linear and/or dose proportional pharmacokinetics of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide was questioned, since already the kinetics of aliskiren itself is slightly nonlinear. In addition, there is a nonlinear component due to the interaction between aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide and the C max of aliskiren increases even when only the hydrochlorothiazide dose increases. Still, the interaction effect is comparatively small to other drug interactions (e.g. cyclosporine).  Distribution Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 135 litres,  indicating  that  aliskiren  distributes  extensively  into  the  extravascular  space.  Selective  tissue accumulation  also  might  be  a  reason  of  the  observed  large  volume  of  distribution.  In  animal  studies aliskiren  concentrations  were  substantially  higher  in  the  kidney  and  in  the  liver  than  in  the  plasma. Aliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The distribution and elimination kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide is described by a bi-exponential decay function. Hydrochlorothiazide accumulates in erythrocytes, reaching equilibrium at about 4 hours after a single  dose.  At  10  hours  post-dosing,  the  concentration  in  erythrocytes  is  about  3-fold  higher  than  in plasma. Based on literature data, hydrochlorothiazide is essentially limited in its distribution in the body to extracellular fluid space and the kidneys and the volume of distribution is approximately 3-4 litres/kg.

-  Metabolism and elimination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  mean  half-life  of  aliskiren  is  about  40  hours  (range  34-41  hours).  The  drug  is  eliminated  mainly through  the  hepatobiliary  route  mainly  as  unchanged  drug.  Following  intravenous  administration,  the mean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l/h. Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Unchanged aliskiren was found in the faeces (78%). Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine following oral administration. The apparent half-life of hydrochlorothiazide is 6-15 hours.  There is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on  repeated  dosing,  and  accumulation  is  minimal  (about  20%  increase  in  C max ,  day  1 vs 8),  when administered once-daily to healthy subjects.

Elderly: The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren was assessed in study SPP100A2217. The detailed statistical analysis revealed that there has been 50 % increase in the total exposure (AUC) and the Cmax has been increased by 30 %.  Changes in pharmacokinetics in the elderly usually occur due to agerelated physiologic perturbations and some of these may explain the increase in drug exposure. The effect of  aging  on  small-bowel  transporter  systems  is  not  yet  fully  established  but  could  contribute  to  the observed increase. Aging is associated with a reduction in hepatic blood flow and kidney clearance which could explain this increase in exposure. Regardless of the reason for the increased exposure, the CHMP was concerned that no dose adjustment was recommended for the elderly, especially since elderly people may be more sensitive to aliskiren in combination with hydrochlorothiazide at the start of the treatment. During the procedure, additional data from a clinical study examining the efficacy and safety of aliskiren based regimens in patients with age ≥ 65 years and systolic essential hypertension were submitted. The results  show  an  acceptable  risk/benefit  ratio  supporting  the  use  of  ALI/HCTZ  combination  in  these

 Dose proportionality and time dependencies No  analysis  of  the  results  from  the  bioequivalence  studies  with  the  combination  of  aliskiren  and hydrochlorothiazide  were  conducted.  The  issue  of  dose  response  was  evaluated  in  the  section  on Bioequivalence. Steady-state concentration data are not available with this new fixed combination.  Special populations Impaired renal function: The objective of study SPP100A2209 was to compare the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren alone or in combination with irbesartan in subjects with renal impairments and healthy controls. Total exposure was significantly higher in patients with damaged kidney function. Thus, the same systemic exposure of hydrochlorothiazide may therefore be achieved with lower doses of in patients with impaired renal function compared to those with normal renal function. The SPC states that the fixed combination product should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment. Impaired  hepatic  function: Hepatic  impairment  has  no  significant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of aliskiren  following  single  dose  administration  as  shown  in  study  SPP100A  2210.  In  cases  of  mild  to moderate impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, the SPC advices to use of the ALI/HCTZ combination  with  caution.  Due  to  the  hydrochlorothiazide  component,  the  fixed  combination  product should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment. Gender: Aliskiren exposure in males compared to females was slightly lower (AUC by 24%, and C max by 30%) however, this difference is mot probably related to differences in body weights. Race: In study SPP100A 2202, there was a slight difference between Caucasian and Asians regarding the kinetics of aliskiren but the observed difference was not clinically relevant. Weight: Overweight volunteers (more than +20% from the ideal body weight) were excluded from all pharmacokinetic studies. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

patients. In addition, data from the ongoing studies investigating safety and efficacy of ALI in the elderly will be presented to the CHMP.

Children: Aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide combination is not recommended for use in children.

##  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

The in  vitro studies,  described  in  the  non  clinical  section  of  the  report,  showed  that  aliskiren  does  not inhibit any of the CYP450 enzymes at therapeutic concentrations (IC 50 &gt; 200 µM).

Aliskiren blocks the renin angiotensin system (RAS) by binding to renin and inhibiting the cleavage of angiotensinogen  to  angiotensin  I  (Ang  I).  This  action  results  in  a  reduction  of  plasma  renin  activity (PRA), angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II). Aliskiren inhibits the RAS in a dose dependent manner following single dose administration and at steady state. The evidence for RAS blockade is based on the effects of aliskiren on plasma rennin activity (PRA), Ang I and Ang II levels, urinary and plasma aldosterone  levels  and  plasma  renin  concentration.  Plasma  renin  activity  is  a  direct  measure  of  the

Sixteen in-vivo interaction  studies  were  carried  out  with  aliskiren  and  clinically  important  interactions were found: -Co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide does not alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren but decreases the AUC  and  Cmax  of  furosemide  (28%  and  49%  respectively)  Therefore,  it is recommended that the effects of furosemide should be monitored and the dose adjusted, if necessary, when initiating treatment with aliskiren. -Co-administration of  aliskiren  and  atorvastatin  does  not  alter  the  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  of atorvastatin  or  its  metabolites,  but  increases  the  steady-state  AUC  and  C max of  aliskiren  by approximately 50%. -Ketoconazole is a potent P-glycoprotein and CYP3 A4 inhibitor and increases aliskiren exposure by 1.8 folds.  It is likely that this effect is due to the inhibition of P-glycoprotein by ketoconazole, since aliskiren is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. -An  interaction  study  conducted  with  aliskiren  and  cyclosporin  shows  that  cyclosporin  increased aliskiren  AUC  by  4.5  -  5.5  fold,  and  C max by  2.5  fold,  independently  of  cyclosporin  dose. Cyclosporin  markedly  increased  aliskiren  t 1/2 .  This  result  confirms  that  P-glycoprotein  is  a  major determinant  of  aliskiren  clearance.  Thus,  a  contraindication  was  required  by  the  CHMP  for  the concomitant  use  of  aliskiren  with  cyclosporin  and  other  potent  P-gp  inhibitors,  e.g.  quinidine, verapamil, and is presented in the SPC. -The interaction study of aliskiren with hydrochlorothiazide revealed that aliskiren decreases both, the rate  and  extent  of  absorption  of  hydrochlorothiazide.  This  effect  is  statistically  significant  and  its mechanism  is  not  understood.  Increasing  hydrochlorothiazide  concentrations  increase  the  C max of aliskiren.  But at steady-state the effect of hydrochlorothiazide is just the opposite, it decreases the Cmax aliskiren by about 20 %. The significance of this observation is most probably of no clinical relevance, but it is important to note that steady-state data were not predictable from the single-dose data.  Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials There were no pharmacokinetic studies conducted with human biomaterials.

formation  of  Ang  I  in  the  plasma.  Plasma  renin  concentration  (PRC,  active  renin)  measures  the concentration of immunoactive renin in the plasma.

Hydrochlorothiazide  is  an  orally  active  thiazide  diuretic  that  has  been  proven  to  be  effective  for  the treatment of hypertension. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide is believed to be related to its volume/sodium depletion. Since RAS blockade and volume depletion have been demonstrated to be among the most effective treatments of hypertension, the combination  of  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  is  expected  to  provide  more  optimal  blood  pressure control than the monotherapies.

 Primary and Secondary pharmacology Biomarker data (PRA and PRC) were collected as pharmacodynamic measures in two clinical studies. In study  CSPP100A  2204,  the  treatment  with  all  three  aliskiren  monotherapy  doses  was  associated  with reductions in PRA. Despite the expected increases in PRA found with hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy (range from 4% to 72%), all of the combination dose groups had PRA reductions, ranging from 46% in the  ALI/HCTZ  150/25  group  to  63%  in  the  ALI/HCTZ  150/6.25  group.  Greater  increases  in  rennin concentration with increasing doses were found for the aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy treatment groups, with the increases somewhat greater with aliskiren than hydrochlorothiazide. Overall, these results  are  consistent  with  the  known pharmacology of many antihypertensives, which leads to a compensatory rise in renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. They also confirm the putative mechanism of action of aliskiren, which reduces PRA through its inhibition of the active enzyme. These  studies  clearly  affirmed  the  putative  effects  of  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  combination,  i.e. aliskiren blocks the reactive rise in PRA induced by hydrochlorothiazide. Clinical efficacy  Dose response study The  selection  of  aliskiren  doses  included  in  the  efficacy  studies  was  based  on  aliskiren  monotherapy clinical  trial  data  and  the  selected  hydrochlorothiazide  doses  included  the  available  marketed  strengths that are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension. The final selection of the market strengths for the  ALI/HCTZ  combination  was  based  on  the  results  of  the  clinical  study  CSPP100A2204,  which provides  data  on  dose-finding  as  well  as  efficacy.  It  was  an  8  week,  double-blind,  multicenter, randomised,  multifactorial,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  on  efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren alone and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in hypertension patients. Aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide were studied alone and in combination. Aliskiren doses were 75, 150, and  300  mg;  hydrochlorothiazide  doses  were  6.25,  12.5,  and  25  mg;  and  all  combinations,  with  the exception of 300/6.25 mg, were studied. A review of the reductions in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  provided  by  the  combinations  of  each  of  the  three  aliskiren  doses  with either 12.5 or 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, subtracted from placebo or from the respective individual hydrochlorothiazide component dose, reveals dose-related effects.

- -4 studies in mild to moderate hypertension - not adequately responding to aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy (SPP100A2331, 2332, 2333, 2309)

The combination of aliskiren with hydrochlorothiazide was well-tolerated. The selected doses appear to be appropriate for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The choice  of  combinations  of  four  strengths:  150  or  300  mg  aliskiren  with  either  12.5  mg  or  25  mg hydrochlorothiazide  seem  appropriate,  in  particular  for  patients  not  adequately  responding  to  aliskiren monotherapy. The clinical efficacy of aliskiren given alone increases in a dose-dependent manner (150 and  300mg),  whereas  no  constant  and  significant  blood  pressure  (BP)  lowering  effects  occur  when increasing  hydrochlorothiazide  dose  from  12.5  mg  to  25  mg.  Based  on  this  clinical  data,  the  use  of aliskiren  combined  with  hydrochlorothiazide  25  mg  might  be  questionable.  However,  considering  the indication of ALI/HCTZ as add-on therapy or replacement therapy, the efficacy data have to be analyzed with focus on non-responder studies. All data from these studies (CSPP100A2332 and 2333) indicate that in combination with aliskiren 300 or 150 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg lowered blood pressure more than  hydrochlorothiazide  12.5  mg  without  a  substantial  change  in  the  safety  profile.  The  difference  in blood pressure reduction between the two hydrochlorothiazide doses was not statistically significant in all analyses but overall the data support a positive benefit/risk assessment for the four doses of ALI/HCTZ in the general hypertension population with inclusion of elderly patients.  Main studies Clinical efficacy was observed in placebo-controlled and active-controlled studies, as follows:  Dose-selection study: 1 placebo-controlled study (SPP100A2204)  Confirmatory efficacy studies: 5 active-controlled studies: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- -1 study in uncomplicated severe hypertension (SPP100A2303)
-  Long-term efficacy studies:

3 studies in total:

- -1 double-blind, active controlled 6-month studies (SPP100A2306)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -1 open label 12-month study, including a one-month, randomised, double-blind withdrawal period to confirm long-term efficacy (SPP100A2302) and a 4-month extension to this study (SPP100A2302E1)

Most of these short-term and long-term efficacy studies may be regarded as pivotal as they provide the principal  evidence  of  the  efficacy  of  aliskiren  in  hypertension.  Each  study  contributes  to  the  proof  of efficacy on different level, and thus, will be accordingly described under the relevant efficacy and safety endpoint.  Moreover, in some studies, comparison was made to other antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker. Combinations of these drugs were also analysed. The following table provides a brief overview of the pivotal studies.

## METHODS

Clinical  studies  were  randomised,  controlled  multicenter  type.  There  was  one  placebo  controlled study,  CSPP100A2204;  all  the  others  were  active  controlled,  with  the  following  reference  agents: aliskiren,  hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan or irbesartan, lisinopril, amlodipine and their combinations. All studies were  double-blind, the  only  open  study  was  CSPP100A2302,  and  its  extension CSPP100A2302E1. Some large-scale studies were performed in well over 100 centres.

## Study Participants

| amlodipine   | 5 and 10 mg   |
|--------------|---------------|
| lisinopril   | 20 and 40 mg  |
| valsartan    | 320 mg        |

In study CSPP100A2303, the efficacy of aliskiren was assessed in uncomplicated severe hypertension. In this study the efficacy of aliskiren with or without hydrochlorothiazide was compared with ramipril with or without hydrochlorothiazide. In the majority of studies patients with obesity, and metabolic syndrome and/or treated diabetes mellitus were not excluded.

Efficacy was tested in patients over the age of 18 with mild to moderate hypertension (DBP from 95 and 110 mm Hg). Patients with severe or secondary hypertension were excluded in all studies except for study CSPP100A2303, in which the patient population had severe hypertension. Patients were also excluded  if  they  had  recent  or  ongoing  cardiovascular  or  cerebrovascular  disorders  that  would preclude  even  brief  periods  off  antihypertensive  treatment  used  for  either  BP  control  or  protection against morbidity and mortality. The clinical studies also excluded most patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment or poorly controlled diabetes. Children and women who were pregnant or nursing were  not  studied.  Study  populations  were  representative  of  adult  patients  requiring  treatment  for hypertension  and  the  characteristics  of  patients  were  balanced  among  treatment  groups  with  some exceptions, e.g. 78,9% of patients were younger than 65 years and only 3,6 % were 75 years or older. With the exception of study CSPP100A2303 (severe hypertension group), the patients suffered from mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Complicated cases were excluded, with the exception of comorbidity  problems  with  body  weight  and  metabolism,  such  as  obesity  (higher  BMI),  metabolic syndrome and (controlled) diabetes mellitus, and in some cases, mild cardiovascular diseases. Treatments According to the results of pharmacokinetic studies, aliskiren was administered once in the morning (at  8:00  h)  (OD)  at  a  dose  of  75,  150,  300  mg  (in  the  majority  of  studies  150  or  300  mg)  in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 6.25, 12.5 or 25 mg (in the majority of studies 12.5 or 25 mg). The doses of comparators in the active-controlled studies: amlodipine lisinopril valsartan The majority of studies were short-term (8-12 weeks: study CSPP100 1201, 2308, 2203, 2204, 2305, 2307, 2309, 2303, 2324), one study (2306) lasted for 26 weeks and 1 study (2302) lasted for 52 weeks with an additional 4-month extension (2302E1) in a subset of patients. Objectives With the exception of study CSPP100A2303 (see below), studies were performed in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The efficacy was assessed: -in ALI/HCTZ combination therapy, compared with placebo, -in ALI/HCTZ combination therapy compared with the drugs alone (monotherapy), i.e. to test the superiority of combined therapy to monotherapy. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The  primary  objective  of  study  CSPP100A2204  was  to  test  the  superiority  of  aliskiren  plus hydrochlorothiazide combination to monotherapy. A dose-response relationship was calculated. In the other short-term studies, the efficacy and safety of ALI/HCTZ was studied in patients who were not adequately responding to aliskiren 300 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg monotherapy. In the longterm  studies,  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  ALI/HCTZ  combination  was  studied.  The persistence of effect and possible withdrawal/rebound phenomena were also addressed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary aim was to prove the concept that ALI/HCTZ combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy with either component. The posology of this combination is based on this concept.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  changes  in  msDBP  and  msSBP.  Blood pressure was measured according to CHMP Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products  in  the  treatment  of  hypertension (CPMP/EWP/238/95/Rev2).  Other  major  secondary variables included the proportion of patients who were responders (DBP &lt;90 mm Hg and/or ≥ 10 mm Hg less than at baseline), the proportion of patients whose BP was controlled (BP &lt; 140/90). In some studies,  dose-response  surface  analysis  and  biomarkers  PRA  and  RC  were  also  determined.  The endpoints were considered appropriate.

Sample size Sample sizes, assuming a dropout rate of 10% and equal randomization ratio, were calculated based on the  primary  variable,  change  from  baseline  in  msDBP  and  a  standard  deviation  of  8  mmHg.  The sample size was calculated to ensure 90% power to detect statistical significance for both pair-wise comparisons under the alternative hypothesis that the treatment difference is 2.5 mmHg at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. It was needed to show that the combination is statistically superior to both monotherapy  treatments.  Therefore  no  statistical  adjustment  for  two  pair-wise  comparisons  was needed. If non-inferiority was statistically detected, a superiority test was performed. This sample size would have more than 90% power in the test that aliskiren is superior to ramipril under the alternative hypothesis that the treatment difference is greater than 2.5 mmHg at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. The approach for sample size calculation was considered appropriate. Randomisation In the appropriate studies, randomisation was performed using a randomisation list with a validated system that automates the random assignment of treatment groups to randomisation numbers in the specified ratio. The randomisation scheme was reviewed by a statistical and quality assurance expert, and locked. Blinding (masking) Based  on  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  patients  eligible  to  enter  the  double-blind  treatment period  of  the  appropriate  study,  investigator  staff,  persons  performing  the  assessments,  and  data analysts were blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomisation until database lock, using the following methods: randomisation data were kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding;  the  identity  of  the  treatments  were  concealed  by  the  use  of  study  drugs  that  are  all identical in packaging, labelling, schedule of administration, appearance, and odour. In studies where a comparator drug was also used, a double-dummy design was applied because the identity of the study drugs could not be disguised due to their different forms. Unblinding only occurred in case of patient emergencies and at the conclusion of the study. The investigator had the option to break the study blind in cases of emergency. Stratification, if appropriate, was performed only at data analysis. The blinding methodology was deemed acceptable. Statistical methods Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Statistical  methods were  appropriate  for  analysing  blood  pressure  changes.  The  primary  efficacy variable  (mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  msDBP  at  trough  in  the  ITT  population)  was analysed by a pre-specified two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and region as factors, and baseline as a covariate. A statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons using Dunnett's procedure  was  used  for  studies  including  multiple  aliskiren  doses.  The  key  secondary  efficacy endpoint, the msSBP, was analyzed similarly. The proportion of responders and the control rate were analysed by means of a logistic regression model with treatment and region as factors, and baseline msDBP as a covariate.

The  primary  pairwise  comparisons  performed  were  ALI/HCTZ  combination  doses  against  their aliskiren  and  HCTZ  monotherapy  doses.  In  addition,  pairwise  comparisons  between  an  active treatment and placebo were also performed as supportive evaluations. The statistical test for each of the  above  pairwise  comparisons  was  made  at  a  two-sided  significance  level  of  0.05.  Ninety-five

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

percent  confidence  intervals  of  pairwise  treatment  differences  were  provided.  The  BP  control  rates (msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg), were analyzed for the Intent-to-treat population and each pairwise treatment  comparison  was  made  at  a  two-sided  significance  level  of  0.05.  Separate  individual evaluations  of  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  were  performed  in  a  similar  manner.  Between-treatment comparisons of change from baseline in msSBP and msDBP were also performed.

If  applicable,  patients  were  randomised and entered the study with control and/or with concomitant therapies.  At  set  time  points,  monitoring  visits  were  conducted  by  responsible  study  monitors  in accordance  with  the  study  protocol.  Patient  visits  were  conducted  as  planned  in  the  protocol  and appropriate examinations, laboratory tests and procedures were performed. Results of medical tests, adverse  events  and  pregnancies  were  monitored  throughout  the  duration  of  the  studies  and  in  the follow  up  period.  Some  minor  procedural  amendments  were  made  to  some  studies  aiming  at uniformity of the studies. These did not affect the outcomes or statistical analyses.

*double-blind period **open label period, safety population There were no large imbalances in the numbers of patients discontinuing for various reasons, other than a tendency for more patients to discontinue for lack of efficacy in placebo group. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide  to  aliskiren  did  not  result  in  increased  patient  withdrawals.  The  number  of patients who discontinued due to adverse events ranged between 1 and 5.2% and there was a higher discontinuation rate (16.9%) in study 2302, which had longer treatment duration (1 year) than other studies. Recruitment The main efficacy and safety confirming studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, North, South and Latin  America.  Studies  were  initiated  and  completed  between  2004  and  2007.  Inclusion/exclusion criteria of the relevant study were considered when recruiting patients. Conduct of the study Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Baseline data

Clinical  trials  included  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  essential  hypertension,  (msDBP ≥ 90  or  95 mmHg and  &lt;110  mmHg),  except  for  study  CSPP100A2303,  which  recruited  patients  with  severe

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertension,  with  msDBP ≥ 105  and  &lt;120  mmHg.  In  addition,  study  CSPP100A2309  enrolled exclusively patients who were obese (BMI ≥ 30  kg/m 2 ).  Other  than  these  differences,  placebo-  and active-controlled  studies  had  comparable  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  The  baseline  demographic characteristics  of  the  treatment  groups  were  comparable  within  each  study,  and  were  generally comparable across the different studies except for differences specified in the protocols: baseline BP was  higher  in  study  CSPP100A2303  as  it  enrolled  severe  hypertensive  patients  and  baseline  body weight and BMI are greater in study CSPP100A2309 as it enrolled obese patients. Patient disposition was similar across treatment groups in all trials. There was a tendency for more patients to discontinue for lack of efficacy in placebo group and low dose monotherapy (aliskiren 75 mg  and hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg) groups.

In  general,  study  population  was  well  balanced  regarding  the  age  and  gender  with  a  relative preponderance of Caucasian race. Numbers analysed The numbers of patients per study and per arms completed were sufficient for statistical analysis. The analysis  population  for  efficacy  is  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  population,  which  was  defined  as  all randomized patients who had baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement. When ITT and per-protocol (PP) analysis were compared, no statistically significant differences were observed. Change  from  baseline  in  msSBP  and  msDBP  were  reviewed  by  treatment  group  for  the  ITT population  as  well  as  age,  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  and  obesity  subgroups.  Overall  BP  control  rate (msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg), systolic BP control rate (msSBP &lt; 140 mmHg), and diastolic BP control rate (msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg) were analysed by visit and treatment group for the ITT population and for the following subgroups: age, gender, race, diabetes status, renal impairment and hypertension stage.  Furthermore,  for  the  overall  population  and  baseline  subgroup  of  patients  with  additional cardiovascular  risk,  the  following  variables  were  analysed  by  visit  and  treatment  group:  more aggressive overall BP control rate at 130/80, systolic BP control rate at 130, and diastolic BP control rate  at  80.

## Outcomes and estimation

Study SPP100A2204 is relevant for the combination therapy of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide as it reports  useful  data  on  dose-finding  and  potentially  useful  efficacy  data.  This  placebo-controlled multifactorial study confirmed that doses of aliskiren 75, 150, and 300 mg and their combinations with hydrochlorothiazide 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg lowered msDBP in mild to moderately hypertensive patients more  effectively  than  placebo.  Overall,  both  components  significantly  contributed  to  the  effects  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination  therapy.  The  greatest  least  square  (LS)  mean  reduction  of  msDBP  was  seen  with ALI/HCTZ 300/25 mg.

In  addition,  the  between-treatment  analysis  showed  that  all  combinations  that  contained  aliskiren doses  of  150  or  300  mg  and  hydrochlorothiazide  12.5  or  25  mg  demonstrated  statistically  greater msSBP  reduction  than  their  component  monotherapies  with  the  greatest  reduction  seen  with ALI/HCTZ 300/25 mg. Study  SPP100A2303 is  important  for  the  efficacy  proof  of  aliskiren  monotherapy,  but  is  not  of interest  for  the  combination  ALI/HCTZ.  Data were analysed and are available, but do not provide adequate information on the comparison of ALI+HCTZ with aliskiren alone. This is due to the fact that hydrochlorothiazide treatment was introduced as an additional therapy at different time points in the study and there are not data on hydrochlorothiazide use alone. The main aim of this study was the assessment of the aliskiren efficacy in comparison with that of lisinopril. Study SPP100A2306 reports information is of limited interest for the combination ALI/HCTZ.  The comparison of the add-on ALI+HCTZ therapy vs aliskiren alone has two major limitations: 1. only a small number of patients in this study required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide; 2. the addition of hydrochlorothiazide occurred at various time points and at variable doses.  There are not data about the  comparison  of  ALI+HCTZ vs hydrochlorothiazide  alone.  The  main  aim  of  this  study  was  the assessment of the aliskiren efficacy in comparison with that of ramipril. Study  SPP100A2309 is relevant for the  combination  ALI/HCTZ.  In  this  study  with  obese hypertensive  patients  not  adequately  responsive  to  HCTZ  monotherapy,  ALI/HCTZ  300/25  mg produced a statistically significant superior reduction in msDBP compared to HCTZ 25 mg alone at Week 8 endpoint (p&lt;0.0001). The ALI/HCTZ regimen had safety and tolerability similar to treatment with hydrochlorothiazide alone. Data support the use of the combination of aliskiren with hydrochlorothiazide as a second line indication, limitedly to obese patients pre-treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Comparisons of the efficacy of ALI/HCTZ  with irbesartan/HCTZ and amlodipine/HCTZ combinations, although numerically greater, were not statistically significant.

In  addition,  ALI/HCTZ 300/25 mg produced a statistically significant superior reduction in msSBP compared  to  hydrochlorothiazide  25  mg  alone  at  week  8  endpoint  (p  &lt;0.0001).  Comparisons  with irbesartan/HCTZ and amlodipine/HCTZ  combinations although numerically greater, were not statistically significant. Study  SPP100A2302  and  its  extension  SPP100A2302E1 are relevant for the combination ALI/HCTZ and report safety data as requested for by applicable guideline for long-term use of the therapy in the treatment of hypertension. During the open-label period, clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in sitting blood pressures were  achieved  with  both  doses  of  aliskiren  as  monotherapy  and  also  combination  therapy.  The reductions were similar in both aliskiren randomization groups. The combination of ALI/HCTZ was well tolerated in patients treated for at least 180 days with the dose of 300mg/12.5mg (n=344) and or the higher dose of 300mg/25mg (N=357). During  the  extension  period,  clinically  meaningful  BP  reduction  from  baseline  was  maintained throughout the duration of the entire study. Greater than 17 mmHg in mean SBP and 10 mmHg in mean DBP were observed at each visit after month 4 when all the patients received the combination treatment of aliskiren 300 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, indicating the long-term efficacy of this combination.

Study SPP100A 2331 examined the differences in the efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide, ALI/HCTZ, valsartan/HCTZ  and  aliskiren/valsartan/HCTZ.  Thus,  two  out  of  the  four  arms  of  this  study  are relevant  to  the  present  application  for  the  combination  ALI/HCTZ.  In  this  study  with  patients  not adequately responsive to 25 mg HCTZ monotherapy, ALI/HCTZ 300/25 mg produced a statistically significant  superior  reduction  in  msDBP  compared  to  hydrochlorothiazide  25  mg  alone  at  week  8 (p&lt;0.0001).

## Ancillary analyses

Dose-response  surface  analysis: For  the  primary  efficacy  variable  (change  from  the  baseline  in msDBP) in study CSPP100A2204, the dose response surface was fitted in the second order. The first

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

order lack-of-fit test was statistically significant (p=0.0107) and the second order lack-of-fit test was not statistically significant (p=0.8717). In this fitted second order form, both the squared term of the aliskiren  dose  and  the  cross  product  term  of  the  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  doses  were  not statistically significant. The negative coefficients for the first order terms indicated that the reduction in  msDBP  had  a  positive  relationship  to  the  dose  of  both  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide.  The positive coefficient for the second order squared term of the hydrochlorothiazide dose indicated that the magnitude of the relationship of msDBP reduction to hydrochlorothiazide dose decreased as the dose  level  increased.  This  was  consistent  with  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  result,  in  which hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and 25 mg had similar reductions in msDBP. This analysis was repeated for msSBP with consistent results.

##  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

In some clinical trials, patients with impaired renal function and diabetes were included. In general, the trend of greater msDBP and msSBP reduction and blood pressure control were observed with the ALI/HCTZ combination compared to the respective monotherapies.  It is, however, important to note that the number of patients with diabetes or moderate renal impairment was small and thus, the data from these patients should be interpreted with caution. The ALI/HCTZ combination is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.

No pooled analyses of the clinical efficacy data from studies were conducted. This was due to the  significant  variability  in  study  design,  duration  of  treatment  and  patient  recruitment. Studies were evaluated individually to assess the efficacy of the combination of aliskiren with hydrochlorothiazide. Pooled data were used for safety analysis only.  Clinical studies in special populations No children were included in clinical studies with ALI/HCTZ. The SPC advises that the combination product is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy. The combination therapy of ALI/HCTZ had clinically relevant additive effects overall, with individual dose  combinations  demonstrating  numerically  greater  reductions  in  msDBP  and  msSBP  for  both genders  than  their  component  monotherapies.  However,  the  originally  claimed  indication  for  initial treatment of hypertensive patients unlikely to achieve target blood pressure with a single agent, such as  patients  with  markedly  elevated  blood  pressure  (systolic  blood  pressure ≥ 160 mmHg  and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg) or patients with additional cardiovascular risk such as diabetes, renal impairment or known cardiovascular disease was not supported by solid clinical data. Therefore, the use of ALI/HCTZ combination was considered approvable only for the second-line indications, i.e. in  patients  whose  BP  is  not  controlled  with  aliskiren  or  hydrochlorothiazide  monotherapy  and  for replacement  therapy  in  patients  adequately  controlled  with  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide.  The indication was amended appropriately. The  study  population  was  divided  into  the  following  racial  subgroups:  Caucasian,  Black,  Asian, Native  American,  Pacific  Islander,  and  other.  Although  the  majority  of  the  study  population  was Caucasian  and  the  number  of  patients  in  other  racial  subpopulation  treatment  group  is  small,  the results  consistently  support  the  conclusion  in  the  overall  population.  Combination  groups  produced greater reductions than in each respective monotherapy. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Approach of caution should be taken when considering the use of the product in elderly population. According  to  pharmacokinetic  data,  the  drug  exposure  increases  with  age;  elevated  plasma  levels occur (exposure in subjects &gt;65years is increased by about 50%, with respect to subjects aged 18-45 years).  The  dose-response  relationship  in  the  elderly  population  is  not  entirely  clear.  Although subgroup analyses of elderly patients do not reveal a higher incidence of adverse events in this special population,  the  number  of  elderly  patients  above  75  years  in  each  treatment  group  is  small,  and therefore data in these subgroups must be interpreted with caution.

## Clinical safety

Since aliskiren is approved at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg for the treatment of hypertension either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents and hydrochlorothiazide has been widely used for the treatment of hypertension, with 12.5 mg and 25 mg as the commonly prescribed doses,  there  is  information  available  on  the  safety  of  these  components  in  the  treatment  of hypertension.

Safety analyses and data for the use of ALI/HCTZ combination were derived from the overall clinical development program, including the short-term and long-term trials.

Safety  assessments  consisted  of  monitoring  and  recording  all  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  serious adverse events (SAEs) including the investigator's assessment of their severity, relationship to study drug, and actions taken; the regular monitoring of haematology and blood chemistry (performed at a central laboratory); regular measurements of vital signs; and performance of physical examinations.

In the placebo-controlled studies, the demographic variables were generally similar across treatment groups.  The  mean  age  of  patients  ranged  from  54-56  years.  Patients  meeting  criteria  for  obesity comprised approximately one-third to one-half of the patients in each of the treatment groups. Of those patients in whom the data were collected, approximately 8% who received ALI/HCTZ in the placebocontrolled  studies  had  a  diagnosis  of  diabetes.  Patients  with  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR)  &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m² comprised 3.8% of the placebo-controlled studies population.

 Patient exposure Overall,  8472  patients  were  included  in  the  ALI/HCTZ  clinical  development  program,  with  3939 patients  being  exposed  to  aliskiren  in  combination  with  hydrochlorothiazide.  Duration  of  exposure was presented  based  on  the  actual  dose  received.  An  adverse  event  started  on  a  dose  was  counted towards that dose, and results were tabulated by dose. In study CSPP100A2204, two treatment groups (ALI/HCTZ  150/25  mg  and  ALI/HCTZ  300/25  mg)  started  with  low  dose  treatment  (ALI/HCTZ 150/12.5 mg) for one week followed by 7 weeks of high dose (ALI/HCTZ 150/25 mg and 300/25 mg). The high dose treatment was used as the treatment group for the entire double-blind period. All safety data were reported based on the actual treatment. Data were pooled into 4 groups, as shown below: The demographics, baseline BPs, co-morbid medical conditions, and use of concomitant medications of the patients in the safety database were generally representative of the target population of patients with essential hypertension.

The demographic variables  in short-term controlled  were  generally  similar  across  treatment  groups and similar to those in the placebo-controlled studies; the deviations in characteristics that did exist were those that would be expected based on the entry criteria (e.g., the inclusion of only obese patients in  study  CSPP100A2309,  and  only  patients  with  severe  hypertension  in  study  CSPP100A2303). Approximately  9%  of  patients  who  received  ALI/HCTZ  in  the  short-term  controlled  studies  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

known to have a diagnosis of diabetes. Patients with GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m² comprised 4.2% of patients who received ALI/HCTZ in the short-term controlled studies population.

The demographics and background characteristics in the long-term open-label and long-term doubleblind  studies  were  generally  similar  to  those  in  the  short-term  controlled  studies.  The  duration  of exposure in the various treatment arms is summarised below:

Overall, this represents a large safety database, which is considered sufficient to meet the regulatory requirements and to demonstrate safety of aliskiren in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment  of  patients  with  hypertension.  The  representation  of  special  patient  population  (e.g.  the elderly) in the overall patients recruited is discussed below.  Adverse events The most frequently observed AEs in the short-term controlled studies are presented by treatment group in the table below: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results were consistent with those in the placebo-controlled studies. The AEs experienced by ≥ 1% of patients taking ALI/HCTZ and that were more frequent than in patients taking placebo were dizziness, diarrhoea, and arthralgia. The only AE that was experienced by ≥ 2% of patients taking ALI/HCTZ and was  more  frequent  than  in  patients  taking  placebo  was  dizziness,  however,  the  difference  was  not statistically significant. The incidence of dizziness in ALI/HCTZ treated patients was not higher than in  hydrochlorothiazide  treated  patients  (2.0%  for  both  groups).  There  was  a  marked  increase  of peripheral oedema in amlodipine/HCTZ group (11%) compared to other groups (&lt;2%).

The most frequently reported AEs in the long-term open-label studies are summarized in the table below:

The  most  frequently  reported  AE  with  ALI/HCTZ  and  aliskiren  monotherapy  was  nasopharyngitis (6.1%  and  6.9%,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  headache  was  2.5%  in  the  ALI/HCTZ  group  and 7.8% in the  aliskiren  monotherapy  group.  There  was  no  evidence  of  increase  in  AE  rates  with  the addition  of  hydrochlorothiazide  to  aliskiren  treatment.  All  the  frequent  AEs  ( ≥ 2%)  reported  in  the long-term  open  label  studies  were  also  reported  in  the  short-term  controlled  trials.  Addition  of hydrochlorothiazide to aliskiren did not increase the incidence of diarrhoea or dizziness.

The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  during  long-term  double-blind  treatment  with  ALI/HCTZ  were dizziness,  nasopharyngitis,  fatigue,  and  headache.  Diarrhoea  was  reported  in  more  patients  treated with  aliskiren  monotherapy  and  the  combination  of  ALI/HCTZ  compared  to  patients  treated  with ramipril monotherapy and the combination of ramipril/HCTZ. There was no evidence of increase in the rate of overall gastrointestinal events and the rate of diarrhoea with addition of hydrochlorothiazide to aliskiren treatment. The incidence of headache was 3.1% in the ALI/HCTZ group and 10.7% in the aliskiren monotherapy group. Adverse events suspected  by  the  investigator  to  be  drug-related  belong  mostly  to  with  the  nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and general disorders and administration site conditions, but the rates of suspected events were low.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Serious adverse events: The proportion of patients with any serious adverse event (SAE) was low and generally  similar  across  all  treatment  groups.  In  the  combined  group  of  all  patients  who  took ALI/HCTZ, the rate was 1.3% in the placebo-controlled studies and 1.0% in the short-term controlled studies.  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  SAEs  with  aliskiren  monotherapy  was  0.5%  in  the placebo-controlled studies and 0.7% in the short-term controlled studies. The proportion of patients experiencing SAEs with hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy was 1.1% in the placebo-controlled studies and 1.0% in the short-term controlled studies. No placebo-treated patients experienced SAEs. In both Group A and Group B (see section Patient exposure ) populations, for ALI/HCTZ, the system organ class  with  the  most  SAEs  was  nervous  system  disorders  (&lt;  0.3%).  Results  in  the  long-term  studies were  consistent  with  the  data  from  the  short-term  studies  given  the  relative  lengths  of  treatment exposure in the one-year and 6-month trials and the 8-week and 12-week trials, respectively. SAEs occurred in four patients (one on aliskiren monotherapy, 3 on placebo who withdrew from aliskiren monotherapy) during the randomized withdrawal period of study CSPP100A2306.

In  the  bioequivalence  study  CALI/HCTZA2103, one  subject  who  received  one  dose  of  ALI/HCTZ 300/25 mg, had an episode of acute cholecystitis which required hospitalisation. This was reported as an SAE not related to study medication. There were no other SAEs in the completed bioequivalence studies relevant for this combination product.

For  the  ALI/HCTZ  group,  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  the  system  organ  class  with  the  most SAEs leading to study discontinuation was cardiac disorders (0.1%), while in the short-term controlled studies, the system organ classes with the most SAEs leading to study discontinuation were cardiac disorders and nervous system disorders (0.1%). The proportion of patients with any SAE leading to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study discontinuation was low and generally similar across all treatment groups. For the ALI/HCTZ group, in both, the long-term open label and long-term double-blind studies, the system organ class with the most SAEs leading to study discontinuation was cardiac disorders (0.5% in both).

Deaths: Overall,  12  deaths  occurred  during  or  after  completion  of  the  studies  which  contained  the treatment of aliskiren in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Two patients are known to have taken ALI/HCTZ at any time, five patients were treated with aliskiren monotherapy, one patient was treated with hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, and one patient was each treated with either valsartan/HCTZ, ramipril/HCTZ,  placebo,  or  receiving  no  treatment.  Deaths  were  related  to  cardiovascular  or cerebrovascular events, as would be expected in an older hypertensive population. The causes of death were similar in all groups, and the rate was no higher in patients treated with ALI/HCTZ compared with component monotherapies, active comparators, or placebo.

In  addition  to  the  routine  assessment  of  clinical  safety  during  treatment  and  withdrawal  and  the evaluation of potential drug interactions with agents commonly used in the hypertensive population, the  focus  of  the  safety  evaluation  was  also  directed  to  potential  safety  concerns  because  aliskiren's mode of action involves blockade of the RAS: -renal dysfunction as seen with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); -angioedema as seen with ACEIs; -cough as seen with ACEIs; -minimal decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit seen with ACEIs and ARBs; -potential gastrointestinal (GI) issues based on findings during the clinical development of aliskiren (preclinical findings in the GI tract; diarrhea noted at highest aliskiren doses in clinical trials). The most important events are described below: Renal function: Hypokalaemia with K+&lt;3.5 mmol/L was more common in the hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy  and  hydrochlorothiazide-containing  combination  groups  than  in  placebo  and  aliskiren monotherapy groups.  Hyperkalaemia  with  K+&gt;5.5  mmol/L  were  infrequent  (0  to  1.4%)  in  patients treated with various doses of ALI/HCTZ in the placebo-controlled trials. Only one patient treated with ALI/HCTZ had hyperkalaemia with K+ ≥ 6.0 mmol/L. No cases of elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine meeting clinically significant criteria were observed in patients treated with ALI/HCTZ. In the short-term controlled studies, the incidence of hyperkalaemia with K+&gt;5.5 mmol/L in patients treated  with  ALI/HCTZ (0.6%) was lower than patients treated with aliskiren monotherapy (1.6%). Only  1  case  (&lt;  0.1%)  of  elevated  BUN,  and  no  cases  of  elevated  creatinine  meeting  clinically significant criteria were observed in patients treated with ALI/HCTZ. It  is  of  interest  that  the  opposite  effects  of  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  result  in  unaltered potassium balance, at least in the majority of patients taking ALI/HCTZ combination. There are no or insufficient  data  on  special  patient  populations,  i.e.  patients  with  a  preponderance  to  develop hyperkalaemia,  e.g.  diabetics  and/or  patients  with  moderate  renal  failure.  However,  in  the  SPC appropriate warning is placed, since risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include renal insufficiency and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients  at  risk  is  recommended.  Caution  is  required  when  co-administering  potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes with ALI/HCTZ. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Angioedema: Angioedema  is  a  known  serious  side  effect  of  ACEIs.  It  has  also  been  reported  in patients who were treated with ARBs. There was one case of angioedema reported in patients who received  the  combination  of  ALI/HCTZ  in  CSPP100A2302  study  and  the  study  drug  was  not interrupted.  Following  study  completion,  the  event  was  completely  resolved.  Based  on  the  low incidence seen in the presented clinical trials, angioedema would not be considered a safety risk for aliskiren  and  its  combination  with  HCTZ.  However,  cases  of  angioedema  with  relevant  occurrence were reported in the postmarketing use of aliskiren and the CHMP favoured the contraindication for patients with a history of angioedema to aliskiren. In addition a warning was added in the appropriate section of the SPC directing that ALI/HCTZ should be discontinued when patients with or without a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

previous  history  who  suffer  angioedema  with  aliskiren  monotherapy  are  warned  to  discontinue treatment  and  contact  their  physician.  Furthermore,  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  includes directions for postmarketing  use  to  monitor  through  targeted follow  up clinically significant angioedema spontaneous reports irrespective of seriousness and causality. Similarly, in clinical trials clinically significant angioedema cases reported as serious adverse event reports are to be thoroughly monitored and followed up.

Cough : Cough occurred in ≤ 2.1% of patients in any treatment group in the placebo-controlled studies. Only  two  patients  (0.1%)  in  the  ALI/HCTZ  combination  treatment  in  the  short-term  placebocontrolled studies discontinued due to cough. Similarly, in the short-term controlled studies cough was reported  in  0.5%  of  patients  receiving  placebo,  0.5%  of  patients  receiving  aliskiren  monotherapy, 0.9%  of  patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide  monotherapy,  and  0.9%  of  patients receiving ALI/HCTZ.  In  the  long-term  open-label  studies,  the  incidence  of  cough  was  1.5%  for  aliskiren monotherapy and 2.2% for ALI/HCTZ combination therapy. In the long-term double-blind studies, the incidence of cough was 3.3% for aliskiren monotherapy and 1.6% for aliskiren in combination with HCTZ compared to 8.1% in ramipril monotherapy and 4.3 % in ramipril/HCTZ. Nevertheless, as a class effect, cough is stated in the RMP as the ongoing safety concerns for aliskiren.

The effects  of  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  on  potassium  levels  were  discussed  in  the Serious adverse  event/deaths/other  significant  events section.  In  summary,  opposite  effects  of  aliskiren  and hydrochlorothiazide  on  potassium  values  were  observed  in  most  patients,  which  in  majority  of  the cases resulted in an unchanged balance. Nevertheless, the SPC includes an appropriate warning related to electrolyte imbalance and its symptoms.

Haematology: A slight  decrease  in  mean  haemoglobin  from  baseline  was  observed  in  the  aliskiren monotherapy and ALI/HCTZ combination treatment groups. However, the percentage of patients with &gt;20% decrease in haemoglobin was low (0% for aliskiren monotherapy and &lt;0.1% for ALI/HCTZ combination  in  short-term  controlled  trials).  There  was  essentially  no  change  in  haematocrit  from baseline  in  ALI/HCTZ-treated  patients.  Recent  studies  have  demonstrated  that  erythropoietin  levels are  increased  by  angiotensin  II  and  that  this  effect  is  mediated  by  the  AT1  receptor.  Thus  drugs blocking the RAS at sufficient doses will be expected to have minor effects on red cell production. Only one patient in the short-term controlled studies discontinued therapy due to anaemia; this patient was in the ALI/HCTZ 300/25 mg group. In the long-term open-label studies, haematology changes at endpoint were similar for monotherapy and combination therapy. At endpoint, platelet count increased slightly in both treatment groups. Other haematological variables changed little from baseline. Results in the long-term double-blind studies were generally similar. Gastrointestinal events: Diarrhoea was observed at a higher rate in ALI/HCTZ (1.3%) as compared to placebo (0.5%) in all short-term controlled trials. Even though the difference did not reach statistical significance between ALI/HCTZ and placebo, diarrhoea is considered as an adverse reaction for the combination  mainly  because  it  is  a  dose  related  adverse  reaction  for  aliskiren.  The  incidence  of diarrhoea  was  not  higher  in  ALI/HCTZ  combination  compared  to  aliskiren  or  hydrochlorothiazide alone.  This  event  was  limited  in  duration  and  most  often  reported  as  mild  to  moderate  in  severity. Diarrhoea did not lead to early withdrawal from the study in most cases, did not increase in frequency with longer duration of treatment, and was not associated with other AEs. As concerns the potential role of aliskiren in colorectal events observed in non clinical setting, the results of the planned longterm safety studies will be presented to the CHMP to give additional evaluation of the risk. Monitoring of such events and assuring safety of patients taking ALI/HCTZ was included in follow up measures.  Laboratory findings Medicinal Product no longer authorised

##  Safety in special populations

Elderly : Analysis of adverse events by age in all studies indicated no excess of dizziness, vertigo, or diarrhea in older patients ( ≥ 65 years of age). Laboratory values of haematology and clinical chemistry, vital  signs,  and  orthostatic  blood  pressure  changes  were  also  evaluated  according  to  age  subgroups (&lt;65 years, ≥ 65 years, ≥ 75 years). Results within the age subgroups were consistent with the overall

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

results.  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  for  patients ≥ 65  years  and ≥ 75  years  was  lower  in  the combination  therapy  treatment  group  than  in  the  monotherapy  or  placebo  groups.  However,  the CHMP was concerned about the size of the elderly population in the clinical trials. It is important to note that the hypotensive effect of the combination ALI/HCTZ is of concern in the elderly, which can be more sensitive to the hypotensive effects than other subgroups. The exposure of the elderly to the product and the data originally presented were considered limited. Therefore, the results of a 36 week study  (CSPP100A2344)  were  submitted  during  the  evaluation  phase.  This  trial  was  conducted  to examine the efficacy and safety of aliskiren based regimens in combination with other antihypertensives  in  patients  with  age ≥ 65  years  and  systolic  essential  hypertension.  None  of  the observed  severe  AEs  in  patients  treated  with  ALI/HCTZ  were  hypotension  or  low  blood  pressure related  events.  The  number  of  patients  discontinuing  the  treatment  due  to  AEs  was  higher  in  the ramipril/HCTZ group than  in  the  ALI/HCTZ  group.  The  conclusions  about  the  safety  profile  were similar  when  analyses  were  limited  to  patients  with  age  &gt;75  years.  This  study  provided  additional information on  elderly  hypertensive populations and  showed  an  acceptable  risk/benefit ratio. Moreover,  a  commitment  was  included  in  the  follow  up  measures  to  provide  the  CHMP  with  the efficacy and safety information from the currently ongoing clinical trials in elderly patients.

Patients  with  diabetes: Since  hydrochlorothiazide  is  known  to  have  been  perceived  to  raise  safety concerns  in  diabetic  patients,  the  safety  in  diabetic  patients  was  closely  evaluated.  In  the  placebocontrolled  studies,  a  total  of  112  patients  in  the  ALI/HCTZ  combination  group  had  diabetes.  The overall  AE  incidence  rates  were  generally  similar  across  treatment  groups  regardless  of  baseline diabetes status and diabetes did not appear to dramatically increase the total incidence of AEs within each treatment group. However, given the small number of patients evaluated, there is a need to better define the safety and risks of the product in the population and the SPC includes a statement that to date, no data are available from clinical studies that were specifically designed to evaluate the safety of the combination product in diabetic patients. Renal impairment: In  general,  patients  with  significant  renal  impairment  (creatinine  &gt;1.7  mg/dl  for women and 2.0 mg/dl for men and/or estimated GFR &lt;30 ml/min) were excluded from the studies conducted  with  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide.  Furthermore,  due  to  the  hydrochlorothiazide component,  the  ALI/HCTZ  combination  is  contraindicated  for  use  in  patients  with  severe  renal impairment  (glomerular  filtration  rate,  GFR,  &lt;  30  ml/min).    Taking  into  account  that  both  of  the components of the combination may accumulate in the kidney, the possible consequences of a longlasting  treatment  especially  in  patients  with  already  impaired  renal  function  might  be  considered. Aliskiren is believed to bind to renin immediately upon its secretion. In contrast, thiazides and related diuretics  accumulate  in  the  distal  tubule  where  they  affect  the  renal  tubular  mechanisms  of electrolyte re-absorption. Accordingly, no pharmacokinetic interactions are expected in the kidney. There are no available data on the use of ALI/HCTZ in children.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions No  clinically  significant  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  observed  between  aliskiren  and  several commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications, including hydrochlorothiazide. The results of the drug-drug interaction study conducted to examine the potential for interactions between aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide showed that there are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions. High fat meal adversely affects aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide disposition (please see section Pharmacokinetics ). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

##  Discontinuation due to adverse events

Patient disposition was similar across treatment groups in all trials, with no large imbalances in the numbers  of  patients  discontinuing  for  various  reasons,  other  than  a  tendency  for  more  patients  to discontinue for lack of efficacy in placebo group. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to aliskiren did not result in increased patient withdrawals. The discontinuations due to safety reasons, e.g. AEs and laboratory abnormalities, were similar in the ALI/HCTZ treated patients when compared to aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide treated patients, and lower when compared to placebo treated patients.

##  Post marketing experience

There are no post marketing data available for the ALI/HCTZ combination. Nevertheless, the approval procedure for aliskiren was successfully completed in August 2007 and since then, clinical experience with the use of this product in the post marketing setting and/or in the clinical trials conducted post approval  revealed  several  important  safety  issues,  which  are  also  applicable  to  the  combination product:

- -The  results  of  the  cyclosporine  interaction  study  in  14  subjects  showed  that  concomitant cyclosporine administration increased AUC 4.5 to 5.5 fold with a lower dose of aliskiren (75 mg) than the authorised strengths (150 and 300mg). Cyclosporine markedly increased aliskiren half life. Hence, there is concern that the increase in AUC would be substantially higher with the approved aliskiren dosage, even exceeding the highest dose tested in humans. An additional concern  is  that  aliskiren  might  distribute  to  tissues  from  which  the  medicinal  product  is normally absent in presence of a P-gp inhibitor, or preset at low levels because of the activity of P-gp.  Non  clinical  and  clinical  data  converge  to  show  that  P-gp  is  a  major  determinant  of aliskiren bioavailability. In addition, literature data show that P-gp mediates tissue uptake of a variety of P-gp substrates and that P-gp inhibitors can markedly increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Given the very limited safety data at increased exposure, and the risk for very  large  increase  in  tissue  exposure,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  co-administration  of cyclosporine and aliskiren poses serious safety concerns. Therefore, the concomitant administration with cyclosporine, a highly potent P-gp inhibitor, as well as with other potent Pgp  inhibitors  (verapamil,  quinidine)  is  contraindicated.  Moreover,  due  to  the  risk  for  higher increase in tissue exposure than in plasma, caution should be advised during co administration with moderate P-gp inhibitors (ketoconazol, itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). -The  overall  safety  and  tolerability  of  aliskiren  150  mg  when  given  in  addition  to  standard therapy in hypertensive patients with stable heart failure was evaluated in a clinical trial with 302  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  heart  failure.  Addition  of  150  mg  aliskiren  showed  a reduction  of  BNP  levels  by  25  %,  although  the  clinical  significance  of  this  reduction  is unknown. The SPC contains a warning about the need for caution when the product is used in patients with heart failure. -The effects of aliskiren (150mg/300mg) on proteinuria in 599 patients with hypertension, type II 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, in whom blood pressure had been previously controlled by means of an angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan) in combination with the optional use of other  antihypertensive  drugs  (hydrochlorothiazide  and/or  amlodipine)  were  investigated  in  a specific  clinical  trial.  The  addition  of  300  mg  aliskiren  achieved  an  average  reduction  in  the urinary  albumin  to  creatinine  (UACR)  ratio  of  12  mg/mmol  (from  58  to  46  mg/mmol) compared to placebo and clinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood pressure. Furthermore, aliskiren was associated with an increased frequency  (4.2%  vs.  1.9%  for  placebo)  in  serum  potassium  concentration  ( ≥ 6  mmol/l).  The SPC for the combination product was adequately updated. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

During the post marketing use of aliskiren, a number of cases of renal failure or acute renal failure were reported. In the light of this  new safety signal on renal failure from the post marketing phase, a special  warning  was  introduced  in  the  SPC  regarding  a  prompt  discontinuation  of  the  treatment, should signs of renal failure occur. The Risk Management Plan has been updated accordingly. The Risk Management Plan will be reviewed on an on-going basis and updated as appropriate in the light of emerging safety data including renal dysfunction. In addition, there is a commitment to update the SPC for the aliskiren monotherapy.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Quality The quality of this medicinal product is considered satisfactory when used with the conditions defined in the SPC. The documentation provided for both active substances ALI and HCTZ is comprehensive and adequately detailed. The pharmaceutical development is adequate and took into consideration the properties and the stability of the active substances. The excipients used are common excipients for immediate  release  dosage  forms.  Similarly,  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented  and  no incompatibility has been noticed. The validation of the manufacturing process ensures consistency and reproducibility  of  the  finished  product.  The  finished  product  has  been  satisfactorily  controlled  and stability  studies  conducted  under  ICH  conditions  showed  that  the  product  is  stable  throughout  the proposed shelf-life. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were some minor unresolved quality issues with no impact on the benefit/risk. The applicant undertook to provide the necessary information as follow-up measures within  an  agreed  timeframe  and  to  submit  variations  if  required  following  the  evaluation  of  this additional information. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The toxicology program of ALI/HCTZ consisted of a principal, GLP compliant 13 week study in rats, with doses selected in a 2 week dose range finding non LP study. No other non clinical studies, such as  pharmacology,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproduction  toxicology  were  considered  necessary for  the  combination  product  as  these  could  be  derived  from  the  previous  studies  with  aliskiren  and from the literature and bibliographic references for hydrochlorothiazide.

In the 2 week dose range finding study the severity of pathological changes in multiple tissues of rats, notably kidney, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow and lymphoid organs indicate that a dose of 300/25 mg/kg/day would not be tolerated in a longer term study. Minimal tubular basophilia present in the kidneys  of  some  animals  treated  at  100/8  mg/kg/day  may  reflect  reduced  renal  perfusion.  The toxicological significance of the minimal lymphocytic infiltration in the medulla of the thymus in two males is unclear but it was not present in the longer studies. The NOAEL is considered to be 100/8 mg/kg/day. In the 13 wk repeated dose toxicity ALI/HCTZ induced slight reversible decreases in body weight  gains  and  food  consumption  in  males  given ≥ 100/8  mg/kg/day.  Reversible  decreases  in potassium and serum chloride levels were seen in rats given the combination at all doses, as well as hydrochlorothiazide alone. There were minimal to mild increases in mean group AST and ALT in two females  given  ALI/HCTZ  150/12  mg/kg/day.  Concurrent  hepatic  histopathologic  lesions  were  not observed, but increase of liver enzyme levels was present after four weeks of recovery period in one high  dose  female.  Treatment-related  microscopic  changes  recorded  as  minimal  increased  cellular vacuolation in the zona glomerulosa were seen in all animals treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone (12 mg/kg/day) or in combination with aliskiren ( ≥ 50/4 mg/kg/day). Due to the lack of further studies longer that 13 weeks it cannot be concluded whether this effect would not became more severe after

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chronic  treatment  and  appropriate  information  on  these  finding  is  included  in  the  SPC.  As  drugs affecting the RAAS are contraindicated in Europe during second and third trimesters of pregnancy, no specific fertility studies were carried out with the ALI/HCTZ combination. No specific carcinogenicity study  was  conducted  with  the  ALI/HCTZ  combination  and  this  approach  is  considered  appropriate based on the available data for the two single components.

Further environmental risk assessment need to be conducted for hydrochlorothiazide because of the unknown contribution of ALI/HCTZ on total hydrochlorothiazide use in the EU. In order to obtain information on the additional environmental exposure and size of the population contributing to the increased environmental exposure of the combination product possibly due to use of the product in patients inadequately controlled by aliskiren, several studies for hydrochlorothiazide will be performed as a follow up measure.

Safety  of  ALI/HCTZ  combination  was  assessed  in  several  short-  and  long-term  clinical  trials.  In addition, data from the post marketing use of aliskiren monotherapy contribute to the establishment of the safety profile of this combination product. The evaluation of adverse events observed showed that diarrhoea,  dizziness,  headache  and  nasopharyngitis  are  the  most  frequently  experienced  adverse events.  Several  adverse  events  constitute  the  events  of  special  interest,  including  angioedema, hyperkalaemia, diarrhoea, decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit.

Efficacy The  fixed  combination  of  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  is  considered  to  achieve  a  greater antihypertensive effect than the single monotherapies. The efficacy data were derived from short- and long-term  clinical  studies  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  current  regulatory  guidelines  using  a parallel-group and an add-on design. The dose-finding was based on parallel-group data. Efficacy was tested in mild to moderate hypertension (90 or 95 to &lt;110 mmHg DBP). The primary and secondary efficacy  variables  were  changes  in  msDBP  and  msSBP,  response  rate  and  control  rate.  In  addition, certain biomarkers have been evaluated (PRA and PRC). The data, however, were insufficient for recognising a positive risk benefit balance for the originally proposed  first  line  indication  of  the  combination  medicinal  product,  i.e.  for  the  treatment  of hypertensive  patients  with  either  additional  cardiovascular  risk  or  with  markedly  elevated  blood pressure (stage 2 hypertension). Indeed, no data had been provided that demonstrated clinical efficacy and  safety  of  the  product  given  as  a  first  line  treatment  in  comparison  to  an  add-on  indication. Furthermore, in the clinical program the target population of the proposed first line indication studies was  not  sufficiently  represented,  since  clinical  studies  excluded  patients  with  poorly  controlled diabetes,  or  significant  cardiovascular  disease,  or  cerebrovascular  diseases,  or  renal  impairment.  In fact,  the  results  in  the  small  subgroup  of  hypertensive  patients  with  additional  cardiovascular  risk indicate that the percentage of patients controlled by the combination ALI/HCTZ was not significantly higher than that obtained monotherapy treatments. Similarly, only limited data were submitted for the first  line  indication  of  ALI/HCTZ  in  patients  with  uncomplicated  severe  hypertension  (stage  2 hypertension)  to  compare  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  ALI/HCTZ vs an  add-on  treatment  of  the single  monocomponents.  Therefore,  the  use  of  ALI/HCTZ  combination  was  considered  approvable only  for  the  second-line  indications,  i.e.  in  patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  not  controlled  with aliskiren  or  hydrochlorothiazide  monotherapy  and  for  replacement  therapy  in  patients  adequately controlled with aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide. The proposed recommendation for administration of the product with a light meal will be supported by further  scientific  data  derived  from  the  planned  studies  investigating  the  effect  of  a  light  meal  on ALI/HCTZ bioavailability. It was observed that food markedly reduces the bioavailability of aliskiren and at present, the bioavailability of aliskiren with light meal is not fully established.

ALI/HCTZ is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  further  data  have  been submitted in order to demonstrate that the use of ALI/HCTZ is safe in hypertensive patients with mild to  moderate  renal  impairment; this  is  considered  acceptable.  The  use  of  the  combination product  is also contraindicated in patients with the history of angioedema, since several cases of this event have

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

been identified during the use of aliskiren. In the event of any signs suggesting an allergic reaction, patients should discontinue the treatment.

As concerns the potential safety concerns for aliskiren in elderly patients when given concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide due to the occurrence of elevated plasma levels after aliskiren monotherapy treatment,  a  36  week  study  (CSPP100A2344)  analysing  efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren  based regimens  in  patients  with  age ≥ 65  years  and  systolic  essential  hypertension  was  conducted.  The results  indicated  acceptable  risk/benefit  ratio  supporting  the  use  of  ALI/HCTZ  combination.  In addition, efficacy and safety information from ongoing clinical trials in elderly patients will be closely examined to ensure the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the risk/benefit profile.

The risk of renal dysfunction as adverse event associated with aliskiren will be further assessed, as well as the clarification on risk of renal impairment from results of the ongoing clinical trials. This is mainly due to the recent reports of acute renal failure in patients with co-morbidities using aliskiren. In the meantime renal dysfunction should be considered an identified risk. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.  User consultation The Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for Rasilez HCT has been tested in English in accordance with Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. The Patient Information Leaflet for Rasilez HCT was found to contain all the necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test. It is considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing. Risk-benefit assessment The  results  of  the  clinical  programme  for  ALI/HCTZ  combination  in  the  treatment  of  essential hypertension  represent  convincing  evidence  that,  in  comparison  to  each  drug  as  monotherapy,  the combination produces a greater antihypertensive effect. The compliance of patients with the fixed dose combination product is expected to improve. The second line indication, i.e. in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide used alone; as replacement therapy in patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination, is considered acceptable. Clinical data are sufficient to prove the benefit of this product in these hypertensive patients. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The incidence of adverse events was similar when the combination of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide was compared to aliskiren monotherapy and hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. It is  to  be  noted  that  the  combination  ALI/HCTZ  may  affect  potassium  and/or  overall  electrolyte homeostasis,  even though the effect of aliskiren (induction of hyperkalaemia) is opposite to that of hydrochlorothiazide  (induction  of  hypokalaemia).  Important  safety  concern  was  related  to  effects already  observed  with  aliskiren  monotherapy  and  linked  to  the  occurrence  of  angioedema  serious reactions or angioedema type reactions in patients with a history of angioedema associated to RAS blockers  or  in  co-medication  with  RAS  blockers.  Aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  combination  is contraindicated  in  patients  with  the  history  of  angioedema  related  to  aliskiren  administration.  It  is noteworthy that acute renal failure was reported in patients with co-morbidities during post marketing treatment  with  aliskiren  and  thus,  caution  should  be  exercised  when  administering  the  medicinal product to patients with conditions related to kidney dysfunction.

Currently,  no  dose  adjustment  is  recommended  in  the  elderly  population  (&gt;65years),  but  further studies  to  better  define  the  safety  profile  in  elderly  and  in  diabetic  patients,  as  well  as  to  better ascertain long-term safety are ongoing or in planning. The  overall benefit/risk balance for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  in  treatment  of  essential  hypertension  is  considered  positive  for  the treatment of hypertension in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide  used  alone,  and  as  replacement  therapy  in  patients  adequately  controlled  with aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Rasilez HCT in the treatment of essential hypertension in adults, when Rasilez HCT is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren  or  hydrochlorothiazide  used  alone  or  when  indicated  as  a  substitution  therapy  in  patients adequately  controlled  with  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide,  given  concurrently,  at  the  same  dose level as in the combination, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
