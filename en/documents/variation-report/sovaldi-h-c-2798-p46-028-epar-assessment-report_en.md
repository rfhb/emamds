This observational registry followed participants for up to 5 years, or until early discontinuation from the study. The Day 1 visit was documented as the last visit of the previous MAH-sponsored treatment protocol. Subsequent visits occurred at Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, 192, and 240.

Assessments included (collected at each visit):

- Perform symptom-directed physical examination
- Body height and weight measurements
- Tanner Pubertal Stage assessment (if applicable)
- Complete QOL survey
- Obtain blood samples for:
- o Plasma HCV RNA (if HCV RNA is detected after nondetectable levels at Day 1 or any time throughout the study, the participant will have a repeat blood sample drawn for confirmation)
- o Viral sequencing (archive); for analysis if a participant who achieved SVR in the parent study has confirmed quantifiable HCV RNA after Day 1 and for persistence in participants who were viremic at the time of study enrollment
- Assessment of procedure-related adverse events (AEs)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) considered to be related to study procedures as assessed by the investigator and mandated by the study protocol were reported under this study. Any treatment related SAEs were reported within the previous Gilead-sponsored treatment protocol.

Participants who began a new treatment course for HCV infection discontinued participation in this study.

## Sample size

Due to the observational nature of this study, no formal power, or sample size calculations were used.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable

## Statistical Methods

Data from this study were summarized descriptively and statistical hypothesis testing was not conducted. All continuous variables were summarized using an 8-number descriptive summary (n, mean, standard deviation, and median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, maximum) by visit. All categorical variables were summarized by number and percentage of participants in each categorical definition.

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all enrolled participants who met all the study entry eligibility criteria and with at least 1 post-Day 1 (Day 1 was documented from the last visit in the initial MAH-sponsored treatment protocol, referred to as 'parent study') visit measurement available. The FAS was the primary analysis set for all analyses. Safety Analysis Set was the same as FAS in this study.

Sustained virologic response duration in days = SVR end date in registry (for participants who did not maintain SVR) or last day of registry (for participants who maintained SVR) - SVR12 date in parent study + 1.

Virologic failure was defined as having 2 consecutive blood samples (at least one week apart) with HCV RNA more than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), or last available HCV RNA more than the LLOQ with no subsequent follow-up values.

## Primary Endpoints

Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and the corresponding percentiles and Z-scores at each visit and change from baseline at each visit were summarized for the Safety Analysis Set by prior treatment group, sex, prior age group (based on the age at the entry of the parent treatment studies), and overall using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to evaluate if the median change from baseline for weight, height, BMI, and the corresponding percentiles and Z-scores at each postbaseline visit was different from zero.

A categorical frequency table of weight/height/BMI Z-scores at each visit by prior treatment group, sex, and prior age group was summarized by 6 categories (&lt; -2, ≥ -2 to &lt; -1, ≥ -1 to &lt; 0, ≥ 0 to &lt; 1, ≥ 1 to &lt; 2, or ≥ 2). A categorical frequency table of weight/height/BMI percentile at each visit by prior treatment group, sex, and prior age group was also summarized by 3 categories (&lt; fifth percentile, ≥ fifth to &lt; 95th percentile, ≥ 95th percentile).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A shift table of Tanner Stages at each postbaseline visit from baseline was provided by prior treatment group, sex, and prior age group. If the assessment within the MAH-sponsored parent protocol determined the participant was at a Tanner Stage 5 or once a participant reached Tanner Stage 5 in the registry study, no further Tanner Pubertal Stage assessments were completed, and the stage was counted as Stage 5 for all the following visits in analyses.

## Secondary Endpoints

The proportion of participants maintaining SVR, proportions of participants with detectable HCV RNA following SVR due to re-emergence of pre-existing virus/development of resistance mutations/re-infection, and proportion of participants with detectable HCV resistance mutations among participants who had not achieved SVR in parent study were summarized based on the plasma HCV RNA and viral sequence analysis results.

## Exploratory Endpoint

The scores from Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) Version 4.0 Short Form (SF-15) were summarized with descriptive statistics at each visit by prior treatment group and prior age group.

## Safety

Safety analyses were based on the Safety Analysis Set and all safety data collected on or after the enrolment through the remainder of the study were included. As there was no study treatment in this study, only AEs related to the required procedures by this study protocol were reported under this study. All deaths, regardless of relatedness to study procedures were recorded when available.

Due to disruption in study conduct as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some assessments were not conducted.

## Results

## Participant flow

- There were 461 participants enrolled in the study.
- o Four hundred twenty-six (92.4%) participants met the eligibility criteria and had available post-Day 1 visit measurements and were included in the FAS and Safety Analysis Sets (the primary analysis sets for endpoint analyses).
- o Thirty-five participants were enrolled, met all the eligibility criteria, but did not have available post-Day 1 visit measurements and thus were excluded from the FAS and Safety Analysis Set.
- Among 426 participants analysed in FAS, 253 (59.4%) participants prematurely discontinued the study, while 173 (40.6%) participants completed the study through Week 240. Of these, 65.9% (58/88 participants) from the SOF+ribavirin (RBV) treatment group, 56.2% (100/178 participants) from the LDV/SOF±RBV treatment group, 10.6% (15/142 participants) from the SOF/VEL treatment group, and 0% (0/18 participants) from the SOF/VEL/VOX treatment group completed the study.
- The most common reason for premature discontinuation from the study was 'Lost to Follow Up' for participants in SOF+RBV (15.9% [14/88 participants]) and LDV/SOF±RBV (28.7% [51/178

participants]) treatment groups, and 'Study Terminated by Sponsor' for participants in the SOF/VEL (48.6% [69/142 participants]) and SOF/VEL/VOX (77.8% [14/18 participants]) treatment groups.

This study is a Postmarketing Requirement (PMR) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SOF and LDV/SOF, which requires at least 3 years of follow-up data for paediatric subjects who were treated with SOF or LDV/SOF. In addition, this study was included in the EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) as a category 'missing information' for SOF, SOF/VEL, and SOF/VEL/VOX. The MAH determined that the scientific objectives of the study would be met when all participants reached 3 years of follow-up as required in the US PMRs for SOF and LDV/SOF or had discontinued early. Consequently, when study closure occurred on 06th January 2023, not all participants had reached up to 5 years of follow-up offered in the study, and clinical sites were instructed to follow the standardized eCRF Completion guidelines to mark the subject completion reason as 'Study Terminated by Sponsor' for these participants. Overall, out of the 426 study participants in the safety analysis set, 302 (70.9%) completed Week 144, or 3 years, of follow-up. The table below shows the total number of participants that reached Week 144 by treatment received in the parent study.

## Assessor's comment:

No major changes from baseline in the weight, BMI or height percentiles were observed during the follow up study. Thus, treatment with DAAs (SOF+RBV, LDV/SOF±RBV, SOF/VEL, SOF/VEL/VOX) does not seem to notably affect long-term growth parameters.

## Secondary endpoints

## Proportion of participants maintaining SVR

Out of 424 participants who had achieved SVR in their parent treatment study, all (100%) participants maintained SVR during this registry study.

Two participants did not achieve SVR in their parent treatment studies and hence, no SVR duration was calculated. Hepatitis C virus sequencing was performed with blood samples collected during this registry study for these 2 participants (both with HCV Genotype 1a) in the FAS who had not achieved SVR in their parent treatment study.

One participant treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks in the parent Study GS-US-337-1116 had the NS5A resistance-associate variant (RAV) Y93H which developed at Week 4 posttreatment. The Y93H RAV was maintained through Week 144. One participant treated with SOF/VEL for 12 weeks in the parent Study GSUS-342-1143 had the NS5A RAV L31V which developed at Week 8 on treatment. The L31V RAV was not detected at Week 24 and Week 48, was detected as a mixture (L31L/V) at Week 72, then not detected at Week 96, 144, and 192. Both participants were tested for the presence of NS5B RAVs during the parent and registry study. No NS5B RAVs were detected in either participant during the parent or registry study at all tested visits.

Table 6 summarizes the SVR duration of participants who achieved SVR in the parent study by treatment group. Overall, the mean (SD) SVR duration was 1359.0 (510.82) days.

Treatment groups are based on the HCV treatment received in the parent Gilead study.

Sustained virologic response duration = last day of registry (for participants who maintained SVR)-SVR12 date in parent study + 1.

Two participants did not achieve SVR in their parent treatment studies and no SVR duration calculated.

All 424 participants who had achieved SVR in parent treatment studies maintained SVR during the registry study.

## Assessor's comment:

Of the 424 participants with SVR24 in the parent study all maintained SVR during the follow up registry study. Two participants did not achieve SVR in the parent study and thus SVR was not calculated for the registry study.

## Exploratory endpoint

Quality of life results

Participant-reported outcomes were assessed using the PedsQL™ Version 4.0 Short Form (SF15). No clinically significant changes were observed from the registry baseline throughout the study.

## Adverse Events

As there was no study treatment in this study, only adverse events (AEs) related to the required procedures by the study protocol were reported under this study. During the registry study, 1 participant experienced a Grade 1 nonserious AE of presyncope that was resolved on the day of onset without any corrective treatment. The AE was considered related to study procedures. No action was taken due to the AE.

Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, and Discontinuations Due to Adverse Event s

No participant experienced a serious adverse event or an AE leading to premature study discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One participant died during the study due to progressive cerebellar glioblastoma and the death was not considered related to study procedures.

## Postmarketing Experience

Based on postmarketing experience to date, the safety profile of SOF, LDV/SOF, SOF/VEL, and SOF/VEL/VOX, in the paediatric population is consistent with their safety profile in adults. No new adverse drug reactions related to SOF, LDV/SOF, SOF/VEL, and SOF/VEL/VOX have been observed in paediatric patients in the postmarketing setting. No postmarketing data are submitted with this application.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This long-term follow up registry assessed safety data of growth and development in paediatric patients previously treated with SOF+RBV, LDV/SOF±RBV, SOF/VEL or SOF/VEL/VOX.

The median (Q1, Q3) of duration on this registry study was 239.1 (179.0, 243.6) weeks for SOF+RBV, 238.6 (142.6, 244.1) weeks for LDV/SOF±RBV, 168.5 (80.1, 193.7) weeks for SOF/VEL, and 143.1 (142.1, 144.0) weeks for SOF/VEL/VOX. No long-term effects of treatment on height, weight, BMI, Tanner pubertal stage, and SF15 scores were observed.

For those participants with SVR in the parent study all maintained SVR during the follow up in the registry.

No clinically significant safety signals have been identified in this long-term follow-up study.
