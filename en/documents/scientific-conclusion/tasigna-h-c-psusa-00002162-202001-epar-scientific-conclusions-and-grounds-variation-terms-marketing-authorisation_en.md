## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nilotinib, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data from spontaneous reports on rhabdomyolysis, a plausible temporal relationship and a plausible mechanism of action by comedication with statins, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between nilotinib and rhabdomyolysis caused by a drug-drug interaction with statins is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nilotinib should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on the adverse reactions cardiac failure, pneumonia, and renal failure from a non-interventional study, the PRAC considers amendment of the frequencies in the product information of nilotinib warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nilotinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nilotinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
