## Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report for the non-interventional imposed PASS final study report for the medicinal product(s) mentioned above, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The observational study and the systematic review/ meta-analysis did not show an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in patients treated with direct-acting antivirals. The DAA-PASS study commitment is considered fulfilled and the respective products should be removed from the list of medicines under additional monitoring.

Therefore, in view of available data regarding the PASS final study report, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for the results of the study for the medicinal product(s) mentioned above, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of these medicinal product(s) is unchanged, subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP is of the opinion that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) of the medicinal product(s) mentioned above should be varied.
