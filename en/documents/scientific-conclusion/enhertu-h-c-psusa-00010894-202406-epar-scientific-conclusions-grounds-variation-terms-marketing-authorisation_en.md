## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for trastuzumab deruxtecan, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on pancytopenia from clinical trials and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between trastuzumab deruxtecan and pancytopenia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing trastuzumab deruxtecan should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trastuzumab deruxtecan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing trastuzumab deruxtecan is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
