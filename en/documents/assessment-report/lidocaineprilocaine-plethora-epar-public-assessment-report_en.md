## Executive summary

Premature ejaculation (PE), also referred to as early (EE) or rapid ejaculation (RE), is generally defined by three essential criteria: brief ejaculatory latency; loss of control; and psychological distress in the patients  and/or  partner  (Althof  et  al.  2010).  According  to  the  American  Psychiatric  Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version IV (DSM-IV TR), PE is described as 'the persistent or recurrent onset of ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration  and  before  the  person  wishes  it.  The  disturbance  must  cause  marked  distress  or interpersonal  difficulty.  The  premature  ejaculation  is  not  due  exclusively  to  the  direct  effects  of  a substance (e.g., withdrawal from opioids)'. PE has two subtypes: lifelong and acquired PE. Lifelong PE is  characterised by early ejaculation at every/or nearly every intercourse with every or nearly every sexual partner from the first sexual encounter onwards, whereas men with acquired PE develop early ejaculation at some point in their life having previously had normal ejaculation experiences (Wespes E et al. 2006).

The approaches to the management of PE have been primarily based on behavioural techniques and pharmacological treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The latter is based on increasing  the  time  it  takes  to  ejaculate  by  preventing  the  neurotransmitter  5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) from being taken back up into nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

In  September 2013, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the authorisation of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora (lidocaine/prilocaine) for the treatment of premature ejaculation in adult men. Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora (also called PSD502, TEMPE) contains the active substances lidocaine and prilocaine, local anaesthetics that act by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses, reducing sensory stimulation. The medicine has been developed as a cutaneous spray solution able to provide rapid-onset topical anaesthesia to the glans penis mucosal surface for the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men.  The recommended dose is 3 actuations applied to cover the glans penis. Each such dose supplies a total of 22.5 mg lidocaine and 7.5 mg prilocaine. A maximum of 3 doses can be used within 24 hours with at least 4 hours between doses.

Clinical  efficacy  of  lidocaine/prilocaine  in  males  with  PE  was  demonstrated  in  two  multi-centre, multinational,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  studies,  both  followed  by  an  open-label phase. In the general population of patients with PE, lidocaine/prilocaine was shown to increase the time  to  achieve  ejaculation  after  penetration  (intra-vaginal  ejaculatory  latency  time  or  IELT,  an indicator  of  pharmacological  activity);  it  also  increased  control  over  ejaculation  and  reduced  the feelings  of  distress  in  patients  with  premature  ejaculation  as  measured  by  the  Index  of  Premature Ejaculation  (IPE).  During  the  3 months  of  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  average  IELT increased  from  0.58  to  3.17 minutes  in  the  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  group  and  from  0.56 to 0.94 minutes  in  the  placebo  group.    The  clinically  significant  increases  in  IELT  were  paralleled  by significant differences in the IPE scores (p &lt;0.0001).

The most common side effects were hypoaesthesia (reduced sensation) and genital burning in both men  and  women,  plus  erectile  dysfunction  in  men  and  headache,  influenza,  nasopharyngitis  and vulvovaginal discomfort in female sexual partners.

Although  the  lidocaine/prilocaine  clinical  development  program  allowed  inclusion  of  males  with  no upper  age  limit,  due  to  the  low  number  of  elderly  subjects  enrolled,  there  are  limited  data  on  the efficacy and safety of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in patients 65 years and over.

The  metabolism  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  results  in  the  formation  of  2,6-xylidine  and otoluidine, respectively, amongst other metabolites. Therefore prilocaine in high doses may cause an increase in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

methaemoglobin  level.  Caution  should  therefore  be  raised  in  patients  with  anaemia,  congenital  or acquired methaemoglobinaemia or patients on concomitant therapy known to produce such conditions.

In  an ex-vivo study  in  rats,  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  was  shown  to  reduce  sperm  motility  and therefore the potential for reduction of sperm motility following clinical use of the medicinal product cannot be excluded.

A  pharmacovigilance  plan  for  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  will  be  implemented  as  part  of  the marketing authorisation. The risk management plan includes an updated drug-utilisation study aimed to characterise real clinical practice and the patients who are prescribed the product.

Lidocaine/Prilocaine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. The Applicant should provide the  study  reports  of  the  experimental  determination  of  the  log  Kow  value  for  both  lidocaine  and prilocaine .

Overall, the efficacy of lidocaine/prilocaine over placebo has been demonstrated. The adverse effect profile of lidocaine/prilocaine for both male subjects and their female partners appears to be benign and manageable and no new safety signals have been observed with lidocaine/prilocaine. Therefore the benefit/risk balance of lidocaine/prilocaine in the treatment of premature ejaculation in adult men is considered positive.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Although there is no clear consensus on the definition of Premature ejaculation (PE), also referred to as early (EE) or rapid ejaculation (RE), it is generally accepted it consists of three essential criteria: brief ejaculatory latency; loss of control; and psychological distress in the patients and/or partner (Althof et al.  2010).  According  to  the  American  Psychiatric  Association's  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mental Disorders, version IV (DSM-IV TR), rapid (premature) ejaculation is defined as 'the persistent or recurrent onset and ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration and  before  the  person  wishes  it.  The  disturbance  must  cause  marked  distress  or  interpersonal difficulty. The premature ejaculation is not due exclusively to the direct effects of a substance (e.g., withdrawal from opioids)'.

PE is the commonest sexual complaint, affecting 30% of sexually active men (Lauman, 1999) to as high  as  66%  in  Germany  (Aschka  et  al.,  2001).  Also  PE  is  self-reported  and  the  obvious  stigma associated  with  it  is  likely  to  lead  to  it  being  underreported.  Furthermore  it  is  important  to  clearly distinguish between PE and Erectile Dysfunction (ED) as they may coexist.

Ejaculation generally occurs because of reflex mechanism initially triggered by stimulation of the penis via  pudendal  sensory  nerves,  with  communication  to  the  spinal  cord  and  the  sensory  cortex.  The secondary reflex is completed after activation of the efferent somatic fibers to the ischiocavernosus and other perineal muscles. The aetiology of PE is however not well understood, with little data to support suggested  biological  and  psychological  hypotheses  (Rowland  et  al.,  1993),  including  anxiety,  penile hypersensitivity (Xin et al., 1997) and serotonin receptor dysfunction.

PE comprises several subtypes; lifelong or acquired PE. Lifelong PE is characterised by early ejaculation at every/or nearly every intercourse with every or nearly every sexual partner from the first sexual encounter onwards. Men with acquired PE develop early ejaculation at some point in their life having previously  had  normal  ejaculation  experiences  (Wespes  E  et  al.  2006).  In  2008  the  International Society  for  Sexual  Medicine  defined  lifelong  PE  as  a  male  sexual  dysfunction  characterised  by '….ejaculation  which  always  or  nearly  always  occurs  prior  to  or  within  about  one  minute  of  vaginal penetration, the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and the presence of negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy' (McMahon et al. 2000).

Acquired PE may be due to sexual performance anxiety, psychological or relationship problems, erectile dysfunction, prostatitis or hyperthyroidism among other causes.  Several psychoactive drugs can cause delayed or retarded ejaculation.

A detailed and complete sexual history should be obtained for all patients for the correct diagnosis to be established. This should be accompanied with a questioning of the patients about frequency and duration of activity required for ejaculation, as well as whether the problem exists with certain types of sexual stimulation versus others. New devices that can stimulate patients to ejaculation may be useful (O'Leary et al., 2001).

The approaches to the management of PE have been primarily based on behavioural techniques and pharmacological treatment (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)).

The  current  available  pharmacological  treatment  for  PE  is  based  on  increasing  the  time  it  takes  to ejaculate by preventing the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) from being taken back up into nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, thereby increasing the amount of serotonin between nerve cells. At the present time, no CHMP scientific guidelines specific for PE are available.

## About the product

Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora also called as PSD502, TEMPE, cutaneous spray, solution is a formulation developed  by  the  applicant  to  provide  rapid  onset  topical  anaesthesia  to  the  glans  penis  mucosal surface for the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  pharmacological  mode  of  action  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is  well  established.  Like  other  local anaesthetics,  they  act  directly  on  nerve  cells  to  block  their  ability  to  transmit  impulses  down  their axons. Lidocaine and prilocaine have similar anaesthetic potency. The molecular targets of both are the voltage-dependent sodium channels of neurons. The drugs bind selectively to the intracellular surface of sodium channels and block the entry of sodium into the cell. The blocking of sodium influx prevents the  depolarisation  necessary  for  action  potential  propagation  and  at  sufficient  concentrations  block impulse  conduction.  Since  binding  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  to  sodium  channels  is  completely reversible, when drug administration is stopped the drug diffuses away. Restoration of active sodium pumping and continued leakage of potassium restores the membrane potential to its polarised state. The membrane potential remains deactivated and refractory to further stimulation for a short period. Eventually nerve function is completely restored (Lagan and McLure, 2004; Becker and Reed, 2006).

Lidocaine  has  a  rapid  onset  of  action  and  anaesthesia  is  obtained  within  a  few  minutes,  with  an intermediate duration of action. Prilocaine has a slower onset of action with slightly longer duration of action  (Martindale  Lidocaine  2012,  Martindale  Prilocaine  2012).  The  combination  of  lidocaine  and prilocaine in PSD502 provides a rapid onset of action. So, application of lidocaine and prilocaine in their base  forms  at  a  pH  of  8.0,  optimises  penetration,  maximising  the  depth  of  neural  blockade  and minimising time to onset of numbness (Henry et al., 2008). Lidocaine and prilocaine, are well known substances that have been used extensively for many years in various formulations, including creams, gels and solutions, which are available over-the-counter or on 'prescription only' depending on their concentration and use.  Lidocaine and prilocaine have been used in anaesthesia for many years, and as such  there  is  considerable  experience  with  these  drugs  in  the  healthcare  industry.    In  addition  to anaesthesia, lidocaine has been widely used in treatment of ventricular arrhythmias.

Lidocaine/prilocaine  cutaneous  spray,  solution  incorporates  a  combination  of  two  active  substances, lidocaine and prilocaine at concentrations of 150 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml respectively.

The combination of lidocaine and prilocaine results in a lowering of the melting point of the mixture in comparison to the melting point of the individual components. As such they co-exist in an appropriate ratio in liquid form at standard temperature and pressure. Both drug substances are readily absorbed through mucous membranes such as the glans penis, but not through normal keratinised skin. The only other constituent of the spray is the propellant 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (also referred to as HFA134a and norflurane), which is a commonly used propellant in pharmaceutical products within the EU.

Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  cutaneous  spray  is  presented  as  a  6.5  ml  filled  in  an  aluminium  spray container  with  metered  valve.  Each  spray  dispenses  50  μL  of  solution  (PSD502  delivers  7.5  mg lidocaine and 2.5 mg prilocaine per metered-dose spray (actuation)) and each dose consists of three spray actuations. After application, the propellant evaporates, leaving a thin layer of the drugs on the glans penis.

## Type of Application and aspects on development

This application is submitted under Article 10b of Directive 2001/83/EC (i.e. fixed combination).

The proposed indication for Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora 150 mg/mL + 50 mg/mL cutaneous spray, solution is treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men.

No formal scientific advice was given by the EMA for this medicinal product.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a cutaneous spray to provide rapid onset  of  topical  anaesthesia  to  the  glans  penis  mucosal  surface  for  the  treatment  of  premature ejaculation in adult men.

The  medicinal  product  is  a  metered-dose  aerosol  spray  that  delivers  a  mixture  of  lidocaine  and prilocaine. It provides a film of local anaesthetic when delivered at the site of application.

Each  actuation  dispenses  7.5  mg  lidocaine  and  2.5  mg  prilocaine  in  their  base  forms.  The  active substances  are  mixed  in  a  3:1  ratio  and  have  a  pKa  that  is  favourable  for  the  absorption  through mucous membranes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  only  excipient  present  in  the  formulation  is  the  propellant  1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane,  which evaporates  at  the  site  of  application  following  actuation.  Tetrafluoroethane  is  a  well-established, commercially available, non-flammable, non-CFC propellant. This excipient is used as both a propellant and solvent, eliminating the requirement for additional surfactants or vehicles.

The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing.

The primary packaging is an aerosol can with a valve, dip tube, button actuator collar and dust cap. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Compatibility  studies  were  performed  with  a  wide  range  of  materials that  are  used  in  contraceptive devices  currently  on  the  EU  market  (male  condom,  cervical  cap,  the  diaphragm  and  the  female condom). Deterioriation was observed when Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora was used with polyurethane-based female and male condoms.  A statement is included in the package leaflet that polyurethane-based barrier contraceptives do not provide effective contraception when lidocaine/prilocaine cutaneous spray is used.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: (1) mixing, (2) filling, (3) additional filling with tetrafluoroethane  and  (4)  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing process.

The major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this cutaneous spray.

## Product specification

The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  include  tests  for  appearance  (visual  inspection), identification of lidocaine (HPLC, TLC), identification of prilocaine (HPLC, TLC), assay of lidocaine and of prilocaine  (HPLC),  dose  content  uniformity  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  delivered  dose  (HPLC),  impurities (HPLC),  mean  content  delivered  per  dose  (HPLC),  number  of  expelled  actuations  (shot  counting), moisture (Karl Fisher), leakage rate (weight check) and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.).

Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  five  production  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability  data  of  four  production  scale  batches  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for  36  months  at 25ºC/60%RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75%RH according to the ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  lidocaine/prilocaine  cutaneous  spray  are  identical  to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested for all parameters as stated in the finished product specification.

Testing was performed with the finished product in the upright position with reduced testing performed in an inverted position to provide information on the effect of the orientation. The analytical methods

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

used  in  stability  study  are  identical  to  those  used  in  the  release  of  drug  product  and  therefore  no further validation studies were necessary. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.

In addition, a freeze/thaw study was conducted on two batches and a temperature excursion study was performed on one batch of lidocaine/prilocaine cutaneous spray. Forced degradation studies were also performed on one batch and in-use stability studies were performed on two batches of lidocaine/prilocaine cutaneous spray. The temperature excursion study was performed to evaluate the effect of storage in extreme temperature conditions (60°C) for 7 days. The significant change was in the  leakage  rate,  however,  as  a  worst-case  scenario,  if  the  drug  product  was  stored  at  60°C  for  3 weeks,  approximately  161  mg  will  be  lost,  which  is  less  than  3  actuations.  If  the  drug  product  is inadvertently exposed to temperatures up to 60°C for two days, no adverse effects are anticipated. The forced degradation study demonstrated that oxidation is the only stressed condition that results in significant  degradation  of  the  drug  product  and  drug  substances.  The  results  of  the  in-use  study support an in-use shelf life of 12 weeks.

Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The majority of the studies have been conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The  non-GLP  studies  generally  were  conducted  in  a  GLP  compliant  facility  and  the  practices  and procedures adopted during their conduct were consistent with the OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice.  In  this  assessment  report,  CHMP/ICH  Non-clinical  Guidelines  have  been  considered,  and mainly  ICH  Topic  M3  (R2):  Nonclinical  Safety  Studies  for  the  Conduct  of  Human  Clinical  Trials  and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/286/95),  Note  for guidance on safety pharmacology  studies  for  human  pharmaceuticals  CPMP/ICH/539/00  (ICH  topic  S7A),  ICH  M  4S, common  technical  document  for  the  registration  of  pharmaceuticals  for  human  use  -  Safety (CPMP/ICH/2887/99-Safety),  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  detection  of  toxicity  to  reproduction  for medicinal products &amp; Toxicology to male fertility (CPMP/ICH/386/95), Note for Guidance on the need for  carcinogenicity  studies  of  pharmaceuticals  (CPMP/ICH/140/95  (ICH  topic  S1A)),  Non-clinical development of fixed  combination  of  medicinal  products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/05),  Non-clinical documentation for mixed marketing authorisation applications (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/799/95) and Environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora, also called PSD502, TEMPE, is a cutaneous spray formulation developed by Plethora Solutions Ltd. to provide rapid onset topical anaesthesia to the glans penis mucosal surface for the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men. The local anaesthetic effects reduce penile  sensitivity  and  so  increase  ejaculatory  latency  time.  PSD502  contains  the  drug  substances lidocaine  and  prilocaine  at  concentrations  of  150  mg/ml  and  50  mg/ml  respectively,  dissolved  in 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.  This,  also  referred  to  as  HFA-134a  and  norflurane,  is  a  commonly  used propellant in pharmaceutical products within the EU.

The  pharmacological  mode  of  action  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is  well  established.  Like  other  local anaesthetics,  they  act  directly  on  nerve  cells  to  block  their  ability  to  transmit  impulses  down  their axons. Lidocaine and prilocaine have similar anaesthetic potency. The molecular targets of both are the voltage-dependent sodium channels of neurons. The drugs bind selectively to the intracellular surface of sodium channels and block the entry of sodium into the cell. The blocking of sodium influx prevents the  depolarisation  necessary  for  action  potential  propagation  and  at  sufficient  concentrations  block impulse  conduction.  Since  binding  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  to  sodium  channels  is  completely reversible, when drug administration is stopped the drug diffuses away. Restoration of active sodium pumping and continued leakage of potassium restores the membrane potential to its polarised state. The membrane potential remains deactivated and refractory to further stimulation for a short period. Eventually nerve function is completely restored (Lagan and McLure, 2004; Becker and Reed, 2006).

Lidocaine  has  a  rapid  onset  of  action  and  anaesthesia  is  obtained  within  a  few  minutes,  with  an intermediate duration of action. Prilocaine has a slower onset of action with slightly longer duration of action  (Martindale  Lidocaine  2012,  Martindale  Prilocaine  2012).  The  combination  of  lidocaine  and prilocaine in PSD502 provides a rapid onset of action. So, application of lidocaine and prilocaine in their base  forms  at  a  pH  of  8.0,  optimises  penetration,  maximising  the  depth  of  neural  blockade  and minimising time to onset of numbness (Henry et al ., 2008).

Non-clinical  evaluation  of  the  pharmacology  of  PSD502  has  not  been  submitted;  however,  the Applicant has made reference to the clinical data which demonstrate that use of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora increases the latency time to ejaculation.

Likewise,  the  Applicant  has  not  submitted  a  detailed  secondary  pharmacodynamics  assessment. However, the nonclinical overview indicates that lidocaine is a class 1b antiarrhythmic agent used in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, while prilocaine is used for infiltration anaesthesia and nerve block in dental procedures and that carbonated solutions of prilocaine have been tried in epidural and brachial plexus nerve blocks (Hardman et al . 1996; Martindale Prilocaine 2012, respectively).

Similarly, the pharmacodynamics written summary states that Safety pharmacology is not applicable but the nonclinical overview summarized the effects of prilocaine and lidocaine on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems, as they are reported in the literature (Martindale Lidocaine, 2012; Gold et al. ,  1998;  Kanai et  al .,  1998;  Cousins  and  Mather,  1980;  Conklin,  1987;  Copeland et  al., 2008; Hardman et al ., 1996; Martindale Prilocaine 2012; EMLA Product Monograph 2010.).

Likewise, pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have not been submitted.

In the absence of non-clinical data, the Applicant has provided clinical data in order to support efficacy (and demonstrate the pharmacological properties) of the proposed product. Application of PSD502 was shown to increase the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and also improve a number of other indices for premature ejaculation such as Patient Reported Outcome.

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

No  new  pharmacology  studies  have  been  conducted  because  the  drug  substances,  lidocaine  and prilocaine, are well established. This is agreed by the CHMP.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted. This is agreed by the CHMP.

## Safety pharmacology programme

No safety pharmacology studies have been submitted. This is agreed by the CHMP.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been submitted. This is agreed by the CHMP.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

No non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with PSD502 by the Applicant. However, the  analytical  methods  used  to  determine  plasma  levels  of  lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  their  respective metabolites,  2,6-xylidine  and  ó-toluidine  in  the  toxicokinetic  studies  have  been  established  and validated by five analytical methods, using HPLC/UV and LC-MS/MS techniques. These analyses were performed using plasma samples of mice and rats, and were validated in the range of 0.50-500 ng/mL for lidocaine and prilocaine and in the range of 1-1000 ng/mL for 2,6-xylidine and for ó-toluidine in rat plasma, and in the range 10-10000 ng/mL for ó-toluidine in mouse plasma.

Distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  as  well  as  pharmacokinetic  drug  studies  have  not  been performed with PSD502. The pharmacokinetics of lidocaine  and  prilocaine  has  been  reported  in  the literature (Fransson et al., 2002; Weiland et al., 2006; Ko et al., 2007; Ko et al., 2008; Rolsted et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2007; Gazarian et al., 1995; Akerman et al., 1966; Integrated Laboratory Systems 2000) and product package inserts (EMLA, 1999)).

Absorption  parameters  for  PSD502,  after  topical  application  in  rats,  have  been  presented  by  the Applicant in the Study Report Nº 459135(29516) and 459140(30745). Also plasma levels of lidocaine and  prilocaine  and  their  metabolites  were  determined  in  a  vaginal  application  study  in  which  the maximum feasible dose of PSD502 was applied (Study Report Nº 519010(32378). The results of these pharmacokinetics studies of absorption indicate that all analytes were presented in all treated animals, with  a  concentration  of  lidocaine  about  3  times  higher  than  prilocaine,  and  similar  levels  of  both metabolites  across  the  treated  groups.  Systemic  exposure  to  lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  2,6-xylidine increased in a dose- proportional manner while the increases in systemic exposure to ó-toluidine were slightly supra-proportional.

Sex-related differences in systemic exposure to 2,6-xylidine and ó-toluidine were observed when the metabolites  were  assayed  alone  after  oral  treatment,  whereby  the  exposure  was  greater  in  males compared  with  females,  indicating  possible  physiological  and/or  metabolic  differences  between  the sexes. However, in the study where the systemic exposure of lidocaine, prilocaine, 2, 6-xylidine and ótoluidine was evaluated after topical administration, no clear sex differences were apparent.

For  lidocaine,  the  primary  route  of  metabolism  in  the  rat  is  via  hydroxylation,  with  preferential hydroxylation at the 3-carbon. The metabolism of prilocaine is primarily due to the hydrolysis of the amide bond forming o toluidine instead of 2,6 xylidine and in man, the primary urinary metabolite is phydroxytoluidine (34%  of dose), followed by o-hydroxytoluidine (2.7%) and ó-toluidine. The metabolism of both of  the  active  substances  does  not  appear  to  be  different  when  administered  in combination.  It  is  noted  that  the  lidocaine  metabolite  2,6  xylidine  and  the  prilocaine  metabolite,  ó-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

toluidine  which  present  safety  concerns  such  as  the  formation  of  methaemoglobin,  have  not  been classified as major metabolites in man.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

The toxicology of both lidocaine and prilocaine, as well as their metabolites, is well known and it is well documented in the scientific literature (de Jong and Bonin, 1980; Akerman et al., 1966; Rosenberg et al.,  1993;  Hofman  et  al.,  1977;  Feldman  et  al.,  1989;  Munson  et  al.,  1975;  Martindale  Lidocaine Martindale Prilocaine, 2012; Vasters et al., 2006; EMLA® Product Monograph 2010, EMLA SPC 2011). Also the toxicity of lidocaine has been tested in Hazardous Substances Data Bank, 2012, in which there are not acute toxicity values for prilocaine.

It  is  known  that  the  topical  application  of  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is  associated  with  irritation, conjunctival hyperaemia, swelling, fluid and exudate discharge and iris reaction. The lidocaine can have serious  effects  on  the  central  nervous  and  cardiovascular  systems.  An  overdosage  of  lidocaine  can result in severe hypotension, asystole, bradycardia, apnoea, seizures, coma, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and death. Meanwhile prilocaine has a low systemic toxicity mainly because of high absorption in the lung and a large volume of distribution and thus is associated with a lower risk of neurological or cardiac side-effects, although its major disadvantage is the formation of methaemoglobin by two of its metabolites,  4-hydroxy-2-methylaniline  and  2-methylaniline  (ó-toluidine).  Methaemoglobinaemia  has been noted after i.v. administration of lidocaine.

## Single dose toxicity

No studies on the single-dose toxicity of PSD502 have been conducted. The lack of single dose toxicity studies  is  not  a  concern  to  the  CHMP.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  has  provided  several  bibliographical references  to  explain  the  acute  toxicity  in  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine,  and  their  respectively metabolites,  2,6-xylidine  and  σ-toluidine,  intraperitoneal  and  intravenously  administered  and  after topical application (de Jong and Bonin, 1980; Akerman et al., 1966; Rosenberg et al., 1993; Hofman et al., 1977; Feldman et al., 1989; Munson et al., 1975; Martindale Lidocaine Martindale Prilocaine, 2012; Vasters et al., 2006; EMLA Product Monograph 2010, EMLA SPC 2011). As well the acute toxicity of lidocaine  has  been  tested  in  Hazardous  Substances  Data  Bank,  2012,  in  which  there  are  not  acute toxicity values for prilocaine.

Acute toxicity values for prilocaine are not available from the Hazardous Substances Data Bank, 2012. Median  convulsant  (CD50)  and  median  lethal  (LD50)  doses  of  lidocaine  following  intraperitoneal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

injection were determined in adult mice; the CD50 was 111.0 mg/kg and the LD50 1331.1 mg/kg (de Jong and Bonin 1980).

In studies in mice, twice the dose of intraperitoneal prilocaine was required than with lidocaine (200 mg/kg prilocaine vs. 100 mg/kg lidocaine) to cause convulsions (Akerman et al. 1966). The prilocaine concentration in the brain was about three times higher than that for lidocaine when the convulsions appeared  (prilocaine  115.6  ±  14.6  μg/g  and  lidocaine  43.1  ±  2.8  μg/g).  The  convulsions  following prilocaine injection lasted 5 minutes less than those for lidocaine, starting later and ending earlier than those following lidocaine injections.

The CNS and CVS toxicity of intravenously administered 0.5% prilocaine was investigated in slightly anaesthetized rats. Arterial blood pressure, ECG and EEG were continuously monitored. The mean dose of prilocaine producing asystole was 166 mg/kg, arrhythmias did not appear until just before asystole. Seizure activity on the EEG occurred at a prilocaine dose of 53 mg/kg (Rosenberg et al. 1993).

Threshold convulsive doses following intermittently infused lidocaine hydrochloride were established in mongrel dogs for each of three distinct and predictable seizure patterns. The first seizure activity was tonic extension which occurred at an infused lidocaine dose of 12.2 ± 0.6 mg/kg, followed by running activity after 22.7 ± 0.9 mg/kg lidocaine. The threshold for intermittent tonic-clonic seizures occurred at an infused dose of 33.3 ± 1.5 mg/kg (Hofman et al. 1977).

In another study in dogs, lidocaine was infused intravenously at a rate of 8 mg/kg/min until seizures occurred.  The  average  dose  at  seizure  onset  was  20.8  ±  4.0  mg/kg  and  with  an  arterial  plasma concentration of 47.2 ± 5.4 μg/mL (Feldman et al. 1989).

The CNS toxicity of lidocaine and prilocaine was studied during constant rate intravenous infusion in rhesus monkeys. Drug effects were compared by determination of drug dosage and arterial plasma concentration that induced behavioural and electrical seizure activity.  Mean  (±  SD)  seizure  dosages were: lidocaine 14.2 ± 3.2 mg/kg and prilocaine 18.1 ± 3.2 mg/kg and corresponding plasma levels were lidocaine 24.5 ± 4.4 μg/mL and prilocaine 20.5 ± 4.2 μg/mL (Munson et al. 1975).

## Repeat dose toxicity

The  Applicant has  submitted  several  repeat-dose  toxicity studies conducted  in  rats with the combination  as  required  by  the  Guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combination  of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). Also 3 repeat-dose oral toxicity studies with the metabolites of lidocaine and prilocaine, 2,6-xylidine and σ -toluidine hydrochloride, respectively, have been done.

In most of these studies, the Applicant has provided the exposures to the metabolites 2,6-xylidine and σ -toluidine (which are considered to be carcinogenic in rats and most likely carcinogenic in human), and has discussed how the exposure compare to that observed in humans.

In the study 459135 , male and female rats were dosed with PSD502 by topical administration during 7 days. Clinical signs and general appearance were checked twice daily; body weights were recorded pre-trial and daily and food consumption was recorded pre-trial and three times during the treatment period. Also, necropsy for each animal was performed on day 7 and selected tissues collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered solution.

On day 3, the group 4 dose level had to be reduced from 600 to 480 mg/day since the treatment had exceeded the maximum possible dose due the amount of solution on the dose site. Two females in high dose group died on Day 5 of treatment; necropsy did not demonstrate any effects due to treatment. However the remaining females in this group showed many brown scabs on the dorsal area of the skin.

Males and females rats were also treated with PSD502 daily for 28 days in other pivotal study, study 459140 . Clinical signs, bodyweight, food consumption and skin assessments were monitored. Also, all animals were subjected to a necropsy examination after completion of the 28 day treatment period and tissues were evaluated histologically. Although the uterus weight in females treated at 1 and 4 mg/day were noted to be statistically significant higher when compared with their control, due to the lack of a dose related response and no histological findings this was considered not to be related to treatment with  PSD502.  In  the  same  way  the  brain  weight  in  females  treated  at  1  mg/day  was  noted  to  be moderately statistically significant but as this was not seen in the absolute values or the higher dose levels, and no histological findings were noted, this was also considered to be incidental to treatment with PSD502.

In addition, samples of the dermal application site (skin), liver, urinary bladder and nasal mucosa at termination were taken for DNA adducts analyses which were not conducted under GLP conditions, but these analyses at The New York Medical Center was approved by the UK MHRA. The results are shown in the following table 3.

As is shown in table 3, only samples taken from the nasal mucosa had detectable DNA adducts, seen also at the 1 and 4 mg/day groups, and demonstrated that DNA adducts derived from lidocaine can be detected  following  topical  application  of  relatively  high  doses  of  PSD502  to  the  rat.  DNA  adducts derived from prilocaine could not be detected under identical conditions.

Also, haemoglobin was extracted from red cell fraction samples and analysed for 2,6-xylidine and ο -toluidine adduct formation.

As it is seen in the table 4, dose related increases in 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine haemoglobin adducts in all groups, and the increases in the lower doses, 1 and 4 mg/day, were approximately proportional to their doses. Low levels of σ-toluidine adducts were present in the pre-dosing haemoglobin samples.

In  the  repeat  dose toxicity  study 518457 also performed in rats during 14 days, the animals were treated with 100 μL/dose of PSD502 into the vagina as 0.9, 3.5, 40 and 134 mg/day. No adverse signs were noted for animals that received 0.9 or 3.5 mg/day of PSD502 and these animals were re-assigned and treated as 80 and 60 mg/day, respectively. There were 4 unscheduled deaths: 1 animal at 80 mg/day group and all 3 animals at 134 mg/day group on the first day of treatment. Adverse signs in these animals included cold to touch, a clear discharge from the nose and vagina, crackling, slow or gasping breathing, a swollen head and staggering, but no abnormal necropsy findings were noted in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the 3 animals that received 134 mg. However, dark liver and reddened fat and blood vessels attached to the uterus were observed in the euthanized animal of 80 mg/day group, and 1 animal that received 60 mg/day for 14 days had reddened vaginal mucosa. So, for a 28 day dosing period to the vaginal tissue of rats, a dosage of no more than 60 mg/day of PSD502 would be considered suitable.

In the other toxicity study in rats with vaginal administration for 28 consecutive days, study 519010 , female rats were administered with 100 μL/dose of PSD502 as 0, 30 and 60 mg/day. All animals were examined  for  reaction  to  treatment,  and  food  consumption  and  body  weights  were  recorded  twice weekly. Also, following dosing on Day 1 and Day 28, blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic analysis  for  lidocaine,  prilocaine,  and  their  respective  metabolites.  At  the  end  of  the  treatment,  a necropsy was performed and the vagina, uterus and ovaries were examined histologically.

Also in this study, tissues were collected to perform DNA adducts analysis. The analyses indicated that very  low  levels  of  2,6-xylidine  and οtoluidine  DNA  adducts,  in  the  order  of  &lt;2  in  10 8   normal nucleotides, were noted in all groups. There was evidence of a dose-relationship with increasing levels of adducts with increasing dosages. The average value expressed as DNA adducts in 10 9  is shown in table 5.

In the tolerance study 521983 ,  also performed during 28 day in rats with vaginal administration of PSD502, the animals were treated at doses of 0, 0.2, 0.6 and 2 mg/day. Clinical observations, body weights and food consumption were recorded. Gross necropsy findings, organ weights and histopathological examinations were also evaluated.

No  unscheduled  deaths  and  no  evidence  of  systemic  toxicity  were  found  in  this  study.  No  gross necropsy or histological findings were considered to be related to treatment with PSD502.

The toxicity of 2,6-xylidine and of σ-toluidine hydrochloride were addressed in three studies performed in  rats  and  mice.  In  the  study 459114 ,  males  and  females  mice  were  fed  with  diets  containing  σtoluidine hydrochloride for a period of up to 14 days. The dietary route of administration was selected for this study as this was the route used in a previously published study conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI-CG-TR-153) and the doses were calculated to be 300 ppm (56.9 mg/kg/day), 1000 ppm (239.6 mg/kg/day) and 3000 ppm (668.6 mg/kg/day). In this study, no adverse effects were reported.

In the some way, the toxicology of σ-toluidine hydrochloride was also evaluated during 14 days in rats (study 459109) , where the dietary route of administration was also selected taking into account the previously  published  study  (NCI-CG-TR-153).  The  treatment  of  σ  -toluidine  hydrochloride  at  1000, 3000  and  6000  ppm  resulted  in  the  likely  intake  of  92.6,  264.7  and  501.3  mg  σ-toluidine hydrochloride/kg/day for males, and 84.7, 231.1 and 438.9 mg σ -toluidine hydrochloride/kg/day for females. No adverse clinical observations were reported in this study.

On the other  hand, in the study 459093 ,  male  and  female  rats  were  fed  with  diet  containing  2,6xylidine for a period of up to 14 days. The dose levels were chosen to be the same as those used in a previous carcinogenicity study conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NIH Publication No. 902534) and they were calculated to  be  300  ppm  (25  mg/kg/day),  1000  ppm  (75.5  mg/kg/day)  and 3000  ppm  (228.5  mg/kg/day).  The  observed  effects  were  reduced  body  weight  gain  and  food consumption except in the 300 ppm group males. No adverse clinical observations were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the literature studies provided, the topical application of both lidocaine and prilocaine is related with irritation, conjunctival hyperaemia, swelling, fluid and exudate discharge and iris reaction.

The  most  serious  effects  of  lidocaine  intoxication  are  on  the  CNS  and  cardiovascular  system  and overdosage can result in severe hypotension, asystole, bradycardia, apnoea, seizures, coma, cardiac arrest,  respiratory  arrest,  and  death.  Also  it  is  reported  that  prilocaine  has  a  low  systemic  toxicity mainly  because  of  a  high  absorption  in  the  lung  and  a  large  volume  of  distribution  and  thus  is associated with a lower risk of neurological or cardiac side-effects, although its major disadvantage is the formation of methaemoglobin  by  2  of  its metabolites, 4-hydroxy-2-methylaniline  and  2methylaniline (σ-toluidine). Methaemoglobinaemia has been noted after i.v. administration of lidocaine.

## Genotoxicity

The genotoxic potential of PSD502 was not studied but no special concerns were identified with the individual molecules (lidocaine and prilocaine separately). However, there is evidence to suggest that the  metabolites  σ-toluidine  is  considered  as  a  mutagen  and  2,6-xylidine  has  genotoxic  effects  in mammalian cells, in mouse lymphoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells and BALB/c-3T3 cells.

## Carcinogenicity

As the carcinogenic potential of 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine is well-known, the Applicant has performed additional studies, which aim to bridge the existing carcinogenic data.

## Long-term studies

No long-term studies on the carcinogenicity of PSD502 have been conducted. The lack of long-term studies on the carcinogenicity of PSD502 is acceptable, since any potential carcinogenicity is due to the formation of the metabolites of lidocaine and prilocaine respectively; 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine which are  classified  by  the  IARC  as  probably  carcinogenic  for  humans  and  are  addressed  in  bibliographic references provided (Studies NTP TR 278 and NCI-CG-TR-153), performed during 104 weeks. So, at high  dose  (3000  ppm)  of  2,6-xylidine,  a  significant  increase  of  the  incidences  of  papillomas  and carcinomas of the nasal cavity was found in both male and female rats, and malignant mesenchymal tumours,  rhabdomyosarcoma,  were  also  observed  in  the  nasal  cavity.  In  addition,  the  increased incidences  of  subcutaneous  fibromas  and  fibrosarcomas  in  male  and  female  rats  and  of  neoplastic nodules of the liver in female rats may have been related to the administration of 2,6-xylidine. In the other study, the rats dosed at 3000 and 6000 ppm with σ-toluidine showed several types of sarcomas of the spleen and other organs in both males and females, mesotheliomas of the abdominal cavity or scrotum  in  males,  transitional-cell  carcinomas  of  the  urinary  bladder  in  females  and  an  increased incidence of fibromas of the subcutaneous tissue in the males and fibroadenomas or adenomas of the mammary gland in the females. Also in this study, mice administered with 1000 and 3000 ppm with σtoluidine  presented  haemangiosarcomas  at  various  sites  in  males,  and  hepatocellular  carcinomas  or adenomas were induced in females.

## Short or medium-term studies

The  potential  for  vaginal  and  cervical  carcinogenicity  of  PSD502  was  investigated  by  histological examination  and  DNA  adducts  formation  in  vaginal  and  cervical  tissue  in  the  28  days  repeat-dose toxicity study (Study No 519010) performed in female rats. The results of this study are shown in table 5.

Since  the  published  studies  on  carcinogenicity  of  2,6-xylidine  and  σ-toluidine  have  no  toxicokinetic data, three studies have been performed: 14 day dietary toxicokinetic study with 2,6-xylidine in the rat.(Study  Number  459093),  14  day  dietary  toxicokinetic  study  with  o-toluidine  in  the  rat  (Study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Number 459109) and 14 day dietary toxicokinetic study with o-toluidine in the mouse (Study Number 459114).

The three studies, studies number 459114, 459093 and 459109, performed by the Applicant complete the published carcinogenic data of 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine.

The results from the repeat-dose study 519010 show that DNA adducts are formed in all three genital tract tissues (uterus, cervix and vagina), in a dose proportional manner, when PSD502 was dosed at 30 and 60 mg/day for 28 days. Although the presence of DNA adducts are markers of DNA exposure to metabolites and the Applicant states that the generation of DNA adducts from the topical application of PSD502 in clinical use will be limited, it can be not discarded an increased in the formation of DNA adducts since PSD502 will be used in an intermittent but chronic clinical use.

## Other studies

No  other  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  submitted,  there  is  not  a  concern  of  the  lack  of  other carcinogenicity studies.

## Reproduction toxicity

Since  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  are  well  established  products,  aspects  with  respect  to  potential effects on reproduction and embryofoetal development are based upon data from the literature. In line with the 'Guideline on Non-clinical development of fixed combination of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/05)'  and  'Guideline  on  Non-clinical  documentation  for  mixed  marketing authorisation  applications  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/799/95)'  no  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity study has been conducted with PSD502. Besides, no major findings in reproductive organs have been observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. The reproductive and teratogenic effects of both lidocaine and prilocaine  have  been studied  in  mice,  rats  and  rabbits  dosed  subcutaneous,  intraperitoneal  and with osmotic mini-pumps (EMEA, 1999; Fujinaga, 1998; Martin and Jurand, 1992; Xylocaine, 2004; Wiedling,  1965;  Fujinaga  and  Mazze,  1986).  It  is  known  that  a  1:1  w/w  mixture  of  lidocaine HCl/prilocaine HCl in doses up to 40 + 40 mg/kg after subcutaneous administration in rats does not affect organogenesis or early foetal development (EMLA ®  Product Monograph, 2010). Also it is known that both lidocaine and prilocaine cross the placenta and blood-brain barrier and they are distributed into breast milk (Naguib et al., 1998; Martindale Lidocaine, 2012; Martindale Prilocaine, 2012).

Ex vivo study have been performed in order to determine the effects of the proposed product on rat sperm  motility  (study  number  495000).  In  this  study,  the  sperm  of  5  sexually  mature  rats  was collected from the epididymis and suspended in 0.2% BSA in Medium 199. PSD502 was sprayed into microcentrifuge tubes from preformulated spray canisters which delivered 7.5 mg lidocaine and 2.5 mg prilocaine per actuation and, after the evaporation of the HFA 134a propellant, 400 μL of 0.2% BSA in Medium 199 was added. This mixed was added to 100 ml of the suspension of the sperm and then was evaluated for motility using a computerised sperm motility analyser. The results are shown below, in table 6.

The results  shown PSD502 has a negative effect on sperm motility but at concentrations far higher than in clinical use.

With regards to the adverse effects on pregnancy rate, the Applicant elaborated that the sperm after the  ejaculation  could  be  exposed  to  a  maximum  of  approximately  10.5  mg  lidocaine  and  3.5  mg prilocaine (14 mg PSD502). Besides, after the ejaculation, the sperm is propelled towards the cervix, away from the area of the glans penis where any remaining PSD502 is likely to be concentrated in vaginal secretions. Therefore, it is suggested that sperm involved in fertilisation may not interact with lidocaine or prilocaine in the vaginal cavity following clinical use of PSD502.

In  the  same way, the applicant has submitted bibliographic references which have reported that no adverse effects on human sperm motility were observed (Bennett et al. 1992,).

Also, in the clinical trials in female partners, the ejaculated sperm has not been exposed to lidocaine and prilocaine metabolites in the vagina, and effects on the sperm that could subsequently affect the embryo or offspring should not occur.

## Toxicokinetic data

The toxicokinetic studies have been conducted as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and mice to assess the systemic exposure to the lidocaine, prilocaine and their metabolites, 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine.

Two  female  rats  were  found  dead  in  the  group  dosed  at  600/480  mg/day  with  PSD502  topically administered  in  the  study  Nº  459135  and  one  female  rat  in  the  group  dosed  at  30  mg/day  with PSD502 administered by intravaginal route in the study Nº 519010. According to the results of study Nº 459135, the company considered that the dose of 40 mg/day was appropriate for the main dermal study, 28 Day local tolerance dermal study (Nº 30745), and that this dose was 427 times the proposed clinical dose to male patients on an mg/kg basis.

On  other  hand,  in  the  two  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  following  the  topical  administration  (Nº 518457 and Nº 519010), a maximum volume of PSD502 was introduced into the vaginas of the rats to investigate the formation of DNA adducts in the vagina and cervix. Thus the PSD502 doses were very large both on mg/kg basis and based on the local concentration of PSD502 and the observed mortality, these findings are not relevant to female partners of treated patients.

## Local tolerance

The local tolerance of PSD502 (at 4 to 160 mg/kg/day) has been assessed in a 28 day repeated dose toxicity study after the dermal application of the drug to rats (study Nº 459140).

The topical use of the product was associated with mild/moderate desquamation, signs of erythema and eschar; however, the applied doses were higher than those proposed clinically and there were no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

signs of antigenicity or immunotoxicity. No further studies to address the local tolerance of PSD502 were needed.

## Other toxicity studies

No other toxicity studies have been realized with PSD502, and this is not regarded as of concern by the CHMP.

## Antigenicity

No antigenicity studies with PSD502 have been conducted in experimental animals, this is regarded as acceptable and supported by the fact that no signs of antigenicity have been found in the repeat-dose toxicity studies.

## Immunotoxicity

Immunotoxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  PSD502  because  of  the  previous  clinical experience with the PSD502 drug substances individually; this is regarded as acceptable and supported by the fact that no signs of immunotoxicity have been found in the repeat-dose toxicity studies.

## Dependence

No  studies  on  dependence  have  been  carried  out  with  PSD502  because  of  the  previous  clinical experience with the PSD502 drug substances individually, this was accepted.

## Metabolites

The metabolites of toxicological relevance, 2,6-xylidine and ο -toluidine have been addressed, and no further studies are needed to characterise the metabolites.

## Studies on impurities

Only one impurity, named PGAK-1, was present at 25  o C in the PDS502 formulation and it has been further characterised. There are no further concerns to be raised from the nonclinical viewpoint.

## Other studies

No other studies have been realized with PSD502, and this is not regarded as of concern by the CHMP.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In accordance with the EMEA 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)', an environmental risk assessment has been performed for  PSD502.  The  octanol/water  partition  coefficient,  log  Kow,  is  2.26  for  lidocaine  and  2.11  for prilocaine, according to Hansch 1995. Since both values are below 4.5, an assessment for Persistence, Bioaccumulation  and  Toxicity,  in  accordance  with  the  Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorisation  and Restriction  of  Chemicals  (REACH)  'Guidance  on  information  requirements  and  chemical  safety assessment'  (ECHA,  2008)  is  not  required.  In  line  with  the  Guideline  'Questions  and  answer  on Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010)' a calculated value of Log Kow is generally not acceptable and has to be determined experimentally.

Also,  the  predicted  environmental  concentration  in  the  surface  water  (PECsw)  has  been  calculated roughly according to the applicable guideline. So, the PECsw for lidocaine was 0.0052 microg/L and for prilocaine was 0.0017 microg/L. The Applicant has used a refine Fpen that is acceptable in accordance with the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 and EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 guidelines. As the PECsw values are below of 0.01 microg/L, a phase II assessment has not to be performed.

Lidocaine/Prilocaine  PEC surfacewater  value  is  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01 µ g/L.  and  is  not  a  PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5.

Therefore Lidocaine/Prilocaine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

The applicant should provide the study reports of the experimental determination of the log Kow value for both lidocaine and prilocaine .

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The lack of secondary pharmacodynamics and pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies is not an issue,  however a justification for the absence of such data should have been provided. Although no new  safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  and  bibliographical  references  have  been submitted,  a  summary  of  the  effects  in  the  central  nervous,  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  system should have been provided in the pharmacodynamics written summary as it is written in the nonclinical overview.

The Applicant has not performed any distribution, metabolism and excretion or pharmacokinetic drug studies with PSD502 and the majority of the pharmacokinetic aspects of this application were therefore based upon data from the literature. On the other hand, the Applicant has discussed the potential for pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  when  administered  with  other  locally  or  systemically  applied medicinal products.

The Applicant has submitted repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with PSD502 which is in line with the Guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed combination of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  In  one  of  these  studies,  study  459135,  a  pilot  study,  2  females treated  with  600/480  mg/day of  PSD502 by dermal route were found dead on day 5 of treatment. Another  2  deaths  have  also  occurred  in  two  intravaginal  studies  following  the  topical  application  of PSD502.

The Applicant states that in this dermal study, the appropriate dose is 40 mg/kg which is estimated to be 427 times the proposed clinical dose. In the same way, in the intravaginal studies, a maximum volume of PSD502 was introduced into the vaginas of the rats to investigate the formation of DNA adducts in the vagina and cervix. Thus the PSD502 doses were very large both on mg/kg basis and a local concentration basis and the deaths in the studies do not have clinical relevance to female partners of treated patients.

Lidocaine was not considered to be mutagenic in a wide range of genotoxicity studies and prilocaine was not considered to be mutagenic but induced homologous recombination in a very sensitive assay

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and this was considered to be the result of an aberrant genetic repair mechanism. Overall, the data available suggest that the active substances could be genotoxic by way of their metabolites. Exposure to  2,6-xylidine  and  ó-toluidine  following  the  proposed  clinical  use  of  PSD502  in  men  and  female partners will be very low and intermittent allowing normal genetic repair mechanisms to operate and preventing the formation of permanent genetic defects.

The  data  generated  in  order  to  bridge  the  pre-existing  carcinogenicity  studies  from  the  literature suggest that the exposures of 2,6 xylidine causing nasal adenomas in a 2-year rat study were 200-fold higher  than  that  observed  clinically  following  exaggerated  clinical  use.  In  addition,  the  no-effect exposures in a mouse study conducted with ó-toluidine was substantially higher than that proposed clinically.  A  no-effect  dose  was  not  established  in  the  2-year  rat  carcinogenicity  conducted  with  ótoluidine; however, the doses administered were extremely high and it is worthwhile to note that in the clinical situation, this metabolite was only detected in one subject following exaggerated use.

As the experience of long-term use in the intended indication is limited to one year, concerns regarding the  potential  systemic  risks  (e.g.  methaemoglobinaemia,  systemic  malignancies)  and  carcinogenicity potential  were  raised.  These  concerns  were  adequately  addressed  by  the  Applicant.  Overall,  the potential occurrence of methaemoglobinaemia from prilocaine and carcinogenicity risk from o -toluidine is extremely unlikely based upon the clinical and non-clinical information provided by the Applicant.

The  presence  of  DNA  adducts  and  haemoglobin  adducts  are  also  relevant  to  the  potential  for carcinogenicity.  It  is  noted  that  in  the  rat  dermal  study,  metabolite  haemoglobin  adduct  levels  at  1 mg/day which is ~10 fold higher than the proposed clinical dose were approximately 15 times the level of 2,6-xylidine and approximately 29 times the level of o-toluidine adduct levels in a clinical trial over an 8 month period. At 1 mg/day, 2,6-xylidine DNA adduct levels were very low and only detected in the nasal mucosa and not in liver and bladder and o-toluidine levels were not detected. These data suggest that DNA adducts of 2,6-xylidine and ó-toluidine following the prescribed use of PSD502 would not be detectable in man.

Data from the literature suggest that lidocaine or prilocaine do not have the potential to cause foetal abnormalities. In accordance with the 'Guideline on Non-clinical development of fixed combination of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/05)' and 'Guideline on Non-clinical documentation for mixed  marketing  authorisation  applications  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/799/95)',  studies  to  evaluate  the effects  on  reproduction  or  embryofoetal  development  have  not  been  conducted  with  PSD502.    It  is noted that no major findings concerning the reproductive organs have been observed in the repeateddose toxicity studies. The results of an ex-vivo study conducted by the Applicant show that the product reduces the sperm motility; hence PSD502 may adversely affect the pregnancy rate at the intended clinical  use.  However,  bibliographic  references  submitted  by  the  applicant  reported  that  no  adverse effects  on  human  sperm  motility  were  identified  during  incubation  with  lidocaine.    Nonetheless,  the effects on sperm motility have been included within the SmPC, Section 4.6.

No signs of antigenicity or immunotoxicity have been observed during the repeat-dose toxicity studies, and no further evaluations are needed.

Regarding  with  the  log  Kow,  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  have  a  log  Kow  which  are  below  4.5, according to a bibliographic reference (Hansch, 1995) that has been provided by the Applicant.

Given  the  observed  systemic  exposure  to  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  following  the  administration  of PSD502  the  potential  for  pharmacokinetic  interactions  with  drugs  which  reduce  the  clearance  of lidocaine/prilocaine  (e.g.  beta-blockers  and  cimetidine)  is  considered  to  be  low;  however,  relevant warnings have been included within the SmPC section 4.5, which is acceptable.

The effect of PSD502 on locally applied agents, such as spermicides would have been quite relevant to the proposed indication; however, given the fact that PSD502 affects sperm motility, the potential for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacodynamic interaction could not be tested.  The effects on sperm motility have been included within  the  SmPC  Section  4.6  as  follows:  'A  study  in  rats  showed  that  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora caused a reduction in sperm mobility'.

The CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed:

- The Applicant should provide all the study reports of the experimental determination of the log Kow value for both lidocaine and prilocaine.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Overall the non-clinical program conducted by the Applicant meets the requirements and the data are acceptable  From  the  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  point  of  view;  both  lidocaine  and prilocaine, as well as their metabolites 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine, are well characterized.

Overall, the majority of the non-clinical issues have been satisfactorily addressed in the SmPC. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity, this information is adequately reflected in section 5.3 in the  SmPC).  As  a  precautionary  measure,  it  is  preferable  to  avoid  the  use  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora during pregnancy unless effective male barrier contraceptive measures are taken in order to avoid potential foetal exposure.

No teratogenic effects of lidocaine were observed in studies of embryonic/foetal development in rats and  rabbits  receiving  doses  during  organogenesis.  Embryotoxicity  was  observed  in  rabbits  at  doses toxic to the mother. The postnatal survival time of the offspring of rats treated during pregnancy and lactation with a dose toxic to the mother was shown to be reduced.

In a study of pregnant rats receiving a combination of lidocaine and prilocaine during organogenesis, no effects on embryonic/foetal development were observed. There are however no systemic exposure data available for comparison with clinical exposure.

Lidocaine  was  not  genotoxic  and  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  lidocaine  has  not  been  studied.  The lidocaine  metabolite  2,6-xylidine  has  genotoxic  potential in  vitro .    In  a  carcinogenicity  study  of  rats exposed to 2,6-xylidine in utero , postnatally and throughout their lifetime, tumours in the nasal cavity, subcutaneous tumours and liver tumours were observed.  The clinical relevance of tumour findings in relation  to  short-term/intermittent  use  of  lidocaine  in  humans  is  unknown.    Human  exposure  from Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora is 20-30 fold less than the minimum dose that did not result in tumours and 200 fold less than the minimum dose that did result in tumours.

Prilocaine  was  not  genotoxic  and  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  prilocaine  has  not  been  studied.  The prilocaine  metabolite o -toluidine  has  genotoxic  potential in  vitro .    In  carcinogenicity  studies  of o -toluidine  in  rats,  mice  and  hamsters,  tumours  were  observed  in  several  organs.    The  clinical relevance  of  tumour  findings  in  respect  of  short-term/intermittent  use  of  prilocaine  in  humans  is unknown.  Human exposure is 1000 fold less than than the minimum dose studied. This dose did result in tumours

There are no adequate data from the use of lidocaine and prilocaine on fertility in humans. In an in vitro study of rats Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora has shown a reduction in sperm motility when 22.5 mg lidocaine  and  7.5 mg  prilocaine  (i.e.  the  amount  in  1  human  dose)  was  in  direct  contact  with  rat sperm. However this study did not reproduce the circumstances of clinical use, as the concentration of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in direct contact with the sperm would be many fold lower. The potential for reduction of sperm motility following the clinical use of the medicinal product cannot be excluded; therefore  it  is  not  possible  to  state  whether  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  would  prevent  pregnancy. This  medicinal  product  may  reduce  the  possibility  of  pregnancy,  but  should  not  be  used  as  a contraceptive.

The Applicant will provide the results of additional studies to further characterise the environmental risk assessment .

Abbreviations: DSM-IV = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; IELT = intravaginal ejaculatory latency time; IPE: Index of Premature Ejaculation; ISSM = International Society for Sexual Medicine; PE = premature ejaculation; UK = United Kingdom; USA = United States of America

*  Additional  inclusion  criteria  added  in  protocol  amendments  4  and  5,  for  the  USA  and  Canada respectively in PSD502-PE-002 and protocol amendment 3 for all study locations in PSD502-PE-004, in response to the release of the ISSM evidence-based definition of PE. In PSD502-PE-002 these inclusion criteria were present in the protocol in use at the outset in Poland. Subjects who were already enrolled who did not meet the criteria for lifelong PE and/or the ISSM definition were excluded from the perprotocol populations.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

## · Male

In study  PSD502-PE-003 ,  one  dose  (30  mg)  of  PSD502 or placebo was applied once daily to the glans penis of 16 healthy male volunteers for 21 days, except for dosing days 7 and 14, when 3 doses (3 sprays each dose, 9 sprays in total) of PSD502 or placebo were applied, each dose 4 ± 0.25 hours apart. On Dosing Days 1 and 21, plasma samples were taken before dosing (0 hours), and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after dosing to determine levels of PSD502 (lidocaine and prilocaine) and metabolites 2,6xylidine and o-toluidine. On Dosing Days 7 and 14, a single plasma sample was taken 1.5 hours after the third dose of PSD502.

Each 30 mg dose (3 sprays) of PSD502 provided 22.5 mg lidocaine base plus 7,5 mg prilocaine base in a eutectic-like combination.

## Single dose

Lidocaine and prilocaine were quantifiable in plasma 1 hour post dose. The maximum concentrations for lidocaine and prilocaine in an individual male subject were 96 ng/mL and 13 ng/mL, respectively, occurring 2 hours post-dose.

## Multiple doses on a single day

The maximum concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine measured in any one individual on either of these days was 171.47 ng/mL for lidocaine on Day 14 and 19.39 ng/mL for prilocaine on Day 7.

The maximum plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine following 3 applications of PSD502 at 4-hourly  intervals  to  healthy  male  volunteers  were  therefore  well  below  the  plasma  concentrations associated with systemic toxicity (&gt;5,000 ng/mL for lidocaine and prilocaine): Approximately 29-fold lower for lidocaine and almost 258-fold lower for prilocaine.

## Repeat dosing for 21 Days

Lidocaine  and  prilocaine  plasma  concentrations  tended  to  be  higher  on  Day  21  than  on  Day  1  (see Table 10). The mean (SD) Cmax of lidocaine in the population overall after repeat daily dosing (Day 21) was 56.11 (33.519) ng/mL, reached at a mean (SD) tmax of 2.69 (1.026) hours. For prilocaine on Day 21 in the population overall, the mean (SD) Cmax was 7.18 (2.457) ng/mL, reached at a mean (SD) tmax of 2.52 (0.964) hours.

The mean Cmax for lidocaine and prilocaine following repeat applications of PSD502 for 21 days to healthy male volunteers were therefore well below the plasma concentrations associated with systemic toxicity  (&gt;5,000  ng/mL  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine):  Approximately  90-fold  lower  for  lidocaine  and almost 700-fold lower for prilocaine.

## · Female

Two studies of PSD502 were carried out in healthy female volunteers. In PSD502-PE-006 3 different single doses of PSD502 (3 mg, 30 mg and 150 mg) or placebo were applied once daily for 7 days to the cervix and vaginal fornices of 21 healthy female volunteers.

The  study  was  terminated  early,  and  thus  study  PSD502-PE-007  was  undertaken  to  provide supplementary information  in  female  volunteers.  In  PSD502-PE-007  60  mg  PSD502  or  placebo  was applied once daily for 7 days to the cervix and vaginal fornices of 30 healthy female volunteers. No firm  conclusions  can  be  drawn  for  exposure  to  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  regarding  dose  dependency because of the small number of observations and variability.

## Single dose

For lidocaine, there appeared to be a dose-proportional trend in exposure to lidocaine across the two studies (see Table 11), with the exception of the post-menopausal 30 mg dose group (n=2) for which the mean Cmax did not fit this pattern. The Cmax was attained up to 2.0 hours after single-dose drug application. For prilocaine there was an increased exposure with increasing dose, but the increase was less than proportional to dose.

The highest mean Cmax for lidocaine and prilocaine (215.54 ng/mL and 28.79 ng/mL, respectively) followed a single 150 mg dose of PSD502 in the pre-menopausal subjects in PSD502-PE-006. This dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

represents a supra-maximal exposure to PSD502 as it is far higher than would be anticipated to occur by transference from a male partner during sexual intercourse. Even so, the maximum concentrations were well below the plasma concentrations associated with systemic toxicity.

The number of subjects (n) reported represents those subjects for whom pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. In some cases, all or most of the concentration values for a subject were below the quantification limit, and parameters could not be calculated.

## Repeat dosing for 7 Days

As with the PK parameters derived following a single dose, the mean PK parameters for lidocaine and prilocaine at all 3 dose levels in study PSD502-PE-006 for Day 7 for pre and post-menopausal women were comprised of 3 or fewer subjects and were characterised by high variability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In PSD502-PE-007, there was no, or minimal, meaningful accumulation of lidocaine or prilocaine observed following topical application of multiple doses of 60 mg PSD502 spray to the cervix and vaginal fornices for all female subjects for 7 consecutive days.

## · Bioavailability

PSD502 has been formulated for topical administration with low systemic absorption as demonstrated in studies PSD502-PE-003, PSD502-PE-006, PSD502-PE-007 and PSD502-PM-001; hence a bioavailability study has not been conducted.

## · Bioequivalence

There have been two formulations of PSD502 aerosol dosage form used during the clinical development program, both containing lidocaine and prilocaine in a 3:1 ratio with tetrafluoroethane serving as  a solvent and propellant. An ethanol-containing formulation was used in an early clinical study PSD502PE-001, instigated by Medpharma Plc prior to the transfer of PSD502 intellectual property to Plethora Solutions Plc on 9 th  December 2003. Following completion of study PSD502-PE-001, Plethora removed ethanol as an excipient and the subsequent formulation of lidocaine, prilocaine and tetrafluoroethane has been used in all other clinical studies presented in this Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), and is the one intended for use as the commercial product.

Study  PSD502-PE-001  is  used  as  supportive  evidence  in  this  application  and  is  not  used  as  sole justification  for  any  efficacy  or  safety  statements  hence  a  bioequivalence  study  for  the  two formulations has not been conducted.

## Data from food-interaction studies

This was regarded as not applicable as the product is for topical use.

## Distribution

The distribution of lidocaine and/or prilocaine following the application of PSD502 to the genital mucosa of male or female healthy volunteers has not been evaluated. However, the distribution of lidocaine and prilocaine following i.v. administration is well documented.

Following an i.v. dose, lidocaine is widely and rapidly distributed into highly perfused tissues followed by redistribution into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The steady-state volume of distribution is 1.1 to 2.1 L/kg (mean 1.5 ± 0.3 standard deviation [SD]).  Once in the body, lidocaine is bound by plasma proteins, including AAG.  The extent of binding is variable, dependent in part on the concentrations of both lidocaine and AAG, but is approximately 66% to 70%. Lidocaine can cross the blood brain barrier and the placenta, presumably by passive diffusion and is distributed in breast milk. The milk: plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4.

Following i.v. administration, the steady state volume of distribution of prilocaine is 0.7 to 4.4 L/kg (mean 2.6 ± 1.3  SD).  The  distribution  volume  is  larger  than  that  for  lidocaine,  and  results  in  lower plasma concentrations for prilocaine when equal amounts of lidocaine and prilocaine are administered. Once in the body, prilocaine is reported to be 55% bound to plasma proteins. Prilocaine crosses the blood-brain  barrier  and  also  crosses  the  placenta,  presumably  by  passive  diffusion,  and  during prolonged  epidural  anaesthesia  may  produce  methaemoglobinaemia  in  the  foetus.  Prilocaine  is  also distributed in breast milk, although the milk:plasma ratio for prilocaine is not determined as data are not available.

## Elimination

## · Excretion

## PSD502 healthy male volunteer studies

In  PSD502-PE-003,  following  single  doses  of  PSD502  (30  mg)  to  the  glans  penis  of  healthy  male volunteers, lidocaine was eliminated with a mean terminal phase half-life (t½) of 2.85 (0.4303) hours (n=6; all subjects). Insufficient data were available to permit the estimation of t½ for prilocaine, 2,6xylidine and o-toluidine.

## PSD502 healthy female volunteer studies

In PSD502-PE-006, the mean t½ values for lidocaine at all 3 dose levels for Days 1 and 7 for pre- and postmenopausal  women  were  in  a  range  between  2.5  -  10.6  hours  and  the  mean  t½  values  for prilocaine at the 3 mg dose level were 4.1 hours (Day 1, post-menopause) and 55.2 hours (Day 7, premenopause). The mean t½ values for prilocaine at the two highest doses were in a range between 2.0 - 3.3 hours.

The mean t½ values for 2,6-xylidine at the 2 highest dose levels for Days 1 and 7 for pre and postmenopausal women were in a range between 5.3 - 23.0 hours. The mean t½ values for o-toluidine at the  2  highest  dose  levels  for  Days  1  and  7  for  pre-  and  postmenopausal  women  were  in  a  range between 3.1 - 17.3 hours. The half-life for metabolites that form after the administration of the parent drug reflect the rate of formation of the metabolite.

In PSD502-PE-007, following a 60 mg daily dose of PSD502, the mean apparent terminal elimination rates (Kel Day 1) for lidocaine and prilocaine were 0.132 and 0.188 (1/hour), respectively; mean t½ values were 5.42 and 3.99 hours, respectively.

## · Metabolism

The  metabolism  of  lidocaine  and/or  prilocaine  following  the  application  of  PSD502  to  the  genital mucosa of male or female healthy volunteers has been evaluated in studies PSD502-PE-003 (healthy male volunteers) and PSD502-PE-006 and PSD502-PE-007 (healthy female volunteers).

## PSD502 healthy male volunteer studies

## Single dose

Following the administration of a single 30 mg dose of PSD502 to the glans penis of 12 healthy male volunteers, 2,6-xylidine concentrations were not detected or not quantifiable until 4 hours post-dose. The mean (SD) 2,6-xylidine plasma concentration 4-hours post-dose on Day 1 is depicted in Table 12 below.  At  8  hours  post-dose,  2,6-xylidine  concentrations  were  not  detected  or  not  quantifiable.  otoluidine was not detected or not quantifiable in any subject on Day 1.

## Multiple doses on a single day

Following the administration of 3 x 30 mg doses of PSD502 to the glans penis at 4 hourly intervals on Day 7 and Day 14, the mean (SD) 2,6-xylidine concentration detected at 1.5 hours post-third-dose was 2.24 (3.076) ng/mL on Day 7 (range 0 to 7.9 ng/mL) and 3.71 (3.823) ng/mL on Day 14 (range 0 to 10.60 ng/mL). o-Toluidine was only detectable in a single subject on and Day 14, 1.5 hours after the third dose (2.03 ng/mL) and was just above the lower level of quantification.

## Repeat dosing for 21 Days

On  Day  21,  following  21  daily  doses  of  PSD502  (30  mg)  2,6-xylidine  was  only  quantifiable  in  3 subjects. The maximum concentration recorded for any subject was 8.51 ng/mL at 4-hours post-dose. o-toluidine was only detected in a single subject, just above the lower level of quantification 4 hours after dosing on Day 21. All other subjects had concentrations of o-toluidine below the lower limit of quantification at all time-points.

## PSD502 healthy female volunteer studies

## Single dose

Systemic exposure of the subjects to the metabolites 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine was low and variable (see Table 13). o-Toluidine was detectable in plasma on Day 1 for a single subject in the 3 mg dose group and for small numbers of subjects in the higher dose groups.

## Repeat dosing for 7 Days

Plasma levels of 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine in these subjects were low or absent, even following repeat dosing with PSD502 150 mg (see Table 14). No 2,6-xylidine was detectable in plasma after 7 daily administrations of the 3-mg dose.

o-Toluidine was detected in the plasma of 2 or fewer pre- and post-menopausal women in any dose group on Day 7 (including one subject for whom o-toluidine was detectable in plasma on Days 1 and 7 after administration of the 3 mg dose).

## Vaginal metabolism of PSD502

Lidocaine  and  prilocaine  were  detected  in  vaginal  fluids  of  subjects  following  all  3  dose  levels  in increasing amounts relative to dose. The appearance of lidocaine and prilocaine in the vaginal fluid was from  the  fluids  washing  away  the  administered  dose  that  was  sprayed  on  the  vaginal  and  cervical surfaces.  Relative  to  the  doses  applied  the  amount  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  detectable  in  vaginal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

fluids 2 hours post-dose was small. The maximum amount of lidocaine and prilocaine present on the tampon at 2 hours post dose was 7.6% of the administered dose.

As expected, metabolites were not detected in vaginal fluid at any of the dose levels in any subject. These metabolites are principally formed in the liver and excreted in urine  as conjugates of further metabolic products. There are no known drug metabolising capabilities or excretory processes in the inner vagina that could result in the presence of 2,6-xylidine or o-toluidine.

## Reports in the literature

There is  some preliminary evidence that lidocaine is metabolised to a minor extent in the skin, but lidocaine  is  largely  metabolised  in  the  liver  by  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)  isoenzymes  CYP1A2  and CYP3A4 to its two major pharmacologically active metabolites, first to MEGX and then to glycinexylidine (GX), and 2,6-xylidine both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. Lidocaine has a high hepatic extraction ratio and any impairment of liver function or hepatic blood flow can significantly affect the PK.

First pass metabolism is extensive and bioavailability is about 35% after oral doses. Metabolism in the liver is rapid and approximately 90% of a given dose is dealkylated to form MEGX and GX. These two metabolites  have  longer  half-lives  than  lidocaine  and  accumulation,  particularly  of  GGX  may  occur during prolonged infusions and may contribute to the therapeutic and toxic effects of the drug. The pharmacological activity of 2,6-xylidine is unknown, but it has been shown to be carcinogenic in rats.

Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36%, and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively [1].

Prilocaine is rapidly metabolised in both the liver, also via CYP450 isoenzymes and in the kidneys by amidases, to various metabolites including ortho- (o-)toluidine and N-npropylalanine [1, 23].

The  o-toluidine  metabolite  has  been  shown  to  be  carcinogenic  in  several  animal  models    and  can produce  methaemoglobinaemia  following  systemic  doses  of  prilocaine  approximating  8  mg/kg.  Very young  patients,  patients  with  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  deficiencies  and  patients  taking oxidizing drugs such as antimalarials and sulfonamides are more susceptible to methemoglobinemia.

## Oral application of Oraqix periodontal gel

Serum  concentrations  of  2,6-xylidine  and  o-toluidine  were  also  evaluated  in  patients  following application  of  Oraqix  periodontal  gel  (a  eutectic  mixture  of  2.5%  lidocaine  and  2.5%  prilocaine)  to periodontal pockets around all the teeth in the mouthThe ratio for Cmax 2,6-xylidine/Cmax lidocaine was in the range 0.01 to 0.15 and the ratio of Cmax o-toluidine/Cmax prilocaine was between 0.12 and 0.48.

## Application of EMLA cream to leg ulcers

The plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine and their main metabolites were evaluated in 36 patients undergoing debridement of venous leg ulcers following the application of EMLA cream (1 to 2 g/cm2; maximum 10 g) for 30 to 45 minutes under an occlusive dressing. The lidocaine metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide was below the limit of quantification in all samples, whereas 2,6-xylidine was quantifiable in 6 of the samples, but did not exceed 12 ng/mL in any of the samples. Maximum plasma levels of prilocaine were 77 ng/mL and the prilocaine metabolite o-toluidine was quantifiable in 62/136 samples  bud  did  not  exceed  11  ng/mL.  There  was  a  significant  correlation  (p&lt;0.05)  between  the plasma levels of lidocaine, prilocaine, and otoluidine and the dose of EMLA cream applied and the leg ulcer area. No apparent sign of accumulation of lidocaine or prilocaine or their main metabolites was observed.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No data was presented on this sub-heading.

## Special populations

No specific PK studies in special populations were conducted.

## Circumcision and menopause

Absorption of lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  appearance  of  the  metabolites  2,6-xylidine  and o -toluidine  is slightly higher in the uncircumcised group. The three possible reasons proposed for this are; firstly, the presence of the foreskin may act as an occlusive barrier, increasing absorption of PSD502, secondly PSD502, may also be absorbed from the inside of the foreskin which thus provides a larger surface area for absorption compared to circumcised subjects. Finally, the mucosa of the glans penis is nonkeratinised  or  poorly  keratinised  in  uncircumcised  men,  but  tends  to  become  keratinised  following circumcision.  PSD502 is not expected to readily penetrate keratinised skin and it would therefore be expected that the increase in keratinisation following circumcision would reduce the rate of absorption of PSD502.

For  the  premenopausal  subjects,  there  was  a  trend  to  a  greater  amount  of  drug  collected  into  the tampon,  relative  to  that  for  the  post-menopausal  women,  A  plausible  explanation  was  that  vaginal fluids are greatly reduced after menopause. Metabolites were not detected in vaginal fluid of pre- or post-menopausal subjects.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## Anti-infectives

As PSD502 is to be applied to the genitalia, and could potentially also spread to the genital area of the sexual partner, a number of in vitro studies were performed to study potential interactions with other topical drugs for genital use, and also contraceptive devices, which may be in contact with PSD502.

PSD502 interaction with the following agents was tested:

1. Antifungal agents: Clotrimazole, Econazole, Imidazole, Nystatin, Miconazole and Ketoconazole
2. Antibiotics: Clindamycin and Metronidazole
3. Antiviral agent: Ayclovir (due to cytotoxicity at full strengths, 1/5 strength PSD502 and 1/125 strength Acyclovir were tested).

There was no interference by PSD502 with the antimicrobial activity of any of the antimicrobial agents tested,  and  this  information  is  included  in  the  SPC.  Despite  the  inability  to  test  interaction  with Acyclovir at clinical strengths, it would seem reasonable to assume that there would be no interaction in clinical practice.

## Other drugs

According to The EMLA® Product Monograph and EMLA SPC, interaction with Class I anti-arrhythmics, drugs  that  reduce  the  clearance  of  lidocaine  (eg,  cimetidine  or  betablockers)  and  induction  of Methaemoglobinaemia due to  benzocaine is possible.

## Contraceptive devices

Four  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  PSD502  on  condoms  (Study  48580  Smithers Rapra Technology Ltd, Shropshire, UK), the cervical cap (Study 50686 Smithers Rapra Technology Ltd), the contraceptive diaphragm (Study 50687 Smithers Rapra Technology Ltd), and the female condom (Study 50841 Smithers Rapra Technology Ltd).  The various contraceptive devices were exposed to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

30  mg  clinical  dose  of  PSD502,  and  subjected  to  tensile  strength  and  elongation  break  tests.    In addition, the male and female condoms were also subjected to burst pressure and burst volume testing. It was found that the integrity of the male condom, the cervical cap, and diaphragm were not affected by  exposure  to  PSD502.    However,  the  female  condom  showed  an  effect  on  tensile  strength  and elongation  of  break  testing  following  exposure  to  PSD502,  and  an  increased  incidence  of  punctured devices.  The female condom tested was polyurethane based, rather than latex rubber.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

In vitro studies of microsomes isolated from human skin have identified that the enzymes involved in metabolism of lidocaine are also expressed in low levels in human skin. However literature searches did not reveal any relevant biomaterials studies carried out on genital mucosa.

The effect of PSD502 on the motility of human sperm has not been evaluated. Effect of PSD502 on spermicidal agents could not be tested for technical reasons, due to the inherent effect of PSD502 on sperm mobility and viability.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

## Lidocaine

Lidocaine base is readily soluble in propellant. However, once the propellant evaporates lidocaine will quickly crystallise on the surface of the skin, rendering it inactive as it is inaccessible to the mucous membrane. Therefore, the presence of prilocaine is an absolute necessity in the formulation as it is required  for  solubilising  lidocaine  and  maintaining  it  in  its  liquid  state  once  the  propellant  has evaporated.

## Prilocaine

By mixing a small amount of prilocaine with lidocaine (ratio 1:3), a mixture is formed which is slightly oily  in  texture,  requires  no  excipients  other  than  the  propellant,  and  importantly,  has  a  pKa  that  is favourable for absorption through mucous membranes. In contrast to lidocaine base, prilocaine alone is not particularly soluble in the propellant, but once mixed with lidocaine, it becomes readily soluble and the melting point is lowered so that it remains in a stable liquid form even when dispensed from a pressurized canister, using a metered dose valve.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The  primary  pharmacological  activity  of  the  combination  product  is  essentially  the  same  as  for  the individual active ingredients. Lidocaine has a rapid onset of action and anaesthesia is obtained rapidly while prilocaine has slower onset of action but a slightly longer duration of action. The combination of lidocaine and prilocaine provides rapid onset of action. PSD502 delivers lidocaine and prilocaine in their base forms increasing the speed of onset of anaesthesia.

Both Lidocaine and Prilocaine act on the CNS and cardiac tissues at higher concentrations. As systemic absorption with PSD502 use is very minimal, adverse effects on these tissues is unlikely. Literature references are provided to show the absorption of the actives through a number of different tissues such as the respiratory tract, anorectal mucosa and skin. Most of these are based on the use of EMLA cream.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The PD effects and interactions are unlikely to result in any adverse effects.

The acute toxic plasma levels of both prilocaine and lidocaine are well established at approximately 5000  ng/ml.  The  highest  maximum  plasma  concentrations  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  following application of PSD502 to the glans penis of healthy male volunteers on multiple dosing days (1.5 hours after  3  4-hourly  30  mg  doses),  were  171.47 ng/mL  and  19.39  ng/mL  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine, respectively,  which  are  29-fold  and  258-fold  below  minimum  toxic  levels.    PSD502  will  be  dosed intermittently over potentially long periods of time for PE, therefore, the safety of chronic dosing is particularly important for this indication. After 21 daily doses of PSD502 to the glans penis of healthy volunteers, the mean Cmax of lidocaine in the population overall was 56.11 ng/mL and for prilocaine was  7.18  (2.457)  ng/mL;  approximately  90-fold  and  700-fold  below  the  plasma  concentrations associated with systemic toxicity for lidocaine and prilocaine, respectively.

Although lidocaine and prilocaine are not carcinogenic, there is evidence that the major metabolites (2,6-xylidine and o -toluidine respectively) or potentially, sub-metabolites of these, may be carcinogenic.  Plasma  levels  of  2,6-xylidine  were  only  detected  at  low  levels,  in  approximately  two thirds of healthy male volunteers in study PSD502-PE-003, where supranormal dosing was tested, and then only at some time-points. In the same study o -toluidine was only detected at one time point in 1 of  the  12  patients  who  received  active  drug.  Haemoglobin  adducts  (along  with  DNA  adducts)  are considered biomarkers of exposure to metabolites. Although there were small rises in both o -toluidine and 2,6-xylidine Hb adduct levels in the sub-group of subjects tested in the pivotal PSD502-PE-002 study, the rises do not appear to be excessive compared to background levels in the literature and therefore, whilst it is not possible to confirm that these rises do not indicate potential harm, there is no obvious safety signal from these results.

With regard to sexual partners of patients using PSD502, drug transfer to partners during intercourse is minimal (1/4 to 1/8 that of the patient), and no (or minimal) accumulation was seen following daily doses. The lack of spermicide interaction study is also noted in the SmPC/PIL. The systemic exposure following PSD502 dosing is so low this is extremely unlikely. However, as a precautionary measure, a warning is included in the SmPC/PIL. Therefore, the latex-based male condom, the cervical cap, and the  diaphragm  can  be  used  as  effective  contraceptives  in  the  presence  of  PSD502,  but  not polyurethane-based  barrier  contraceptives.  Deterioriation  was  observed  when  Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora was used with polyurethane-based female and male condoms.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The Applicant has presented a comprehensive clinical pharmacology  program. There are no outstanding issues on clinical pharmacology.

The clinical pharmacology development of PSD502 comprises four pK studies, three studies conducted in  healthy  volunteers  and  one  in  patients  undergoing  skin  grafts.  These  studies  provide  limited information  on  the  pK  and  pD  behaviour  of  the  product.  The  Applicant  has  completed  the  missing information with that available  for  EMLA  cream,  a  eutectic  mixture  of lidocaine  2.5%  and  prilocaine 2.5% to be administered topically. The Applicant has justified it through the similar composition and topical administration of both products and the extensive use and the well-known pharmacology of the components. Admittedly, lidocaine and prilocaine are present in a number of formulations. However, EMLA and PSD502 cannot be considered identical formulations. It is uncertain to what extent the data can be extrapolated although given the low expected systemic exposure it does not seem to be an issue.  A  relative  bioavailability  study  with  EMLA  would  have  been  useful  in  order  to  confirm  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acceptability  of  the  provided  data,  however  the  lack  of  this  study  was  not  considered  major  by  the CHMP.

PSD502 acts locally in the glans penis. PK studies have shown that after the administration of single and  multiple  doses  to  healthy  male  volunteers  systemic  absorption  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is minimal. Repeated daily dosing increases the exposure although a safety margin of 29 for lidocaine and 258 for prilocaine has been estimated. Similarly, when potential transfer to females partners was investigated the application to cervix and vaginal fornices of doses up to 150 mg (5-fold the dose to be administered to the male) rendered plasma concentrations well below the toxicity limits. Lidocaine and prilocaine  plasma  concentrations  tended  to  be  higher  on  Day  21,  but  again,  plasma  concentrations were well below the limits of toxicity.  Slightly greater amount of the actives were recovered from the vaginal fluid of premenopausal women compared to post-menopausal women. It has been explained due to decreased vaginal fluid secretion in the latter group although it is more likely that this is due to increased systemic absorption in the postmenopausal women as seen by slightly higher plasma levels of the actives.

Although the mechanism is not clear, there is no safety concern due to the low levels of the actives, both in plasma and in vaginal fluid.

Concentrations of both lidocaine and prilocaine in uncircumcised subjects appeared to be higher than in the circumcised group, remarkably after repeated dosing. Whereas the stability studies conducted to evaluate  the  effect  of  PSD502  on  condoms  and  other  devices  do  not  raise  any  concern  about  the integrity  of  these  devices  except  for  polyurethane-based  condoms  the  differences  in  exposure  to lidocaine  and  prilocaine  when  they  (particularly  male  condoms)  are  used  are  not  determined.    The information has been included in the PI.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of PSD502 in the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men was evaluated in five studies:

- 1 proof of concept phase 2 study (ANAE-059-00)
- 1 dose-range finding study (PSD502-PE-005)
- 2 pivotal studies (PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004)
- 1 supportive phase 2 study (PSD502-PE-001)

## 2.5.1. Dose response study

## · Study PSD502-PE-005

Study PE-005 was primarily aimed to evaluate the effect of 3 doses (3 mg, 30 mg, and 53 mg) of PSD502 on IELT. The study followed a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover design.

After  the  initial  screening  assessments  subjects  underwent  a  baseline  evaluation  period  of  2  weeks during which they were required to document at least one sexual encounter using a stopwatch with a recorded  IELT ≤ 1  minute.  Subjects  who  were  eligible  to  continue  in  the  study  were  assigned  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomization number corresponding to pre-determined sequences of PSD502 doses or placebo. The treatment period was 4 weeks (1 week for placebo and 1 week for each of the 3 doses).

The three doses chosen to be tested were 30 mg (3 sprays, each containing 7.5 mg lidocaine and 2.5 mg prilocaine); 3 mg, low dose (3 sprays, each containing 0.75 mg lidocaine and 0.25 mg prilocaine) and 53 mg, high dose (3 sprays, each containing 13.28 mg lidocaine and 4.45 mg prilocaine).

## Subject Study Flow

<!-- image -->

PE-005 included subjects aged ≥ 18 years, satisfying ISSM criteria for PE with a baseline IELT ≤ 1 minute in  at  least  one  sexual  encounter  were  eligible  to  enrol  in  this  study.  Subjects  must  have  been  in  a stable  heterosexual  and  monogamous  relationship  of  at  least  3  months  duration.  Subjects  were excluded if:

- they had erectile dysfunction, defined as an  IIEF-5 score of ≤ 21  (unless  the  low  score  was entirely related to PE symptoms in the opinion of the Investigator),
- they or their partner had any physical or psychological condition that would prevent them from undertaking the study procedures, or had a current history of alcohol or drug abuse, had an increased susceptibility to methemoglobinemia or used class I or III anti-arrhythmic drugs.
- they had received treatment with anti-depressant therapy for PE, local anesthetic spray, intracavernosal injection or psychotherapy for PE within 4 weeks of screening. Subjects were able to take tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs or SSRIs, for indications other than PE, as long as the dose remained unchanged within 4 weeks of screening and continued to remain unchanged throughout the treatment period

The primary efficacy variable was the change in mean IELT from baseline.

The secondary efficacy variables were the proportion of subjects with mean IELT &gt;1 minute and &gt;2 minutes, and the proportion of subjects with at least a two-fold increase in mean IELT compared with baseline

Based  on  data  from  PSD502-PE-001,  24  subjects  were  sufficient  to  ensure  at  least  90%  power  to demonstrate a significant dose response. This assumed that the underlying dose response was such that there is at least a doubling of IELT in the higher doses of PSD502 compared with placebo. There was  also  at  least  80%  power  to  detect  at  least  a  2-fold  increase  in  IELT  versus  placebo  for  each individual PSD502 dose.

The primary efficacy variable was to be analysed using a linear random effects model with dose, period and centre as fixed effects, mean baseline IELT as a covariate and subject as a random effect. The mean  IELT  was  to  be  log-transformed  prior  to  the  analysis.  Evidence  of  dose-response  was  to  be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

assessed using linear contrast test. Differences between the different doses of PSD502 were also to be assessed but without adjustments for multiplicity. Modelling of the dose-response relationship was also to be undertaken. All randomised subjects receiving at least one dose of study medication were to be used in the analysis. The secondary efficacy variables were to be analysed using a generalised linear mixed  model  with  dose,  treatment  period  and  centre  as  fixed  effects,  mean  baseline  IELT  as  a covariate and subject as a random effect.

All randomised subjects that received the study drug were to be included in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population.  The  ITT  population  was  to  be  used  for  the  analysis  of  all  baseline  characteristics  and primary analysis of efficacy data. The per protocol population was to be a subset of the ITT population and was to be formed by excluding subjects with major protocol deviations that could have affected the efficacy  assessments.  All  subjects  that  received  the  study  drug  were  to  be  included  in  the  safety population. The safety population was to be used for the analysis of all safety data.

## Efficacy results

A total of 35 subjects were treated. The study population was 100% Caucasian with a mean age of 40 years. Approximately a third of the male subjects in the ITT population were less than 35 years of age. The median age was 39 years (range 21 years to 66 years). The BMI ranged from 19.5 kg/m2 to 35.4 kg/m2, with a mean BMI of 26.49 kg/m2. Approximately 15% of subjects in the ITT population had a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or over.

All subjects had life-long PE. The median time since diagnosis of PE was 1 year (range 0 years to 26 years). Ten (29%) subjects had previously received one or more treatments for PE. The most common type of treatment for PE was SSRIs or other antidepressants, followed by local anaesthetic. There were no circumcised subjects.

## Sexual Encounter Data - ITT Population

Source:Table10,Section14

The number of sexual encounters with the spray was similar for each dose group including placebo. For the  53mg  dose,  in  five  (7%)  encounters  where  penetration  occurred,  the  subjects  did  not  achieve ejaculation, whereas all penetrations at the two lower doses resulted in successful ejaculation.

Two subjects did not achieve penetration or ejaculation on any occasion following the 53mg dose, and both  these  subjects  reported  difficulty  maintaining  an  erection,  and  one  also  complained  of  local

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

numbness. Two other subjects were able to achieve penetration but did not ejaculate on each occasion following the 53mg dose.

- Primary Efficacy Variable

When compared with placebo, only treatment with the 30 mg dose significantly delayed ejaculation (geometric mean ratio to placebo 1.7-fold, lower 95% CL 1.19; p = 0.008). The proportion of subjects with at least a 2-fold increase in mean IELT was 32.4%, 57.1%, 65.7% and 47.1% for placebo, 3 mg PSD502, 30 mg PSD502, and 53 mg PSD502, respectively. In part, this was due to the fact that a significant percentage (12%; 4 of 34 subjects) of subjects experienced hypoesthesia with the 53 mg dose, resulting in ejaculation failure (baseline IELT data were carried forward where all IELT data for an individual period were missing).

The primary efficacy analysis performed on the PP population was very similar to that for the ITT population.

- Secondary Efficacy Variables

A greater proportion of subjects receiving the PSD502 30mg dose attained an IELT &gt; 1 minute and &gt; 2 minutes in comparison to all other doses.

- Safety Results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects: In total 23 treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported by six (17%) subjects: 2 (6%) with 3mg, 4 (11%) with 30mg and 6 (18%) with 53mg.

The  most  common TEAE  were hypoaesthesia of male genitalia  (n=5;  14%;  4  reported  with  53  mg dose), erectile dysfunction (n=2; 6%), genital burning sensation (n=1; 53mg dose).

Two  TEAEs  (penile  numbness  and  penile  burn)  reported  by  subject  407  during  the  PSD502  53mg treatment period were reported to be severe. All other TEAEs were either reported as mild or moderate in severity.

Partner: In total 11 TEAEs were reported by four (11%) partners. Overall, two (6%) partners for the subjects treated with PSD502 53mg, two (6%) partners for the subjects treated with PSD502 30mg, three (9%) partners for the subjects treated with PSD502 3mg and no partners for the subjects treated with  placebo  reported  TEAEs.  The  most  common  TEAE  was  hypoaesthesia  (vaginal  numbness),  this was reported  five  times  in  total,  by  one  (3%)  partner  for  the  PSD502  3mg  dose  and  by  two  (6%) partners  for  the  PSD502  30mg  dose.  The  second  most  common  TEAE  was  vulvovaginal  burning sensation, this was reported four times in total, by one (3%) partner for the PSD502 30mg dose and by two (6%) partners for the PSD502 53mg dose.

There were no severe TEAEs reported in partners. The severity profile for partners was very similar across the three PSD502 treatment periods.

## 2.5.2. Main studies (phase III = therapeutic confirmatory trials)

Primary evidence for the efficacy of PSD502 in the treatment of patients with premature ejaculation comes from the individual primary Studies PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004. These pivotal studies were  phase  III,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study,  with  open-label follow-up in 240-300 subjects with lifelong PE and their sexual partners.

## Methods

Two  pivotal  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  12-week,  parallel-design,  multinational studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  PSD502  on  demand  dosing  (prior  to sexual intercourse) in men with premature ejaculation. Only the 30 mg dose was tested.

The  demonstration  of  efficacy  in  the  proposed  indication  is  primarily  based  on  the  comparison  with placebo. The Applicant states that no products were approved for the treatment of PE at the time of initiation  of  the  studies.  Dapoxetine  is  currently  the  only  approved  oral  medicinal  product  for  the treatment  of  PE  but  several  products  have  been  used  to  cover  this  need.    The  justification  of  the Applicant is acceptable.

The duration of the studies is 12 weeks for the DB phase (dapoxetine efficacy trials were of similar duration). Open label extension to up to 9 months provide a total exposure of 12 month. Long term

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy is based on a primarily aimed safety extension of the pivotal studies. No controlled data further to 12 weeks to support efficacy are available.

## Study Participants

## Inclusion criteria

Male subjects aged 18 years and over with lifelong PE were to be considered suitable for the study if they satisfied the DSM-IV and the ISSM criteria.

Subjects were eligible to enrol in the study if they had documented an IELT ≤ 1 minute in at least 2 of the first 3 sexual encounters in the Baseline period and had a response to Screening PEP to perceived control over ejaculation and satisfaction with sexual intercourse of 'Poor' or 'Very poor', and to personal distress and interpersonal difficulty related to ejaculation of 'Quite a bit' or 'Extremely'.

Subjects were required to be in a stable heterosexual and monogamous relationship and the partner was willing to comply with the study procedures.

## Exclusion criteria

Subjects were excluded if they had erectile dysfunction (defined as an IIEF5 score of ≤ 21) unless the low score was entirely related to PE symptoms in the opinion of the Investigator, or he, or his sexual partner, had a physical or psychological condition that would prevent them from undertaking the study procedures,  or  had  a  current  history  of  alcohol  or  drug  abuse  or  had  an  increased  susceptibility  to methaemoglobinaemia or known drug sensitivity to amide-type local anaesthetics or used class I or III anti-arrhythmic drugs.

Subjects also were excluded if they had a pregnant partner or of child-bearing potential and not using appropriate  contraception  [hormonal  contraception  or  intra-uterine  device  (IUD)  during  double-blind part of study; hormonal contraception or IUD or condom during open-label part of study].

Subjects were not to be permitted to have received any treatment for PE (e.g. anti-depressant therapy, local  anaesthetic  spray,  intra-cavernosal  injection  or  psychotherapy  for  PE)  within  4  weeks  of Screening  until  the  end  of  the  study.  Subjects  who  were  taking  tricyclic  antidepressants,  MAOIs  or SSRIs,  for  indications  other  than  PE,  were  to  be  permitted  to  participate  as  long  as  the  dose  had remained unchanged within 4 weeks of Screening and was planned to remain unchanged throughout the double-blind treatment period.

## Treatments

The active test product was PSD502, a metered dose aerosol spray delivering a eutectic-like mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine for topical anaesthesia. A single dose of IP was to consist of 3 sprays applied to the glans penis. Each actuation dispensed lidocaine 7.5 mg and prilocaine 2.5 mg in their base forms (a  total  dose  of  22.5mg  lidocaine  and  7.5mg  prilocaine).  The  propellant  used  in  this  spray  was tetrafluoroethane (HFA-134a), which also served as a solvent. Once HFA-134a evaporated, the liquid formulation  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  was  to  form  a  slightly  oily  thin  layer  of  drug  at  the  site  of application.

The placebo was a metered dose aerosol spray that was identical in appearance to the PSD502 spray and contained the same propellant HFC gas.

Both  pivotal  studies  were  controlled  with  placebo.  No  active  control  was  included.  The  inclusion  of dapoxetine as active control (the only approved treatment for this condition) has been discussed by the Applicant. It is  acknowledged the additional difficulties of adding a third arm by a different route of administration  (and  the  derived  double  dummy  for  masking),  mainly  when  both  treatments  are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administered in the preambles of the sexual intercourse and at different stages (dapoxetine 1-3 hours before, PSD502 five minutes before). The controlled placebo design is acceptable.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the studies was to determine the effect of PSD502 on Index of Premature Ejaculation and Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time.

- -The secondary objective of the studies was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PSD502 in subjects with PE, and their sexual partners and to evaluate the effect of PSD502 on the subject and partner Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP)

.

Study PE-002 had also the following secondary objectives:

- -to determine the minimally important difference in IPE domains;
- -to evaluate the relationship between IELT and IPE;

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Outcomes

Efficacy  was  primarily  assessed  by  quantitative  measures  based  on  time  to  ejaculation  (IELT)  and qualitative  evaluation  of  the  personal  impact  as  patient  reported  outcomes  (Index  of  Premature Ejaculation). This is welcome since PE is considered a multidimensional condition. Besides, it reflects the relevant aspects included in the definition of the condition. Both IELT and IPE questionnaire can be considered standard methods of measurement and have been widely used in PE clinical research.

IELT  was  measured  with  a  stopwatch.  As  the  stopwatch  could  be  operated  by  the  subject  or  the partner (always the same subject during the trial) some differences in the measures could result from it.  It  can  be  relevant  in  those  outcomes  (secondary  endpoints)  in  which  absolute  means  instead  of changes with respect to baseline are considered in the estimation (e.g. % subjects with mean IELT &gt; 1 or 2 minutes).

Response  was  also  measured  in  terms  of  responder  rates:  IELT  &gt;  1  minute  (according  the  ISSM definition) and IELT &gt; 2 minutes. Although important, 'normalisation' of the time to ejaculation does not result as significant as the perceived improvement by the subject.

With  respect  to  PRO  (Patient-reported  outcomes),  control  over  ejaculation  and  satisfaction  were considered the two most relevant measures. Control has been described as the key outcome of the impact of the condition.

The PEP has been validated in subjects with PE satisfying the DSM-IV criteria (without restrictions on IELT) and it has been widely used as PRO in published studies on PE. Relevantly, this outcome also monitors the partner's perception.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy endpoints

Intravaginal ejaculatory latency time: Subjects were instructed to start timing at the time of vaginal penetration  and  to  stop  at  the  start  of  ejaculation.  Subjects  (or  their  sexual  partner)  were  to  be provided with a stopwatch, and were to record the stopwatch recorded IELT in the diary card for each sexual encounter when IP was used. When ejaculation happened before penetration, then the IELT was set to zero, and if the subject was unable to ejaculate, then the IELT was recorded as missing.

During the double-blind treatment phase of the study, the person recording the IELT (subject or his partner) was to remain the same.

Index of premature ejaculation: The IPE is a 10-item questionnaire with three domains: ejaculatory control (4 questions), distress (2 questions) and sexual satisfaction (4 questions). The 10 items were individually scored as follows:

- Items 1-8 scored 5 to 1 in descending order with the 'No sexual intercourse, not applicable category' set to missing.
- Items 9-10 scored 1 to 5 in ascending order with the 'No sexual intercourse, not applicable category' set to missing.

Control scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater control. Satisfaction scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction. Distress scores range from 2 to 10 with a higher score indicating less distress.

Premature Ejaculation Profile: The PEP is a 4 item questionnaire validated for use in PE. Questions were related  to  perceived  control  over  ejaculation,  satisfaction  with  sexual  intercourse,  personal  distress related to ejaculation, and interpersonal difficulty related to ejaculation, each answered on a 5-point scale,  with  a  maximum  score  of  5  points  for  each  question,  and  higher  scores  representing  better functioning. Subjects' sexual partners were to complete a 4 point PEP questionnaire. The questions to be  answered  by  the  female  sexual  partners  were  identical  to  those  of  the  subjects'  questionnaire except that the females were asked to consider their partners' ejaculation when giving responses.

Global ratings: The study PSD502-PE-002 incorporated global ratings of the quality of orgasm (change from baseline), of distress, control and satisfaction and the opinion of the study medication answering the following questions:

- 'In general, how do you rate the orgasm you experience during sexual intercourse?' with a 5point scale ranging from 'Very poor' to 'Very Good'.
- 'What  was  your  opinion  of  the  study  medication?'  with  a  4-point  scale  from  'Poor'  to 'Excellent'.
- 'Compared to when you started this study, how do you rate
- o the distress you experience during sexual intercourse?'
- o your ability to control your time to ejaculation during sexual intercourse?'
- o your satisfaction with sexual intercourse?'

The  subjects  were  to  provide  their  answers  using  a  4-point  scale  of  'no  change/worse',  'small improvement', 'moderate improvement' and 'large improvement'. These questions were to serve as 'anchor' questions in the estimation of the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of the IPE domains.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary measures of efficacy were the:

- change in mean IELT from Baseline to during the 3 months of double-blind treatment
- change in the IPE domain of ejaculatory control from Baseline to month 3
- change in the IPE domain of sexual satisfaction from Baseline to month 3
- change in the IPE domain of distress from Baseline to month 3 (in study PE-004 it was measured as secondary variable)

The secondary measures of efficacy were the:

- proportion  of  subjects  with  mean  IELT  &gt;  1  minute  and  &gt;  2  minutes  during  the  3 months of double-blind treatment
- change in mean IELT from Baseline to each month of double-blind treatment
- change in the IPE domains of ejaculatory control, distress and sexual satisfaction from Baseline to months 1 and 2 separately
- scores for perceived control over ejaculation, personal distress related to ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse and interpersonal difficulty related to ejaculation based on the subject PEP and the partner at months 1, 2 and 3.

## Sample size

Due to the co-primary variables in this study, a fixed sequence Bonferroni procedure was to be used to maintain the overall level of significance at no greater than 5%. Based on data from a previous Phase II  study  of  PSD502  in  PE  (PSD502-PE-001),  it  was  calculated  that  with  240  to  300  subjects  this procedure would provide in excess of 95% power to detect a statistically significant treatment effect on at least one of the endpoints. Unconditionally, there was to be an excess of 95% power to detect a statistically  significant  2-fold  increase  in  mean  IELT  for  PSD502  versus  placebo  at  the  5%  level  of significance and at least 95% power to detect a statistically significant moderate effect size (Cohen's effect size of 0.55) difference for PSD502 versus placebo in the IPE domains of ejaculatory control and sexual satisfaction individually.

## Randomisation

Patients  who  met  the  inclusion  criteria  and  did  not  meet  the  exclusion  criteria  at  the  end  of  the screening  period,  were  randomized  to  1  of  the  treatment  groups  in  a  2:1  ratio  using  a  computergenerated randomization scheme. Randomization was stratified by study site.

## Blinding (masking)

The  study  design  incorporated  both  a  double-blind  treatment  phase  and  an  optional  open  label treatment  phase.  The  first  three  months  of  the  treatment  phase  of  the  studies  was  a  double-blind phase (PSD502 and placebo). The cold sensation caused by the latent heat of evaporation from the placebo spray sufficiently mimicked the numbing effect of the PSD502 spray and therefore supported blinding.

The open-label design allowed all study subjects an opportunity for treatment with active treatment.

## Statistical methods

All randomised subjects that received the study drug were to be included in the Intent-to- Treat (ITT) population.  The  ITT  population  was  to  be  used  for  the  summary  of  all  Baseline  characteristics  and primary analysis of efficacy data. The PP population was a subset of the ITT population and was to be formed  by  excluding  subjects  with  major  protocol  deviations  that  could  have  affected  the  efficacy assessments. All subjects that received the study drug were to be included in the safety population.

For  each  study  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  (and  the  SAP  for  the  interim  analysis  of  Study PSD502-PE-002) were finalised before the respective database locks.

Eligible  subjects  were  randomised  to  either  PSD502  or  placebo  in  a  2:1  ratio  with  stratification  by centre.  Centres that contained less than 12 subjects were pooled with similar centres within the same country such that pooled centres were similarly sized and contained no more than 24 subjects.

Analysis  of  mean  IELT  over  the  3-month  treatment  period  was  conducted  on  log-transformed  data using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including factors for pooled centre and treatment and with  the  baseline  value  as  a  covariate.    The  treatment  effect  of  PSD502  compared  to  placebo  was estimated together with the associated 95% confidence interval which was transformed back to show the estimate ratio of treatment effects.  A similar ANCOVA model was used to analyse the domains of the IPE without first log-transforming the data.  A multiple testing procedure was pre-defined in order to control the Type I error.  All tests were two-sided.

Missing data were handled as follows.  For subjects who withdrew, the IELT was based on available data within the month that withdrawal occurred.  For subjects with no IELT data during a particular period, the mean IELT was set to the mean IELT from the baseline period, baseline observation carried forward (BOCF).  For subjects withdrawing during the double-blind phase, the IPE questionnaire was to be  completed  at  the  time  of  withdrawal.    For  nominal  visits  after  withdrawal,  the  IPE  scores  were carried forward from the last visit, last observation carried forward (LOCF).  If a subject attended a visit but did not complete the IPE questionnaire or only provided partially completed information, the domains  scores  were  considered  to  be  missing.    Subjects  withdrawing  before  completing  any questionnaire would have the domain scores set to the baseline values.

Various  sensitivity  analyses  were  to  be  performed  to  examine  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the analysis of the primary efficacy variables for the ITT population.  These were to include an analysis using the observed data and an analysis based on the PP population.

## Changes in the planned statistical analyses

The  following  changes  to  the  protocol-planned  analyses  were  described  in  the  SAPs,  which  were approved prior to database lock and unblinding.

The 'interim' analysis conducted in Study PSD502-PE-002 to estimate the MCID and investigate the sensitivity  to  change  of  the  IPE,  undertaken  after  approximately  half  of  the  enrolled  subjects  had completed the double-blind phase of the study, was repeated at the end of the study to utilise the full study data to provide a more powerful analysis.

The  protocol  stated  that  the  relationship  of  the  IPE  domains  with  IELT  was  to  be  investigated. However, emerging data showed that there was significant number of subjects with IPE domain scores at  the  minimum  or  maximum  values  potentially  masking  such  a  relationship.  Consequently,  this analysis was not undertaken.

An additional summary of the incidence of treatment-related AEs starting on the same day or the day after use of the study spray was also performed to provide additional information on AEs commencing immediately following treatment.

In  Studies  PSD502-PE-002  and  PSD502-PE-004  data  from  the  double-blind  part  of  the  study  were analysed following database lock after all subjects had completed the double-blind treatment phase.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following the re-opening of the database to enter and clean accumulating data from the open-label phase,  a  small  amount  of  data  from  the  double-blind  phase  was  further  cleaned.    Consequently  all affected analyses were re-run following database lock after all subjects had completed each study as a whole  and  the  results  were  compared  against  the  original  analyses.    They  were  found  to  be  not significantly affected

## Results

## Study PE-002

Of the 256 patients enrolled a total of 29 randomised subjects (21 to receive PSD502 and 8 subjects to receive  Placebo)  withdrew  during  the  double-blind  treatment  phase.  Seven  of  the  withdrawals  (4  in PSD502/3 in Placebo) were by subjects prior to them using the assigned treatment.

For  the  remaining  17  subjects  who  withdrew  following  commencement  of  PSD502  treatment,  7 subjects withdrew due to withdrawal of consent by the subject, 5 subjects were lost to follow-up, 3 subjects  (withdrew  due  to  intolerable  AEs  and  1  subject  (1303)  withdrew  as  a  result  of  Sponsor's decision.

In the Placebo group, 2 subjects withdrew due to withdrawal of consent by the subject and 3 subjects were lost to follow-up.

## Study PE-004

A total of 335 subjects provided written informed consent and were screened. Of these, 35 subjects failed screening. The most common reason for failing screening was failure of the subject to meet the study entry criteria.

A total of 31 study sites across 4 European countries randomised 300 study subjects (PSD502: 200 subjects;  Placebo:  100  subjects).  Of  these,  22  subjects  withdrew  during  the  double-blind  treatment phase (PSD502: 18 subjects; Placebo: 4 subjects). Half of the withdrawals in the PSD502 treatment group  were  by  subjects  prior  to  them  using  PSD502  (5  withdrawals  of  consent  by  the  subject,  3 subjects lost to follow-up and 1 withdrawal of consent by subject's sexual partner). For the remaining 9 subjects  who  withdrew  following  commencement  of  PSD502  treatment,  4  subjects  withdrew  due  to withdrawal  of  consent  by  the  subject  or  the  subject's  sexual  partner,  2  subjects  withdrew  due  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intolerable  AEs,  2  subjects  were  lost  to  follow-up  and  1  subject  withdrew  as  a  result  of  Sponsor's decision.

In the Placebo group, a total of 4 subjects who were randomised to receive placebo discontinued the study  during  the  double  blind  phase.  Of  these,  1  subject  withdrew  consent  prior  to  commencing treatment. Of the remaining 3 subjects who withdrew after receiving at least a single dose of Placebo, 2 subjects withdrew due to withdrawal of consent by the subject and the remaining subject was lost to follow-up.

## Recruitment

A total of 22 subjects treated with PSD502 in the double-blind phase had acquired PE (6.1% of the population), 19 of whom were recruited in study PSD502-PE-002 in the USA and Canada as these were the only countries where recruitment started before the implementation of the protocol amendment requiring  subjects  to  have  lifelong  PE.  There  appears  to  be  no  evidence  that  men  with  acquired  PE respond differently to PSD502 than to men with lifelong PE.

## Conduct of the study

A number of amendments were approved to exclude patients with HIV, HBV and HCV, update definition of PE according to the ISSM criteria, clarify the use of condoms in the open label phase clarification of data collection etc.

## Baseline data

In Study PE-002 male subjects in the ITT population were 18 to 68 years of age and had a mean age of  38.7  years.  Over  80% of the subjects were of white ethnic origin, with Afro-Caribbean being the next represented ethnic group (8.4%). The BMI ranged from 17.9 kg/m2 to 52.1 kg/m2, with a mean BMI of 27.29 kg/m2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately half of the ITT population had been circumcised (USA: circumcised 87.5%, uncircumcised 12.5%; Canada: circumcised 61.9%, uncircumcised 38.1%; Poland: circumcised 5.0%, uncircumcised 95.5%).

In Study PE-004 male subjects in the ITT population were 19 to 65 years of age and had a mean age of 34.8 years. All but 3 of the 290 subjects (99%) were white. The BMI ranged from 17.9 kg/m 2  to 43.3  kg/m 2 ,  with  a  mean  BMI  of  26.22  kg/m 2 .  Less  than  7%  of  the  ITT  population  had  been circumcised.

## Numbers analysed

Totals of 249 and 290 subjects comprised the ITT populations for the PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE004 studies, respectively, which was 97% of the randomized population in both cases. Totals of 193 and  237  subjects  comprised  the  Per  Protocol  populations,  representing  75%  and  79%  of  the randomized populations in PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 studies, respectively.

## Outcomes and estimation

Baseline PE measures for the ITT population for both studies are summarised in Table 22.

Baseline IELT was the mean of all IELTs recorded on subject diary cards in the period between the start of screening(visit 1)and randomization(visit 2).IELT data are reported in theCSRs in seconds, but are presented here in minutes for consistency with other presentations.

Abbreviations:IELT=intravaginal ejaculatory latency time;IPE =index of premature ejaculation;ITT =intention-to-treat; PE = premature ejaculation; SD = standard deviation

Baseline IPE domain scores were collected at the end of the screening period (visit 2).

Control domain scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater control.

Distress domain scores range from 2 to 10 with a higher score indicating less distress.

Satisfaction domain scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction.

In Study PE-002 a median of 13 doses of PSD502 and 12 doses of placebo were administered in the double-blind phase.

In Study PE-004 a median of 15.0 doses of PSD502 and placebo were administered in the double-blind phase.

## Primary endpoint

The  effectiveness  of  PSD502  in  treating  PE  was  assessed  by  measuring  IELT  and  the  co-primary endpoints of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction and distress using the IPE.

## · IELT

Over  the  3  month  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  geometric  mean  IELT  for  subjects  in  the  ITT population of PSD502-PE-002 had increased to 2.59 minutes in the PSD502 group and to 0.80 minutes in the placebo group, and in PSD502-PE-004, had increased to 3.79 minutes in the PSD502 group and 1.07 minutes in the placebo group.

Subjects  who  received  PSD502  had  a  4.66-fold  increase  in  their  adjusted  geometric  mean  IELT  in PSD502-PE-002  and  a  6.30-fold  increase  in  their  adjusted  mean  IELT  in  PSD502-PE-004,  whereas those  who  received  placebo  demonstrated  a  1.53-fold  increase  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  a  1.74-fold increase in PSD502-PE-004. The analysis of the ratio to baseline over the 3 month treatment phase for PSD502/Placebo  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  3.05-fold  (95%CI:  2.29,  4.06)  treatment benefit  in  favour  of  PSD502  (p&lt;0.0001;  significance  level=0.0125)  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

statistically  significant  3.62  fold  (95%CI:  2.80,  4.67)  treatment  benefit  in  favour  of  PSD502 (p&lt;0.0001; significance level=0.0167) in PSD502-PE-004 (Table 23).

## · IPE: Change from baseline in IPE domain scores at month 3

For  the  ITT  population,  substantial  improvement  was  observed  in  all  3  domains  at  month  3  in  the PSD502 groups of both studies compared with the placebo groups. The improvements in the scores for all  3  domains  were  slightly  higher  in  the  PE-004  study  than  in  the  PE-002  study,  even  though  the baseline scores for all 3 domains were also higher in PE-004 (Table 24).

Note: Calculations were made using the number of subjects with non-missing IPEs at baseline and at month 3 in each treatment group. Change was defined as visit -baseline.Control scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater control. Satisfaction scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction.Distress scores range from 2 to10 with a higher score indicating less distress.In order to control the overall level of significance at no greater than 5%, a fixed sequence Bonferroni procedure was implemented for each study. The significance level was 0.033 for control, 0.05 for satisfaction, and distress. For PSD502-PE-004, distress (secondary endpoint) was not included in the testing procedure.

a) Analysis of covariance was performed with factors for treatment and pooled centre with baseline as a covariate.

b)CalculatedusingthedifferenceofPSD502minusplacebo

Results of the observed cases analysis (ITT population) on IPE domains of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and distress were similar to those of the baseline carried forward analysis.

Results observed with the Per Protocol populations were consistent with results observed with the ITT populations.

## · Change from baseline to each month of double blind treatment

At  the  end  of  each  month  of  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  geometric  mean  IELT  for  all subjects in the ITT population had increased more from baseline in the PSD502 treatment groups of both pivotal studies and smaller improvements were seen in the placebo groups.

At  the  end  of  months  1  and  2,  subjects  treated  with  PSD502  had  larger  changes  (representing  an improvement) in their adjusted mean change from baseline scores for each of the IPE domains than subjects  who  received  placebo.  The  changes  from  baseline  were  generally  slightly  larger  in  the PSD502-PE-004 than the PSD502-PE-002 study for all domains at both months 1 and 2.

## · PEP: subjects and partners (Change from baseline in PEP domain scores)

In both studies, the PEP scores for subjects and partners followed a similar pattern of improvement to the IELT and IPE scores

At the end of each of months 1, 2 and 3, more subjects treated with PSD502 than Placebo had at least a  1  point  category  improvement  in  each  of  the  PEP  domains  of  perceived  control  over  ejaculation, personal distress related to ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse and interpersonal difficulty related to ejaculation.

In PSD502-PE-002 at month 3, the proportion of PSD502-treated subjects who indicated a response of 'very  good'  or  'good'  was  33.4%  for  control  and  41.0%  for  satisfaction  compared  with  2.5%  and 10.1%, respectively,  of  placebo-treated  subjects.  The  proportion  of  PSD502-treated  subjects  with  a response of 'not at all'  or  'a  little  bit'  was  43.6%  for  distress  and  59.0%  for  interpersonal  difficulty compared with 13.9% and 31.6%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects.

In PSD502-PE-004 at month 3, the proportion of PSD502-treated subjects who indicated a response of 'very good' or 'good' was 40.7% for control and 51.1% for satisfaction compared with 8.4% and 9.4%, respectively, of placebo-treated subjects. The proportion of PSD502-treated subjects with a response of 'not at all' or 'a little bit' was 55.4% for distress and 69.5% for interpersonal difficulty compared with 18.8% and 32.3%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects.

## Additional endpoints

In Study PE-002 the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the change from baseline in the IPE domains was estimated to be 2.9 to 4.3 points for ejaculatory control, 2.9 to 4.6 points for sexual satisfaction,  and  1.4  to  1.5  points  for  distress.    The  MCID  for  the  ratio  to  baseline  mean  IELT  was estimated  to  be  2  to  3-fold.    As  the  treatment  effects  for  the  primary  endpoints  exceed  these estimates, the clinical significance of the results is further demonstrated.

The relationship between the IPE domains and IELT was not undertaken because data showed that a large  number  of  subjects  had  IPE  domain  scores  at  the  minimum  or  maximum  values,  potentially masking any relationship with IELT.

Other measures of treatment effectiveness also demonstrated significant improvements:

-    At  the  end  of  the  3  month  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  proportion  of  subjects  rating  the quality of their orgasm 'Poor' or 'Very poor' reduced by approximately 3-fold from baseline in subjects receiving  PSD502  (baseline:  59.3%;  month  3:  20.1%)  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  over  3-fold  from baseline  in  subjects  receiving  PSD502  (baseline:  57.5%;  month  3:  16.2%)  in  PSD502-PE-004.  This contrasted with findings in  the  placebo-treated  subjects  where  the  proportion  of  subjects  rating  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

quality of their orgasm 'Poor' or 'Very poor' at the end of month 3 was lower by approximately 10% (baseline: 60.0%; month 3: 48.7%) in PSD502-PE-002 and unchanged (baseline: 57.1%; month 3: 51.5%) in PSD502-PE-004.

-   At the end of the 3 month double-blind treatment phase, more PSD502 subjects than Placebo subjects rated the study medication as 'Excellent'. In contrast, the worst rating of 'Poor' was assigned by more Placebo subjects than PSD502 subjects.

## Open-label extension

At the end of the double-blind treatment phase in pivotal studies PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 subjects had the option to participate in the open-label treatment phase in which all subjects received treatment with PSD502. The duration of the open-label phase was 5 months in PSD502-PE-002 and 9 months in PSD502-PE-004.

A total of  497  subjects  (98.4%  of  those  completing  the  double-blind  phase)  entered  the  open-label phase of the studies. Most (90.3%) of the subjects completed the open label phase. The most common reasons  for  discontinuing  early  were  subject/partner  request  and  lost  to  follow-up  (each  4.4%), followed  by  investigator's  decision  (0.6%),  and  adverse  event,  protocol  violation,  and  sponsor's decision (each 0.2%).

Note: Percentages for the double-blind phase Were caloulhted using the mwber of subjecis randomly assigned to each treatment group. Percentages calculated for the open-label phase Were calculated using the number of subjects who entered the open-label phase in each treatuent group. Subjects may have had more than one renson for discontinuation so percentages may add to more than 100%%.

## · Change in mean IELT and IPE domain scores over time

For all subjects in the open-label treatment phase, the ratio to baseline geometric mean IELT ranged from 5.62 (Visit 6) to 6.73 (Visit 7) in PSD502-PE-002, and from 8.39 (Visit 6) to 10.39 (Visit 10) in the  PSD502-PE-  004  study.  This  trend  was  consistent  for  the  groups  who  had  received  PSD502  or placebo in the double-blind phase as well as for all subjects in each open label phase.

For those subjects who received placebo during the double-blind phase and switched to PSD502 during the  open-label  phase,  marked  improvements  in  IELT  were  observed  at  the  first  assessment  after initiating treatment with PSD502. Subjects who received PSD502 in the double-blind treatment phases of the both studies had slightly higher ratio to baseline geometric mean IELTs at Visits 6-8 in the openlabel treatment phase than those subjects who had previously received placebo during the double-blind treatment phase of the study. However, at Visit 10 in PSD502-PE-004 (following a full 9 months openlabel treatment with PSD502), this difference was no longer apparent.

## · Change from baseline in IPE domain scores

Improvement  was  also  observed  in  IPE  domain  scores  from  the  end  of  the  double-blind  treatment phase  to  the  end  of  the  open-label  phase.  The  mean  change  from  baseline  for  ejaculatory  control, sexual satisfaction, and distress score was 12.3, 10.9, and 5.3 points, respectively at the end of the open-label  phase.  These  results  demonstrate  that  PSD502  was  as  effective  in  delaying  ejaculation, improving ejaculatory control and sexual satisfaction, and reducing distress at the end of the openlabel treatment period (month 12) as at the end of double-blind treatment period (month 3).

## Ancillary analyses

A subgroup analyses was carried out on the controlled PE Studies population which included subjects from PSD502-PE-001, PSD502-PE-002, PSD502-PE-004, and the 30 mg level of PSD502-PE-005.

## Hepatic and Renal Impairment

The  effect  of  chronic  renal  failure  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lidocaine  has  been  investigated  in  a literature-based study.  Lidocaine (1 mg/kg) was administered as an intravenous injection to healthy subjects,  subjects  with  moderate  renal  insufficiency,  subjects  with  severe  renal  insufficiency,  and functionally anephric patients undergoing long-term haemodialysis. Results of this study showed that clearance  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  insufficiency  was  approximately  half  that  of  the  healthy volunteers (6.01 ± 2.54 mL/minute x kg vs. 11.87 ± 2.97 mL/minute x kg; p &lt;0.001), and the halflife was approximately doubled (4.55 ± 1.71 hours vs. 2.24 ± 0.55 hours, p &lt;0.001). No such changes were observed in subjects undergoing regular haemodialysis, whose values were similar to those of the healthy volunteers.

## Incidence of Adverse Events by Age Group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When TEAEs were analysed by age group for the Controlled PE Studies population, the most common TEAEs across all age groups were the genital complaints of erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia, as observed  in  the  full  PSD502  Glanspenis-treated  Subjects  population.  Taking  into  consideration  the variable number of subjects in each age group (i.e., 149 subjects in the 25 to &lt;35 years group and 6 subjects  in  the  ≥65  years  group),  the  frequencies  of  these  events  across  the  age  groups  were generally comparable. All the events of erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia were considered to be related to treatment with PSD502. Severe TEAEs and TEAEs leading to early discontinuation were also analysed by subject age group. No obvious trends were identified in these analyses.

More than 90% of patients included in the controlled trials were younger than 55 years, the number of patients older than 65 years old were limited. Although PE is more common in the younger age group this has been addressed in the PI and RMP as missing information from the safety perspective.

ED is also more frequent in the older population and it is a known AE for this combination of lidocaine and prilocaine. So, at present, it cannot be ruled out that this limited participation of patients older than 65 years of age have an impact on the safety profile of PSD502. This has been addressed in the RMP.

## Incidence of Adverse Events by Body Weight

The frequency of these events was comparable in the BMI subgroups. The frequency of drug-related vulvovaginal burning sensation was comparable in the partners of subjects in both BMI subgroups.

Severe  TEAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  early  discontinuation  were  also  analysed  by  baseline  BMI.  No obvious trends were identified in these analyses.

## Incidence of Adverse Events by Circumcision Status

In the Controlled PE Studies population, the events of erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia occurred more frequently in uncircumcised subjects than in circumcised subjects. The proportion of uncircumcised subjects who experienced erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia were 3.8% and 2.4%, respectively. In contrast, in circumcised subjects the proportions were 2.0% and 1.0%, respectively. The events of ejaculation failure (0.7%) and genital erythema (0.7%) were only observed in uncircumcised subjects. One possible explanation for this difference is that the mucosa of the glans penis  tends  to  become  keratinised  following  circumcision,  and  PSD502  is  less  readily  absorbed  by keratinised  skin  than  mucosa.  The  frequency  of  vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  was  greater  in  the partners  of  circumcised  subjects  than  in  partners  of  uncircumcised  subjects  (9.0%  vs.  3.4%, respectively.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  drug  is  absorbed  better  through  the  poorly-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

keratinised  mucosa  of  the  uncircumcised  subjects,  thus  leaving  less  available  on  the  surface  for transfer to a partner. Severe TEAEs and TEAEs leading to early discontinuation were also analysed by circumcision status. No obvious trends were identified in these analyses.

## Incidence of Adverse Events by Race

The Controlled PE Studies population was predominantly Caucasian (approximately 90%). No obvious trends were observed for the subject racial subgroups, but interpretations should be made with caution since the majority of subjects were Caucasian.

## Incidence of Adverse Events by Lifelong/Acquired PE

In  the  Controlled  PE  Studies  population,  subjects  with  lifelong  PE  had  events  of  erectile  dysfunction (3.5%) and hypoaesthesia (2.2%). There were no reports of these events in subjects with acquired PE. However, since the majority of subjects (approximately 85%) in the Controlled PE Studies population had a diagnosis of lifelong PE, interpretations of the lifelong/acquired PE analyses should be made with caution.

## Incidence of Adverse Events by Categorical Ratio to Baseline IELT

The number of PSD502-treated subjects with ratio to baseline IELT &lt;1, 1 to &lt;2, and ≥2 was 12, 56, and  290,  respectively.  Given  that  the  number  of  subjects  was  not  comparable  in  each  subgroup, interpretations of this analysis should be made with caution. The proportion of subjects with erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia was 5.4% and 1.8%, respectively, in the 1 to &lt;2 subgroup, and 2.8% and 1.7%, respectively, in the ≥2 subgroup. These events were not observed in the &lt;1 subgroup.

## Summary of main efficacy results

A statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect has been shown by this medicinal product in the treatment of lifelong premature ejaculation. It has been observed in objective measures as intravaginal latency time and also perceived as a psychological benefit by the subjects and their partners.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Data from studies that characterise the efficacy of PSD502 are summarised by combining data from the two pivotal studies PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 using similar statistical methods to those described for each study. The IPE domain of distress was treated as a secondary endpoint in PSD502PE-004 and as a co-primary endpoint (changed through a protocol amendment) in PSD502-PE-002. For the combined analysis, the IPE domain score of distress was treated as a co-primary efficacy endpoint.

Note: Percentages for the double-blind phase were calculated using the mumber of subjects randomly assigned to each treatment group. Percentages calculated for the open-label phase were calculated using the number of subjects who entered the open-label phase in each treatment group. Subjects may have had more than one reason for discontinuation, so percentages may add to more than 100%.

a) All subjects received PSD502 in the open-label phase.

## · IELT

When IELT values of PSD502-treated subjects were compared with those of the placebo-treated subjects, a 3.3-fold (95% CI: 2.78, 4.01) delay in ejaculation that was statistically (p &lt;0.0001; significance level = 0.0125) and clinically significant was observed.

## · Proportion  of  subjects  with  mean  IELT  &gt;1  minute  or  &gt;2  minutes  during  the  3  months  of double-blind treatment

Most subjects (85.2%) in the PSD502 group achieved a mean IELT of &gt;1 minute over the course of 3 months  of  treatment  with  PSD502.  Even  though  there  was  a  highly  significant  difference  between PSD502 and placebo treated subjects, 46.4% of the placebo subjects had a mean IELT of &gt;1 minute.

## · Ratio to baseline of mean IELT during double-blind treatment by month

Marked improvement in IELT was observed at the first assessment (month 1). The geometric mean IELT increased from 0.581 minutes to 2.463 minutes in the PSD502 group and from 0.555 minutes to 0.852 minutes in the placebo group. Analysis of covariance of the log-transformed values revealed that ejaculation was delayed 4.4-fold and 1.5-fold compared with baseline in PSD502 and placebo groups, respectively.  Similar  results  (PSD502  vs.  placebo) were  observed  at  month 2  (5.0-fold  vs.  1.6-fold) and month 3 (5.3-fold vs. 1.7-fold). More than half of the PSD502- treated subjects had a mean IELT of &gt;2 minutes at the end of months 1, 2 and 3 (53.9%, 62.0%, and 65.1% respectively).

When compared with placebo, treatment with PSD502 resulted in a highly statistically significant delay in ejaculation of 2.9-fold (95% CI: 2.36, 3.44) at month 1; 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.66, 3.88) at month 2 and 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.55, 3.92) at month 3; p &lt;0.0001 for each month's assessment.

Change was observed in the IPE domains of ejaculatory control, distress and sexual satisfaction from baseline to months 1 and 2 separately.

At month 1, the adjusted mean change (PSD502 vs. placebo) was 6.4 vs. 1.6 for ejaculatory control, 5.9 vs. 1.7 for satisfaction, and 2.9 vs. 0.9 for distress. A similar result was observed at month 2.

Note: Calculations were made uising the mumber of subjects with non-missing IPEs at baseline and visit in each treatuent group.

Abbreviations: IPE = index of prematue ejaculation; ITT = intention-to-treat; SE= standrd eror

Contol scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater control. Satisfaction scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction. Distess scores range from 2 to 10 with a higher score indicating less distress.

a) Amalysis of covariance was performed with factors for treatment and pooled centre with baseline as a covanhte.

Analysis of covariance revealed a statistically significant improvement for all three IPE domain scores when the PSD502 group was compared with the placebo group at month 1: ejaculatory control: 4.9 points (95% CI: 4.0, 5.8; p &lt;0.0001), sexual satisfaction: 4.2 points (95% CI: 3.4, 5.1; p &lt;0.0001), and distress: 2.1 points (95% CI: 1.6, 2.5; p &lt; 0.0001). A significant improvement was also observed at month 2. An improvement of 5.9 points (95% CI: 5.0, 6.7) for ejaculatory control, 5.2 points (95% CI: 4.3, 6.1) for sexual satisfaction, and 2.4 points (95% CI: 2.0, 2.8) for distress at month 2; all were significant at the p &lt;0.0001 level.

## · Subject PEP: Change from baseline in scores based on the subject PEP at months 1, 2 and 3

The  chi-squared  test  for  trend  revealed  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  subjects'  PEP responses in favour of PSD502 (p &lt;0.0001 for each parameter) for all three monthly assessments. At month 3, the proportion of PSD502-treated subjects who indicated a response of 'very good' or 'good' was  37.3%  for  control  and  46.5%  for  satisfaction  compared  with  5.7%  and  9.7%,  respectively,  of placebo-treated subjects. The proportion of PSD502-treated subjects with a response of 'not at all' or 'a little  bit'  was  50.0%  for  distress  and  64.7%  for  interpersonal  difficulty  compared  with  16.6%  and 32.0%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects.

## · Partner PEP: Change from baseline in scores based on the partner PEP at month 3

A statistically significant difference in favour of PSD502 was also observed for partner PEP responses (p &lt;0.0001 for each parameter). The proportion of PSD502-treated subjects' partners who indicated a response  of  'very  good'  or  'good'  was  35.9%  for  control  and  43.0%  for  satisfaction  compared  with 10.5% and 16.5%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects' partners.

The proportion of PSD502-treated subjects' partners with a response of 'not at all' or 'a little bit' was 58.3%  for  distress  and  70.4%  for  interpersonal  difficulty  compared  with  31.7%  and  44.1%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects' partners.

## Supportive studies

## · ANAE-059-00

ANAE-059-00 was a single-centre, open-label, uncontrolled, proof-of-concept investigator-led study.

The  primary  objective  of  ANAE-059-00  was  to  measure  IELT  in  men  with  PE  before  and  after  the application of PSD502 to the penis. The subjects eligible for enrolment into ANAE-059-00 were men aged 21 to 70 years inclusive, with self-reported sexual dissatisfaction due to PE, and referral to a urology clinic. Subjects were instructed to use the spray on five consecutive encounters and to record the number of sprays and duration of use in each case. Subjects were instructed to apply between 3 and 5 sprays of PSD502 to the glans penis (depending on the size of the glans), approximately 15 to 30 minutes before intercourse.

A sample size of 15 subjects was chosen as it would provide statistical significance if the IELT times increased from two minutes to over 10 minutes.

A total of 14 subjects were treated. Of these, 3 subjects withdrew. The population had a mean age of 41 years and experienced PE for a mean of 10.2 years. Subjects reported a mean IELT of 55 seconds (range, 5 to 120 seconds). Eleven subjects used PSD502 on at least one occasion and recorded at least one  quantitative  efficacy  measurement.  The  mean  duration  for  which  TEMPE  was  applied  prior  to initiating intercourse was 17.8 minutes (range from 5 to 45 minutes per encounter).

The mean (SD) IELT increased from 1.4 minutes (± 1.1 minute) to 11.35 minutes (± 10.7 minutes; p =  0.008)  after  treatment,  representing  a  9-fold  increase  of  the  mean.  No  subject  experienced  a decrease in IELT. The mean sexual satisfaction scores after treatment for both subjects and partners were +1, on a scale where -1 was worse, 0 the same, +1 better, and +2 much better. The duration of PSD502 application (5 to 45 minutes) did not appear to affect either the change in IELT or the sexual satisfaction scores.

Four  subjects  and  three  partners  reported  genital  numbness  on  at  least  one  occasion,  one  subject reported  a  burning  sensation  on  the  first  application  one  subject  reported  itching  scrotum  with  red spots after the first application, four subjects reported difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection / ejaculating on at least once occasion.

This study mainly contributed to safety data provision of PSD502. No sound conclusions on efficacy can be drawn.

## · PSD502-PE-001

PSD502-PE-001  was  a  multicentre,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  which included subjects who fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria, in which a time limit for IELT is not included. This Phase II pilot study was the first controlled study evaluating the efficacy of PSD502 in the treatment of PE.  A treatment regimen of 3 sprays of PSD502 (delivering a total of 22.5 mg lidocaine and 7.5 mg prilocaine  in  a  eutectic  like  combination)  was  chosen.  Each  actuation  of  the  PSD502  spray  also contained  7.4  mg  ethanol  as  an  excipient.  Subjects  were  told  to  apply  3  sprays  to  the  glans  penis approximately 15 minutes before sexual intercourse and to wipe off excess spray before penetration. Subjects  were  instructed  to  use  the  spray  for  a  total  of  4  occasions  during  the  1-month  treatment period but not more than once in any 24-hour period.

The  primary  objective  of  PSD502-PE-001  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  PSD502  compared  with placebo  in  treating  subjects  with  PE.  The  study  had  a  one-month  baseline  period  in  which  subjects recorded baseline IELT on three separate occasions and completed baseline questionnaires.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients who had at least two sexual encounters where the IELT was ≥ 4 minutes following treatment. Change from baseline of IELT was promoted from a secondary to a co-primary variable in a protocol amendment. The secondary efficacy variables were IELT response (a response was defined as ≥ 2 IELT recordings of ≥ 2 minutes or ≥ 3 minutes in Month 2), the change in IEC score and the change in SQoL score.

The sample size was based on data from the pilot study ANAE-059-00. A sample size of 25 patients per treatment  group  provides  between  70%  and  80%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  40%  between PSD502 and placebo, at the α=0.05 level of significance (two-sided). To take account of missing or incomplete data the sample size was increased by approximately 30% and hence 35 patients per group were to be entered into the study.

A  total  of  54  subjects  (26  PSD502  and  28  placebo  subjects)  were  treated  in  this  study.  The  study population  was  predominantly  Caucasian  80%  with  a  mean  age  of  40  years.  The  observed  mean change  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  was  3.8  minutes  in  the  PSD502  group compared with 0.7 minutes in the placebo group. The estimated geometric means for the IELT during month  2,  derived  from  the  analysis  of  the  log-transformed  data,  were  2.50  and  1.04  minutes  for PSD502 and placebo respectively representing a 2.4-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 4.4; p&lt;0.01) difference in favour  of  PSD502.  Twenty-five  percent  of  PSD502-treated  subjects  were  considered  responders  (at least two sexual encounters where the IELT was ≥ 4 minutes) compared with 13% of placebo.

The effectiveness of PSD502 in treating PE was supported by positive trends in the IEC completed by subjects and SQoL questionnaires completed separately by subjects and their partners at the end of month 2.

Differences  in  the  selection  criteria  of  the  patients  and  the  formulation  used  (containing  ethanol  as excipient) with respect to the pivotal studies prevent from considering it for efficacy.

The Applicant has provided a comparison with Dapoxetine to offer information on the relative efficacy of  PSD502. This comparison can only be made from the Dapoxetine literature and the PAR since a head-to-head comparison has not been performed in a clinical trial. Pooled IELTs from the Dapoxetine pivotal studies are summarized in the report issued by the Swedish Medicines Product Agency. After 12 weeks DB treatment, mean IELTs increased from an average Baseline of 0.9 minutes, to 1.9 minutes (Placebo);  3.1  minutes  (Dapoxetine  30  mg)  and  3.6  minutes  (Dapoxetine  60  mg).  In  comparison, mean IELTs increased from a Baseline of 0.659 minutes (PSD502) and 0.665 (Placebo) to 5.651 and 1.389 minutes respectively in the pooled pivotal studies for PSD502.

Despite  the  limitations  of  comparing  results  across  studies,  these  data  suggest  that  the  PSD502treated patients had shorter IELTs at Baseline, and yet showed a much greater rise, to a final higher IELT  value,  with  a  greater  differential  from  placebo  than  either  of  the  Dapoxetine  doses.  It  is interesting to note that only 58% of patients in the Dapoxetine Pivotal studies had an average Baseline IELT of ≤ 1 minute and would, therefore have fulfilled the ISSM definition of PE.

The main PRO used in the Dapoxetine studies was the PEP and the report only presented a composite responder endpoint, which was not used in the PSD502 studies. However, McMahon et al. published an integrated analysis of the results from five Dapoxetine Phase III Studies [54]. The PEP data from this publication, together with the corresponding data from the PSD502 Pivotal studies is summarized in Table 39.

It  can  be  seen  that  the  patients  who  received  PSD502  in  the  PSD502  pivotal  studies  generally  had more severe (lower) PEP scores at baseline and these improved to a greater degree than the patients in the Dapoxetine studies, regardless of Dapoxetine dose.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Currently, there is no consensus as to what level of IELT constitutes a meaningful improvement in PE. While IELT may be viewed as an indicator of pharmacologic activity, the clinical relevance of achieving a given level of IELT or a given level of change in IELT is likely to differ from individual to individual. Therefore, to understand the improvement in IELT, it is also necessary to examine the relationships between IELT and responses to participant and partner outcome measures.

A statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect has been shown by this medicinal product in the  treatment  of  lifelong  premature  ejaculation.  It  has  been  observed  in  objective  measures  as intravaginal  latency  time  and  also  perceived  as  a  psychological  benefit  by  the  subjects  and  their partners.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The primary efficacy evaluation for PSD502 in the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) is based on 2  pivotal  trials  (with  open-label  extensions),  1  dose-range  finding  study  and  2  supportive  phase  2 studies.

Two additional studies (one conducted in patients with burns undergoing skin graft and one conducted in female patients undergoing hysteroscopy) have been submitted. They only have been considered for safety.

Two pivotal randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, 12-week studies support the use of PSD502 in the treatment of subjects with premature ejaculation (studies PE-002 and PE-004). Data from these two studies were integrated for pooled-analyses.

The population of subjects participating in these trials is adequate and representative for patients with lifelong  PE.  The  studies  enrolled  adult  male  subjects  (18  to  67  years  of  age)  according  to  the  two hallmarks  of  the  condition:  a  reduced  latency  time  for  ejaculation  (&lt;  1  minute)  and  the  negative impact  on  the  individual.    These  criteria  correspond  to  the  definition  of  PE  published  by  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

International Society for Sexual Medicine in 2008, when the pivotal trials were on-going. At that time a small proportion of subjects with acquired PE had been enrolled (6% of the total population). Since the new definition of PE only refers to lifelong PE the recruitment of those patients was stopped.  However, the primary efficacy analysis (ITT population) considered both groups of subjects. Given the differences between both syndromes (mainly related to the gradual onset of the symptoms and a more prolonged time  to  ejaculation  in  acquired  PE)  it  is  uncertain  that  the  results  obtained  in  lifelong  PE  can  be extrapolated  to  acquired  PE.  The  inclusion  of  the  PRO  and  control  over  ejaculation  and  satisfaction variables in the primary endpoint is acceptable.

Subjects reported an ejaculatory latency time of 0.6 minutes. In addition a minimum of severity in the subjective perception was required. According to the lack of control over ejaculation, the reported level of distress and dissatisfaction with the sexual relationships the patients recruited in the pivotal studies mostly suffered from a severe condition.

These results demonstrate that PSD502 was as effective in delaying ejaculation, improving ejaculatory control and sexual satisfaction, and reducing distress at the end of the open-label treatment period (month 12) as at the end of double-blind treatment period (month 3).

Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  comparable  between  the  two  groups.  Most  of  the subjects randomised were adults (only 6 patients were older than 65 years and 49 older than 55 years) and Caucasian subjects (&gt;90%). The median duration of symptoms since diagnosis was 1 to 1.5 years and most of subjects (70%) had not been previously treated for PE.

Subjects were treated for 12 weeks. Only the comparison with placebo is available. The justification provided by the Applicant about the lack of availability of dapoxetine (the only approved treatment for this condition) at the start of the studies is acknowledged. The additional difficulties of adding a third arm by a different route of administration, mainly when most of treatments are administered before sexual intercourse as on-demand basis are recognised.

Only the 30 mg dose was formally studied. A dose-range finding study was conducted (Study PE-005) in which 3 mg and 53 mg were also tested. Taking into account that it was started when the pivotal studies were already ongoing the study does not appear to provide relevant information apart from confirming  the  selection  of  the  dose.  Important  information  related  to  the  minimal  and  maximal effective dose, the optimum dose range or the dose adjustment in case of reporting insufficient effect or adverse events has not been established. Efficacy was primarily based on the effect on IELT and the improvement  of  the  control  over  ejaculation,  sexual  satisfaction  and  the  reduction  of  the  distress related to ejaculation (IPE domains). This is welcome since it addresses the multidimensional profile of the condition.

IELT was measured with a stopwatch. Although it is not required for the clinical management of the condition it is recommended for the monitoring of IELT response in clinical research. As the stopwatch could  be  operated  by  the  subject  or  the  partner  (always  the  same  subject  during  the  trial)  some differences  in  the  measures  could  result  from  it.  It  can  be  relevant  in  those  outcomes  (secondary endpoints) in which absolute means instead of changes with respect to baseline are considered in the estimation (e.g. % subjects with mean IELT &gt; 1 or 2 minutes). The Applicant has clarified during the procedure the lack of potential differences in patient's response according to the person dealing with the stopwatch. In addition, only one secondary endpoint could have been affected by this fact and their results were consistent with all the other endpoint results.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Over  the  3 month  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  geometric  mean  IELT  for  subjects  in  the  ITT population of PSD502-PE-002 had increased to 2.59 minutes in the PSD502 group and to 0.80 minutes

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the placebo group, and in PSD502-PE-004, had increased to 3.79 minutes in the PSD502 group and 1.07 minutes in the placebo group, demonstrating a 4.66-fold and a 6.30-fold increase respectively for PSD502. The analysis of the ratio to baseline over the 3 month treatment phase for PSD502/Placebo demonstrated a statistically significant 3.05-fold (95%CI: 2.29, 4.06) treatment benefit in favour of PSD502 (p&lt;0.0001; significance level=0.0125) in PSD502-PE-002 and a statistically significant 3.62 fold (95%CI: 2.80, 4.67) treatment benefit in favour of PSD502 (p&lt;0.0001; significance level=0.0167) in PSD502-PE-004.

This effect was also perceived as a meaningful change by the patient when the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) domains were measured.

For the IPE domains in the ITT population, substantial improvement was observed in all 3 domains at month  3  in  the  PSD502  groups  of  both  studies  compared  with  the  placebo  groups.      Changes  in adjusted mean scores (PSD502 vs. placebo) at month 3 for the ejaculatory control score were 7.3 vs. 2.3 in PSD502-PE-002, and 9.2 vs. 2.2 in PSD502-PE-004, representing 5.0 point (95% CI: 3.61, 6.34) and 7.0  point  (95%  CI:  5.87,  8.18)  statistically  significant  treatment  benefits  in  favour  of  PSD502. Changes in adjusted mean scores (PSD502 vs. placebo) at month 3 for the sexual satisfaction score were 6.7 vs. 2.2 in PSD502-PE-002, and 7.8 vs. 1.9 in PSD502-PE-004, representing a 4.6 point (95% CI: 3.30, 5.84) and 5.9 (95% CI: 4.78, 7.04) statistically significant treatment benefits in favour of PSD502 between the two study treatments. Changes in adjusted mean scores (PSD502 vs. placebo) at month 3 for the distress score were 3.5 vs. 1.0 in PSD502-PE-002, and 4.0 vs. 1.2 in PSD502-PE-004, representing a 2.5 point (95% CI: 1.86, 3.20) and 2.8 (95% CI: 2.21, 3.31) statistically significant treatment benefits in favour of PSD502.

Outcomes related to secondary variables also showed a statistically significant difference with respect to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment:

- When the effect on IELT is expressed as responder rate 85% of subjects treated with PSD502 vs 46% of those treated with Placebo did not formally qualify as PE (IELT lasting &gt; 1 minute). These differences were remarkable when more stringent definitions of responses were analysed (44% of PSD502 subjects reaching IELT longer than 4 minutes compared with 4% of those receiving Placebo)
- Changes in scores based on Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) were also significantly superior for PSD502. Subjects treated with PSD502 and their partners reported higher levels of control over ejaculation and sexual satisfaction and lower distress and interpersonal difficulties related to ejaculation than those treated with placebo.

The Applicant has performed an indirect contrast with the available published results from dapoxetine studies.  Bearing  in  mind  relevant  differences  between  populations  (inclusion  criteria,  severity  of  the condition) PSD502 could be comparable to Dapoxetine high dose, performing better than 30 mg dose. These results are comparable to the clinical results obtained in clinical trials with Dapoxetine with the IELT  as  primary  endpoints,  the  only  product  approved  for  this  indication.  In  the  Dapoxetine  trials, treatment resulted in significant improvement in mean (SD) IELT at the endpoint of 12 weeks [1.66 (2.087), 2.86 (3.588), and 3.36 (3.973) min for placebo, dapoxetine 30 and 60 mg, respectively for the first pivotal study and 1.84 (2.335), 2.70 (3.386) and 3.28 (3.404) min in the second study]. The control  over  ejaculation  and  satisfaction  with  sexual  intercourse  also  improved.  In  both  Dapoxetine studies, improvement in IELT was noted from the first dose and sustained over 12 weeks. Subgroup analyses using baseline average IELT≤1min and &gt;1min showed similar results.

The screening of the subjects was determined by the self-reported reduced ejaculation latency and the qualification of the impact by mean of IPE and PEP questionnaire. IELT was not part of this selection in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

order to avoid the training effect on the IELT derived from the frequent use of the stopwatch. This 'learning' effect has already been described in the clinical investigation of other conditions (e.g. use of diaries in  urinary  incontinence trials)  and  its  main consequence is a remarkable placebo effect. This was described in dapoxetine clinical trials, where placebo subjects doubled their IELT with respect to baseline measurement at the end of the treatment period.  This finding has not been so remarkable in clinical trials with PSD502. At the end of the double blind phase Placebo treated patients achieved a mean IELT below 1 minute (1.6 ratio with respect to baseline).

Also  noteworthy  is  the  similar  number  of  encounters  (and  the  doses  of  the  product)  reported  in subjects on PSD502 and on placebo. Unless the couples did not report the sexual relationships in which spray was not used some differences would be expected between subjects experiencing improvement of  the  condition  and  satisfaction  with  the  results  and  those  without  changes  in  the  level  of  bother reported at baseline. These two features (the modest placebo effect and the lack of discrepancy in the on-demand use between placebo and active group) pose doubts regarding the maintenance of blinding during the trial.  The Applicant has explained that the sexual encounter frequency was not collected at baseline  as  an  efficacy  measure.  Whereas  it  appears  difficult  to  adequately  assess  the  effect  of treatment on this outcome the differences in satisfaction with sexual intercourse between both PSD502 and placebo reported by patients and partners can be considered sufficiently supportive.

Circumcised subjects showed lower benefit than uncircumcised males. The Applicant has explained it due to the  keratinisation  of  the  mucosa  of  the  glans  penis  in  circumcised  men  and  the  consequent reduction in penetration of the product. Admittedly, some relevant differences in the response were also  observed  between  countries,  showing  the  subjects  recruited  in  USA  the  lowest  IELT  and  IPE values.  The  Applicant  has  attributed  this  finding  to  the  differences  in  circumcision  status  between countries and it has been further supported by additional analyses in the Response document provided by the Applicant.

Other  demographic  characteristics  do  not  appear  to  influence  in  the  response  except  for  the  age, younger  subjects  reporting  greater  benefit  than  older  patients.  However,  the  limited  number  of subjects older than 65 years and even 55 years included in clinical trials does not allow to determine if such differences in fact exist.

Long-term  efficacy  data of  PSD502 come  from the open-label  phases  of  the  two  pivotal  trials.  No controlled data further to 12 weeks to support efficacy are available. Although the results obtained at 12 months do not suggest loss of efficacy it provides limited evidence regarding the maintenance of the effect of PSD502. In this phase the use of condoms was permitted and according to the Applicant's responses no relevant differences were observed on efficacy or safety profile of the product. However, the  lack  of  a  placebo  arm  and  of  the  precise  number  of  condom  users  prevent  from  reaching  valid conclusions  on  this  issue.  Data  from  literature  (mainly  related  to  the  use  of  EMLA  on  the  genital mucosa of male patients) are reassuring although a higher rate of local numbness and loss of erection could be reasonably expected.  This advice is included in the Product Information.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The  efficacy  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  was  demonstrated  in  two  multi-centre,  multinational, randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  studies,  both  followed  by  an  open-label  phase.  Men satisfying the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) criteria for premature ejaculation (PE) who had a baseline IELT ≤ 1 minute in at least 2 of the first 3 sexual encounters during screening were eligible to enrol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical trials have shown Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora to increase the intra-vaginal ejaculatory latency time  (IELT),  increase  control  over  ejaculation  and  reduce  the  feelings  of  distress  in  patients  with premature  ejaculation  as  measured  by  the  Index  of  Premature  Ejaculation  (IPE).    The  medicinal product has a rapid onset of action and is effective within 5 minutes of application.  The effectiveness of the medicinal product has been demonstrated to persist on repeat use over time.

The effectiveness of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in treating PE was assessed by measuring IELT and the co primary endpoints of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and distress using the IPE.  During the 3 months of the double-blind treatment phase, the geometric mean IELT increased from 0.58 to 3.17 minutes in the Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora group and from 0.56 to 0.94 minutes in the placebo group.  85.2%  of  subjects  in  the  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  group  achieved  a  mean  IELT  of &gt; 1 minute over the course of 3 months of treatment with it, whereas 46.4% of the placebo subjects had a mean IELT of &gt; 1 minute.  66.2% of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora-treated subjects and 18.8% of placebo-treated subjects achieved a mean IELT &gt; 2 minutes.

The clinically significant increases in IELT were paralleled by significant differences in the IPE scores (p &lt;0.0001).  Adjusted mean change scores (Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora vs. placebo) at Month 3 were 8.2 vs. 2.2 for the ejaculatory control score, 7.2 vs. 1.9 for the sexual satisfaction score, and 3.7 vs. 1.1 for the distress score.

In Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora-treated subjects, IELT and IPE scores increased at the first measured timepoint.  Both IELT and IPE scores continued to increase slightly more throughout the remainder of the double-blind phase.  The positive changes in IELT and IPE domain scores were maintained during the open-label treatment phase.

At each of the three monthly assessments all subjects completed a Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) questionnaire  relating  to  perceived  control  over  ejaculation,  personal  distress  related  to  ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, and interpersonal difficulty relating to ejaculation. The PEP scores followed a similar pattern of improvement to the IELT and IPE scores.  For all of the three monthly assessments completed by the subjects, there was a significant difference between Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora and placebo (p &lt; 0.0001).  Partners completed the PEP questionnaire at month three.  There was  also  a  significant  difference  over  placebo  in  all  domains  for  the  responses  from  the  partners (p &lt; 0.0001).

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The clinical safety analysis of the use of 30 mg PSD502 in subjects with premature ejaculation (PE) and their sexual partners is based on ten studies, including:

- four controlled PE studies (PSD502-PE-001 - pilot study, PSD502-PE-002 - pivotal study + PK, PSD502-004 - pivotal study, and PSD502-PE-005 - Dose ranging study)
- one uncontrolled PE study (ANAE-059-00 - open-label pilot)
- three studies in healthy volunteers (PSD502-PE-003 in healthy male volunteers and PSD502PE-006 and PSD502-PE-007 in healthy female volunteers)
- two non-PE studies in pain management (PSD502-PM-001 in patients undergoing skin grafts as treatment for burns and PSD502-UP-001 in patients undergoing hysteroscopy).

For the integrated safety analysis, the following analysis populations were used: PSD502 Glans-penistreated  Subjects,  Controlled  PE  Studies,  Uncontrolled  Long-term  PE  Studies,  other  studies  (dose-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ranging  study,  healthy  male  and  female  volunteer  studies,  pilot  PE  study  ANAE-059-00  and  non-PE studies).

The  PSD502  Glans-penis-treated  Subjects  population  (subjects  who  received  repeated  doses  of PSD502  to  the  glans  penis),  and  their  female  sexual  partners  were  the  primary  safety  analysis population.  Data from 'other studies' are considered as supportive only.

Safety  analysis  has  been  provided  both  for  the  primary  safety  analysis  population  and  for  those patients included in the controlled trials. In addition, safety analysis for the long-term studies and the dose-ranging study is provided.

The safety profile of PSD502 was established by assessing:

- the incidence of adverse events in subjects and their female sexual partners
- the effects of PSD502 on vital sign assessments, clinical laboratory results, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results for subjects enrolled in the ten studies
- haemoglobin (Hb) adduct levels in a subset of subjects in study PSD502-PE-002 to evaluate potential toxicity of lidocaine/prilocaine metabolites.

## Patient exposure

## Overall patient exposure

In the pivotal studies, nearly 332 men were exposed to 30mg PSD502 for 3 months in the double blind phase, with 182 being exposed for 12 months in the open-label phase.

A total of 658  subjects received at least one dose of PSD502 across the 8 studies providing safety data in the integrated analysis. Of the 658 subjects who received PSD502:

- 596 (90.6%) were in the PSD502 Glans-penis-treated Subjects population
- 419 (63.7%) were in the Controlled PE Studies population
- 497 (75.5%) were in the Uncontrolled Long Term PE Studies population
- 35 (5.3%) were in the dose-ranging study
- 12 (1.8%) were healthy male volunteers
- 39 (5.9%) were healthy female volunteers
- 17 (2.6%) were in the single dose non-PE studies.

Most of the glans-penis treated subjects (91.7%) received at least 4 doses of the product and around 50%  of  them  were  given  at  least  32  doses.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  was  203  days (approximately 7 months).

The total number of female sexual partners in the PSD502 Glans-penis-subjects population is 584.

- -Extent of exposure

In the PSD502 Glans-penis-treated Subjects population, 91.7% of subjects received at least 4 doses and 50.5% received at least 32 doses of PSD502 30 mg. The mean number of doses was 40 (median: 33 doses) with a maximum of 197 doses administered. The proportion of subjects who participated in the studies for at least 2 months was 81.4% and those who participated for at least 5 months was 66.1%.  The  mean  length  of  time  PSD502  Glans-penis-treated  subjects  participated  in  the  studies was 203 days (approximately 7 months) with a median of 216 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Controlled PE Studies population, 89.3% of  subjects received more than 4 doses and 57.6% received more than 12 doses of PSD502 30 mg. The mean number of doses was 14.9 (median: 14 doses) with a maximum of 31 doses administered. The proportion of subjects who participated in the studies  for  more  than  2  months  was  84.4%.  The  mean  length  of  time  subjects  participated  in  the studies was 70.7 days with a median of 78 days.

## Adverse events

- -Overall analysis of Adverse Events/common adverse events

## · Controlled PE Studies population

In the controlled PE studies population less patients (16.2%) reported at least one TEAE. The TEAEs distribution was similar or slightly lower to the previously mentioned: erectile dysfunction (3.3% vs 0 in placebo group), hypoaesthesia (2.6% vs 0), genital erythema (0.5% vs 0), ejaculation failure (0.5% vs 0) and genital burning sensation (0.2% vs 0.4%). Slightly lower incidence of TEAEs was observed for the long-term studies population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data for the dose ranging trial show a dose-related increase of adverse events, being all TEAEs more frequent with the dose of 53 mg.

Given the mechanism of action of the components (lidocaine and prilocaine) of PSD502 and the topical route of administration, these local TEAEs reported are not unexpected.

Additionally,  some  systemic  adverse  events  were  also  observed  in  the  PSD502  Glans-penis-treated Subjects population such as nasopharyngitis (2.7%), headache (2.3%) and influenza (1.3%).

## · Female partners

A total of 83 of the 584 ( 14.2% ) female sexual partners in the PSD502 Glans-penis treated Subjects population had at least one TEAE during the studies. The most common (≥1.0%) partner TEAEs in the PSD502  Glans-penis-treated Subjects population were vulvovaginal burning sensation (3.9%), headache (1.9%), influenza (1.2%), nasopharyngitis (1.2%), hypoaesthesia (1.0%), and vulvovaginal discomfort (1.0%).

In the controlled studies, similar incidences were reported for patients treated with PSD502 included in the controlled trials. The most common sexual partner TEAE was vulvovaginal burning sensation (4.5% in the PSD502 group vs. 0.8% in placebo group).

In  general,  most  of  the  drug-related  events  occurred  immediately,  or  within  24  hours,  following treatment with PSD502.

In the dose-ranging Study, higher incidences were again seen, mainly with the 53 mg dose for which 17.6% of patients reported drug-related TEAEs in comparison to 11.4% with 30 mg PSD502 dose.

Souurce:Section2.7.4.7,Table101

Most  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate.  Seven  subjects  (1.2%)  in  the  Glans-penis-treated  subject population had at least one severe TEAE.  Erectile dysfunction occurred in 3 patients (0.5%) and was considered  related  to  treatment.  Other  severe  TEAEs  related  to  study  drug  were  impaired  glucose tolerance, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. One case of hypoaesthesia was reported in the dose-ranging trial with the 53 mg dose, a higher dose that the one recommended for this intended indication.

The  following  AEs  were  considered  severe  but  unrelated  to  study  drug:  myocardial  infarction, toothache, tooth infection and back pain.

## · Female partners

Vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  was  the  commonest  likely  drug-related  TEAE  (8.6%)  this  is  not unexpected considering the topical administration of the drug.

A total of 8 subjects experienced serious adverse events; 6 subjects in PSD502-PE-002, 1 subject in PSD502-PE-004, and 1 subject in PSD502-PM-001. All of the serious adverse events were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment with study drug.

TEAEs were also collected for female sexual partners. The most common were vulvovaginal burning sensation (3.9%), headache (1.9%), influenza (1.2%), nasopharyngitis (1.2%), hypoaesthesia (1.0%), and vulvovaginal discomfort (1.0%). Similar incidences were reported for patients treated with PSD502 included in the controlled trials.

Vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  was  the  commonest  likely  drug-related  TEAE  (8.6%)  what  is  not unexpected considering the topical administration of the drug. Six patients (1%) reported at least one severe TEAE.

Only  3  female  sexual  partners  experienced  serious  adverse  events,  which  were  not  considered treatment-related (cardiac failure secondary to desmopressin, pneumotorax and ovarian cyst) what is reassuring.

## Laboratory findings

No meaningful changes in any laboratory parameter were observed.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

Haematology and chemistry laboratory tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each study. Only single cases of abnormal determinations of laboratory results (bicarbonate and hematocrit levels) were reported for all the studies (controlled, uncontrolled, healthy female/male volunteer studies).

## Vital Signs and ECG findings

In the primary safety analysis population two subjects reported elevations of blood pressure during the study and one patient had a shift to abnormal ECG results and the end of study. In the controlled study population the shift from normal to abnormal ECG was comparable in the group treated with PSD502 (3.3%) and placebo (4.1%).

## Safety in special populations

No specific in special populations were conducted.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No in vivo drug interaction studies have been carried out with PSD502. However, although PSD502 is a novel spray, the components lidocaine and prilocaine, have been used extensively in both topical and systemic formulations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on reports in the literature from experience with lidocaine and prilocaine:

- -Lidocaine may interact with anti-arrhythmic compounds; generally, toxic effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs are additive and potentially synergistic so should be avoided.
- -Prilocaine given concomitantly with drugs such as sulfonamides or anti-malarial drugs may result in a predisposition to methaemoglobinaemia.

Four  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  PSD502  on  condoms,  the  cervical  cap,  the contraceptive diaphragm, and the female condom. Briefly, it was found that the integrity of the male condom, the cervical cap, and diaphragm (all latex rubber-based) were not affected by exposure to PSD502. However, the female condom (polyurethane based) showed an effect on tensile strength and elongation  of  break  testing  following  exposure  to  PSD502,  and  an  increased  incidence  of  punctured devices. Therefore, the latex-based male condom, the cervical cap, and the diaphragm can be used as effective contraceptives in the presence of PSD502, but not polyurethane-based barrier contraceptives.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

A total of 5 subjects discontinued from a study early due to TEAEs; 2 subjects from PSD502-PE-002, 2 subjects from PSD502-PE-004, and 1 subject from PSD502-UP-001. Three of the subjects discontinued early because of erectile dysfunction. These 3 events were considered related to the study drug. One of these patients also had hypoaesthesia.

## · Female sexual partners leading to early discontinuation

Two subjects discontinued early because of TEAEs experienced by their sexual partners; one partner from PSD502-PE-002 and one from PSD502-PE-004. Partner events leading to early discontinuation were both genital complaints (vulvovaginal discomfort and vulvovaginal burning sensation) and were considered by the investigators to be related to treatment with study drug.

## Post marketing experience

No post-marketing experience exists to date as PSD502 spray is not on the market. However, lidocaine and  prilocaine  are  marketed  worldwide  in  various  topical  formulations,  including  creams,  gels  and solutions, which are available over-the-counter or by prescription only depending on their concentration and use. A eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine is marketed as EMLA cream and EMLA anaesthetic disc (a patch formulation).

As PSD502 is a mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine for topical use, one would expect a toxicity profile similar to that of EMLA cream (a mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine, although in different proportions to PSD502). EMLA cream contains 2.5% lidocaine w/w (25 mg/g) and 2.5% prilocaine (25 mg/g), and it is approved as a local anaesthetic for topical use to produce surface anaesthesia of the skin, and for topical use on the genital mucosa to facilitate the removal of warts in adults.

The most commonly reported events (&gt;1%) with the use of EMLA cream on genital mucosa have been transient  local  reactions  such  as  erythema,  oedema,  paleness,  and  an  initial,  usually  mild,  burning sensation, itch, or warmth at the application site. Local paraesthesia such as tingling at the application site has been reported as an uncommon event (&gt;0.1% and &lt;1%), and allergic reactions have been reported as rare events (&lt;0.1%). Allergic reactions to the amide group of local anaesthetics are rare. Occasional reports of contact sensitivity to lidocaine have been reported, and cross reactivity between lidocaine and prilocaine has also been described.

Metabolites of lidocaine and prilocaine include anilines such as 2,6-xylidine and o -toluidine, respectively, which are toxic at high levels. Symptoms of aniline poisoning include methaemoglobinaemia,  headache,  paraesthesia,  hyperalgesia,  poly  neuritis,  cardiac  arrhythmias, dizziness, hypotension, convulsion, muscle weakness, and/or digestive derangement.

A  contraindication  of  the  use  of  Lidocaine  has  been  introduced  in  the  PI  in  individuals  with hypovolaemia,  heart  block  or  other  conduction  disturbances,  and  hepatic  impairment  (may  lead  to increased plasma levels and known hypersensitivity to amide-type local anaesthetics). A contraindication of the  use  of Prilocaine is also added  in  PI  in  individuals  with  anaemia  or methaemoglobinaemia  (congenital  or  idiopathic)  and  known  hypersensitivity  to  amide-type  local anaesthetics.  A  warning  has  been  added  in  the  SmpC  for  individuals  with  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency who are more susceptible to drug-induced methaemoglobinaemia.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The primary safety analysis population was the glans-penis treated subjects (n=658) that included all patients  enrolled  in  PE  studies  plus  the  studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  All  those  patients  received  at least one dose of PSD502. Most of them (91.7%) received at least 4 doses of the product and around 50% of them were given 32 doses. The mean duration of exposure was 203 days (approximately 7 months).  The  size  of  the  safety  database  and  the  duration  of  exposure  are  considered  sufficient, although not very extensive enough for the evaluation of the safety profile of the medicinal product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety analysis has been also provided for the controlled trial populations, the long-term studies and the dose-ranging study.

About a quarter of patients (n=138, 23.2%) of the primary safety analysis population reported at least one TEAE. The commonest TEAEs were hypoaesthesia (4.5%), erectile dysfunction (4.4%), nasopharyngitis (2.7%), headache (2.3%), influenza (1.3%), and genital burning sensation (1.0%). Incidences were a bit lower in the controlled trials and the long-term studies. The adverse events are incorporated in section 4.8 in the SmPC.

In 55 subjects (9.2%) of the primary safety analysis population TEAEs were related to the reproductive system and breast disorders system organ class, what is expected given the mechanism of action and the topical administration of PSD502. The most frequent TEAEs were hypoaesthesia (4.5%), erectile dysfunction (4.4%), genital burning sensation (1.0%), genital erythema (0.5%) and ejaculation failure (0.3%). In the controlled PE studies population less patients (16.2%) reported at least one TEAE but a similar incidence was observed. Slightly lower incidence of TEAEs was observed for in the long-term studies. Data for the dose ranging trial show a dose-related increase of adverse events, being all TEAEs more frequent with the dose of 53 mg.

Fifty-seven subjects (9.6%) in the primary safety analysis population had a TEAE that was considered to  be  drug-related  and  they  were  in  relation  to  the  local  administration  of  the  product  and  its mechanism of action: hypoaesthesia (4.5%), erectile dysfunction (4.4%) and genital burning sensation (1.0%). Most of the drug-related events occurred immediately, or within 24 hours, following treatment with PSD502. A clear dose-related incidence of TEAEs was observed in the dose-ranging study with higher incidences seen mainly with the 53 mg dose for which 17.6% of patients reported drug-related TEAEs in comparison to 11.4% with 30 mg PSD502 dose.

Most of TEAEs were mild or moderate. Seven subjects (1.2%) had at least one severe TEAE.  Erectile dysfunction  occurred  in  3  patients  (0.5%)  and  was  considered  related  to  treatment.  Other  severe TEAEs related to study drug were impaired glucose tolerance, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. One case of hypoaesthesia was reported in the dose-ranging trial with the 53 mg dose, a higher dose that the one recommended for this intended indication. The following AEs were considered severe but unrelated to study drug: myocardial infarction, toothache, tooth infection and back pain.

There were no relevant differences regarding the nature of the TEAEs observed in healthy volunteers.

TEAEs  were  also  collected  for  female  sexual  partners.  The  commonest  were  vulvovaginal  burning sensation (3.9%), headache (1.9%), influenza (1.2%), nasopharyngitis (1.2%), hypoaesthesia (1.0%), and vulvovaginal discomfort (1.0%). Similar incidences were reported for patients treated with PSD502 included in the controlled trials. Vulvovaginal burning sensation was the commonest likely drug-related TEAE (8.6%) what is not unexpected considering the topical administration of the drug. Six patients (1%) reported at least one severe TEAE. Only 3 sexual partners experienced serious adverse events and  these  were  not  considered  treatment-related  (cardiac  failure  secondary  to  desmopressin, pneumothorax and ovarian cyst) what is reassuring. There is no data if inadvertent dosing to other sites  (or  used  in  other  mucoses)  occur  although  no  differences  regarding  adverse  events  in  genital mucosa are to be expected. This is adequately addressed in the RMP.

Only single cases of abnormal determinations of laboratory results (bicarbonate and hematocrit levels) were reported for all the studies what is considered reassuring.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the primary safety analysis population two subjects reported elevations of blood pressure during the study and one patient had a shift to abnormal ECG results at the end of study. In the controlled study population the shift from normal to abnormal ECG was comparable in the group treated with PSD502 (3.3%) and placebo (4.1%) what is reassuring.

Overall, 90% of patients included in the controlled trials were younger than 55 years, and a limited number of patients were older than 65 years. The younger age group representation is relevant as PE is more common. However, it cannot be ruled out that the limited participation of patients older than 65 years of age have an impact on the safety profile of PSD502 as ED is also more frequent in the older  population  and  it  is  a  known  AE  for  this  combination  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine.  This  issue  is properly addressed in the RMP as missing information.

ED and hypoaesthesia occurred more frequently in uncircumcised subjects. Ejaculation failure (0.7%) and  genital  erythema  (0.7%)  were  only  observed  in  uncircumcised  subjects  too.  The  Applicant's justification of these differences with respect to circumcised patients is supported.

Five subjects discontinued early due to TEAEs; 3 male subjects due to ED and 2 female sexual partners due to genital complaints.

Although the lidocaine/prilocine spray is not available on the market anywhere, there is an authorised product for topical use containing a mixture of lidocaine and proilocaine (EMLA®) in different indication and  concentrations.  Similar  local  reactions  (erytema,  burning  sensation,  paresthesia)  have  been reported post-marketing, all of them linked to the mechanism of action of both active substances and the  topical  use.  However,  whereas  EMLA  is  going  to  be  used  in  specific  occasions,  i.e.  minor interventions or surgical interventions, Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora is expected to be used for chronic and intermittent use and indicated for the treatment of PE. As it is known that the use of prilocaine may result in a predisposition to methaemoglobinaemia and there is carcinogenicity potential from o -toluidine metabolite in humans, a prolonged exposure and the possible accumulation of lidocaine/prilocaine  following  repeated  doses  could  lead  to  a  higher  incidence  of  these  potentially negative events. This concern has been adequately justified by the Applicant. Data provided revealed that  the  potential  occurrence  of  methaemoglobinaemia  from  prilocaine  and  the  carcinogenicity  risk from o-toluidine following PSD502 administration seem to be negligible. No cases were reported during clinical  studies  and  no  considerable  accumulation of prilocaine or o -toluidine  seems to be expected following repeated administrations of PSD502. However, since these risks cannot be ruled out in the intended  population,  it  has  been  reflected  in  the  RMP  and  a  warning  and  additional  information  is included in the PI.

Of note, a concern related to the potential risks for the foetus in pregnant women was also raised. After the assessment of further information provided by the Applicant, this risk seems to be negligible. However, there are limited data in pregnant women and therefore this concern is considered at present unknown. This has been reflected the RMP as well as the PI.

Known interactions of lidocaine and prilocaine have already been included in the proposed SmPC as well as warnings related to these interactions.

The Applicant was requested to include some additional amendments in the proposed SmPC:

- -Information related to the compatibility of PSD502 and latex rubber-based contraceptives or polyurethane based contraceptives under section 4.4. It is considered that this information is relevant for a safe use of PSD502 cutaneous spray.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Information on pregnancy taking into account that  there is limited information that offers a reassuring safety profile during pregnancy and lactation in humans.

The above requirements have been adequately addressed in the corresponding sections of the SmPC.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

No  relevant  concerns  seem  to  have  been  identified  in  the  clinical  development  of  PSD502  for premature ejaculation. Most of adverse events reported were mild or moderate in intensity and mainly localized  reactions  related  to  the  local  administration  and  mechanism  of  action  of  the  product (hypoaesthesia, erectile dysfunction (ED), genital burning sensation, genital erythema and ejaculation failure).  Given  the  mechanism  of  action  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  and  the  topical  route  of administration, these local TEAEs reported are not unexpected.

Few cases were considered severe (3 cases of ED, impaired glucose tolerance, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipidaemia  and  hypertension)  all  of  them  considered  related  to  the  studied  medicinal  product. Some systemic adverse events were also observed such as nasopharyngitis, headache and influenza.

Overall,  the  female  sexual  partners  also  had  TEAEs,  some  localised  and  related  to  the  local administration of the product (vulvovaginal burning sensation, vulvovaginal discomfort and hypoaesthesia) and other systemic (headache, influenza, nasopharyngitis). There is no data in male sexual partners although no differences regarding adverse events in genital mucosa are to be expected. This is properly addressed in the RMP as important potential risk.

Overall,  PSD502 has an apparently benign and manageable safety profile. Furthermore, it is known that  the  use  of  prilocaine  may  result  in  a  predisposition  to  methaemoglobinaemia  and  there  is carcinogenicity potential from o -toluidine metabolite in humans, a prolonged exposure could lead to a higher incidence of these potentially negative events. The potential occurrence of these risks seem to be  negligible  although  cannot  be  ruled  out.  A  specific  wording  is  included  to  reflect  these  risks  in product  information  and  RMP.  Similarly,  a  concern  related  to  the  potential  risks  for  the  foetus  in pregnant  women  was  also  raised.  Given  the  limited  data  available,  some  recommendations  are provided in the product information.

In addition, the fact that very few patients older than 65 years (less than 10%) were included in the controlled  trials  raises  a  concern  regarding  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  this  product  in  this  specific population. This is reflected in the RMP as missing information.

Finally, there are some additional risks that have been reflected in the updated PI such as the possible effect on male fertility (sperm mobility), the inadvertent dosing to other sites and the potential for offlabel use that are adequately reflected in the RMP.

Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures)

The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed  postauthorisation  PhV  development  plan  is  not  sufficient  to  identify  and  characterise  the  risks  of  the product and the MAA should perform as an additional PV measure detailed in the RMP an updated Drug utilisation  study  aimed  to  characterise  real  clinical  practice  and  the  patients  who  are  prescribed  the product. This study should take into account the following:

- The sample should be representative of the prescription patterns of the product in real life conditions. The proposed sample size should be stated.

-  The  potential  bias  introduced  by  a  selection  of  investigators  should  be  specifically  addressed  and prevented in the study design.

- A design including a full retrospective collection of data using existing data sources would be a valid approach.

- The detailed description of the information that will be collected will depend on the data source and amended as appropriate.

Further minor amendments to the PhV plan are detailed in section 4.

The  PRAC  also  considered  that  routine  PhV  is  sufficient  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk minimisation measures.

| Routine risk minimisation measures   | (Proposed) text in SmPC • Precautions for use included in section 4.4: Care should be taken not to allow Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora to come in contact with the eye, as it may cause eye irritation. Also the loss of protective reflexes can permit corneal irritation and potential abrasion. Absorption of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in conjunctival tissues has not been determined. If contact with the eye occurs, immediately rinse the eye with water or sodium chloride solution and protect it until sensation returns. Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora sprayed onto mucous membranes of the patient or their partner, such as the mouth, nose and throat, or transferred onto female genitalia or anal lining, could be absorbed and temporary local numbness/anaesthesia is likely to result. This hypoaesthesia may mask normal pain sensations and, therefore, increase the dangers of localised injury. A higher rate of erectile dysfunction and male genital hypoaesthesia may be experienced when using Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora with male condoms. • Described as one of most frequent of ADRs in male patients and female partners in section 4.8: Summary of the safety profile The most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of this medicinal product in male patients were local effects of genital hypoaesthesia (4.5%) and erectile dysfunction (4.4%).

Vulvovaginal discomfort or burning sensation caused discontinuation of treatment in 0.3% of subjects.  - Listed in section 4.8 under frequency category of 'Common'.  ## (Proposed) text in Package Leaflet:  - Warnings and precautions included in section 2:  When you use this medicine, particularly during priming of the container, aim the container away from the face to avoid accidental contact with ears, eyes, nose and mouth.  If some medicine accidentally gets into your eyes or your partner's eyes, rinse them immediately with cold water or saline solution and cover them gently until any effects, such as numbness, wear off. Be aware that normal protective mechanisms, such as blinking, or sensation of a foreign body in the eye, may not occur until the numbness has worn off.  Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora may also come into contact with other mucous membranes such as your, or your partner's, mouth, nose and throat, causing them to feel slightly numb for a short while.  As this will reduce the ability to feel pain in these areas, extra care should be taken not to injure them until the numbness has worn off.  During sexual intercourse, a small amount of this medicine may be transferred e.g. to the vagina or the anus.  Therefore, both partners may feel slight numbness for a short while and should take care not to injure themselves, particularly during sexual activity.  - Increased incidence of hypoaesthesia with condom use highlighted in section 2:  ## Other medicines and Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora  If you use Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora with condoms, you may be more likely to be unable to develop or maintain an erection.  You may also be more likely to have reduced feeling in and around the penis.  - Listed in section 4 as 'Common' side-   |

| Routine risk minimisation measures   | (Proposed) text in SmPC • The following information is included in section 4.6: Women of childbearing potential / contraception in male and females Patients hoping to achieve conception should either avoid using Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora, or, if it is essential to achieve penetration, should wash the glans penis as thoroughly as possible prior to intercourse. Fertility There are no adequate data from the use of lidocaine and prilocaine on fertility in humans. A study in rats showed that Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora caused a reduction in sperm motility. This medicinal product may reduce the possibility of pregnancy, but should not be used as a contraceptive. • The following information is included in section 5.3: Effect on fertility In an in vitro study of rats Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora has shown a reduction in sperm motility when 22.5 mg lidocaine and 7.5 mg prilocaine (i.e. the amount of 1 human dose) was in direct contact with rat sperm. However this study did not reproduce the circumstances of clinical use, as the concentration of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in direct contact with the sperm would be many fold lower. The potential for reduction of sperm motility following the clinical use of Lidocaine/Prilocaine the medicinal product cannot be excluded; therefore it is not possible to state whether Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora would prevent pregnancy.

| Methaemoglobinaemia may be accentuated in patients already taking medicinal products known to induce the condition, e.g. sulphonamides, acetanilid, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, metoclopramide, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine and quinine (see section 4.4). The risk of additional systemic toxicity should be considered when large doses of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora are applied to patients already using other local anaesthetics or structurally related medicinal products e.g. class I anti-arrhythmics such as mexiletine. Specific interaction studies with lidocaine/prilocaine and anti-arrhythmic medicinal products class III (e.g. amiodarone) have not been performed, but caution is advised (see also section 4.4). Medicinal products that reduce the clearance of lidocaine (e.g. cimetidine or betablockers) may cause potentially toxic plasma concentrations when lidocaine is given intravenously in repeated high doses over a long time period (30 hours). • Symptoms of systemic toxicities and treatments are included in section 4.9: Prilocaine in high doses may cause an increase in the methaemoglobin level particularly in conjunction with methaemoglobin-inducing agents (e.g. sulphonamides). Clinically significant methaemoglobinaemia should be treated with a slow intravenous injection of methylthioninium chloride. Should other symptoms of systemic toxicity occur, the signs are anticipated to be similar in nature to those following the administration of local anaesthetics by other routes. Local anaesthetic toxicity is manifested by symptoms of nervous system excitation and, in severe cases, central nervous and cardiovascular depression. Severe neurological symptoms (convulsions, CNS depression) must be treated symptomatically by respiratory support and the administration of anticonvulsive medicinal products. | Methaemoglobinaemia may be accentuated in patients already taking medicinal products known to induce the condition, e.g. sulphonamides, acetanilid, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, metoclopramide, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine and quinine (see section 4.4).

|                  | • Warnings and precautions are provided in section 2: Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora - if you, or your sexual partner, have been diagnosed with a genetic disease or other condition affecting your red blood cells (glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, anaemia or methaemoglobinaemia) - if you have a history of medicine sensitivities, especially if you are not certain which medicine causes sensitivity - if you suffer from severe liver problems • Other medicines which may interact with PSD502 or increase the risk of methaemoglobinaemia are listed in section 2 under heading Other medicines and Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora • Symptoms of systemic toxicity are provided in section 3: If you use more Lidocaine/Prilocaine than you should Symptoms of using too much Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora are listed below. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any of these. They are very unlikely to happen if it is used as instructed: • Feeling light-headed or dizzy • Tingling of the skin around the mouth and numbness of the tongue • Abnormal taste • Blurred vision • Ringing in the ears • There is also a risk of a disorder reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood (methaemoglobinaemia). This is more likely when certain medicines have been taken at the same time. If this happens, the skin becomes bluish-grey due to a lack of oxygen. In serious cases of overdose, symptoms may include fits, low blood pressure, slowed breathing, stopped breathing and altered heart beat. These effects may be life-threatening. |

| Routine risk minimisation measures   | (Proposed) text in SmPC The following information is provided to the prescriber: • section 4.6: Pregnancy There are no or limited amount of data from the use of lidocaine and prilocaine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora during pregnancy unless effective male barrier contraceptive measures are taken in order to avoid potential foetal exposure.. • Section 5.3: Reproductive toxicity Lidocaine No teratogenic effects were observed in studies of embryonic/foetal development in rats and rabbits receiving doses during organogenesis. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at doses toxic to the mother. The postnatal survival time of the offspring of rats treated during pregnancy and lactation with a dose toxic to the mother was shown to be reduced. Prilocaine In a study of pregnant rats receiving a combination of lidocaine and prilocaine during organogenesis, no effects on embryonic/foetal development were observed. There are however no systemic exposure data available for comparison with clinical exposure.

|                 | medicinal products known to induce the condition, e.g. sulphonamides, acetanilid, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, metoclopramide, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, quinine (see section 4.4). The risk of additional systemic toxicity shouldbeconsideredwhenlargedoses of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora are applied topatients alreadyusing otherlocal anaesthetics or structurally related medicinal products e.g. class I anti- arrhythmics such as mexiletine. Specific interaction studies with lidocaine/prilocaine and anti-arrhythmic medicinal products class III (e.g. amiodarone) have not been performed, but caution is advised (see also section 4.4). Medicinal products that reduce the clearance of lidocaine (e.g. cimetidine or betablockers) may cause potentially toxic plasma concentrationswhenlidocaine is given intravenously in repeated high doses over a long time period (30 hours). Symptoms of systemic toxicities and treatments are included in section 4.9: Prilocaine in high doses may cause an increase in themethaemoglobinlevel particularly in conjunction with methaemoglobin-inducing agents (e.g. sulphonamides). Clinically significant methaemoglobinaemia should be treated with a slow intravenous injection of methylthioninium chloride. Should other symptoms of systemic toxicity occur, the signs are anticipated to be similar in nature to those following the administration of local anaesthetics by other routes. Local anaesthetic toxicity is manifested by symptoms of nervous system excitation and, in severe cases, centralnervous and cardiovascular depression. Severe neurological symptoms (convulsions,CNS depression) must be treated symptomatically by respiratory support and the administration of anticonvulsive medicinal products. |                                        |

As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora during pregnancy unless effective male barrier contraceptive measures are taken in order to avoid potential foetal exposure.. Section 5.3: Reproductive toxicity Lidocaine No teratogenic effects were observed in studies of embryonic/foetal development in rats and rabbits receiving doses during organogenesis. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at doses toxic to the mother. The postnatal survival time of the offspring of rats treated during pregnancy and lactation with a dose toxic to the mother was shown to be reduced. Prilocaine In a study of pregnant rats receiving a combination of lidocaine and prilocaine during organogenesis, no effects on embryonic/foetal development were observed. There are however no systemic exposure data available for comparison with clinical exposure.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted:

1. The DUS study should not be classified as category 2 and should be categorised as category 3 study. In the milestones a planned date for the submission of the final report should be also provided

2. Table III.5.1 should be a complete overview of all on-going and planed studies in categories 1-3. Routine pharmacovigilance activities should not be included. Therefore, in this case, the only additional PhV activity planned by the MAH that should be included in this table is the Drug Utilization Study.

## 2.9. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Premature Ejaculation is a sexual dysfunction in men with a significant negative psychological impact leading  to  distress  and  reduced  sexual  satisfaction  in  both  the  patient  and  their  partners.  Limited therapeutic alternatives are currently available in the EU for this condition. PSD502 is a mixture of two local anaesthetics - lidocaine and prilocaine for the topical treatment of PE.

Two pivotal trials have been provided to support the efficacy and safety of the product. In both trials efficacy was primarily based on the effect on as intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and the improvement  of  the  control  over  ejaculation  during  sexual  intercourse,  sexual  satisfaction  and  the reduction of the distress related to ejaculation (IPE domains) addressing the multidimensional profile of the  condition.  Results  showed  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  of  PSD502  in objective measures as intravaginal latency time and also perceived as a benefit by the subjects and their partners.

Long-term efficacy data of PSD502 are available coming from the open-label phases of the two pivotal trials and results do not suggest loss of efficacy.

The ease and convenience of application just 5 minutes prior to intercourse would result in increased spontaneity and therefore greater sexual satisfaction.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The pivotal studies have been carried out in heterosexual men who were in a monogamous relationship for  at  least  3  months  prior  to  study  entry.  The  effect  of  PSD502  in  homosexual  men  (with  single/ multiple partners), and heterosexual men with multiple partners has not been studied. As in the latter case, a psychological element may also be involved, the effect of PSD502 alone may not be sufficient. However based on the results of the studies presented here, there is no reason to believe that PSD502 may not show similar effects in these groups too.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The risk derived from an increased absorption through damaged mucosa or when a condom is used could be of concern. Condoms are widely used as contraceptive measure and/or with casual partners and the lack of information on the effect of condoms on the absorption of PSD502 is of concern. In this respect, the clarifications submitted by the Applicant do not suggest a negative effect on the efficacy or safety profile of the product. However, the limitations of the data provided prevent from reaching valid conclusions  on  this  issue.  Given  that  a  higher  rate  of  local  numbness  and  loss  of  erection  could  be reasonably  expected  when  condoms  are  concomitantly  used,  patients  are  warned  in  the  Product Information.

Although there are some data on the use of PSD502 at 12 months that do not suggest loss of efficacy the  evidence  regarding  the  maintenance  of  the  effect  of  PSD502  is  considered  limited.  Additionally, only 30 mg dose has been sufficiently studied. No posology recommendation based on clinical data can be offered to subjects requiring dose adjustment in case of reporting insufficient effect or if adverse (tolerability) events occur.

Demographic characteristics do not appear to influence on the response except for the age, younger subjects reporting greater benefit than older patients. However, the limited number of subjects older than  65  years  and  even  55  years  included  in  clinical  trials  does  not  allow  to  determine  if  such differences in fact exist. This limitation is reflected in the SmPC.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  safety  profile  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  for  both  male  glans-penis-treated  subjects and female  partners  appears  to  be  benign  and  manageable  since  adverse  events  observed  during  the clinical trials seem to be expected considering the mechanism of action of both anaesthetics (lidocaine and prilocaine) and the topical administration of this cutaneous solution.

Regarding the safety data presented, the majority of adverse events were local adverse events in the glans  penis:  hypoaesthesia  (4.5%),  erectile  dysfunction  (4.4%),  genital  burning  sensation  (1.0%), genital  erythema  (0.5%)  and  ejaculation  failure  (0.3%).  Hypoaesthesia,  erectile  dysfunction  and genital  burning  sensation  were  considered  to  be  drug-related.  In  addition,  some  systemic  adverse events such as nasopharyngitis (2.7%), headache (2.3%) and influenza (1.3%) were also observed.

With regards to TEAEs reported for female sexual partners, the commonest were vulvovaginal burning sensation  (3.9%),  headache  (1.9%),  influenza  (1.2%),  nasopharyngitis  (1.2%),  hypoaesthesia (1.0%), and vulvovaginal discomfort (1.0%). Vulvovaginal burning sensation was the commonest likely drug-related TEAE.

With respect to the SmPC, there are potential risks caused by both anaesthetics that are adequately addressed  in  the  SmPC  (sections  4.4  and  4.5).  In  addition,  an  appropriate  warning  related  to  the compatibility of PSD502 and latex rubber-based contraceptives or polyurethane based contraceptives has  been  also  included  in  section  4.4  and  section  2  of  the  package  leaflet.  Moreover,  appropriate information regarding fertility, pregnancy and breast-feeding has been implemented by the Applicant in section 4.6 of the SmPC and section 2 of the package leaflet.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Some uncertainties were detected following Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora safety assessment. Despite the  reported  adverse  events  that  were  considered  expected  taking  into  account  the  mechanism  of action  of  both  anaesthetics  and  the  topical  administration  of  this  cutaneous  solution,  some  issues

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

related to the prolonged use of PSD502 were requested to be further clarified. Overall, the potential occurrence  of  methaemoglobinaemia  from  prilocaine  and  carcinogenicity  risk  from o -toluidine  is extremely  unlikely  based  upon  the  clinical  and  non-clinical  information  provided  by  the  Applicant. Although no cases were reported during clinical trials, these risks cannot be ruled out and is reflected in the RMP. A specific wording is included in product information.

Similarly, a concern related to the potential risks for the foetus in pregnant women was also raised. Given the limited data available, some recommendations are provided in the product information.

Finally, concerns related to the possible effect on male fertility, the inadvertent dosing to other sites (or  used  in  other  mucosas)  and  the  potential  for  off-label  use  are  already  included  in  the  RMP. Information concerning the limited number of patients older than 65 years is included in the RMP as missing information. This limitation is adequately reflected in the Product Information.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Lidocaine-prilocaine well-established drug combination, with moderate side effects, with a therapeutic innovative  local  action  through  spray  application  that  produces  'on  demand'  patient  and  partner clinical benefits as defined by objective measures (IELT) and domains from patient reported outcomes in the treatment of PE, which is the commonest sexual complaint in men. The innovative local route of administration  compared  to  currently  authorised  medicinal  product  for  the  treatment  of  PE  mean minimises the systemic drug exposure and possibility of systemic side effects.

## Benefit-risk balance

A statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect has been shown by PSD502 in the treatment of lifelong PE. It has been observed in objective measures as intravaginal latency time and also perceived as  a  benefit  by  the  subjects  and  their  partners.  Also,  indirect  comparison  to  dapoxetine  provides supportive results. The lack of sufficient information regarding the efficacy on elderly subjects and the potential risk associated to the concomitant use of condoms is reflected in the Product Information.

Overall, the safety profile of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora for both male glans-penis-treated subjects and female partners appears to be benign and manageable. The local identified risks reported in this dossier were not unexpected. Concerns initially raised regarding metahaemoglobinemia and carcinogenicity potential have been solved and are adequately addressed in the RMP. Concerning the potential risks for the foetus in pregnant women, more detailed recommendations have been provided in the product information. The possible effect on male fertility, the inadvertent dosing to other sites (or used in other mucoses) and the potential for off-label use are included in the RMP. Moreover, the limited number of patients older than 65 years is reflected in the RMP as missing information.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

The advantages of this topical formulation in the treatment of PE, including the positive psychological outcomes in the patient and their partners are considered to be much higher than the disadvantages of PSD502 in terms of local adverse effects which are generally manageable. The two active substances in PSD502,  Lidocaine/Prilocaine,  are  well  known.  The  availability  of  a  discrete  spray  formulation  is considered as of added value.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall B/R of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora 150 mg/ml + 50 mg/ml cutaneous spray, solution is positive and the application is approvable as the Applicant submitted satisfactory responses to the list of outstanding issues.
