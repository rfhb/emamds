## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Uric acid is the end metabolite in the purine catabolic pathway in humans. In most species, except the great apes, urate oxidase catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. Uric acid, which is poorly soluble in water, is excreted in the urine. When the concentration of serum uric acid (SUA) is above the biochemical limit of solubility, 6.8 mg/dl, i.e. in the status of hyperuricaemia, monosodium urate crystals may precipitate in tissues.

## KRYSTEXXA is indicated for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients refractory to conventional therapy.

Gout is characterized by a constellation of signs and symptoms typified by the occurrence of episodic acute inflammation in and around a joint or joints (a gout flare), the formation of gout tophi, gouty arthritis,  and  uric  acid  nephropathy  (including  uric  acid  renal  stones).  Chronic  gout  is  a  debilitating condition in which pain and dysfunction are caused by an accumulation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in tissues and joint spaces, caused by hyperuricaemia. Hyperuricaemia is defined as a serum urate level ≥ 6.8 mg/dL (404 μmol/L), the limit of urate solubility at physiological temperature and pH. Urate-lowering therapy is the pharmaceutical approach to prevent recurrent flares and the development  of  complications:  xanthine  oxidase  inhibitors,  such  as  allopurinol  or  febuxostat,  which block the synthesis of uric acid; uricosuric agents, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, which are used alone or in combination with allopurinol to enhance the urinary excretion of uric acid in some patients. Although allopurinol is generally well tolerated, patients with gout may fail to normalize their serum uric acid even with the medically appropriate dose of allopurinol. About the product Pegloticase,  the  active  substance  in  Krystexxa,  is  a  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG)-modified  recombinant mammalian uricase of the therapeutic class bio-uricolytic agent. Each subunit of the tetrameric enzyme is conjugated with several strands of a 10 kDa monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG). The rationale for  the  addition  of  mPEG  to  this  molecule  was  to  reduce  the  potential  for  immunogenicity  and  to increase circulation half-life compared to the non-PEGylated porcine enzyme. Uricase catalyses the first step of the conversion of uric acid (UA) into the highly water-soluble endstage  metabolite  allantoin,  which  is  eliminated  by  renal  excretion.  Pegloticase  was  developed  for parenteral therapy of gout in patients refractory or intolerant to conventional treatment with uricostatic or uricosuric drugs. The pharmacokinetic profile of pegloticase is such that sub-saturating SUA levels can be maintained for long periods, which is a precondition for eliminating tissue pools of MSU crystals. The  product  is  a  colourless,  clear,  sterile  solution  containing  8  mg/ml  of  pegloticase.  Pegloticase  is packaged in sterile single-use glass vials filled to deliver 1 ml of study drug. The proposed indication for pegloticase was: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Gout refractory to conventional therapy occurs in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid and  whose  signs  and  symptoms  are  inadequately  controlled  with  xanthine  oxidase  inhibitors  or uricosuric  agents  at  the  maximum  medically  appropriate  dose,  or  for  whom  these  drugs  are contraindicated.

The proposed dose is 8 mg given as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (wks).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The final approved indication is:

'KRYSTEXXA is indicated for the treatment of severe debilitating chronic tophaceous gout in adult patients who may also have erosive joint involvement and who have failed to normalize serum uric acid with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these medicines are contraindicated (see Section 4.4).'

2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction The finished product is a concentrated solution for dilution prior to administration. It is presented as a single-use 2 mL glass vial containing 1 mL of pegloticase solution in normal phosphate buffered saline at  a  concentration  of  32  mg  of  pegloticase/mL,  corresponding  to  8  mg  uricase  protein.  Prior  to administration to the patient by intravenous infusion, 1 mL of the finished product is diluted 1:250 with sterile sodium chloride infusion solution. The active substance is pegloticase, a recombinant uricase of chimeric mammalian origin produced in E. coli to  which  monomethoxy poly (ethylene glycol) (mPEG) has been covalently attached. The active substance is presented as a solution buffered in sodium phosphate and sodium chloride at pH 7.3. Uricase intermediate is a homotetramer of 136.8 kDa, consisting of four identical non-covalently-bound uricase  monomeric  subunits.  Derivatisation  of  uricase  with  monomethoxypoly(ethylene  glycol)-pnitrophenyl carbonate (mPEG-NPC) with an average mass of 10 kDa results in the covalent attachment of an average of 10.2 ± 1.0 strands of mPEG per uricase monomeric subunit or 40.8 ± 4.0 strands of mPEG per uricase homotetramer, resulting in a MW of approx. 545 kDa. 2.2.2. Active Substance (Uricase Intermediate and Pegloticase Active Substance) Manufacture Pegloticase drug substance is manufactured by Bio Technology General, Kiryat Malachi, Israel. Origin, source and history of cells, characterisation and testing Generation of the expression plasmid, the production cell line, the cell banks and its characterisation has been adequately described. Uricase intermediate is produced in an E. coli strain. Characterisation and evaluation of stability of the cell line was based on Master Cell Bank (MCB) and End of Production (EoP) cells. Cell Banking System The cell banking system was established as two-tiered cell bank with a Master Cell Bank (MCB) used to generate the Working Cell Bank (WCB). A protocol for generation of future WCBs is provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Manufacture

The manufacturing process of pegloticase has been described with sufficient detail. It is divided in four main steps:

1.  Fermentation/harvest:  Production  of  the  biomass,  from  thawing  of  a  vial  of  frozen  WCB  to harvesting of the biomass from the main production fermentor;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Recovery: Separation of the biomass from the fermentor broth, disruption of the cells, separation and dissolution of the inclusion bodies containing the target protein;

3. Purification: Isolation and purification of uricase intermediate through several chromatographic and ultrafiltration steps and;

4. Pegylation/purification: Conjugation of mPEG to uricase intermediate and purification of pegloticase.

The fermentation/harvest stage comprises two sequential fermentation runs initiated by inoculation of two shake flasks from one vial of the WCB. At the required OD660 production of uricase is induced. Fermentation continues with supplemental feeds until harvesting is initiated by cooling of the culture followed  by  ultracentrifugation,  diafiltration  and  concentration  to  result  in  a  cell-slurry  intermediate. Uricase is recovered from cells with mechanical disruption supported by lysis of cells with lysozyme to obtain  inclusion  bodies.  Upon  solubilisation  of  inclusion  bodies  uricase  is  recovered  in  its  tetrameric native state. The solubilisate is initially refined through precipitation of process related protein (CPC) to yield crude uricase solubilisate as the retentate. Purification  of  crude  uricase  to  uricase  intermediate  is  achieved  by  several  column  chromatography steps. The function of each step is sufficiently described. The  PEGylation  stage  is  initiated  with  column  chromatography-based  concentration  of  uricase intermediate. The  PEGylation reagent converts the concentrated uricase intermediate pool at predefined reaction conditions to a reaction product containing ~ 40 PEG-strands each of ~ 10 kDa per tetrameric uricase molecule. Application of a further chromatographic purification step and subsequent concentration and diafiltration into the final formulation buffer results in pegloticase active substance that is filled in glass bottles. A traditional approach to development and control of the manufacturing process has been taken. The manufacturing steps are monitored by process controls that are adequately documented. The list of inprocess controls has been amended with a comprehensive list of process parameters including their classification with respect to criticality. These data are used to support the control strategy. Although  the  Applicant  has  not  provided  any  process  characterisation  data  in  the  dossier,  the acceptance and target ranges or set points chosen for the process controls are generally explained and justified  by  the  Applicant's  understanding  derived  from  development  studies  and  the  existing manufacturing experience. The manufacturing process was validated in two separate campaigns both traditionally performed with three  consecutive  lots,  respectively.  The  initial  validation  campaign  focused  on  consistency  of  the manufacturing process in its entirety supported by additional scaled-down validation studies on column resin lifetime and calculation of clearance factors for process-related impurities. PEGylation  conditions  in  the  first  validation  campaign  were  adjusted  to  reach  a  defined  target PEGylation ratio for the uricase molecule of ~ 9 strands/uricase subunit. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Although  the  first  process  validation  campaign  was  successfully  completed  a  critical  aspect  of  this process  validation  campaign  was  a  shift  in  PEGylation  conditions  away  from  those  used  for manufacture of the Phase III clinical batch. The shift intended to reach a level of 9 PEG-strands per molecule subunit. Therefore, the second validation campaign further included a reversion of PEGylation conditions back to those used for manufacture of the Phase III Clinical batch (~ 10 strands /uricase subunit). The second validation campaign was successfully completed as well.

## Manufacturing process development

Process  development  included  six  distinct  stages  of  the  pegloticase  manufacturing  process  ranging from  a  laboratory-scale  process  (pre-development  process),  used  to  prepare  material  for  initial pharmacokinetic studies of the product, via scale-up (development and pilot scale process) to process

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A used for manufacture of the clinical lot. Process B, the proposed commercial process, included a shift in the ratio of PEG  strands/subunit  from  ~10  strands  /  subunit  (Process  A)  to  a  ratio of 9 strands / subunit. Process B material was used in a clinical Phase III follow-up study. In Process C (proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process)  additional  filtration  steps  were  included  and  the PEGylation ratio  was  changed  back  to  ~  10  strands/subunit  (as  in  Process  A).  The  evolution  of  the commercial process C from the development process is described with sufficient detail. Comparability studies were performed to support comparability of pilot scale material with clinical process A material as well as comparability of clinical process A material with both process B and process C material.

Characterisation and Impurities In  general,  appropriate  information  has  been  provided  on  characterisation  of  uricase  intermediate, which has been performed using suitable state-of-the-art analytical methods. Characterisation  studies  comprise  studies  of  the  primary  structure,  modifications  in  the  primary sequence  (disulfide  bonds,  deamidation,  oxidation,  and  acid  isoforms)  as  well  as  studies  on  the presence of high and low molecular weight forms. SEC-HPLC shows that uricase intermediate contains monomer which is comprised of four monomeric subunits,  and  high  molecular  weight  (HMW)  forms  which  include  dimer  and  higher  oligomers.  In addition, the secondary structure as well as the enzymatic potency of uricase intermediate has been investigated. The tetrameric structure of uricase is essential for its catalysis of the oxidative cleavage of uric acid to produce allantoin, carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Uricase intermediate catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. Potential impurities in uricase intermediate are product-related impurities and  process-related impurities.  The  testing  currently  applied  for  the  control  of  product-related  impurities  give  sufficient confidence  on  quality.  In  general,  appropriate  information  has  been  provided  on  characterisation  of Pegloticase  active  substance  which  used  suitable  orthogonal  analytical  methods  and  evaluation  of representative active substance and finished product lots. Characterization studies have also been performed on the pegloticase active substance. The extent and the sites of pegylation have been investigated as well as the enzymatic activity of pegylated uricase. Forced degradation studies have been performed to investigate potential degradation pathways and to conclude on appropriate analytical methods. Information has been provided on the amount of methionine oxidation in pegloticase active substance. The presence of acidic forms was revealed by IEF investigation of the uricase subunit and the apparent heterogeneity in uricase has been addressed with respect to the pegloticase active substance. The near-UV CD spectra used for investigation of the tertiary structure of Pegloticase active substance showed considerable differences between the unpegylated and the pegylated protein. This has been confirmed for a number of batches. Extent of PEGylation was determined and studies show enzymatic activity and immunogenicity as a function of the extent of PEGylation. Specification Medicinal product no longer authorised

Release  testing  of  uricase  intermediate  includes  tests  for  appearance,  pH,  identity,  protein  content, specific activity, isomers, polymeric forms, product-related forms, endotoxin and bioburden.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  general,  the  description  of  the  analytical  methods  is  considered  sufficient.  Non-compendial  tests have  been  validated,  compendial  tests  have  been  qualified.  The  information  provided  on  batch analyses  of  uricase  intermediate  as  well  as  the  provided  justification  of  specification  is  considered acceptable.

Pegloticase  active  substance  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  pH,  osmolality,  identity, mPEG/monomer, specific activity, polymeric forms, product and process-related impurities, endotoxin and bioburden.

Batch data obtained from process B are deemed to be supportive with regard to batch analyses for Pegloticase active substance. References standards of materials Information regarding the qualification program for new Uricase Reference Standard (RS) as well the Pegloticase RS are considered acceptable. Container Closure System The  container  closure  system  for  the  uricase  intermediate  is  a  sterile,  disposable  plastic  bag.  The product contact surface is a low density polyethylene material. The container closure system for the pegloticase drug substance is a clear Type 1 glass bottle with a polypropylene screw cap. Stability The applicant provides stability  data  for two  batches  of  uricase  stored  in  PE  material  substantiating stability of uricase over the proposed hold time of 54 days at 2-8 °C. Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf-life of the Pegloticase active substance of 6 months when stored at 2-8°C is acceptable. In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out-of-specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product Krystexxa finished product is a colourless, clear to slightly opalescent, sterile solution containing 32 mg/mL of pegloticase comprised of 8 mg/mL uricase protein conjugated to monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol), (mPEG) in phosphate buffered saline. The finished product is presented in a 1 mL (nominal) fill in  a  single-use  vial.  There  are  no  overages.  During  manufacture  of  the  finished  product,  a  target volume of the finished product solution is filled into the final container to ensure that the total dose volume of 1.0 mL can be delivered. Pharmaceutical Development Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  development  of  the  finished  product  is  adequately  described.  Minor  changes  were  introduced during the finished product process development. These include changes to the manufacturing site, the batch  size  and  the  introduction  of  a  two  filter  filtration  step  for  commercial  batches.  Since  these changes are considered to have no impact on the final product quality comparability studies are not required.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The compatibility  of  Krystexxa  and  the  commercially  available  sodium  chloride  solution  (0.45%  and 0.9%)  was  tested  to  evaluate  pegloticase  stability  after  dilution.  No  excipient  of  human  or  animal origin is used in the finished product. No novel excipient is used in the finished product.

## Adventitious agents

According  to  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform Encephalopathy  Agents  via  Human  and  Veterinary  Medicinal  Products,  (EMEA/410/01  rev.  3,  July 2011) bovine milk is unlikely to present any risk of TSE contamination. Since the casein used for N-Z amine production is sourced from milk from healthy animals and collected under the same conditions as  for  human  consumption  and  since  no  other  ruminant  materials  are  used  in  the  preparation  the casein can be considered compliant with the NfG.

The slip agent is a tallow derivative and has been manufactured under rigorous process conditions, therefore it is unlikely to represent a risk of TSE contamination. Lysozyme  is  a  raw  material  derived  from  hen's  eggs  and  is  used  during  the  uricase  intermediate manufacturing process (recovery step). The Applicant has performed a further risk assessment under special  consideration  of  small,  non-enveloped  viruses.  A  literature-based  estimation  of  the  virus reduction  ability  of  AEX  and  affinity  chromatography  has  been  performed  and  both  methods  were assumed to be effective in virus removal/inactivation. Although a theoretical evaluation of the virus reduction capacity of the manufacturing process might be used as supportive data, the process- and product-specific conditions of the processes to be compared deviate in essential details (i.e. matrix) and  thereby  hamper  a  meaningful  comparison.  Therefore  the  replacement  of  the  animal-derived lysozyme by a recombinant product is considered a key measure to assure the virus safety  of  this material. Manufacture of the product The  Krystexxa  finished  product  is  manufactured  at  Sigma-Tau  PharmaSource,  Inc.  Indianapolis, Indiana (STPS). The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling,  inspection,  labelling  and packaging. No change in formulation occurs during finished product manufacturing. The manufacturing process is appropriately described and controlled. A rationale for the classification of all controls into in-process tests, critical and key processing parameters is presented. The in-process tests are limited by acceptance criteria. The finished product production process only comprises, mixing of several glass bottles of one active substance lot, sterile filtration into a filling bag, transport to the fill site and filling into vials. The  final  process  was  validated  by  producing  six  validation  batches,  three  of  them  using  active substance  from  process  C.  The  validation  data  included  results  of  all  in-process  tests  and  critical processing  parameters.  The  results  were  within  the  predefined  ranges  or  fulfilled  the  acceptance criteria.  Overall, the validation results demonstrate that the finished product manufacturing process is under control and produces finished product of consistent quality.

## Product specification

The  drug  product  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identity,  content,  potency  and  purity. The list of tests is adequate to control drug product quality.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analytical methods for testing pegloticase attributes in the finished product solution are identical to the methods used for active substance analysis. The release specification limits are based on statistical evaluation of the batch data obtained so far.

Results  of  all  finished  product  batches  produced  so  far  are  presented,  among  them  four  batches representing the commercial finished product (active substance process C) process and the clinic lot 5682003100  used  in  for  phase  III  studies.  All  parameters  fulfilled  the  acceptance  criteria,  thus confirming consistent finished product quality.

Reference standards or materials There is no designated Krystexxa finished product reference standard other than that described in the active substance section. Stability of the product Stability studies were initiated with four Krystexxa finished product batches manufactured with Process C active substance. All stability data from the Krystexxa finished product process C available so far (maximum 18 months) met the acceptance criteria. Although the active substance of process B has a slightly different PEGylation:protein ratio, it is not considered to impact on the degradation rate given the high degree of PEGylation in the molecule. Therefore, the stability data of the pilot scale lot can be used to support the proposed finished product shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2-8°C. A post-approval stability protocol is available. In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out-of-specification  result,  or  significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects In the Quality Dossier for Krystexxa (Pegloticase) the development, characterisation, manufacture and control  of  the  intermediate  uricase,  the  active  substance  Pegloticase  and  the  finished  product Krystexxa are adequately described. No major objections were raised during the evaluation, but the applicant was asked to address a number of other concerns mainly related to comparability of phase 3 and commercial active substance batches, control of uricase intermediate, pegloticase active substance and finished product. All issues raised during the evaluation have been adequately addressed by the Applicant. A number of recommendations have been identified which should be appropriately followed by the Applicant post authorisation. Based on the review of data on quality, the CHMP consider that the application for Krystexxa can be approved. 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to provide reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The design of the non-clinical testing program for pegloticase was based on the guidance provided by ICH  S6:  Preclinical  Safety  Evaluation  of  Biotechnology-Derived  Pharmaceuticals.  The  non-clinical testing strategy involved pharmacodynamic studies to evaluate pegloticase activity, pharmacokinetic studies to ascertain systemic disposition and metabolism, and toxicology studies to characterize the safety profile, including the immunogenic potential of the molecule.

In rats and dogs with endogenous uricase and already low baseline UA levels, pegloticase lowered UA levels further when administered IV, IM or SC. Thus, pegloticase was shown to be able to supplement the intrinsic activity of endogenous uricase in these species.

In all of the non-clinical studies, pegloticase was formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as was the case for pegloticase administered in the clinical trials. The drug substance used in the toxicology studies was produced using the same process used to manufacture pegloticase for the clinical trials. GLP Studies  on  primary  pharmacology  of  pegloticase  were  performed  in  compliance  with  GLP,  with  the exception of the study in knock-out mice. All pivotal toxicological studies were conducted in accordance with GLP. 2.3.2. Pharmacology Primary pharmacodynamic studies Urate  oxidase  (uricase)  catalyzes  the  conversion  of  uric  acid  (UA)  to  allantoin.  Pegloticase  is  a recombinant  mammalian  (porcine/baboon  variant)  uricase  produced  in E.  coli .  The  effect  of  PEGuricase on SUA levels was determined in an in vivo a genetically modified mouse model (Uox-/-) where the endogenous uricase gene had been knocked-out. In this study, PEG-uricase was administered via the intraperitoneal route. Furthermore  the  pharmacodynamics  were  investigated  in  four  non-clinical  single-dose  toxicology studies and in five repeat (intermittent) dose toxicology studies, UA levels were measured following intravenous or intramuscular administration of pegloticase in rats and dogs. Since the main species (rats and dogs) used in the preclinical studies possess the enzyme uricase and have already low endogenous baseline levels of UA, the pharmacodynamics of pegloticase was initially examined using an uricase-deficient knock-out mouse model. In this hyperuricemic model, pegloticase exhibited greater bioavailability and greater and more prolonged biological (UA-lowering) activity when the  unmodified  recombinant  enzyme.  In  the  uricase-deficient  mouse  model,  the  control  mice developed the expected signs of diabetes insipidus, with impaired renal concentrating ability. However, in mice receiving pegloticase, the development of diabetes insipidus and nephropathy were prevented, and the renal concentrating ability remained similar to that in normal control ( Uox+/+ ) mice.

Overall, the pharmacological activity of pegloticase in non-clinical studies established the potential of pegloticase to lower UA levels for clinical use. Subsequent clinical studies demonstrated that a dose of 8 mg (3.51 mg/m 2 ) given IV on an every 2 week dosing schedule was effective in lowering UA levels in humans (5.3.5.1.1, C0403; 5.3.5.1.2, C0405; 5.3.5.1.3, C0406).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Pegloticase  is  a  recombinant  enzyme  which,  according  to  the  Applicant,  has  no  known  secondary pharmacodynamic activities in addition to its capability to convert UA to allantoin. Therefore, the CHMP endorses  the  Applicant's  argument  that  an  investigation  of  secondary  pharmacodynamics  was  not applicable and no data for secondary pharmacodynamic studies has been provided.

## Safety pharmacology programme

No  separate  safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  conducted  for  this  biotechnology  product  but safety pharmacology endpoints were investigated in context of the toxicity studies, which is considered an  acceptable  approach.  Pharmacodynamic  effects  on  the  cardiovascular  system  (in  dogs)  and  a modified Irwin's Behavioural Screen (in dogs and rats) were performed as part of single and repeated dose toxicity studies. There were no unexpected organ system findings or effects on function in any of these  non-clinical  studies  at  pegloticase  exposures  greatly  exceeding  the  clinical  exposure  that warranted further consideration for separate safety pharmacology studies. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  performed.  This  was  considered  acceptable  to CHMP.  However, concomitant medication was considered in the study population to study potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions in clinical studies. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of pegloticase was performed in  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rats,  rabbits,  pigs  and  dogs  after  single  and  repeat  IV,  SC  and  IM application. Methods of analysis Two methods were used to address ADME of pegloticase: -125 I- Pegloticase (radiolabel on lysine residue (s) of the protein) was used to assess the disposition of the radioactivity in the animals. -A colorimetric  method  (measuring  enzymatic  activity)  was used  to determine  pegloticase concentrations in biological fluids. The  measurement  of  the  enzymatic  activity  was  considered  to  be  the  most  appropriate  means  to measure concentrations of pegloticase because of its large molecular size and high content of mPEG. Absorption Systemic exposure Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  the  single  dose  pharmocokinetic/toxicokinetic  studies,  the  exposure  to  pegloticase  tended  to  be higher in female rats compared to male rats, whereas exposure appeared to be comparable in male and female dogs. Exposure (AUC) after single IV application in dogs increased roughly as a function of the applied dose.

In the repeat dose pharmocokinetic/toxicokinetic studies in rats (SC) and dogs (SC, IV), peak/plateau levels  and  total  (AUC)  systemic  exposures  to  pegloticase  increased  roughly  as  a  function  of  the administered dose as well as the duration of the study. Plateau values in the 39 week chronic toxicity study in dogs with an IV application of doses up to 10 mg/kg every 7 days were reached after 84 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  mean  total  exposures  following  IV,  SC  and  IM  application  tended  to  be  higher  in  female  rats compared  to  male  rats,  whereas  in  the  dog  studies  the  mean  total  exposure  appeared  to  be comparable for the males and females.

## Bioavailability

Bioavailability  (F)  following  SC  administration  of  pegloticase  appeared  to  be  lower  in  the  rat  (26%) compared to rabbit (84 - 95%), dog (48 - 50%) or pig (77%).

Mean bioavailability following IM administration of pegloticase tended also to be somewhat lower in the rat  (44  -  76%)  compared  to  the  rabbit  (88  -  98%),  the  dog  (68  -  100%)  or  the  pig  (72%).  For example, in a repeated dose dog study of four weeks duration with weekly IM dosing, the 1.5 mg/kg dose had a mean bioavailability of 100% in males and 91% in females for the terminal dose. Plasma elimination half-life In  single  and  repeat  dose  pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic  studies,  mean  apparent  plasma  elimination half-life  following  IV  administration  of  pegloticase  appeared  to  be  shorter  in  rats  (23  -  84  hours) compared to rabbits (89 - 153 hours), dogs (94 - 216 hours), or pigs (178 hours). In the rat, plasma elimination half-life of pegloticase following repeated IV administration of a dose of 0.7 mg/kg (34 - 43 hours) was similar to that seen after a single IV application of a dose of ~0.5 mg/kg (35 - 48 hours) and 15.2 mg/kg (54 - 68 hours). Also the plasma elimination half-life with repeated SC injections of doses of 3.4, 10.2 and 34 mg/kg did not show any dose-dependency with values ranging from 63 to 84 hours. Therefore, in the rat, elimination kinetics do not appear to be appreciably affected by the applied dose and administration mode. In a single dose juvenile dog study, the elimination half-life for IV doses of 0.4, 1.5 and 10 mg/kg was 54, 96 and 104 hours (combined male and female values). In a single dose adult dog study, the elimination half-life was 109, 139 and 187 hours (combined male and female values) for IV doses of 0.4, 1.5 and 10 mg/kg. In  the  12-week  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  with  IV  doses  of  0.5,  1.5  and  5  mg/kg  the  terminal plasma elimination half-life was 169, 167 and 227 hours (combined male and female values). For IV dose of 0.4 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg, a half-live of 109 hours and 147 hours (combined male and female values), respectively, was observed following single application, whereas a final half-life of 163 hours and 221 hours (combined male and female values), respectively, was observed after repeated administration. For  an  IM  dose  of  1.5  mg/kg    a  half-live  of  217    hours  (combined  male  and  female  values)  was observed following single application, and a half-life of 222 hours (combined male and female values) was observed after repeated administration. Therefore,  in  the  dog,  elimination  half-life  does  appear  to  increase  with  the  applied  dose  and  with repeated IV application and appears to be shorter in juvenile animals than in adult animals. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The plasma elimination half-life of pegloticase after repeated IV administration in the Phase 2 clinical study for the 8 mg given every 2 weeks dose was 160 hours (ranging from 95.8 - 371 hours). In the Phase 3 clinical studies, the terminal half-life was 214 hours (ranging from 123 - 444 hours). Although this  suggests  that  mean  clinical  exposure  may  be  of  a  longer  duration,  values  did  to  some  extent overlap with the values determined for the dog and whereby affirmed the relevance of this species for evaluation of pegloticase toxicity. Furthermore, with regard to the repeat dose toxicity studies, total exposures in rats and dogs in these studies were much higher than those in the clinical investigations, assuring that cumulative exposures to pegloticase in the non-clinical toxicity studies were well beyond that anticipated clinically.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clearance

In accordance with the observed shorter plasma elimination half-life, clearance appeared to be higher in rats (0.97 - 1.01 ml/hxkg) than in adult dogs (0.09 - 0.39 ml/hxkg).

In accordance with the observed shorter plasma elimination half-life, clearance appeared to be higher in juvenile dogs (0.41 - 0.72 ml/hxkg) than in adult dogs (values see above)

## Volume of distribution

For the volume of distribution values of 78-95 ml/kg were reported for rat and values of 24 - 81 ml and 45 - 70 ml for adult and juvenile dogs, respectively. There appeared to be no gender differences. These low values suggest that distribution of pegloticase is mainly confined to the circulating plasma volume. Distribution As  described  above,  Vd-values  suggest  that  distribution  of  pegloticase  is  mainly  confined  to  the circulating  plasma  volume.  From  the  single-dose  tissue  distribution  studies  in  male  and  female  rats given 125 I-pegloticase by the IV route, the distribution of the radiolabel to the tissues was consistent with the blood flow to the organs and total (specific) tissue radioactivity generally declined in parallel with blood/plasma elimination except in the thyroid and spleen. In these two organs, the elimination of radioactivity was much slower. For the thyroid, this probably represents the uptake of the radiolabel or protein fragments thereof. There was no evidence in the repeated dose toxicity studies that the thyroid was a target organ. Thus, for this organ, the radioactivity likely represents a pseudo-distribution of the label. However, for the spleen, the residual radioactivity likely represents 125 I-pegloticase sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in this organ. With either IV or SC administration, radioactivity in the spleen did not decline in parallel with blood or other organs over the 7 days of study. This observation correlates with the microscopic findings in the spleen (vacuolated macrophages) in the repeated dose toxicity studies. Protein binding studies were not conducted since the molecular weight of pegloticase (&gt;540 kDa) is much greater than that of  albumin  (66  kDa),  making  it  unsuitable  for  the  study  of  plasma  protein binding using conventional techniques. Radiolabelled studies to assess placental transfer were not conducted. However, in the rat embryo/foetal toxicity studies, pegloticase was not detected in pooled foetal samples, indicating that it does not cross the placenta. Metabolism Medicinal product no longer authorised

The large size of pegloticase with the extensive PEG modification makes isolation and identification of the in vivo degradation products impractical. Therefore, the metabolism of pegloticase was followed by measurement of the amount of radioactivity precipitated by TCA in the blood and urine in male and female rats given  125 I-pegloticase by the IV or SC routes. To this aim 125 I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was coupled to free amino groups on pegloticase. In blood, TCA precipitated (indicates radiolabel attached to protein) radioactivity approached 100%. Greater than 89% of the radioactivity found in the urine was TCA soluble, indicating that extensive degradation of the radiolabelled protein had taken place, probably  via  vascular  proteolytic  activity  and  reticuloendothelial  processing.  Pegloticase  protein degradation products were not further isolated or identified from urine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since the 125 I-label  was  coupled  to  the  protein  part  of  the  pegloticase  molecule,  no  direct  evidence concerning the metabolic fate of the PEG-part of the pegloticase can be derived from the experiments performed with  125 I-pegloticase.

According to literature provided by the Applicant, the pharmacokinetics and organ uptake of PEGylated peptides and enzymes is affected in a predictable manner by their molecular size. As the molecular size increases, blood and body clearances decrease. PEGylation delays the elimination of these pharmaceuticals from the circulation by a variety of mechanisms, including decreasing renal clearance, proteolysis  and  immunogenicity.  The  metabolism  of  PEG  itself  is  limited,  and  it  is  apparent  that metabolic clearance of PEG decreases markedly as molecular weight increases. High molecular weight PEGs (&gt;5000; typical of those used to PEGylate proteins) show little or no metabolism. Thus for PEGs typically used in biological products, metabolism will not play a major role in their elimination.

To support the Phase 1 clinical trials, pegloticase was administered SC in single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Furthermore, single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs were also investigated via the IM route. However, the IV route of administration was thereafter developed as the SC route raised concern on the potential for immunogenicity. Hence, to support the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, which used IV route of administration, pegloticase was administered IV in single-dose studies in rats and dogs and in repeated dose toxicity studies in dogs. For the long term IV chronic toxicity studies, the dog was chosen since plasma half-life of pegloticase in dogs was closer to the pegloticase half-life determined in humans.

PEG of the size used to modify uricase and the large size of resulting pegloticase would indicate that for the PEG moiety, urinary excretion would be the route of elimination. The  presented  literature  data  appear  to  be  of  relevance  for  an  estimation  of  the  metabolic fate/elimination  of  the  PEG-part  of  the  pegloticase  molecule.  Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  considers  it scientifically  necessary  to  follow-up  on  this  discussion,  taking  into  account  the  occurrence  of vacuolization  in  different  cell  types  and  the  formation  of  anti-PEG  antibodies  during  repeated  dose toxicity  studies  with  pegloticase.  To  further  investigate  the  tissue  deposition  of  pegloticase  (tissue vacuolization) and the reversibility of this process, it is recommended that the applicant provides longterm data from an ongoing 12-month repeated dose toxicity study in dogs once available. Excretion The IV administration of 125 I-pegloticase to rats in the ADME studies demonstrated a slow elimination of  the  pegloticase-derived  material  from  the  blood  with  a  half-life  of  35.2 hours  in  males  and 48.1 hours in females. However, the retention of radioactivity in the spleen and thyroid was different than  for  other  tissues  in  which  radioactivity  declined  as  the  radioactivity  in  the  blood  declined  (see above). The excretion of  125 I-pegloticase occurred principally through the urine (approximately 70% of total  administered  radioactivity)  as  a  soluble  fraction,  probably  representing  protein  degradation products, while less than 10% of radioactivity were detected in the faeces. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have not been performed. This appears to be acceptable with regard to the known high substrate specificity of uricase for uric acid. 2.3.4. Toxicology Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity studies with pegloticase were conducted in rats and dogs via the IV, SC and IM route  of  application,  involving  a  post-observation  period  of  up  to  28  days.  Investigations  usually included a measurement of body weight and food consumption, clinical observations, serum chemistry and macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of selected tissues following necropsies. Safety pharmacology endpoints (modified Irwin´s behavioural screen, electrocardiography) were included in some of the studies.

In the rat studies, single IV and SC doses of up to 72.5 mg (corresponding to a body surface areabased exposure ratio of 124 compared with human exposure) and an IM dose of 15.2 mg/kg were well tolerated. There were no adverse findings. In the adult dog studies, single IV, SC and IM doses of up to 10, 29 and 1.5 mg/kg (corresponding to body surface area-based exposure ratios of 57, 165 and 8.5, respectively) were well tolerated. There were no adverse findings. In  conclusion,  the  acute  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  adult  dogs  did  not  allow  to  define  a  nonclinical  adverse  effect  level  or  a  maximal  tolerated  dose  for  acute  application  of  pegloticase.  The applied  dose  levels  provided  a  sufficiently  high  safety  margin  relative  to  human  exposure  for  this biotechnology-derived product.

1: Exposure compared with the clinical exposure 2: AUC: Values relative to exposure (AUC) of clinical responders in the phase 3 studies given 8 mg pegloticase every two weeks; 2: BSA (Body surface area): Values relative to exposure of patients (3.51 mg/m 2 ), based on a clinical dose of 8 mg and the average body weight of 99.3 kg in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical investigations. Repeat dose toxicity Repeated dose toxicity studies with pegloticase were conducted in rats and dogs. Investigations usually included a measurement of body weight and food consumption, clinical observations, serum chemistry and macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of selected tissues following necropsies. Safety pharmacology endpoints (modified Irwin´s behavioural screen, electrocardiography) were included in some of the studies. In  the  rat,  subchronic  toxicity  of  SC  doses  up  to  34  mg/kg  was  studied  for  54  days  (pegloticase administered every second day), followed by a 14 day recovery period. In the dog, subchronic toxicity of SC doses (up to 17 mg/kg for 52 days, recovery period 28 days) and IM doses (up to 1.5 mg/kg for 28 days, recovery period 28 days) were evaluated. In  accordance  with  the  IV  application  in  the  Phase  2  and  3  clinical  studies,  the  pivotal  repeat  dose toxicity  studies  focused  on  the  evaluation  of  the  subchronic  and  chronic  toxicity  of  IV  applied pegloticase in the dog in studies of 4 weeks (application every 4 th  day, recovery period 4 weeks), 12 weeks (application every 5 th  day, recovery period 6 weeks) and 39 weeks duration (application every 7 th  day, recovery period 12 weeks). For the long term IV chronic toxicity studies, the dog was chosen since  plasma  half-life  of  pegloticase  in  dogs  was  closer  to  the  pegloticase  half-life  determined  in humans than plasma half-life in rats. In the repeated dose toxicity studies there were no study drug-related deaths or relevant functional impairments.  The only consistent finding concerning serum chemistry was the lowering of endogenous uric acid levels, which reflects the expected pharmacological effect of pegloticase.

Tissue vacuolization The main relevant finding in the repeated dose toxicity studies was the occurrence of vacuolization in different tissues following repeated  pegloticase  application  to rats  and  dogs.  The  severity  of vacuolization and the number of tissues affected appeared to be dependent on the applied dose and the duration of exposure. Therefore, the number of tissues affected and the severity of vacuolization was greatest in the high dose (10 mg/kg) group in the 39-week dog repeated dose toxicity study in which  vacuolization  was  observed  in  spleen,  liver,  duodenum,  jejunum,  adrenal  cortex  and  heart. According to the presented study data, tissue vacuolization was not fully reversible during the applied recovery periods. Anti-drug antibody formation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Antibody development in response to repeated pegloticase injections was observed in several studies, including  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rats,  rabbits  and  dogs,  and  repeat  (intermittent)  dose  toxicity studies in rats and dogs. This is expected, because for the tested species, pegloticase represents a foreign  protein  and  therefore  possesses  an  inherent  immunogenic  potential  to  evoke  an  antibody response.  Usually,  antibody  formation  in  animal  studies  is  not  predictive  for  anti-drug  antibody formation in humans.

Weak antibody titers to m-PEG, and pegloticase were detected in most subchronic/chronic studies. The predominant immune response was directed against uricase. In the 12- and 39-week chronic toxicity study in dogs, anti-uricase antibodies/anti-pegloticase antibodies developed in most treated dogs, the response was not dose- or gender- related. There was a trend towards a decrease in titer and response during  recovery  for  anti-uricase  and  anti-pegloticase  antibodies.  Anti-uricase/anti-pegloticase  IgG

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antibodies  in  all  high  responders  did  not  affect  pegloticase  activity,  i.e.  the  antibodies  were  not considered  to  be  neutralizing.  There  was  only  a  small  anti-PEG  response.  There  were  no  clinical manifestations associated with the presence of antibodies against uricase, pegloticase or m-PEG.

Intermittent dosing did not affect immune competence, and in the subchronic IV dog study, 4 week intermittent dosing followed by a recovery period and then challenge with pegloticase did not evoke any exaggerated immune response.

In  the  clinical  trials,  antibody  titers  to  pegloticase  have  been  detected  in  most  treated  patients. Although no neutralizing antibodies have been detected in patients receiving pegloticase, an increase in the clearance of pegloticase has been noted, possibly through immune complex formation via the PEG moiety. The toxicokinetic parameters determined in the repeat (intermittent) dose toxicity studies provided  no  evidence  that  there  was  any  increase  in  clearance  of  pegloticase  seen  during  these studies. Genotoxicity Pegloticase is a m-PEG conjugated recombinant mammalian uricase and regarded as a biotechnological product.  The  enzyme  and  the  conjugated  mPEG  moiety  are  not  considered  to  have  a  genotoxic potential. According to ICH S6 standard genotoxicity testing is not required for this type of product. Carcinogenicity Pegloticase is a m-PEG conjugated recombinant mammalian uricase. As the enzyme does not belong to any  class  of  growth  factor  or  hormone  like  peptides  it  is  not  considered  to  have  a  carcinogenic potential. In addition, in the repeated dose toxicity studies there were no findings that would indicate any carcinogenic potential. According to ICH S6 standard carcinogenicity testing is not required for this type of product. Reproduction Toxicity Embryo/foetal development When  pregnant  rats  were  treated  on  gestation day  6 to 16  an  increase in  extramedullary haematopoiesis with dose-dependent increase in severity was observed in all treatment groups. While macrophages were not affected at 5 mg/kg (low dose) and 10 mg/kg (mid dose) administered IV every other day, in the pivotal study one out of eight mid dose dams showed vacuolated macrophages at 20 mg/kg as well as all high dose dams at 40 mg/kg with the same administration regimen as in the dose range  finding  study.  In  both  studies  uric  acid  levels  were  decreased  by  gestation  day  17  when compared to pre dose levels on gestation day 6. Toxicokinetic investigations in dams showed a dose proportional  increase  in  pegloticase  plasma  levels.  In  pooled  litter  samples  pegloticase  values  were below the LLOQ.  No drug-related effects were observed in foetuses of all treated groups. There was one malformed control foetus (localized foetal oedema) in the dose range finding and three foetuses with malformations (one control foetus with anal atresia and vertebral agenesis with anury; one low dose  foetus  with  exencephaly  and  open  eyelids  and  additionally spina  bifida and  absent  gonads, another low dose foetus with vertebral malformation) in the pivotal study.

## Studies in juvenile animals

In a single dose IV study in juvenile dogs aged 7 - 8 weeks old, a dose-dependent decrease in relative heart weights, reaching statistical significance in females of the mid (1.5 mg/kg) and high dose (10 mg/kg) groups, was observed. Furthermore, electrocardiographic  evaluations  which  were  performed pre dose (day -9), one hour post dose on the treatment day, and after a recovery period of 21 days

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

showed an increased incidence of dogs with second degree atrioventricular block on day 21 post dose, while  no  such  finding  was  observed  in  any  of  the  control  group  dogs.  As  no  second  degree atrioventricular  block  was  observed  one  hour  post-dosing  in  juvenile  dogs,  and  pharmacokinetic considerations do not suggest any causal relationship with the second degree atrioventricular blocks demonstrated electrocardiographically 21 days after pegloticase administration, a causal relationship appears to be unlikely.

## Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic  parameters  have  been  determined  in  the  single  and  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  (see above). Local Tolerance Separate local tolerance studies were not performed. The assessment of local tolerance was part of the single  dose  and  repeat  (intermittent)  dose  toxicity  studies  conducted.  This  approach  is  considered acceptable. There were no pegloticase injection site findings in the seven single dose studies. In the 54-day SC repeated dose rat study, there was a dose and treatment related change in all three pegloticase dose groups at the site of the SC injection. Slight oedema and inflammation were observed indicating that the pegloticase formulation caused a slight local response in the subcutaneous tissue of the rats after repeated injection. In the 52-day SC repeat dose dog study and in the three (4-week, 12-week and 39-week) IV repeated dose dog studies, there were no pegloticase injection site findings. Other toxicity studies Studies have been performed to evaluate the immunogenic potential of pegloticase and to characterize potential  effects  on  macrophage  function.  These  studies  are  discussed  above  (see  Repeated  dose toxicity). 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment As the active ingredient pegloticase is an enzyme and thus a protein the applicant did not provide an environmental risk assessment. With reference to the guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006) the applicant pointed out that this approach is supported by the given guideline where it is stated that vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from an ERA because they are unlikely  to  result  in  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  The  justification  for  not  providing  an environmental risk assessment for the active ingredient pegloticase is considered acceptable. 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacology

The  primary  pharmacology  of  pegloticase  in  the  mentioned  non-clinical  studies  established  the potential of pegloticase to lower UA levels for clinical use. Subsequent clinical studies demonstrated that  a  dose  of  8 mg  (3.51 mg/m 2 )  given  IV  on  an  every  2 week  dosing  schedule  was  effective  in lowering UA levels in humans.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to safety pharmacology, according to ICH S6 'Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals',  it  is  important  to  investigate  the  potential  for  undesirable pharmacological activity of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals on the major physiological systems in appropriate animal models. To this aim, functional indices may be investigated in separate studies or incorporated in the design of toxicity studies. The approach taken by the Applicant to investigate safety pharmacology  endpoints  in  context  of  the  toxicity  studies  is  therefore  in  accordance  with  the recommendation  laid  down  in  ICH  S6  and  additional  separate  safety  pharmacology  studies  are  not considered warranted.

Pharmacokinetics The pharmakocinetics were investigated of pegloticase in plasma from rats,  rabbits, dogs, and pigs following single or repeat-  (intermittent) dosing by the IV, subcutaneous, and IM routes (these were assessed using a colorimetric assay). The CHMP noted that the analytical methods applied do not provide direct information concerning the pharmacokinetics of the PEG-part of pegloticase, which does not show enzymatic activity and is not labelled by  125 I when using the Bolton Hunter method. Therefore, the Applicant was asked to provide a more detailed discussion concerning the pharmacokinetics of the PEG-part of pegloticase, taking also into  account  the  observation  of  tissue  vacuolization  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  with pegloticase. Further data will become available with the final report of the 24-month vacuole study in dogs, which was recommended to be provided once available (see below). In  single  and  repeat  dose  pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic  studies,  mean  apparent  plasma  elimination half-life  following  IV  administration  of  pegloticase  appeared  to  be  shorter  in  rats  (23  -  84  hours) compared to rabbits (89 - 153 hours), dogs (94 - 216 hours), or pigs (178 hours).  With regard to the repeat dose toxicity studies, total exposures in rats and dogs in these studies were much higher than those in the clinical investigations, assuring that cumulative exposures to pegloticase in the non-clinical toxicity studies were well beyond that anticipated clinically. Toxicology Repeated dose toxicity studies with pegloticase were conducted in rats and dogs. Investigations usually included a measurement of body weight and food consumption, clinical observations, serum chemistry and macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of selected tissues following necropsies. Repeated dose toxicity Reaction products of uricase-mediated uric acid degradation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Uricase  is  an  enzyme  not  physiologically  present  in  humans.  Allantoin  and  hydrogenperoxide  are formed  as  reaction  products  during  uricase-mediated  degradation  of  uric  acid.  During  therapy  with pegloticase, patients will therefore be exposed to these degradation products in an amount exceeding the  normal  physiological  exposure.  The  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  did  not  allow  to  define  a maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for subchronic and chronic application of pegloticase. Nevertheless, the applied dose levels provided a sufficiently high safety margin relative to human clinical exposure for this biotechnology-derived product, amounting for the high dose in the 39 week dog toxicity study in an exposure-based safety margin of 645.

The CHMP asked the Applicant to tabulate reported concentrations of allantoin in normal animals and humans, and compare this to allantoin  exposure  expected  in  humans  treated  with  pegloticase.  The Applicant  has  provided  an  estimation  of  the  additional  amount  of  these  reaction  products  formed during pegloticase therapy and a discussion concerning their toxicological properties. Allantoin formed by pegloticase from urate does not appear to represent a relevant safety problem. According to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Applicant,  the  amount  of  H2O2  produced  during  pegloticase  therapy  can  be  expected  to  be decomposed by red blood cells via catalase. The contraindication listed in the SmPC together with the warning statement for SmPC section 4.4 concerning potential haemolysis and/or methaemoglobinaemia during KRYSTEXXA treatment were considered sufficient by the CHMP to cover relevant aspects related to an increased hydrogen peroxide production during Krystexxa treatment.

Also, maintaining plasma urate levels at &lt;1 mg/dL with pegloticase did not increase plasma levels of F2-isoprostanes, considered to be relevant biomarkers for oxidative stress, and pegloticase was even shown  to  lower  in  F2-isoprostanes  levels  over  time  on  treatment.  In  order  to  prevent  possible haemolytic  anaemia  induced  by  hydrogen  peroxide,  cellular  metabolic  disorders  known  to  cause haemolytic  anaemia  (like  G6PDH  deficiency)  are  included  as  contraindications  for  use  in  the  SmPC. Furthermore, 'Genetic Polymorphism (G6PD deficiency, cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency and other metabolic disorders known to cause haemolytic anaemia)' is indicated as missing information in the RMP.

Overall, the information available concerning potential adverse consequences related to the occurrence of  tissue  vacuolization,  in  particular  in  cells  other  than  macrophages,  during  chronic  therapy  with pegloticase should be investigated further. The Applicant is already conducting an additional 12-month chronic  toxicity  study  in  dogs  with  a  12-month  recovery  period  to  further  characterize  effects  of pegloticase  on  tissue  vacuolization,  and  the  CHMP  recommended  these  results  to  be  provided  once available.

Tissue vacuolization The main relevant finding in the repeated dose toxicity studies was the occurrence of vacuolization in different tissues following repeated  pegloticase  application  to rats  and  dogs.  The  severity  of vacuolization and the number of tissues affected appeared to be dependent on the applied dose and the duration of exposure; vacuolization was not fully reversible during the applied recovery periods. As  reported  for  other  pegylated  products,  vacuolization  appears  to  be  related  to  the  presence  of macrophages in some of the affected tissues. However, the CHMP noted that in the present studies with  pegloticase  other  cell  types  (e.g.  in  the  aorta  outflow  area  of  the  heart)  appeared  also  to  be involved. For  macrophages,  the  presence  of  the  vacuoles  may  reflect  their  normal  function,  as  part  of  the reticuloendothelial  system,  to  remove  from  circulation  and  possibly  degrade  any  large  molecules, cellular debris or foreign material that they encounter. The vacuoles may be interpreted to reflect the fact that the macrophages could not rapidly degrade the pegloticase and therefore, retained it in their cytoplasm, probably in isolated phagosomes. In the repeated dose toxicity studies there was no case, at any dose or duration of application, of a test  animal  developing  a  systemic  disease  that  would  suggest  that  the  defensive  functions  of  the macrophages had been compromised by the presence of the vacuoles in their cytoplasm. Furthermore, there was no evidence at any dose of a study animal developing any condition that would indicate that the presence of vacuoles in cells from any organ had an adverse effect upon the health of the animal. However, significant decreases in the TNF response to a LPS challenge were seen in total splenocytes and macrophages from rats dosed for 4 weeks with pegloticase doses of 4.3, 10.2 and 34 mg/kg. The effects  were  most  prominent  in  the  high-dose  group,  but  also  observed  for  the  lower  dose  groups. Since there were no vacuoles reported in the low- and mid-dose groups, it was difficult to establish a functional relationship between TNF-release upon LPS challenge and the presence of vacuoles.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A single embryofoetal development study in rats was included in the MAA dossier. This study in rats does  not  indicate  direct  or  indirect  harmful  effects  with  respect  to  reproductive  toxicity.  Additional reproductive  toxicity  studies  are  ongoing:  rat  fertility  study  (WIL-441020),  rabbit  embryo/foetal developmental toxicity study (WIL-441021), rat pre-and postnatal development study (WIL-441025). The final reports should be available by the end of 2012. The CHMP recommended these results to be provided once available.

Section 4.6 of the SmPC states that 'embryofetal development study in rats does not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity' and section 5.3 of the SmPC includes a wording  'in the pregnant rat study there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity at 46 times the clinical exposure (AUC)'.

2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects In  general,  the  available  data  on  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  of pegloticase  is  considered  comprehensive  to  support  the  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation  for pegloticase from a non-clinical point of view. The  CHMP  noted  that  further  non-clinical  studies  are  ongoing,  whose  results  will  provide  relevant information regarding the formation, effects and reversibility of intracellular cytoplasmic vacuoles after i.v.  administration  of  pegloticase  (12-month  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  dogs)  and  reproductive toxicity of pegloticase (rat fertility study, rabbit embryo/foetal developmental toxicity study, rat preand postnatal development study). The CHMP therefore recommended that the results of these studies will  be  provided  as  soon  as  available,  this  has  been  agreed  by  the  applicant  in  their  letter  of recommendation. The Genetic Polymorphism (G6PD deficiency, cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency and other metabolic disorders known to cause haemolytic anaemia) has been addressed in the SmPC.  SmPC section 4.3 includes  a  contraindication  for  Glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (G6PD)  deficiency  and  other cellular metabolic disorders known to cause haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia. SmPC section 4.4 includes:  'It  is  not  known  whether  patients  with  deficiency  of  cytochrome  b5  reductase  (formerly known as methaemoglobin reductase) or other cellular metabolic disorders are at increased risk for haemolysis  and/or  methaemoglobinaemia.    If  haemolysis  and/or  methaemoglobinaemia  occur  in patients  receiving  KRYSTEXXA, treatment should be immediately and permanently discontinued and appropriate  measures  initiated.'  SmPC  section  4.8  lists  haemolysis  as  an  adverse  reaction  with  not known incidence. This has also been addressed in the risk management plan as important identified risk. The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, pegloticase is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 2.4. Clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

Pegloticase has been developed as recombinant PEGylated uricase with a prolonged circulating half-life of enzymatically active uricase. The enzyme uricase can be found in an extensive variety of organisms but is absent in humans and many other primates.  The outer surface of the tetrameric uricase enzyme is encased in a hydrated PEG 'cloud' also impacting the pharmacokinetics of the compound.

The  formulation  for  intravenous  use  was  kept  unchanged  throughout  the  development  phase  and therefore no comparative biopharmaceutical studies were performed.

Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  Pharmacodynamic  (PD)  data  have  been  generated  from  five  studies  all conducted in patients with severe refractory gout (see Table 2). Table 2 Overview of PK/PD studies · Analytical methods Different  analytical  methods  were  validated  and  used  in  the  course  of  clinical  development.  During Phase  1,  pegloticase  activity  was  determined  using  a  radiochemical  HPLC  method  to  quantify  the amount of [8-14C] uric acid remaining after pegloticase oxidation of UA in standard samples (study C0402). In the Phase 2 and 3 studies, a fluorimetric method was used for the determination of active pegloticase in human serum. The presence of anti-pegloticase antibodies was detected by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Absorption / Distribution / Elimination Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study  401 was  initiated  to  determine  the  bioavailability  and  PK  of  pegloticase  following  SC administration.    The  mean  plasma  urate  was  reduced  from  11  mg/dL  to  3  mg/dL  after  7  days. However 3 patients had injection site reactions, and while the circulating half-life of the enzyme was unexpectedly prolonged in 8 patients, with activity detectable after 21 days, there was also evidence of accelerated clearance in the other 5 patients with no detectable enzyme activity after 10 days, possibly associated with the development of anti-PEG antibodies. As a result, the Phase 1 study was terminated and no further development of SC administration of pegloticase was pursued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  402 was  an  open-label,  single-dose  study  of  intravenously  administered  pegloticase  was conducted in 24 subjects with symptomatic gout. The primary objective was to assess the PK profile, tolerability and safety of PEG uricase, administered as a single intravenous infusion. Another objective was to evaluate the dose response effect on plasma uric acid levels. Escalating doses of pegloticase (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8 or 12 mg) were administered as a 1-hour infusion. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at 1.5, 4, 8, 24 hours, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 14 and 21 days post-dose. Non-compartmental PK and PD analyses were conducted using data from 23 of the 24 subjects which were also included in the PK analyses (one subject had only 2 detectable concentrations).

The primary efficacy objective of this study was to assess the effect of multiple doses of PEG-uricase on  uric  acid  levels,  time  to  normalization  of  uric  acid  (i.e.  ≤6  mg/dL  of  uric  acid  in  plasma),  and duration  of  uric  acid  normalization  in  the  above-mentioned  population.  The  secondary  efficacy objective  was  to  assess  PK  and  PD  parameters  of  multiple  doses  of  PEG-uricase  in  this  patient population.

The results of study 402 are summarized in Table 3. Although sample size is rather limited and high variability does not allow a final conclusion, Cmax for uricase appeared to be roughly dose proportional. However, there seemed to be no increase in AUC above the 8 mg dose. Study results further indicated a dose of 2 mg or greater to be sufficient to keep uric acid levels below the solubility level of 6.8 mg/dL in serum. The mean uricase half-life was found to be at least 1 week, though high data variability is noted. Compartmental PK/PD modelling results suggested that pegloticase  doses  of 2  mg  or  greater  could maintain mean pegloticase levels above EC50 and consequently uric acid levels below its solubility limit of 6.8 mg/dL for up to one week. Table 3 Mean (CV%) Pharmacokinetic parameters by dosing group for Protocol C0402 Study 403 was a randomized, open-label, multi-centre, parallel-group Phase 2 study. Altogether 41 subjects  with  refractory  gout  and  hyperuricaemia  were  enrolled.  Each  subject  received  3  or  6  IV infusions of pegloticase, infused over approximately 30-60 minutes. The dosing regimens were chosen based on the outcome of previously performed studies (namely 401 and 402) and were 4 mg every 2 weeks, 8 mg every 2 weeks, 8 mg every 4 weeks or 12 mg every 4 weeks.

Pharmacokinetics of pegloticase in serum were best described by a 1-compartment model with linear elimination. The final PK/PD model included a direct inhibitory Emax model to describe an inhibitory effect of pegloticase on uric acid. Covariates investigated for inclusion in the PK/PD model were age, sex, race, body weight, ideal body weight and antibody levels. No influence on CL and Vc appeared to come  from  factors  like  age,  sex,  race,  body  weight,  and  antibody  levels.  Simulations  indicated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pegloticase given as 2 h- IV infusion every 2 or 4 weeks at an 8 mg dose to best control uric acid levels below the threshold of 6 mg/dL. This dosing regimen is also supported by the long half-life of pegloticase.

Treatment 4 mg every 2 weeks 8 mg every 2 weeks 8 mg every 4 weeks 12 mg every 4 weeks Studies 405 and 406 were two multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, parallel treatment group Phase 3 trials with a 24 week treatment period. Each subject was expected to participate  in  the  study  for  up  to  26  weeks,  including  a  2-week  screening  period  and  the  24  week treatment period. Each subject received 8 mg pegloticase IV every 2 weeks or 8 mg pegloticase IV every 4 weeks (alternating with placebo infusion every 2 weeks) or matching placebo control. Samples for PK analysis were collected before each dose administration, as well as 2 and 24 hours after the end of dose administration following doses 1 (week 1), 5 (week 9) and 11 (week 21). Additional samples were also collected 7 days after the end of dose administration following Doses 5 and 11, 2 hours and 7 days after the end of dose administration following Doses 6 and 12, and 14 days after the end of dose  administration  following  Dose  12.  In  the  event  of  an  early  termination,  a  sample  was  also collected at this time. Samples for analysis of antibodies to pegloticase and PEG were collected predose before dose 1 (week 1), dose 2 (week 3), dose 3 (week 5), dose 5 (week 9), dose 7 (week 13), dose 9 (week 17), dose 11 (week 21) and approximately 14 days after dose 12 (week 25).

A  population  PK  analysis  was  performed  using  NONMEM  VI  in  order  to  robustly  characterize  the pharmacokinetics of pegloticase. A total of 163 subjects (131 men and 32 women) from both protocols

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Only subjects who received active drug and who had at least one detectable pegloticase concentration were included in the population PK analysis.

Vc if increase in anti-pegloticase (L) CL if no increase in anti-pegloticase (L/h) CL if increase in anti-pegloticase (L/h) Covariates investigated included demographic variables (height, weight, ideal body weight, body mass index, age, body surface area, sex) as well as serum uric acid levels at screening, creatinine clearance (calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation), number of gout flare ups, overall antibody level against pegloticase  and  PEG,  presence  of  tophi,  presence  of  hypertension  or  diabetes  and  allergy  or gastrointestinal intolerance to allopurinol. The only significant covariates included in the PK model were body surface area and anti-pegloticase antibody response on Vc and CL. Although creatinine clearance on CL and anti-pegloticase antibody response on Vc were associated with the greatest decreases in objective function, they were not included as covariates in the model, because their inclusion in the model did not provide pharmacologically plausible results. Anti-pegloticase antibody level on Vc should have been added to the model, since this covariate was associated with the most important decrease in  objective  function.  However,  when  this  covariate  was  added  to  the  model,  anti-pegloticase antibodies were not a significant covariate on CL, when it would be expected that the antibodies should have an effect on pegloticase elimination. Creatinine clearance on CL was the covariate that produced the second-greatest decrease in objective function (after anti-pegloticase antibody level on Vc), but the  inclusion  of  this  covariate  was  not  deemed  appropriate  as  no  renal  elimination  of  unchanged pegloticase is observed (it is possible that uremic toxins accumulating with decreased renal function could  inhibit  transporters  thereby  decreasing  access  to  sites  of  metabolism).  Since  the  inclusion  of anti-pegloticase antibody level on Vc and creatinine clearance on CL did not lead to final models that were realistic from a pharmacologic perspective, the analysis using BSA on CL as the second covariate was pursued since the effect of creatinine clearance on clearance was not a primary covariate, while anti-pegloticase  antibodies  did  become  a  selected  covariate  on  CL  in  the  forward  analysis.  The inclusion of the anti-pegloticase antibody response in the final model indicates that the presence of antibodies  is  associated  with  an  increased  volume  of  distribution  as  well  as  an  increased  systemic clearance. Treatment group was not a significant covariate; therefore, population PK parameters were the same regardless of the dosing frequency (every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks).

No studies have been performed with pegloticase regarding metabolism, using human biomaterials, protein binding, or distribution studies using human biomaterials.

Given the type of medicinal product, route of administration, and  target  population  information  provided  on  pharmacokinetics  and  PK/PD  relation  are  considered acceptable by the CHMP. Dosing and dose in special populations No specific studies have been performed. Group imbalances were apparent in the dose finding study C0403 making the selection of the appropriate dose difficult. PK dose proportionality (AUCinf) was not sufficiently shown. Based on population PK analyses, only BSA was correlated with the clearance and volume of distribution.  The population included a substantial proportion of elderly patients, the median age  being  57  years.  Dose  subgroup  analyses  indicated  that  PUA  responses  might  be  influenced  by absolute bodyweight (BW) and might be modified in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment. This is supported by data from population pharmacokinetic analysis revealing an influence of the BSA and of the patient's  creatinine  clearance  on  the  clearance  of  pegloticase.  This  has  not  been  further evaluated  by  the  Applicant  but  might  have  an  impact  on  dose  selection  for  patients  with  renal impairment and different weight. Higher AE rates were reported for most SOCs in the elderly and in patients with impaired renal function, these  likely  to  be  correlated.  However,  there  was  no  obvious  unexpected  safety  signal  that  would justify a dose adjustment in these patients. The statement that data are very limited in patients with severe  renal  impairment  has  been  added  in  the  SmPC.  Further  evaluation  of  the  optimal  dose  in patients with over 100 kg BW is deemed to be necessary. The Applicant commits to conduct such a dose finding study. Meanwhile, the SmPC contains an appropriate warning. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies No interaction studies have been conducted with pegloticase. Additionally, 41% of patients developed antibodies against the PEG moiety. As no interaction studies were conducted it cannot be excluded at present that these antibodies could reduce the efficacy of other PEGylated agents (e.g. interferon) that might be used in future. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

In  humans,  uric  acid  is  the  terminal  metabolite  of  purine  degradation.  Pegloticase  catalyzes  the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin. Allantoin is an inert and highly soluble purine metabolite. It is readily

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

eliminated. Pegloticase is a uric acid specific enzyme and as such might have a very specific effect. Elimination of allantoin is not explicitly presented.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The  Phase  I  programme  established  that  pegloticase  administered  intravenously  had  an  acceptable profile  of  tolerability  and  safety,  after  it  was  shown  that  subcutaneous  administration  was  less  well tolerated.

Irrespective  of  certain  limitations  regarding  sample  size,  and  some  differences  between  studies probably  caused  by  model  misspecification,  manufacturing  site  change,  and  bioanalytical  assay differences, the clinical pharmacology results characterize the PK and PD profiles of pegloticase. The main conclusions supported by the data are:

Study 402 examined the efficacy, immunogenicity, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pegloticase following IV administration. Six groups of 4 patients received single IV doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 12 mg of protein. Following doses of 4-12mg the plasma urate fell within 24-72 hours from a mean ± SEM of 11.1 ± 0.6mg/dL to 1.0 ± 0.5 mg/dl. The plasma half-life of uricase activity ranged from 6-14 days but area under the curve measurements of the plasma urate suggested that plasma urate levels were maintained in the range 1.2- 4.7 mg/dL for 21 days following infusion  of  these  doses.  The  study  identified  a  clear  pharmacodynamic  relationship  between  the  IV administered pegloticase dose, uricase activity, and the plasma uric acid concentration achieved. AntiPEG IgG antibodies developed in 9 patients who had more rapid clearance of enzyme but there were no associated allergic reactions.

- An 8 mg dose is expected to provide sufficient control of hyperuricemia in patients with chronic gout  who  have  failed  alternative  urate-lowering  therapies,  a  population  currently  without alternative treatment options.
- The long half-life and low EC50 support the use of a two weeks dose administration interval.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Potential for some accumulation in the pegloticase 8 mg every two weeks dosing regimen is predicted by the PK modeling; however, this is not of large enough magnitude to give rise to concern (confirmed by the safety profile in patients continuously exposed to pegloticase 8 mg every two weeks for 30 months or more).
- Dose  subgroup  analyses  indicated  that  PUA  responses  might  be  influenced  by  absolute bodyweight (BW) and might be modified in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment.

In  a  single-dose,  dose-escalating study,  following 1-hour intravenous infusions of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 12 mg of pegloticase in 24 patients with symptomatic gout (n=4 subjects/dose group), plasma uric acid  decreased  with  increasing  pegloticase  dose  or  concentrations.  The  duration  of  suppression  of plasma uric acid appeared to be positively associated with pegloticase dose.  Sustained decrease in plasma uric acid below the solubility concentration of 6 mg/dl for more than 12.5 days was observed with doses of 8 mg and 12 mg. 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology The  mode  of  action  of  pegloticase  was  well  characterised  by  the  PK/PD  studies  providing  a  sound rationale for the frequency of dosing being tested in the Phase III. The frequency of dosing seems to be sufficiently supported by the results of the pivotal studies. 2.5. Clinical efficacy The  efficacy  of  pegloticase  was  investigated  in  three  trials,  a  dose-response  study  (403)  and  two double-blind placebo-controlled replicate pivotal Phase III trials (405 &amp; 406).  They were all conducted in  the  target  population  of  patients  with  gout  refractory  to  conventional  therapy.    Two  additional studies were performed (407 &amp; 409), for safety purposes mainly: long-term safety and safety of reexposure after a treatment interruption of at least one year.

## 2.5.1. Dose response study

## Study C0403

Randomized, open-label, multi-centre, parallel-group study of multiple doses of pegloticase, administered by IV infusion, in 41 patients in patients with hyperuricemia and symptomatic gout.

The dose finding study C0403 assessed a total of 41 patients distributed across 4 dosing groups: 4 mg/2 wks (resulting 6 infusions over a period of 10 wks), 8 mg/2 wks (resulting 6 infusions over a period of 10 wks), 8 mg/4 wks (resulting 3 infusions over a period of 8 wks), 12 mg/4 wks (resulting 3 infusions over a period of 8 wks).

Main inclusion criteria

The  patients'  characteristics  showed  distinct  differences  in  the  BMI  between  the  groups.  The  mean bodyweight in the 4mg/2weeks group was very high with 115.26kg (BMI 36.38) whereas the patients in  the  8mg/2 weeks group weighted 76.95kg (BMI 27.12). In the 4mg/2weeks group there was no female patient and in the 8mg/2weeks group the rate of men were 62.5%. Also the age was 10 years lower in the 4mg/2weeks group and SUA at baseline was 1mg/dL lower than with 8mg. The percentages of ITT population treatment responders in the 4mg 2-week, the 8mg 2-week, the 8mg 4-week, and the 12mg 4-week treatment regimens were 4/7 (57.1%), 7/8 (87.5%), 7/13 (53.8%), and  8/13  (61.5%),  respectively.  No  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between  the treatment comparisons of interest (ie, 4mg 2-week vs. 8mg 2-week, 8mg 2-week vs. 8mg 4-week, and 8mg 4-week vs. 12mg 4-week) for the ITT population. The dose-finding study lacked power to show statistically significant differences between the efficacies of the included dosing regimens according to the pre-specified primary endpoint (normalization of PUA to &lt; 6 mg/dL for 80% of the time during entire treatment period).  Nevertheless, using this response criterion, the best regimen was 8mg/2 wks with a proportion of responders (87%) almost twice that achieved with the 8mg/4 wks (46%) when early drop-outs were imputed as non-responders. 2.5.2.

- Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 150/95 mmHg)

All  subjects  who  experienced  a  gout  flare  after  the  screening  visit,  received  an  anti-inflammatory treatment,  pre-specified  at  screening  from  among  three  possible  options:  NSAIDs  and  a  PPI, colchicine;  or  corticosteroids.  Narcotic  analgesics,  acetaminophen,  or  tramadol,  prescribed  at  the discretion of the investigator, could be used to attain effective analgesia in conjunction with gout flare treatment.

· History of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis · Haemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL (males) and &lt; 7 g/dL (females) · Organ transplant recipient · Prior treatment with pegloticase, or other recombinant uricase, or any concomitant therapy with a PEG-conjugated drug · G6PD deficiency · History of anaphylactic reaction to a recombinant protein or porcine product, or hypersensitivity to PEG Treatments Patients were randomised to one of three groups: · pegloticase 8 mg/2 wks, · pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks (alternating every 2 weeks with placebo) · or placebo/2 wks. All  patients  received  an  IV  infusion  of  either  pegloticase  or  placebo  (250  mL)  over  a  2-hour  period every 2 wks. Subjects were to remain at the study site for at least 2 additional hours of observation in order monitor for infusion reactions (IR). Study duration was approximately 26 wks, including 2 wks for screening and 24 wks (6 months) of treatment. After completing the study, subjects were given the option of continuing active treatment up to an additional 30 months through the separate OLE protocol (Study 407), or they could enter at any time into an observation Phase. Gout flare prophylaxis and treatment All patients were required to use a gout flare prophylaxis drug regimen starting 1 week before the first administration of study drug and for the whole duration of the trial. This consisted of colchicine at a dose individualised for each subject by the investigator (0.6 to 1.2mg/d) or an NSAID, associated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastric prophylaxis, if necessary.

## Infusion reaction prophylaxis

All subjects received a standardised pre-treatment prophylaxis regimen consisting of:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 60mg of fexofenadine po the night before study drug infusion,
- 60mg of fexofenadine and 1000mg of acetaminophen po the morning of the infusion,
- and hydrocortisone 200mg IV immediately prior to the infusion of study drug.

## Management of infusion reactions

If a subject experienced an IR (= an AE during the infusion or within the 2 hours post-infusion), the following  procedures  were  undertaken:  abbreviated  physical  exam,  vital  signs,  12-lead  ECG,  blood sample for measurement of tryptase (as a marker for mast cell degranulation).

The rate of infusion had be slowed by half (250 mL/4 hours instead of 250 mL/2 hours), or stopped.  If the AE resolved, the infusion may have proceeded to completion, either at the original rate or at a slower rate. If the AE failed to resolve within one hour, or if in the investigator's opinion the subject was  experiencing  an  anaphylactic  reaction,  the  infusion  had  to  be  terminated.  Subjects  who  were considered to have possibly experienced an anaphylactic reaction did not receive a subsequent infusion of  study  drug  without  the  written  authorisation  of  the  Sponsor's  Medical  Monitor.  After  the  first experience of an infusion reaction, the next infusion could be initiated at a slower rate and/or with an increased volume of dilution. In addition, the patient could receive 20mg prednisone the night prior to the next infusion. Objectives Primary objective To demonstrate superiority of pegloticase vs. placebo in reducing plasma uric acid (PUA) as determined by the percentage of subjects achieving and maintaining PUA concentrations &lt; 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time assessed during Months 3 and 6 combined. Secondary objectives To determine the effect of pegloticase as reflected by: · the reduction of tophus burden, · the improvement of patient reported outcomes (PROs) using the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), · the reduction of the number of swollen and tender joints, · the reduction of incidence and frequency of gout flares. Safety objectives To describe the AE profile of pegloticase, in particular: · to determine the incidence of infusion reactions (IRs) and gout flares, · to determine the incidence of clinically manifest allergic reactions, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- to characterize the potential for antibody response to pegloticase by laboratory evaluation.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint

Normalisation of PUA to &lt; 6 mg/dL for 80% of the time during Months 3 and 6 combined (i.e., PUA responder).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were treated every two weeks with either pegloticase or placebo for a treatment period of 6 months. Week 1 was defined as the first day of treatment, so patients were treated on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25.

Following randomisation patients had blood samples taken for measurement of plasma uric acid (PUA) on the day of first treatment (week 1) and at weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24  and  25.  At  weeks  1,  9,  11,  21  and  23  both  pre  and  2  hours  post-dose  samples  were  taken (otherwise only a pre-dose measurement was taken).  On weeks 1, 9, and 21 samples were also taken 24 hours after treatment.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Week 9 (pre-dose, post-dose, + 24 hours), 10, 11 (pre-dose, post-dose), 12, 13 | Week 21 (pre-dose, post-dose, + 24 hours), 22, 23 (pre-dose, post-dose), 24, 25 |

The primary analysis of this endpoint was based on a responder analysis. A patient was classified as a responder if he/she maintained PUA &lt; 6mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during months 3 and 6 combined. A PUA time curve was derived using the linear trapezoidal rule. The proportion of time that the PUA level was below 6 mg/dL was defined as the ratio of the time during months 3 and 6 which the PUA level remained below 6 mg/dL to the entire time interval during each of months 3 and 6. Assessments used for evaluation of primary end-point Month 3 Month 6 Week 9 (pre-dose, post-dose, + 24 hours), 10, 11 (pre-dose, post-dose), 12, 13 Week 21 (pre-dose, post-dose, + 24 hours), 22, 23 (pre-dose, post-dose), 24, 25 Subjects who withdrew from the study before Month 6 were considered non-responders.  Any subject with missing data at week 9 (pre-dose), week 13, week 21 (pre-dose) or week 25 had the baseline value imputed for those measurements. Secondary endpoints · Other endpoints related to PUA: percentage of time that patients were measured with PUA &lt; 6 mg/dL (non hyperuricaemic time) for months 3 and 6 separately, mean PUA (area under the PUA time curve divided by the corresponding time interval), reduction in mean PUA from baseline, and percent reduction in mean PUA from baseline · Reduction of tophus burden Photographs  of  each  subject's  hands  and  feet  and  up  to  two  other  representative  sites  of tophaceous disease were obtained at baseline and at Weeks 13, 19, and 25 using a standardized digital  photography  method.  A  blinded  central  reader  assessed  the  photographs  for  size  of  each target  tophus  using  the  MedStudio®  image  analysis  software  package.  To  be  considered measurable,  tophi  were  ≥  5  mm  in  the  longest  dimension  at  baseline  and  had  borders distinguishable. Up to two tophi representative of the subject's tophus burden but which could not be accurately measured (e.g., due to location, shape or other factors), could also be evaluated at the reader's discretion.

The response of each individual tophus was categorized according to change from baseline using quantitative  or  semi-quantitative  assessment  as:  complete  response  (CR),  marked  response, improved, partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease PD), unable to evaluate. The  overall  categorical  tophus  response  of  CR,  PR,  SD,  or  PD  was  based  on  the  best  response reported among all tophi (measurable and unmeasured) for an individual subject. If any one tophus showed complete response (CR), the overall response was reported as CR if there was no evidence of progressive disease (PD). If, however, any single tophus showed progression, or if a new tophus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

appeared  during  the  study,  the  overall  response  for  that  subject  was  progressive  disease  (PD), regardless of the response of any other tophi.

Time to tophus resolution was defined as the earliest assessment time at which one of the target tophi showed complete resolution.

## · Number of swollen or tender joints

A standard examination of 54 joints was performed by the clinician at baseline, and Weeks 13, 19, and 25. The number of swollen and tender joints, tenosynovitis, and painful and swollen bursae were summarized descriptively. A Clinician's Global Assessment (CGA) of disease activity was also quantified using a 100-mm VAS from 0 (very good) to 100 (very bad).

As  pre-specified  in  the  protocol,  the  evaluation  of  secondary  endpoints  was  to  be  based  on  pooled analyses from the two replicate studies.  If 70% of patients had tophi at study entry, the combined data from the two studies had 80% power to detect a difference of 31% vs. 5% in overall tophi CR rate with a significance level of 5% for each comparison.

· Incidence and severity of gout flares Gout flares were self-reported by patients and confirmed by the investigators. · Patients Reported Outcomes o SF-36 quality of life [QoL] The SF-36 was completed at baseline and Weeks 13, 19, and 25.  The 8 domains of the SF-36 (Physical  Functioning,  Role-Physical,  Bodily  Pain,  General  Health,  Vitality,  Social  Functioning, Role-Emotional,  and  Mental  Health)  were  used  to  calculate  three  summary  scores,  mental (MCS), physical (PCS), and Arthritis-Specific Health Index (ASHI) components; this score was weighted to measure bodily pain, other aspects of physical and role functioning, and well-being particular to arthritic conditions. o HAQ-DI (physical function) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index measures disability over the past week by grouping 20 questions into 8 domains of function: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The highest score for each of the 8 domains is summed (range: 0 to 24) and divided by 8 to yield, on a continuous scale, a Functional Disability Index (range: 0 to 3), with higher score indicative of increased functional disability. The HAQ includes a patient's assessment of pain measured using a 100-mm VAS and a global assessment (PGA) of how well the subject is doing despite arthritis using a 100-mm VAS scale (where 0 = very well and 100 =  very  poor).  The  scale  is  not  included  in  the  validated  version  of  the  Spanish  HAQ questionnaire and, therefore, subjects using the Spanish version of the questionnaire were not included in this analysis. Sample size Approximately 120 patients were to be screened in each trial in order to randomise 100 patients across the three treatment arms. With 40 patients in each pegloticase arm and 20 patients in the placebo arm,  the  study  had  80%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  35%  vs.  5%  in  responder  rate  with  a significance level of 5% for each comparison.

## Randomisation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The randomisation, which used a 2:2:1 (placebo) ratio, was balanced across study centres in the USA, Canada,  Mexico,  and  was  stratified  by  presence/absence  of  tophi.    The  randomisation  was  central using an interactive voice response (IVR) system.

## Blinding (masking)

Pegloticase and placebo were supplied in identical single-use glass vials containing a sterile solution in phosphate buffered  saline  or  phosphate  buffered  saline  alone,  respectively.    To  ensure  blinding,  all patients received an infusion every 2 weeks; for the 8mg/4 wks dosing regimen, half of the injections were of placebo.

- The  numbers  of  gout  flares  experienced  during  the  first  3-month  period  and  during  the  last  3month period were compared using two sample t-tests.  The incidence of gout flares was compared using the Fisher's exact test.  Shift tables were used to display the change in incidence and severity of gout flares during the first 3 mo as compared to the last 3 mo of the study by treatment group. The weekly flare burden was determined by assigning a flare score for each day in the study (0 = no flares, 1 = mild flares, 2 = moderate flares, and 3 = severe flares) based on the most severe flare reported for each day; the weekly flare burden was calculated as the average score for the 7day  period,  i.e.,  from  0  to  3  (with  higher  scores  reflecting  a  more  severe  condition).  Last observational was carried forward for the final visit information.

Statistical methods The primary analysis was a responder analysis, where responders were defined as subjects whose PUA concentrations remained &lt; 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during months 3 and 6 combined. Responder rates were compared between each of the pegloticase treatment groups and placebo using Fisher's exact test. Analysis populations · Intent-To-Treat  (ITT) :  all  randomised  subjects  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study medication and had some follow-up data · Per-protocol (PP) : all subjects of the ITT population who completed 6 months of the study without major protocol deviations · Tophus-evaluable (TE) : all subjects with a tophus at baseline and any subjects who developed a tophus over the course of the study Primary analysis Responder rates were compared between each of the pegloticase treatment groups and placebo using Fisher's exact test. This was done separately for each trial with the ITT population as primary analysis. The same analysis was performed in the PP population as a supportive analysis. Analyses of secondary endpoints Pooled analyses of the two trials were performed for all secondary endpoints. · The PUA endpoints were analysed using two-sample t-test or non-parametric test if needed. · The CR rates for tophi were compared using Fisher's exact test and two sample Wilcoxon test for ordinal scores (1 to 4).  Kaplan-Meier plots were used to describe time to tophus resolution. · Number of swollen/tender joints, CGA, QoL and VAS scores were compared using two-sample ttest and changes from baseline were analysed using a linear model with covariate as the baseline value.  Last observation was carried forward for the final visit information. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Results

## Participant flow

Overall, 128 and 134 subjects were screened in study 405 and 406, respectively.  Out of these, 109 and 116 subjects, respectively, were randomised; the most frequent screening failures were due to laboratory tests that did not meet selection criteria.  Overall, 212 patients (out of 225) were treated and they were all included in the ITT analysis.

The disposition of the study patients is shown in Table 8.

Table 8 Disposition of patients in studies 405 &amp; 406 - adapted from CSRs (including corrections after database lock in study 406 CSR p.45) Recruitment Study 405 was conducted in 29 centres in US and Canada from June 2006 to October 2007. Study 406 was conducted in 27 centres in US and Mexico from June 2006 to October 2007. Subject were randomised from June 2006 to March 2007 and followed for 6 months. Conduct of the study Administrative structure The  studies  were  monitored  by  a  CRO  (Kendle  International),  which  also  conducted  the  statistical analysis and prepared the CSR.

Several central laboratories were used:

- Princeton Radiology Pharmaceutical Research for the reading of the target tophus photographs
- ICON  Clinical  Laboratories  for  the  routine  laboratory  tests,  including  G6PD,  tryptase  and  CH50 determinations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Charles  River  Laboratories  Preclinical  Services  Montreal  for  the  assays  of  uric  acid,  PEG-uricase activity and PEG-uricase antibodies

## Study audits

The Sponsor audited the CRO and laboratories as well as a number of investigator sites: 5 sites in study 405 and 6 sites in study 406.

The FDA inspected the Sponsor, Charles River Laboratories and 3 investigator sites.

Protocol amendments Three  protocol  amendments  were  made,  which  introduced  minor  changes  to  the  statistical  plan, inclusion criteria, and study procedures. Baseline data Baseline characteristics are presented for the pooled data in the ITT population, i.e. 212 patients. The patients enrolled in the pivotal studies were aged between 23 and 89 years, 55 years on average, with a sex ratio of 4:1. There were a majority of White patients (67%) but Hispanic and Black patients were  also  represented.  Of  note,  African  Americans  are  known  to  develop  hyperuricaemia  more commonly than White persons.  The patients were clearly overweight as evidenced by a mean BMI of 33  kg/m 2 and  weight  of  100  kg;  obesity  is  a  well-known  factor  associated  with  gout,  as  are  the metabolic  syndrome,  hypertension,  congestive  heart  failure,  and  renal  insufficiency.  Indeed,  comorbidities  in  the  study  population  included  hypertension  (&gt;  70%),  metabolic  disorders  (&gt;  60%), renal  failure  and  nephrolithisasis  (&gt;  40%),  and  cardiac  disorders  (&gt;  30%)  (data  not  shown).    The majority of patients did not drink alcohol, a trigger for recurrent flares (data not shown). The overall mean duration since first gout attack was 17 years and the number of gout flares reported over the last 18 months was about 10 (i.e. &gt; 6 per year), the majority of which were crippling (63%). Overall, 73% exhibited tophi. More than half the patients (58%) had a chronic arthropathy and 22% had undergone surgery for gout; as many as 16% had renal complications of gout. As required by protocol, all patients had a history of hypersensitivity or failure to normalise SUA with allopurinol. The most frequent reason was related to hypersensitivity (40% of the cases) followed by lack of efficacy, and dosing limited by GI intolerance or renal impairment. In  the  pooled  analysis,  the  treatment  arms  appeared  reasonably  well-balanced  with  respect  to demographics  and  disease  characteristics.  Of  note,  there  were  some  differences  between  the  two studies; patients were slightly older, more overweight, with more co-morbidities and more severe gout in study 405 than in study 406. Numbers analysed The number of infusions administered to each patient (out of a total of 12) is summarised in Table 9. Medicinal product no longer authorised

While the vast majority of patients received their full treatment in the placebo arm, these data reflect a high  discontinuation  rate (about  30%) in  the  pegloticase  arms,  with  no  difference  between  the  two regimens (consistent with Table 12). Treatment withdrawal occurred as early as after the first infusion and no pattern was evident. Outcomes and estimation A. Primary endpoint With  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint,  normalisation  of  PUA  to  below  6 mg/dL  at  both  Month  3  and Month 6, pegloticase was shown effective in both pivotal Phase III trials and in the pooled analysis. Significantly  more  subjects  in  both  8 mg  pegloticase  every  2  wks  (E2W)  and  every  4 wks  (E4W) treatment arms were responders compared to subjects receiving placebo (Table 10).

## B. Secondary endpoints

## Mean PUA

Mean PUA values were significantly lower for both pegloticase groups than  for placebo at Month 3, Month 6, and Month 3 and 6 combined (p &lt; 0.001) (Tables 11 and 12).

Overall,  155  patients  were  evaluable  for  this  endpoint.    Differences  in  Overall  tophus  response, analyzed by categories of response, were significantly greater for pegloticase 8 mg E2W compared to placebo at every post-baseline tophus measurement including Final Visit.  For the pegloticase 8 mg E4W arm, the difference  was  only  significant  at  Week  19  (Table  13).    This  analysis  was  consistent between the two studies and the pooled analysis.

The  Overall  tophus  response  was  assessed  in  relation  to  the  PUA  responder  status.  Within  each pegloticase  arm,  a  greater  number  of  subjects  who  were  PUA  responders  demonstrated  complete resolution of tophi (41-62%) than subjects who were non-responders, although a certain proportion of non-responder patients had a complete response (11-26%) at Final Visit.

Resolution of tophi has been shown with urate-lowering therapy and some experts contend that SUA should be lowered to &lt; 5 mg/dL in patients with tophaceous gout. The velocity of tophi reduction has been  shown  to  be  linearly  related  to  the  mean  SUA  during  therapy.  With  conventional  therapy, resolution of tophi takes an average of 20 months (Perez-Ruiz et al, 2002).

Number of swollen or tender joints The mean baseline number of swollen and tender joints was higher in the placebo arm as compared with the pegloticase arms. For both endpoints, statistically significant changes from baseline were seen in both pegloticase arms but not in the placebo arm. The differences from placebo were not statistically significant for swollen joints for either pegloticase regimen; however, for tender joints both groups did achieve  superiority  to  placebo  (Tables  14  and  15).  PUA  responders  had  a  greater  decrease  in  the number of swollen and tender joints than PUA non-responders.

1 P-value based on two sample t-test to compare corresponding pegloticase groups vs. placebo. 2 P-value based on paired t-test within treatment. The  clinician's  global  assessment  of  disease  activity  (CGA)  reflected  a  greater  improvement  from baseline to Week 25 for both pegloticase regimens as compared with placebo (p &lt;0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) (data not shown). When combined (i.e. number of swollen or tender joints), the change from baseline to week 25 was significant  in  both  treatment  arms  (data  not  shown).  Overall,  these  results  provide  evidence  of significant clinical benefit for patients with gout arthropathy. Gout flares Following the initiation of pegloticase treatment, the incidence of gout flares increased during Months 1-3 as expected, as this also occurs with other urate-lowering treatments. In contrast, during Months 4-6,  patients  who  received  pegloticase  8  mg  E2W  had  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the incidence of gout flares compared with placebo (p = 0.007) (Table 16 and Figure 2).

During Months 1-3, the severity of gout flares was typically moderate in both pegloticase arms. The frequency of severe flares was 22-23% in the pegloticase arms vs. 5% in the placebo arm. During Months  4-6,  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  subjects  experiencing  severe  flares  in  the pegloticase arms (7-9%) vs. 14% in the placebo arm (Table 17).

As  expected  and  in  spite  of  prophylactic  treatment,  gout  flares  occurred  more  frequently  at  the initiation of therapy with pegloticase as compared with placebo, especially in the first month, and they were also more severe. However, after the first 3 months of treatment, the effect of the E2W regimen was manifest as patients experienced significantly less flares in comparison with placebo. In contrast, with  the  E4W  regimen,  the  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  flares  was  still  numerically  higher during  Months  5  &amp;  6  than  with  placebo.  Therefore,  only  the  E2W  regimen  has  shown  a  favourable effect on gout flares.

SF-36 As  a  reference  for  comparison  purposes,  in  a  healthy  normal  population  (age  55-64  for  males  and females combined) the average scores are approximately 47 for Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores and 52 for Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. In the study population, these scores were  lower  at  baseline,  especially  the  physical  component.  Both  pegloticase  regimens  produced significantly greater changes from baseline than placebo for the physical component but not for the mental component (Tables 18 and 19). The changes were much greater in PUA responders than PUA non-responders (data not shown).

The  mean  ASHI  scores  at  baseline  were  similar  across  treatment  arms.  At  the  final  visit,  both pegloticase  arms  had  statistically  significantly  higher  mean  ASHI  scores  than  placebo,  indicating improvement in bodily pain and functional impairment after receiving treatment with pegloticase (p ≤ 0.003).  For  the  between  treatment  comparisons,  the  changes  from  baseline  were  statistically significantly different for both pegloticase regimens (p = 0.003) (Table 20).

Table 20 SF-36 ASHI score (ITT population) - from pooled analysis HAQ-DI Mean HAQ-DI scores decreased (i.e., reflected improvement in physical functioning) from baseline to Final Visit in both pegloticase arms, whereas they showed little change in the placebo arm. The mean changes from baseline in each pegloticase arm were statistically significantly greater than for placebo (p ≤ 0.026) (Table 21).

Mean HAQ pain scores decreased from baseline to Final Visit in both pegloticase arms but increased in the placebo arm. The improvement was statistically significant for the pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks regimen only (p = 0.04) (Table 22). The changes were much greater in PUA responders than PUA nonresponders (data not shown).

At baseline, the various scores reflected the impact of the disease on the patients' physical functioning and  bodily  pain.  In  particular,  the  baseline  HAQ-disability  index  (mean  1.1  -  1.2)  suggested  a moderate level of physical impairment and the baseline VAS score (around 50) a moderate level of pain. In general, a significant improvement was reported for the various scores (except for the mental SF-36 component, which was not very affected at baseline) in both pegloticase arms; these results provide supportive evidence of patient benefit.

The baseline mean HAQ Patient Global Assessment (PGA) score was lower in the pegloticase 8 mg E2W arm in comparison to the other arms but the differences were not statistically significant. Mean HAQ PGA  scores  decreased  (improved)  from  baseline  to  Final  Visit  in  both  pegloticase  arms  whereas  it increased slightly in the placebo arm. The improvement was statistically significant for both pegloticase regimens (p ≤ 0.02) (Table 23). The changes were much greater in PUA responders than PUA nonresponders (data not shown).

## Ancillary analyses

The terms responder and non-responder are defined by the primary endpoint but the PUA data clearly show that all subjects who received pegloticase responded with a rapid normalisation of PUA within the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

first day. Some of these subjects had a persistent normalisation for the entire 6-month study period (including over months 3 and 6) and can be referred to as 'persistent responders' while those subjects that did not maintain PUA below 6 mg/dL for the entire 6-month study period (including months 3 and 6) can be referred to as 'transient responders' (Figure 3). Loss of PUA response may be attributable to more rapid clearance of drug due to the presence of anti-pegloticase antibodies. In contrast to subjects receiving pegloticase, mean PUA levels in placebo subjects never normalised.

While there were no placebo responders (no decrease in PUA below 6 mg/dL), a statistical difference was  observed  in  both  studies  between  each  of  the  active  treatment  arms  and  the  placebo  arm, although it was borderline in study 405 for the every 4 weeks (E4W) regimen. This regimen produced less consistent response estimates than the every 2 weeks (E2W) regimen with proportions as different as 20% and 49% in studies 405 and 406, respectively. Nevertheless, it can be accepted that efficacy has been shown for both regimens. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) Pooled analysis across the two pivotal studies The pooled analysis of the pivotal studies C0405 and C0406 confirms the statistically significant and clinically relevant PUA reduction shown for the pegloticase within the single pivotal studies. Overall the 8mg/2  weeks  shows  more  decrease  of  PUA-levels  and  more  constant  PUA  concentrations.  Clinical improvement is also of greater magnitude for the 8mg/2 weeks dosing than given 8mg/4 weeks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Primary endpoint

With  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint,  normalisation  of  PUA  to  below  6 mg/dL  at  both  Month  3  and Month 6, pegloticase was shown effective in both pivotal Phase III trials and in the pooled analysis. Significantly more subjects in both 8 mg pegloticase every 2 wks and every 4 wks treatment groups were responders compared to subjects receiving  placebo;  there  were  no  placebo-responders  (Table 26).

* 95% CI for the difference in responder rate vs. placebo      * * p-value vs. placebo using Fisher's exact test Secondary endpoints Please  make reference to the pooled data presented in outcomes and estimations of the secondary endpoints. Additional analyses The following additional analyses are shown below: the overall duration of treatment in studies C0405, C0406, and C0407, efficacy data with regard to PUA results from the two pivotal 6 months studies C0405 and C0406, and the new long term efficacy analyses in patients treated for at least 1 year in studies C0405, C0406, and C0407 and an analysis of PUA responder with different cut-offs (50%, 60% 70% and 80% of time &gt;6mg/dL. These analyses show that overall 76 patients received 8mg/2w and 67 patients received 8mg/4w for 100%  of  their  pegloticase  treatment  time.  65  patients  received  pegloticase  under  both  regimens (8mg/2w and 8mg/4w), i.e. switched between regimens within the studies. With  regard  to  treatment  duration  over  one  year  only  33  patients  could  be  identified  as  having received a stable therapeutic dose regimen of 8mg/2w (Table 27).

The  results  with  respect  to  efficacy  (and  safety,  see  below)  especially  the  loss  of  efficacy  during prolonged treatment due to formation of antibodies against pegloticase of a treatment given every 4 weeks compared to the frequency every 2 weeks are distinctly different as can be seen in the PUA analyses of the three dose regimens (Table 28).

1  Responder = subjects achieving and maintaining PUA &lt; 6 mg/dL at least 80% of the time 2 The two-sided 95%CI for the binomial proportion is derived from the Wilson score statistic As there were more responders in female patients than in male patients, it was hypothesised that this outcome may be related to differences in body weight and consequently differences in dose per kg BW. Additional data submitted by the applicant showed a relationship between the responder rate and body weight in the 8mg/2w treatment arm (see table below, responder at 3 and 6 months, p-value=0.053).

## Supportive studies

## Study C0407 (OLE)

The Multi-centre Open-Label Extension Study C0407 includes a variety of data with different impact on the outcome e.g. different duration of treatment or switching of dosing, hence data from this study to support  efficacy  demonstration  requires  use  the  post  hoc  analysis.  This  analysis  was  made  for responders in studies C0405/6 and only for patients who received approx. continuously the therapeutic dose. In this subgroup analysis a trend is indicated that clinical improvement is continued (week 101: status of individual tophus resolution (all improved, CR=73%), tender and swollen joints (0.4 and 1.3 respectively, baseline = 8.9 and 11.7), clinically relevant improvements compared to baseline in pain, patient  global  assessment,  HAQ-DI  and  SF-36  Physical  component)  and  gout  flares  decreased  to  a mean  number  of  flares  per  patient  of  0.02  (baseline  =  0.13).  The  CHMP  noted  however  that  this analysis is based only on 19 patients hence it does not substantially contribute to efficacy data. Study C0409 It  is  noted  that  the  non-randomized,  multicentre,  open-label  re-exposure  study  C0409  could  not substantially contribute to efficacy data because only 3 patients received the full course over 24 weeks. 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies The design of the two replicate Phase III trials is considered adequate including the choice of the study population, which corresponds to the restricted indication sought by the Applicant, and the selection of placebo as comparator given the absence of any treatment for gout refractory to conventional uratelowering agents. Patients had to stop any urate-lowering agent at least one week before the first study infusion. These  selection criteria define  a  population  of  patients  with  symptomatic  gout  and hyperuricaemia that failed to respond to allopurinol (in the EU, the maximum dose for severe condition is 900 mg daily). Moreover, allopurinol is contraindicated in patients with allopurinol (potentially lifethreatening)  hypersensitivity  and  its  posology  needs  to  be  reduced  in  patients  with  impaired  renal function. The primary objective (reduction of SUA below the threshold of 6 mg/dL) is a valid surrogate endpoint, which  is  consistent  with  the  therapeutic  target  for  any  prophylaxis  of  gout  in  clinical  practice. Importantly, the selected secondary endpoints are indicative of direct benefit to the patients: reduction of  tophi  burden,  of  the  number  of  swollen  and  tender  joints,  of  the  incidence  and  severity  of  gout flares, as well as improvement of quality of life.  SUA, acute gout attacks, tophus burden, and the SF36 instrument as a measure of quality of life are all validated outcome measures (OMERACT 9). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based on the results of this Phase II study, 4mg IV every 2 wks was defined as the minimally effective dose; both dose regimens 8mg/2 wks or 8mg/4 wks were effective, and 12mg/4 wks did not provide additional benefit beyond that of the 8mg groups, thereby defining a dose-response plateau. Although the 8mg/2 wks and 8mg/4 wks treatment achieved the same degree of plasma UA decrease, an every 2 wks infusion regimen appeared to offer a more rapid and more prolonged reduction of plasma UA. On the  basis  of  safety  and  efficacy  results  of  this  Phase  II  study,  the  pegloticase  dose  selected  for advancement to Phase III pivotal trials was 8 mg to be administered IV every 2 wks or every 4 wks. Based on the results of the Phase I trial, the selection of the dose regimens tested in this Phase II trial and its design are considered adequate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  studies  appear  to  have  been  adequately  conducted.  The  statistical  analyses  are  generally considered acceptable.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In a pooled analysis, the proportion of responders that maintain a low PUA concentration (&lt; 6 mg/dL) up to the 6 th   month of the double-blind trial is numerically higher with the  E2W regimen (42%) as compared with the E4W regimen (35%) whereas there is no responder in the placebo arm, a highly significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) for both pegloticase arms. Furthermore, while large fluctuations of PUA  concentration are observed  with the E4W  regimen,  sustained  low  to undetectable  PUA concentrations can be achieved with the E2W regimen. Of note, essentially all subjects show an initial rapid decline in PUA concentration, but in those who develop high titres of anti-pegloticase antibodies, exposure  to  pegloticase  becomes  insufficient  to  catabolise  excessive  UA  and  PUA  concentration eventually returns to pre-treatment levels. The analyses of different cut-off values for the definition PUA responders (PUA &lt;6 mg/dL 50%, 60%, 70% or 80% of time) show the robustness of results over 6 months.

In a post-hoc descriptive analysis in various subgroups, responder rates ranged from 31% to 60% with the E2W regimen and were usually higher then those observed with the E4W regimen, which ranged from  26%  to  47%.  Efficacy  vs.  placebo  (0%  response)  was  evident  in  all  subgroups  but  their  size precludes  any  conclusion  on  potential  small  differences  in  efficacy.  Nevertheless,  the  finding  that efficacy does not decrease with age and impaired renal function is reassuring. Patients up to 89 years of age have been treated in the pivotal trials. As for renal impairment, the number of patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min at baseline was limited (38 in the pegloticase arms) and only 14 had severe  renal  impairment  (CrCL  &lt; 30 mL/min).  This  has  been  reflected  in  the  SmPC  and,  given  the prevalence of renal complications associated with severe chronic gout, further data will be collected post-authorisation in patients with severe renal impairment.

Sustained  low  PUA  concentrations  translate  into  clinical  benefit  to  the  patient  as  reflected  by  a significant  effect  on  tophi,  which  is  only  significant  for  the  E2W  regimen  with  40%  of  the  patients exhibiting at least one tophus completely resolved at the Final Visit within the first 6 months of therapy vs.  7%  on  placebo  (p  =  0.002).  However,  when  missing  data  were  considered  as  failures,  these percentages were 29% vs. 7% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. This is an objective sign of clinical efficacy that was observed over a short period of time. Other clinical benefits to the patient include a significant reduction  in  the  number  of  tender  joints  (p  &lt;  0.02)  and  a  favourable  impact  on  quality  of  life,  as reflected  in  the  Physical  Component  Summary  of  the  SF-36  questionnaire  (p  &lt;  0.01)  in  both pegloticase arms. As with all urate-lowering therapies, treatment with pegloticase was expected to lead to an increase in gout flares during the initiation of therapy. It is important to note that the self-reported history of gout flares  in  the  pre-study  period  was  1.38 flares  per  3 month  for  all  subjects.  Gout  flare  prophylaxis (colchicine or NSAID)  for  all subjects started at least 1 week  before  their first study  drug administration, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated.  About  80%  of  the  patients experience gout flares within the first 3 months of pegloticase therapy. Subsequently, the benefit of the treatment becomes evident as the incidence of gout flares decreases over time in comparison to placebo, the difference being only significant for the E2W regimen (pegloticase 41%, placebo 67%; p = 0.007). However, the CHMP noted that this reduction of gout flare incidence for the E2W regimen was only observed for a selected subgroup as the patients who discontinued the study before month 4 were excluded from this analysis; in a worst-case analysis imputing dropouts as incident cases of gout flare, no significant difference was seen.

A small number of patients (33) were treated for at least one year at a stable dose of 8mg/2w. Sixtyone percent (61%) were responders beyond 12 months and the overall responder rate in this post hoc analysis was 48.5%. The long-term efficacy results (PUA responder rates) in patients treated with a stable,  unchanged dose of pegloticase (8mg/2w or 8mg/4w) for at least 52 weeks showed a higher proportion  of  responders  in  the  8mg/2w  group  compared  to  8mg/4w  regimen  at  all  analysed  time points.  Insofar,  the  interval  of  2weeks  is  supported  by  the  presented  data.  However,  subgroup analyses indicate that PUA responses might be influenced by absolute bodyweight (BW) and might be modified  in  the  elderly  and  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  This  is  supported  by  data  from population pharmacokinetic analysis revealing an influence of the BSA and of the patient's creatinine clearance on the clearance of pegloticase. This might have an impact on dose selection for patients with renal impairment and different weight. However, as no obvious unexpected safety signals have been  seen  in  the  elderly  and  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function,  a  dose  adjustment  in  these patients seems not justified. This is reflected in the SmPC. With regard to the efficacy in patients over 100kg BW, the SmPC indicates the lower response rates that were observed in these patients but also clarifies that the available data are not conclusive.

Pegloticase is claimed for long-term treatment. The safety of pegloticase is supported by the results of 7 clinical studies in patients with refractory gout, including two Phase I studies (C0401 and C0402), one Phase II study (C0403), two replicate pivotal Phase III studies (C0405 and C0406), as well as an open  label  extension  (OLE)  to  Phase  III  (C0407),  as  well  as  a  small,  open-label  study  (C0409) evaluating  safety  and  efficacy  of  re-exposure  to  pegloticase  after  a  prolonged  drug-free  interval  in patients  who  participated  in  earlier  studies  of  IV  administered  pegloticase.  The  clinical  studies  with pegloticase in gout are summarized in Table 2.7.4-1. Pegloticase was IV infused in all studies except for C0401 in which pegloticase was administered subquanteously.

2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy The primary endpoint percentage of PUA responders achieving the primary efficacy endpoint (PUA &lt; 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Months 3 and 6) was significantly and clinically relevantly greater in the patients receiving pegloticase 8 mg/2 wk and partially 8 mg/4 wk when compared to placebo treated patients. The secondary endpoints showed for the intended therapeutic dose that the continuously lowering of plasma uric  acid  under  the  threshold  of  crystallisation  induces  a  clinical  improvement.  For  clinically relevant parameters as function, pain or tender and swollen joints a meaningful improvement for the claimed therapeutic dose could be shown compared to placebo at week 25. The mean decrease of PUA is  mainly  maintained  over  time  so  that  uric  acid  can  also  be  released  from  the  tissue  which  is documented in gout tophi dissolving from 3-5 month of treatment on. The long-term efficacy results (PUA responder rates) in patients treated with a stable, unchanged dose of pegloticase (8mg/2w or 8mg/4w) for at least 52 weeks show a higher proportion of responders in the 8mg/2w group compared to  8mg/4w  regimen  at  all  analysed  time  points.  However,  subgroup  analyses  indicate  that  PUA responses might be influenced by absolute bodyweight (BW). The CHMP has recommended and the applicant  has  agreed  to  further  explore  the  optimal  dose  in  patients  with  over  100  kg  BW  in  a dedicated study. This together with this information in the SmPC is considered adequate. 2.6. Clinical safety Patient exposure Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The IV studies included in total 277 patients with symptomatic gout despite previous treatment with conventional  therapy  (e.g.  xanthine  oxidase  inhibitors);  273  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of pegloticase.

In studies C0405/C0406/C0407, 108 patients were started on the claimed dose regimen 8mg/2 weeks (when including patients in the placebo arm that were treated with pegloticase in the extension study) and 100 patients were started on the 8mg/4 weeks regimen. Out of these, 57 and 45, respectively, were treated for at least 18 months (maximum duration 31 months). However, since patients were allowed to switch from one regimen to the other in the course of the extension study, only 33 patients were maintained on the claimed dose regimen 8mg/2 weeks for at least 12 months.

On  the  basis  of  the  pivotal  studies  (C0405/6)  only  very  common  AEs  could  be  detected  over  a treatment period of up to 6 month. The long-term safety database is limited and this is reflected in the SmPC; however, this is considered acceptable given the last line indication and potential therapeutic benefit  to  the  patient.  This  will  be  further  addressed  in  post-authorisation  studies.  The  two  dose regimens were not considered comparable with regard to safety because the dosing frequency has a distinct influence on the patient's reactions to pegloticase. The table below presents the summary of adverse events (AEs) in the pooled pivotal studies C0405 and C0406 (safety population).

In patients with renal insufficiency the incidence of severe AEs was increased versus placebo (placebo: 27%, 8mg/2 weeks: 38.5%, 8mg/4 weeks: 50%. However, there is no overall  difference  in  safety across  a  variety  of  baseline  renal  function  categories,  from  &lt;30  mL/min,  30-50  mL/min,  and  &gt;50 mL/min.

Renal failure, renal failure chronic and renal impairment together was reported to have a frequency of 3.6% in the 8mg/4 weeks group versus 0% in the placebo group. Chromaturia is documented only for pegloticase  Haematocrit and haemoglobin were decreased only in the pegloticase groups (total 3.6%) this is an AE and will be further monitored.

There were in total 4 infusion events in C0405/C0406, 1 in Study C0405 (mild injection site erythema; pegloticase  8  mg/2  wks)  and  3  in  Study  C0406  (infusion  site  irritation,  pegloticase  8  mg/2  wks; infusion site erythema, pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks; injection site hemorrhage, placebo). All were reported as mild in severity.

Applying  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  anaphylaxis  proposed  by  the  NIAID/FAAN  Joint  Symposium  on Anaphylaxis (Sampson et al. 2006) led to the detection of 14 cases (7 definite and 7 potential) out of the  273  patients  of  the  entire  pegloticase  clinical  study  database  (Studies  C0402,  C0403,  C0405, C0406, and C0407), i.e. a prevalence of 5.1%. These reactions occurred during or within 2 hours of pegloticase infusion. Two cases occurred during the first infusion, including one in a patient that did not  receive  the  full  prophylaxis  (missed  fexofenadine  and  paracetamol);  the  remainder  occurred between  the  third  and  sixth  infusion.  Symptoms  of  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid  reaction  included stridor,  wheezing,  perioral/lingual  oedema,  or  hemodynamic  instability,  with  or  without  rash  or urticaria. Finally, 9/14 patients stopped treatment as a result of such reaction.

Infections  as  AEs  occurred  in  a  greater  percentage  in  the  pegloticase  8mg/2wks  group  than  the placebo group. The underlying mechanism for this is not clear. Gout flares Gout flare was the most common AE in the double-blind studies despite gout flare prophylaxis as seen with  all  effective  urate  lowering  therapies.  Most  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity,  were  generally tolerated by subjects but resulted in discontinuation of pegloticase therapy in 5 patients on pegloticase 8 mg/2 wks and 3 patients on pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks.  Gout flares were especially frequent in the first 3 months of therapy (see efficacy section). Infusion reactions An infusion reaction (IR) was defined as an AE, or more typically, a cluster of AEs that occurred during or within 2 hours after the end of the study drug infusion. The prevalence and severity of IRs in the double-blind-trials is shown in the table below; more patients experienced an IR on the E4W regimen than on the E2W regimen. Likewise, the percentage of pegloticase infusions with an infusion reaction was much lower (5%; 43/852) in the E2W arm than in the E4W arm (65/430; 15%). Most patients developed only one or two IRs and most IRs were of moderate intensity. Table 35 Prevalence and severity of IRs in the pooled analysis C0405/C0406 Anaphylactic and delayed hypersensitivity reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

One  case  of  possible  delayed  type  hypersensitivity  (angioneurotic  oedema  and  urticaria  occurring approximately 6 days after the third pegloticase dose was reported in the 8 mg/4 weeks group. It led to treatment discontinuation and fully resolved with corticosteroids and epinephrine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A post-hoc analysis was carried out where various scenarios and simulations of stopping criteria based on  SUA  levels  explored  the  effect  of  these  stopping  criteria  on  the  response  rates  and  IR  rates simultaneously. Table 36 below presents the results of these scenarios in the 8 mg/2 weeks group, selecting  different  SUA  cut-offs,  6 mg/dL,  7 mg/dL  or  8 mg/dL  as  well  as  one  or  two  consecutive measurements prior to stopping.

Table 36 Pegloticase Stopping Rule in the pooled analysis C0405/C0406 (N=85)

The results of these simulations demonstrated that if no stopping criterion were used (as was done during the phase III trials), the overall response rate would be 42% with an IR rate of 26% in the patients treated with the 8mg every two week regimen. The IR rate would be minimized when a single assessment of SUA with a cut-off of 6 mg/dL or 7 mg/dL were used.  However, in such a scenario the efficacy  would  be  reduced  to  36%.  Therefore,  the  applicant  proposed  that  pegloticase  should  be stopped if SUA &gt; 6 mg/dL in two consecutive tests, which according to the simulations reduced the IR rate substantially (14%) but maintained the efficacy almost at the same level (41%). This algorithm has been included in the SmPC as a risk mitigation measure. Infusion related reactions in relation to BW Infusion related reactions showed a tendency to occur in a greater proportion of patients in the higher weight group of &gt;100kg since infusion reactions occurred in 53.7% for patients in the weight 70 to ≤100 kg weight group, 70.0% of the patients in the &gt;100 to ≤120 weight group, and 75% of patients in  the  &gt;120  kg  weight  group,  respectively.  Also  the  anti-pegloticase  antibody  titres  showed  higher levels  of  antibody  in  the  higher  weight  groups.  The  statistically  significant  kg  BW  dose  response relation suggests that patients over 100kg BW may not receive an optimal dose leading to a setting similar to an 'interruption' of therapy. Serious adverse events/ deaths/other significant events Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events (SAEs), including IRs and gout flares, are summarized by system organ class and preferred term (for details see Table 37).

Forty-four (44) subjects experienced a total of 78 SAEs: 20 (23.5%) subjects were in the pegloticase 8 mg/2 wks group,  19  (22.6%)  subjects  were  in  the  pegloticase  8  mg/4  wks  group,  and  5  (11.6%) subjects were in the placebo group. Serious AEs typically were experienced by single subjects, except for IRs which occurred in 4 (4.7%) subjects in the pegloticase 8 mg/2 wks group, 7 (8.3%) subjects in the pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks group, and 0 subjects in the placebo group. Other SAEs experienced by more  than  1  subject  in  the  pegloticase  8  mg/2  wks  group  included  gout  (4  subjects  [4.7%]), arrhythmia (2 [2.4%]), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (2 [2.4%]). Gout was experienced by 2 (4.7%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  No  SAE  was  experienced  by  more  than  one  subject  in  the pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks group. In comparisons between the pegloticase dose groups and placebo, no SAEs  (by  preferred  term)  were  detected  other  than  IRs  that  indicated  a  causal  relationship  to pegloticase dose administration. Overall, the incidence of SAEs in the pegloticase groups was double in comparison to placebo (8mg/2 weeks: 23.5% vs 22.6% vs 11.6%). It  is  recognised  that  incidences  of  serious  AEs  related  to  cardiac  disorders  were  increased  in comparison to placebo (0%) in the 8mg/2 weeks group, with a frequency of 4.7% and if chest pain is included 5.9%, and in the 8mg/4 weeks group with a frequency of 3.6%. The incidence of severe infusion reactions (IR) was higher in the pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks group than in the pegloticase 8 mg/2 wks group: 9.5% vs. 4.7%, respectively. These IRs occurred very commonly and serious IRs were even common despite prior intensive prophylactic medication was applied to the patients. The frequency of IRs in the safety population being 100% of time on active treatment was 50%  (38/76)  in  the  pegloticase  8 mg/2 weeks  group.  The  frequency  of  serious  IRs  in  the  safety population  being  100%  of  time  on  active  treatment  was  13.2%  (10/76)  in  the  pegloticase 8 mg/2 weeks group. IRs are described to mostly occur within the first 4 months. Deaths Overall, there were 6 deaths. Five of them were in the pegloticase treatment arm. Subjects who were randomized in the two double-blind studies: 3 in the pegloticase every 2 wks group (C0405-203-001, cardiac arrest, unlikely to be related to study drug; C0406-301-003, Staph. aureus septicemia, unlikely to be related to study drug; C0406-315-005, sudden death attributed to cardiac arrhythmia, unlikely to be related to study drug); 2 in the pegloticase every 4 wks group (C0405-102-006, congestive heart failure, unlikely to be related to study drug; C0405-122-004, sepsis, unlikely to be related to study drug); and 1 in the placebo group (C0406-301-014, multi-system organ failure, not related to study drug).

Two of the 3 subjects in the pegloticase every 2 wks group who died had a most recent UA below 6 mg/dL. The one subject in the pegloticase every 4 wks group who died had a UA above 6 mg/dL.  All subjects who died were older than 50 years of age and had multiple co-morbidities.

There were 2 additional deaths reported in subjects who received placebo in the double-blind studies, did  not  enroll  in  the  OLE  C0407  Study,  and  died  approximately  4  months  after  participation  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

double-blind studies. None of the deaths appeared to be causally related to treatment, as judged by the Clinical Investigators and Savient Medical Monitors.

## Laboratory findings

On the base of the submitted main clinically relevant laboratory findings (renal, liver, blood) no signal is  apparent, however, no final conclusion could be made as the sample size is very small and most patients have several co-morbidities and co- medication.

Immunogenicity Anti-pegloticase  antibodies  were  detected  in  89%  of  subjects  in  the  pegloticase  8  mg/2  weeks  and pegloticase 8 mg/4 weeks treatment groups in the double-blind C0405 and C0406 Studies, and in 15% of the placebo group. An increase in anti-pegloticase antibody titre was detected at week 3 following initiation of treatment with  8  mg  pegloticase  every  two  weeks.  This  relatively  early  onset  suggested  involvement  of  IgM antibodies in the immune response to treatment, which was confirmed by isotyping of all confirmed positive samples. Impact on pharmacokinetics The subjects in the pegloticase 8 mg/2 weeks treatment group with a transient response to pegloticase had a mean peak concentration of pegloticase that was approximately 70% lower (0.8 μg/mL) than for persistent responders at Week 9, attributable to more rapid clearance in the presence of higher levels of anti-pegloticase antibodies. The persistent responders in the pegloticase 8 mg every 2 week group had trough concentrations in the range of 0.5 to 0.7 μg/mL. See Figure 4. Figure 4 Comparison  of  Mean  Pegloticase  Concentrations  in  Persistent  and  Transient Responders; Pegloticase 8mg/2 wks Group (Pooled Data C0405/C0406) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Impact on efficacy

The detection of anti-pegloticase antibodies above a titre of 1:2430 was associated with a reduction in drug trough concentration and reduced therapeutic efficacy, as reflected in mean SUA levels exceeding the target of 6 mg/dL. In transient responders, SUA response was lost (defined as &gt; 6 mg/dL) in 80% of subjects within the first few infusions and most (90%) within the first 9 weeks (see figure 5 below).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Loss  of  efficacy  was  not  associated  with  detection  of  neutralising  antibodies,  as  measured  in  an enzymatic assay. Although the increased clearance of pegloticase with the resultant loss of SUA response is mediated by anti-pegloticase  antibodies,  there  can  be  an  apparent  lag  time  between  the  onset  of  increased clearance and the presence of measurably increased antibodies in the serum. Therefore, measurement of anti-pegloticase antibody titres is not predictive of the loss of the SUA response, whereas monitoring SUA  is  a  good  surrogate  for  measuring  the  development  of  anti-pegloticase  antibodies  that  cause increased clearance of administered pegloticase. Impact on safety There  was  a  numerically  higher  rate  of  patients  with  IRs  in  the  group  of  subjects  who  eventually manifested with high antibody titres (&gt; 1:2430) (18/39; 46%) than in those whose titre remained low (4/46; 9%).  No relationship was shown between antibody titres and severity of IRs. The  incidence  of  IR  was  lower  in  subjects  who  were  responders  to  pegloticase  and  there  were  no severe infusion reactions in responders. In most pegloticase-treated subjects with IRs, loss of response to pegloticase (return to SUA &gt; 6.0 mg/dL) preceded the time of the first IR.  This observation points to  the  need  for  risk  mitigation,  i.e.,  monitoring  serum  uric  acid  with  discontinuation  of  pegloticase when SUA &gt; 6 mg/dL as indicated in the SmPC.

## Safety in special populations

There are no safety studies in special populations.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The CHMP considered acceptable that interaction studies were not conducted with pegloticase.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

A total of 34 subjects were reported in the clinical database as discontinued during the first 6 months of treatment due to an SAE, AE, IR, or gout flare. In the pegloticase 8 mg/2 wks group, 16 subjects were discontinued: 5 subjects discontinued due to gout flares and 7 subjects discontinued due to IRs. In the pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks group, 17 subjects were discontinued: 3 subjects discontinued due to gout flares and 10 subjects discontinued due to IRs. In the placebo group, 1 subject discontinued due to a gout flare and none discontinued due to IRs.

Post marketing experience There have been no epidemiological studies and no post marketing studies with pegloticase. 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SmPC. Infusion reaction More  patients  experienced  an  IR  on  the  E4W  regimen  than  on  the  E2W  regimen.  Likewise,  the percentage of pegloticase infusions with an infusion reaction was much lower (5%; 43/852) in the E2W arm than in the E4W arm (65/430; 15%). Most patients developed only one or two IRs and most IRs were of moderate intensity. 14 cases of anaphylaxis (7 definite and 7 potential) out of the 273 patients of the entire pegloticase clinical  study  database  (Studies  C0402,  C0403,  C0405,  C0406,  and  C0407)  were  detected,  i.e.  a prevalence  of  5.1%.  These  reactions  occurred  during  or  within  2 hours  of  pegloticase  infusion. Symptoms of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction included stridor, wheezing, perioral/lingual oedema, or hemodynamic instability, with or without rash or urticaria. Finally, 9/14 patients stopped treatment as a result of such reaction. The applicant has proposed that pegloticase should be stopped if SUA &gt; 6 mg/dL in two consecutive tests. A post-hoc analysis was carried out where various scenarios and simulations of stopping criteria based on SUA levels explored the effect of these stopping criteria on the response rates and IR rates simultaneously. According to the simulations the proposed SUA based algorithm will reduce the IR rate substantially (14%) but maintained the efficacy almost at the same level (41%). This algorithm has been included in the SmPC as a risk mitigation measure. Also, the ongoing (US) and planned (EU) observational studies are the only way to evaluate the effect of the proposed algorithm. The statistically significant kg BW dose response relation suggests that patients over 100kg BW may not receive an optimal dose leading to a setting similar to an 'interruption' of therapy. The applicant will  further  explore  the  optimal  dose  in  patients  with  over  100kg  BW,  as  documented  in  the  risk management plan. Meanwhile the information above is reflected in the SmPC. Serious cardiac events Medicinal product no longer authorised

An  increased  occurrence  of  cardiac  adverse  events  in  patients  treated  with  Krystexxa  has  been observed, even if the data are limited. Because a preclinical signal has been detected for a cardiac risk (vacuoles) further preclinical studies were initiated and are ongoing to assess the impact of PEG on the heart.

## Gout flares

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Gout flare was the most common AE in the double-blind studies despite gout flare prophylaxis as seen with  all  effective  urate  lowering  therapies.  Most  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity,  were  generally tolerated by subjects but resulted in discontinuation of pegloticase therapy in 5 patients on pegloticase 8 mg/2 wks and 3 patients on pegloticase 8 mg/4 wks. Gout flares were especially frequent in the first 3 months of therapy (see efficacy section). A staggered dose escalation to achieve a more progressive PUA level reduction may reduce the frequency and severity of gout flares.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

IRs/anaphylaxis Further data will be provided in a larger cohort of patients from the ongoing (US) and planned (EU) observational studies. Details of data collection are provided with the US study protocol and will be similar with the EU protocol and are considered the only way to evaluate the effect of the proposed algorithm. Serious cardiac events Preclinical studies are ongoing to assess the impact of PEG on the heart. Further data will be provided in a larger cohort of patients from the ongoing (US) and planned (EU) observational studies. Both data sets will be used to gain more information on the 'important potential risk' of worsening of congestive heart failure, other cardiac risks and long term cardiovascular safety. Gout flares The  high  incidence  of  gout  flares  is  of  concern,  therefore,  it  should  be  investigated  whether  a staggered  dose  escalation  may  reduce  the  frequency  and  severity  of  gout  flares.  The  applicant commits to conduct 'Gout flare' interventional trial . Further data will be provided in a larger cohort of patients from the ongoing (US) and planned (EU) observational studies. 2.7. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. In  addition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant  should  take  the  following  minor  points  into consideration for future update to the Pharmacovigilance system: · The flowchart should be expanded with more timelines for major processing steps. · A  summary  of  the  information  provided  in  the  response  document  on  the  external  safety committee should be included. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- The section on SOPs should be updated according to SOPs having been finalised by then.
- The  description  of  the  quality  management  system  should  be  updated  according  to  the comments in the clinical AR.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Benefits Beneficial effects The beneficial effect of peglotiocase is its ability to effectively reduce uric acid level in patients who have failed to respond to conventional urate-lowering therapy. In the two main studies the primary endpoint achieved statistical significance and clinically relevant superiority versus placebo showing that the percentage of subjects achieving and maintaining plasma uric acid (PUA) levels &lt;6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Months 3 and 6 was 42.4% for pegloticase (8mg/2weeks) versus 0% for placebo (ITT-population, pooled data studies C0405 and C0406/6). In patients receiving pegloticase 8 mg/4weeks the difference was also significant but less pronounced. The  secondary  endpoints  showed  for  the  intended  therapeutic  dose  (8  mg/2  weeks)  that  the continuous  lowering  of  plasma  uric  acid  under  the  threshold  of  crystallisation  induces  a  clinical improvement.  For  clinically  relevant  parameters  as  function,  pain  or  tender  and  swollen  joints  a clinically  meaningful  improvement  for  the  intended  therapeutic  dose  could  be  shown  compared  to placebo at week 25. The marked decrease of PUA is mainly maintained over time so that uric acid can be  mobilized  from  the  tissue  which  is  documented  in  gout  tophi  dissolving  as  from  3-5  month  of treatment. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects Dose subgroup analyses indicate that PUA responses might be influenced by absolute bodyweight (BW) and might be modified in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment. This is supported by data from  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  revealing  an  influence  of  the  BSA  and  of  the  patient's creatinine clearance on the clearance of pegloticase. This might have an impact on dose selection for patients with renal impairment and different weight. However, as no obvious unexpected safety signals have been seen in the elderly and in patients with impaired renal function, a dose adjustment in these patients seems not justified. This is reflected in the SmPC. With regard to the efficacy in patients over 100kg BW, the SmPC indicates the lower response rates that were observed in these patients but also clarifying that the available data is not conclusive. The CHMP has recommended and the applicant has agreed to further explore the optimal dose in patients with over 100 kg BW in a dedicated study. This together with this information in the SmPC is considered adequate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Long-term data are obtained from a very small (33 patients on stable dose of 8mg/2 weeks over a treatment  duration  of  one  year)  and  heterogeneous  population  with  different  co-medications.  In principle, continuous PUA decrease is likely, however with a potential for patients to drop out because of  loss  of  effect  due  to  antibody  formation.  Furthermore,  the  optimal  treatment  duration  with pegloticase  has  not  been  established.  In  light  of  these  limitations,  the  benefit  risk  relation  of  a treatment should be re-assessed on an ongoing basis by the physician considering tophus resolution but  also  the  increased  risk  and  the  initially  increased  burden  for  the  patient.  However,  it  is  not considered justified to recommend stopping therapy after 6 months in those patients that maintain a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

response  with  an  acceptable  tolerance.  Therefore,  the  duration  of  treatment  should  be  based  upon maintenance of response (serum uric acid levels &lt; 6 mg/dl) and clinical judgment, as stated in the SmPC. More data from long-term treatment will be provided by the ongoing (US) and planned (EU) observational studies as well as the registry, as specified in the risk management plan.

## Risks

Infusion  reactions  (IRs)  are  very  common  (25.9%)  in  treatment  with  pegloticase  (8mg/2  weeks) (pooled analyses C0405/06). These events potentially occur as anaphylaxis despite potent prophylactic measure. IRs are described to mostly occur within the first 4 months. To manage this identified risk a serum uric acid based algorithm has been developed and implemented in the SmPC. On the basis of a post hoc analysis of the two pivotal trials it seems that the incidence of IRs could be reduced to a calculated frequency of approximately 14% with this algorithm. The presented data also indicate that the 8mg/2 week regimen has the better risk profile and in contrary to the 8mg/4 week regimen the chance to reduce the IRs by means of the proposed algorithm. It should however be noted that in the first US post-marketing reports half the reactions occurred during the 2 nd infusion. Since the proposed algorithm  requires  2  consecutive  pre-infusion  levels  &gt;  6  mg/dl,  only  reactions  potentially  occurring after the 2 nd  infusion can be avoided using this algorithm. The potential of this algorithm to manage this risk needs therefore further data from post-marketing experience, and such data is considered key to the benefit risk of the product. An observational study will be conducted in the EU, and is a condition to the authorisation. The data from this study together with data from other sources identified in the risk management plan will be the basis for the evaluation of the effect of the proposed algorithm. An increased  occurrence  of  cardiac  adverse  events  has  been  observed,  even  if  the  database  is  too small  to  detect  a  clear  cardiac  safety  signal.  Because  a  preclinical  signal  has  been  detected  for  a cardiac risk (vacuoles) further preclinical studies are ongoing to assess the impact of PEG on the heart. Additionally,  further  data  will  be  provided  in  a  larger  cohort  of  patients  from  the  ongoing  (US)  and planned (EU) observational studies. In the US study cardiovascular events are not a primary endpoint but it is understood that they are included in secondary endpoints in Serious Adverse Events. In the proposal  for  the  EU  Post  Authorization  Observational  Study  cardiovascular  adverse  events  were included amongst others as primary endpoints; therefore the data from this study is considered key to the benefit risk. Both the US based observational study and the EU observational study will be used to gain more information on the worsening of congestive heart failure, other cardiac risks and long term cardiovascular safety. Upon treatment initiation with pegloticase, gout flare frequency is distinctly increased at the beginning. To reduce the likelihood of gout flares prophylaxis with colchicine or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is recommended; this recommendation is included in the SmPC. Based on available data it  is  expected  that  continuous  treatment  with  pegloticase  decreases frequency and intensity of gout flares  hence  treatment  does  not  need  to  be  interrupted  because  of  a  gout  flare,  which  should  be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Additional data on this identified risk will be obtained in a larger cohort of patients from the ongoing (US) and planned (EU) observational studies. Furthermore, the risk management specifies the conduct of a gout flare interventional study, which will investigate whether a staggered dose escalation may reduce the frequency and severity of gout flares at the initiation of treatment.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Overall the size of the safety data base is small with 208 patients having received at least one infusion of  8  mg  pegloticase  in  the  pivotal  trials,  half  of  them  at  the  recommended  E2W  dosing  regimen. However, this is considered reflecting the restricted indication for treatment of patients who have failed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to respond to conventional urate-lowering therapy. Also data on re-exposure is limited. Additional data including long-term data will be generated through the post authorisation safety study in the EU, which is a condition to the marketing authorisation.

Infusion related reactions show a tendency to occur in a greater proportion of patients in the higher weight group of &gt;100kg since infusion reactions occurred in 53.7% for patients in the weight 70 to ≤100 kg weight group, and 70.0% of the patients in the &gt;100 to ≤120 weight group, and 75% of patients  in  the  &gt;120  kg  weight  group,  respectively.  Also  the  anti-pegloticase  antibody  titers  show higher levels of antibody in the higher weight groups. This information is reflected in the SmPC. The post-marketing authorisation study will enrich the data in this population.

Benefit-risk balance Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects Chronic gout is a debilitating disease, which may be associated with chronic pain or recurrent flares, joint deformities and/or joint destruction, disfiguring tophi, and renal impairment. Chronic gout results in  activity  limitations,  reduction in quality of life. If a patient fails to respond to conventional uratelowering therapy (xanthine oxidase inhibitors or uricosuric agents) or is unable to tolerate them, there is  no  alternative  option  currently  available.  Therefore,  there  is  clearly  an  unmet  medical  need  that pegloticase can address. Pegloticase  provides  a  very  potent  means  to  reduce  serum  uric  acid  to  undetectable  level,  which translates in very important clinical benefit to the patient. Three safety signals (infusion reactions/anaphylactic reactions, serious cardiac events, and gout flares) have been identified. The risk minimisation activities are considered adequate to manage these risks in this  specific  patient  population.  Additional  data  will  be  generated  particularly  through  a  postauthorisation safety study to be conducted in the EU, which is considered key to the benefit risk of the product. Benefit-risk balance The  benefit  risk  balance  for  Krystexxa  is  positive  for  a  very  restricted  group  of  severely  affected patients,  i.e.  adult  patients  with  severe  debilitating  chronic  tophaceous  gout  who  may  also  have erosive  joint  involvement  and  who  have  failed  to  normalize  serum  uric  acid  with  xanthine  oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom  these medicines are contraindicated. Discussion on the benefit-risk balance The  indication  describes  a  very  restricted  group  of  severely  affected  patients  with  tophaceous  gout which is the consequence of the chronic inability to eliminate urate as rapidly as it is produced. It is considered that for these patients the potential benefits of treatment with KRYSTEXXA outweigh the potential safety concerns, also considering the risk minimisation activities. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The ongoing (US) and planned (EU) observational studies will better characterise the long-term safety profile of the product, evaluate the effect of the recommended algorithm and, and evaluate the efficacy and safety with re-exposure to pegloticase after a treatment-free interval. Furthermore, to address the fact that during initial treatment with Krystexxa gout flare frequency is distinctly increased, likely due to  a  particularly  effective  reduction  of  SUA  levels,  a  dedicated  study  to  evaluate  a  dose  titration approach to potentially mitigate gout flares when initiating pegloticase treatment will be performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Preclinical  studies  are  ongoing  to  assess  the  impact  of  PEG  on  the  heart  and  further  data  will  be provided in a larger cohort of patients from the ongoing/planned observational studies to evaluate the cardiac risk with pegloticase. Additional data will be generated regarding the optimal dose in patients with over 100 kg BW.

The overall B/R of KRYSTEXXA is positive with the condition to perform the post-authorisation safety study in the EU as it is deemed key to the benefit risk.

4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Krystexxa  in  the  treatment  of  severe  debilitating  chronic tophaceous gout in adult patients who may also have erosive joint involvement and who have failed to normalize serum uric acid with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or  for  whom  these  medicines  are  contraindicated  (see  Section  4.4)  is  favourable  and  therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal  product  subject  to  medical  restricted  prescription  (See  Annex  I:  Summary  of  Product Characteristics, section 4.2).
