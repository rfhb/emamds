## Introduction

Efalizumab  is  a  recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  produced  in  genetically  engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. It is an IgG kappa immunoglobulin, containing human constant region sequences and murine light- and heavy-chain complementary determining region sequences. Raptiva is  a  selective  immunosuppressor  that  alters  T-lymphocyte  function  and  may  affect  host  defences against infections. Efalizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic  plaque  psoriasis  who  have  failed  to  respond  to,  or  who  have  a  contraindication  to,  or  are intolerant to other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate and PUVA.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Following  the  assessment  of  PSUR  5,  the  CHMP  requested  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder (MAH) to perform a comprehensive benefit-risk (B-R) re-assessment including a critical discussion of safety  and  efficacy  outcomes  of  cumulative  post-marketing  safety  information  and  of  all  Raptiva clinical trials completed after the original Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) procedure. With the submission of the benefit/risk re-evaluation, the MAH applied for an update of Section 4.4 'Special Warnings and Precautions for Use' of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) with a rewording  of  the  discontinuation  guidance  (based  on  integrated  assessment  of  studies  ACD2391g, HUPS300, 25180, 25300), Section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' with an update of information on overall incidence  of  adverse  events  (based  in  particular  on  studies  ACD2243g,  ACD2391g,  ACD2601g, 25161,25300,  24011  and  safety  analyses  based  on  the  overall  clinical  database)  and  Section  5.1 'Pharmacodynamic  Properties'  with  an  update  of  the  clinical  particulars  (based  on  integrated assessment of studies ACD2243g, ACD2391g, ACD2601g, 25300, 24011). Sections 2 and 3 of the Package Leaflet (PL) have been updated accordingly. Clinical aspects The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Raptiva  in  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  patients  have  been demonstrated in  five  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trials  (n=1742).  In  all  5  studies, patients  randomized  to  the  Raptiva  group  achieved  better  responses  than  placebo  on  the  primary endpoint which was statistically significant. During the original MAA procedure, interim reports of study 24011 and ACD2243g were submitted to the EMEA in December 2003 and April 2004. Final clinical study reports of these two studies have since  become  available  as  well  as  final  study  results  for  study  25300,  25161,  25030,  ACD2244g, ACD2391g and ACD2601g, ACD2782g and HUPS300. Additional safety data from studies for other indications were also included in the safety database. In the studies, the endpoint was expressed as the proportion of patients with ≥ 75% improvement in the Psoriasis  Area  and  Severity  Index  (PASI)  score  (relative  to  baseline)  and/or  proportion  of  subjects with predefined response on the physician global assessment (PGA).

## Clinical efficacy

The following studies are in support of the efficacy of Raptiva in the authorised indication:

Medicinal product no longer authorised Study 24011 was  a  Phase III  trial  whose  primary  efficacy  objective  was  to  compare  efalizumab 1 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) once a week for 12 weeks with placebo in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of efalizumab during  the  extended  treatment  and  re-treatment  periods.  In  the  double-blind  (DB)  treatment  period, patients were randomised 2:1 to receive efalizumab 1 mg/kg or matching placebo SC once a week for 12 weeks.  Patients  with  a  PASI 75  response  at  First  Treatment  (FT)  Week 12  then  entered  an Observation period of up to 24 weeks. At the end of the Observation period, or if relapse or clinical need for  re-treatment  was  noted  patients  entered  a  12-week  open  Re-treatment  (RT)  period,  during which they received efalizumab 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once a week. The median time to relapse (&gt; 50% loss of response) among PASI 75 responders at 12 weeks was 58 days  (n=164).  None  of  these  patients  experienced  a  worsening  of  disease  to  125%  of  baseline PASI. Re-treatment of week 12 responders who had relapsed led to PASI 75 and PASI 50 response rates of 47.6% and 77.9% respectively. Patients who did not reach a PASI 75 response (PASI 50-74 responders &amp; non-responders) entered a 12-week extended (ET) treatment period immediately after the  FT  period.  In  these  patients  approximately  50%  of  PASI 50-74  responders  achieved  a  PASI 75 response at 24 weeks, while &lt; 15% of FT period non-responders did so. Table 1: Study 24011:  PASI 75  Response  at  24 weeks  for  PASI 50-74  Responders and Non-Responders at Week 12 (FT on Efalizumab) In study 25300 , patients had the possibility to stop treatment after Week 12 and enter an Observation period  lasting  up  to  8 weeks.  A  total  of  135  Week 12  responders  entered  the  Observation  period. Consistent  with  the  data  from  study 24011,  median  time  to  relapse  was  56 days.  Among  the 113 patients  who  chose  to  be  retreated  with  efalizumab  after  the  Observation  period,  response  was similar to that observed during the FT period: mean (SD) PASI score at RT Week 12 was 7.03 (5.47) as compared to a RT baseline value of 19.27 (8.17). Study ACD2391g was  a  Phase III  trial  whose  primary  efficacy  objective  was  to  assess  the  rate  of response  at  24 weeks  in  patients  originally  randomised  to  receive  1.0 mg/kg/wk  SC  efalizumab  for 12 weeks  in  study ACD2390g.  PASI 75  response  at  24 weeks  was  determined  relative  to  Day 0  of study ACD2390g.  Of  the  117 patients  who  were  PASI 50-74  responders  at  Week 12,  58  (49.6%) became PASI 75 responders at Week 24. Approximately 19% of patients who were non-responders at Week 12 became PASI 75 responders at Week 24 (24 out of the 127 non-responders). In study 25300 , 853 of 1255 patients (68%) had PGA ratings of good or better at week 12 (95% CI: 65%  and  70.5%).  A  PASI  75  response  rate  of  36%  (451  patients)  was  observed  at  week  12.  All efficacy  results  were  consistent  with  the  primary  endpoint.  Of  note  the  response  rate  in  patients (n=232) who were refractory to all three  major  systemic  treatments  (i.e.  cyclosporin,  methotrexate, and PUVA) was 61% versus 69% in patient not refractory for any of these (p=0.03).

The MAH updated Section 5.1 of the SPC to reflect the data on time to relapse in the target population and other clinical particulars (see paragraph 3.3 Changes to the Product Information).

Clinical studies in special populations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study ACD3753g was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IV trial in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving the hands and/or feet, with or without pustules and with or without psoriasis at other sites. The study consisted of a 12-week treatment regimen of efalizumab 1.0 mg/kg/wk or placebo, followed by a 4-week observation period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a Physician's Global Assessment of Hand and/or Foot Psoriasis (PGA [hand/foot]) rating of 0, 1 or 2 ('Clear', 'Almost Clear' or 'Mild') at Week 12/Day 84. In the Intention  to  treat  (ITT)  population,  46.2%  of  patients  receiving  efalizumab  achieved  response compared  with  17.9%  of  patients  receiving  placebo  (24  of  52  and  5  of  28 patients  respectively; difference in proportions 28.3; p=0.015; 95%CI: 8.7, 47.9). It is noted that the PGA [hand/foot] is not a thoroughly validated endpoint.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Studies 25300 and 25161 provided supportive evidence for the efficacy of efalizumab in hand and foot psoriasis. These studies did not require patients to have any hand and/or foot involvement, but assessment of hand and/or foot psoriasis using the Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) was a tertiary endpoint. PPPASI was analysed in the subgroups of patients who had baseline scores above zero. Median percent improvement in PPPASI 69.4% (n=247) in study 25300 and 100% (m=19) in study 25161 respectively. The CHMP noted that no special claims with respect to efficacy in hand foot psoriasis is made. This was agreed and in principle this is already covered in the current indication referring to second line treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Clinical safety Sixteen new studies have become available since registration. The overall clinical safety database for efalizumab now includes more than 7000 patients (&gt;6000 receiving efalizumab and &gt;1400 receiving placebo), including more than 6500 patients with psoriasis, providing an exposure to efalizumab of approximately 2800 patient-years and an exposure to placebo of &gt;300 patient-years. Currently, the main safety information in the SPC comes from the 12-week placebo-controlled studies and the PSURs. The new studies provide relevant information in the following areas that should be reflected in the SPC: ·  Safety data on long-term treatment for up to 3 years (studies ACD2243g, ACD2391g, ACD2601g and 25161). · Safety data in the target population for up to 24 weeks of treatment (studies 24011 and 25300). The  MAH proposed  the  inclusion  of  the  long-term  data  to  some  of  the  safety  information  already present in Section 4.8, under 'Additional Information'. Concerning leucocytosis and lymphocytosis ,  the  expected  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  effect  already observed in the  short-term  studies  was  observed  in  study  ACD2243g.  The  MAH  proposed  that  the information regarding the PD effect that reaches a plateau and does not increase beyond the FT period should be reflected in the SPC In Section 4.8 under 'Additional Information '. The CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposal (See paragraph 3.3 Changes to the Product Information).

Concerning thrombocytopenia , a small and gradual decrease in mean platelet counts was seen over the 3 years of treatment in study ACD2243g. There appeared to be no clinical sequelae associated with this decrease, and mean platelet counts remained within the normal range throughout the study. The MAH agreed with the CHMP to update Section 4.8 to reflect these long term data.

Concerning hypersensitivity and allergic disorders ,  9 patients in study ACD2243g (2.6%) developed anti-efalizumab  antibodies  during  the  study.  Due  to  the  low  incidence  of  antibody  formation,  no correlation can be established between the presence of antibodies and AE rates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypersensitivity-related adverse events were uncommon, and the rate of such events decreased over time (9.8% or 33 of 338 patients for FT and less than 6.6% or 19 of 290 patients for the remaining 12week periods of the study). In study ACD2601g, hypersensitivity-related AEs were observed in 6.6%, 3.7%, 4.5% and 2.1% of patients in the successive 12-week periods (42 of 635, 21 of 567, 23 of 509 and 10 of 479 patients respectively), suggesting that there is no increase in such events over long-term treatment.

The MAH agreed with the CHMP to update Section 4.8 to reflect these long term data.

Medicinal product no longer authorised An  indirect  comparison  of  the  incidence  densities  in  the  long-term  studies  vs  the  12-week  studies showed  no  increase  in  risk  of  any  event  examined,  with  exception  of  non-melanoma  skin  cancer (NMSC). Standardised  incidence  ratio  did  not  show  evidence  of  an  increase  risk  of  cardiovascular events  or  overall  malignancies  with  efalizumab  compared  to  the  expected  incidences  in  a  general psoriasis population. There was however some increase in the incidence of NMSC and infections. The data of malignancies and infections have been included in Section 4.8 of the SPC (see paragraph 3.3 Changes to the Product Information). In March 2008 the CHMP requested the MAH to perform, a meta-analysis of clinical trial data related to malignancies. The  MAH discussed  that  they  have  performed  a  statistical  analysis  of  clinical  trial  data  related  to malignancies. The pooled analyses included data from a total of 29 clinical trials in which patients were treated with efalizumab  or  placebo:  the  studies  have  been  assigned  either  to  Cohort  A  (which  includes  studies involving  up  to  12  weeks  of  treatment)  or  to  Cohort  B  (which  includes  all  long-term  studies,  with exposure greater than 12 weeks and up to 3 years). A third cohort (Cohort C) has been created and includes  data  up  to  12  weeks  from  all  studies.  The  12-week  cut-off  for  this  third  cohort  has  been chosen to allow fair comparison to placebo, for which the maximum exposure is 12 weeks. As an external reference population, the moderate-to-severe psoriasis population from the UK-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD) was used. In total 95,069 psoriasis patients above the age of 20 years were identified, of which 4070 (4.28%) were classified as having severe psoriasis. This is the population considered as the reference population for these analyses. Table 2 below shows the Incidence per 100 patient years and the standardised incidence ratio. Signal work-up of malignancies shows that the data presented cannot exclude that there might be an increase over time driven by Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC), namely squamous cell carcinoma. The risk of developing lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disorders does not seem to increase over time.

Since  the  placing  of  the  market  of  Raptiva,  the  following  reactions  were  added  to  the  SPC:  septic meningitis, infections (including opportunistic infections as tuberculosis), immune related haemolytic anaemia,  antibodies  during  vaccinations,  interstitial  pneumonitis,  arthritis,  erythema  multiforme, inflammatory  polyradiculoneuropathy,  and  facial  palsy.  Other  possible  signals  are  tuberculosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, lymphomas and other malignancies, and liver disorders. However, data from long-term studies confirm the current safety profile of efalizumab.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Taking into account all the limitations of the meta-analysis and the available data indicating some risk of NMSC, malignancies will have to be monitored. The MAH committed to continue monitoring the safety of the product in order to better identify the incidence profile of rare events such as severe infections and lymphoproliferative disorders. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment The efficacy data provided with this variation has shown that the discontinuation of treatment may cause a recurrence or exacerbation of psoriasis especially in patients not responding to treatment and that  tapering the  dose  of  efalizumab is  not  effective  in  decreasing  the  incidence  of  psoriasis-related events. Section 4.4 of the SPC has been updated to reflect this information. Also, information about time to relapse after treatment discontinuation and effect of efalizumab re-treatment in patients with PASI  75  response  after  12  weeks  especially  provided  by  Study  IMP24011  has  shown  that approximately half of the patients (46.8%) who were partial responders (50% to 74% improvement on PASI, similar to PGA good) after 12 weeks of Raptiva treatment achieved a PASI 75 response at week 24. Additionally, long-term treatment data showed that half of the patients treated for more than 1 year were PASI 75 responders. Section 5.1 has been updated accordingly. Concerning  safety,  long  term  data  from  study  ACD2243g  in  relation  to  and  lymphocytosis  and thrombocytopenia confirmed that the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect already observed in the short-term studies.  Section  4.8  has  been  updated  to  reflect  that  the  PD  effect  reaches  a  plateau  and  does  not increase beyond the FT period. Concerning thrombocytopenia, a small and gradual decrease in mean platelet counts was seen over the 3 years of treatment in study ACD2243g within the normal range was observed. Also, over long term treatment,  the  frequency  of  hypersensitivity-related  adverse  events  did  not  increase.  These  findings have been included in Section 4.8.

The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  benefit-risk  of  Raptiva  remains  positive  for  the  population  in  the approved indication.

## Changes to the Product Information

## Summary of Product Characteristics

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised New text is marked as underlined; deleted text is marked as strikethrough Section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' Psoriasis During treatment with Raptiva, cases of exacerbation of psoriasis, including pustular, erythrodermic, and  guttate  subtypes,  have  been  observed  (see  section  4.8).  In  such  cases,  it  is  recommended  to discontinue treatment with Raptiva. Abrupt  dDiscontinuation  of  treatment  may  cause  a  recurrence  or  exacerbation  of  plaque  psoriasis including  erythrodermic  and  pustular  psoriasis,  especially  in  patients  not  responding  to  treatment. Gradual reduction of dose or frequency does not appear to be beneficial. Discontinuation Management of patients discontinuing  Raptiva  includes  close  observation.  In  case  of  recurrence  or exacerbation of disease, as well as in patients who discontinue Raptiva and are non-responders, the treating  physician should institute the most appropriate psoriasis treatment as necessary. In case retreatment  with  Raptiva  is  indicated  the  same  guidance  should  be  followed  as  under  Posology  and method  of  administration.  Re-treatment  may  be  associated  with  lower  or  inadequate  response  to Raptiva than in the earlier treatment periods. Therapy may be continued only in those patients who respond adequately to treatment. The CHMP considered these changes to be acceptable since they provide specific new information. Section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' The MAH proposed the following update of Section 4.8: Additional Information Long-term exposure: Analysis following long-term use in a cohort of 158339 patients (study ACD 2243g) with moderate to severe  psoriasis  receiving  Raptiva  1  mg/kg/week  for  108  weeks  ,  of  which  166  patients  have  been treated for more than 2 years and up to 3 years, did not show any noteworthy differences in frequency of adverse events as compared to 12 weeks of exposure to Raptiva. Safety data beyond 12 weeks in the target population are not yet available. The safety profile of Raptiva remains acceptable over long term, up to 3 years. Most events were mild to moderate, with no apparent increase over time in the incidence of serious events and events leading to discontinuation. Long-term use of Raptiva did not reveal any common unexpected AE. Pooled safety analysis: The incidence of serious infections and malignancies in the Raptiva clinical trial database of 29 studies was evaluated up to 12 weeks in comparison to placebo and over long term treatment in 15 of these 29 studies of &gt; 12 weeks and up to 144 weeks duration (Table1).

Thrombocytopenia: in the combined safety database of 3291 Raptiva-treated patients at the time of approval, there were nine occurrences (0.3%) of thrombocytopenia with less than 52,000 cells per μ l reported.  Four  of  these  patients  had  clinical  signs  of  thrombocytopenia.  Based  on  available  platelet count measurements, the onset of platelet decline was between 8 and 12 weeks after the first dose of Raptiva  in  5  patients,  but  occurred  later  in  the  other  patients.  In  one  patient,  thrombocytopenia occurred 3 weeks after treatment discontinuation. The platelet count nadirs occurred between 12 and 72 weeks after the first dose of Raptiva. Over long term treatment up to 3 years, a small and gradual decrease in mean platelet counts within the normal range was observed. In the same population two cases of severe thrombocytopenia (0.6%) of rapid onset were observed (See section 4.4).

Medicinal product no longer authorised * pooled analysis of 29 studies ** pooled analysis of 15 studies The  CHMP  considered  the  proposed  addition  of  the  text  ' The  safety  profile  of  Raptiva  remains acceptable  over  long  term,  up  to  3  years.  Most  events  were  mild  to  moderate,  with  no  apparent increase over time in the incidence of serious events and events leading to discontinuation. Long-term use  of  Raptiva  did  not  reveal  any  common  unexpected  AE '  to  be  not  acceptable  since  it  can  be regarded to be a commercial claim. In addition, the CHMP was of the opinion that the information presented in the table is relevant for this section, but should be described in words (e.g. the incidence of malignancies appear to increase with treatment duration). The MAH agreed with the CHMP to revise the text as follows: Additional Information Long-term exposure: Analysis following long-term use in a cohort of 158 339 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving Raptiva 1 mg/kg/week for 108 weeks, of which 166 patients have been treated for more than 2 years and up to 3 years, did not show any noteworthy differences in frequency of adverse events as compared to 12 weeks of exposure to Raptiva. Safety data beyond 12 weeks in the target population are not yet available. The  MAH  also  agreed  with  the  CHMP  to  amend  Section  4.8  with  the  inclusion  of  data  on thrombocytopenia as follows: ' Leucocytosis  and  lymphocytosis:  in  large  placebo-controlled  and  in  long-term  clinical  studies, between  40  and  50%  of  patients  developed  sustained  asymptomatic  lymphocytosis  during  Raptiva therapy.  All  values  were  between  2.5  fold  and  3.5  fold  the  ULN  (Upper  Limit  of  Normal). Lymphocyte  count  returned  to  baseline  after  therapy  discontinuation.  Slight  elevation  in  absolute neutrophil count and eosinophil count were observed but in a smaller proportion of patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypersensitivity and allergic disorders: in large placebo-controlled clinical studies, the percentage of patients  experiencing  an  adverse  event  suggestive  of  hypersensitivity,  including  urticaria,  rash  and allergic reactions was slightly higher in the Raptiva group (8%) than in the placebo group (7%). (See section 4.4). Over long term, hypersensitivity-related adverse events did not increase.

Infections: other therapies that alter T-lymphocyte function have been associated with increased risk of developing serious infections. In placebo controlled clinical trials, infection rates in Raptiva-treated patients was approximately 27.3% versus 24.0% in placebo-treated patients. In the target population studied  in  study  IMP24011,  the  infection  rate  in  Raptiva-treated  patients  was  approximately  25.7% versus 22.3% in placebo-treated patients.

Medicinal product no longer authorised As regards serious infections In both controlled and uncontrolled studies, the overall incidence in both controlled and uncontrolled studies of up to 12 weeks of hospitalisations for infections was 1.6 2.8 per 100 patient-years for Raptiva-treated patients compared with 1.2 1.4 per 100 patient-years for placebotreated  patients.  The  most  frequent  serious  infections  were  pneumonia,  cellulitis,  infections  not otherwise specified and sepsis. Over long term treatment, the incidence of serious infection was 1.8 per 100 patient years. (See section 4.4). Class adverse reactions Neoplasms benign and malignant: a higher rate of malignancies has been associated with therapies affecting the immune  system.  In  placebo  controlled  clinical trials, the overall incidences of malignancy (the majority of which were non-melanoma skin cancers) were similar in Raptiva-treated patients  and  in  placebo-treated  patients.  In  addition,  the  incidences  of  specific  tumours  in  Raptiva patients were in line with those observed in control psoriasis populations. Among psoriasis patients who received Raptiva at any dose, the overall incidence of malignancies of any kind was 1.7 per 100 patient-years for Raptiva-treated patients compared with 1.6 per 100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients. Experience with Raptiva has not shown evidence of risk of developing malignancy exceeding that expected in the psoriasis population. There was no evidence of an increased risk of any particular malignancy over time with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer (0.3 vs. 0.9 per 100 patient-years, short term and long term treatment, respectively) (See section 4.4). The CHMP found this change acceptable however the MAH was recommended to revise the SPC in accordance  with  the  current  SPC  guideline  at  the  next  renewal  in  order  to  make  the  additional information  more  easily  accessible  to  the  prescribing  physicians  (i.e.  reactions  reported  are  not included in the adverse reactions table).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH proposed to summarise the long term efficacy data in Section 5.1 as follows:

## 'Clinical efficacy

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Study ACD2243g, an open label uncontrolled study, provided data on the continuous treatment with Raptiva up to 3 years. After an initial 12 week treatment period, only patients achieving at least PASI 50 and an OLS of at least mild were allowed to continue treatment (n=290; 86%). In the Intent-toTreat analysis (n=339), the PASI 75 response rate was 41% at Week 12 and was maintained during the study with a 46% response rate at Week 144 (Table 5). Additionally, a PASI 90 response rate was observed in approximately 30% of patients at 3 years.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The efficacy of Raptiva versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis has  not  been  evaluated  in  studies  directly  comparing  Raptiva  with  other  systemic  therapies.  The present  results  of  Raptiva  versus  placebo  in  these  patients  over  12  weeks  of  treatment  indicate  a modest efficacy of response to Raptiva (in terms of PASI 75 response rate) in 22% to 39% of patients (see Table 23). Long term open label, uncontrolled studies indicate efficacy of Raptiva (in terms of PASI 75 response rate) in 35% to 50% of patients (Table 5). Based on the clinical development data generated (see Table 12) and limited long-term experience (Table 5), Raptiva is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1.' [….] Long term data up to 108 weeks have been obtained in an uncontrolled study in 158 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (ACD2243g) (See Table 3 above). About 72% of the patients (122 of 170) in the cohort were PASI 75 responders. When all the drop outs of the maintenance cohort were considered as non responders, the PASI 75 responder rate was 42% (122 of 290 patients). Long-term treatment: Data from extended treatment (more than 12 weeks) have been obtained from 4311 patients in open label  uncontrolled  studies.  Over  600  patients  have  been  treated  for  more  than  1  year  (studies ACD2391g, ACD2601g and ACD2243g ) including 166 patients treated for more than 2 years and up to 3 years (Table 4). Study ACD2391g was an open-label extension of the placebo controlled trial ACD2390g. A PASI 75 response rate of 44% was observed at 24 weeks of continuous Raptiva treatment (Table 5). Study ACD2601g was the open label extension of the placebo controlled trial ACD2600g. PASI 75 response rate was 41% at Week 60 (Table 5).

Medicinal product no longer authorised The CHMP considered the proposed text to be unacceptable since the figures are already presented in the table 1 and 2 of Section 5.1. Additionally, the figures presented in the text above are a range of responder rates over the short term studies which do not reflect the different populations and different study design. Therefore, the MAH was requested to present an estimate of PASI75 responders that summarise  all  studies.  Also  the  efficacy  results  based  on  open  label  long  tem  studies  are  biased because only those who benefit continue. Overall,  the  CHMP  agreed  on  the  relevance  of  the  presented  long  term  study  data  however recommended that Section 5.1 should be concise in terms of information to the treating doctors and agreed with the MAH to include the following text: 'Clinical efficacy The efficacy of Raptiva versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis has  not  been  evaluated  in  studies  directly  comparing  Raptiva  with  other  systemic  therapies.  The present results of Raptiva versus placebo in these patients over 12 weeks of treatment with different populations indicate a modest efficacy of PASI 75 response to Raptiva in 22% to 39% of patients (see Table 2). Based  on  the  clinical  development  data  generated  (see  Table  1)  and  limited  long-term  experience, Raptiva is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1.' 'Long-term treatment: Data from extended treatment (more than 12 weeks) have been obtained from 4311 patients in open label  uncontrolled  studies.  Over  600  patients  have  been  treated  for  more  than  1  year  including  166 patients treated for more than 2 years and up to 3 years. Approximately half of the patients treated for more than 1 year were PASI 75 responders (when all dropouts were considered as non-responders).' The MAH also proposed the following changes:

'Time to relapse ( ≥ 50% loss of improvement) was evaluated in Study ACD2058g and IMP 24011 for patients who were classified as responders ( ≥ 75% improvement on PASI) after 12 weeks of treatment. The median time to relapse among PASI responders ranged from 5958 to 74 days following the last Raptiva dose in the initial treatment period.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study IMP24011, approximately half of the patients (46.8%) who were partial responders (50% to 74% improvement on PASI, similar to PGA good) after 12 weeks of Raptiva treatment achieved a PASI 75 response at week 24.'

The CHMP considered the proposed changes to be acceptable.

## Patient Leaflet

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  MAH  has  revised  the  PL  in  line  with  the  SPC.  The  word  'abruptly'  has  been  removed  from sections 2 and 3. Take special care with Raptiva: […] - If you discontinue Raptiva treatment abruptly (and this applies especially to patients not responding to  treatment)  your  psoriasis  may  significantly  worsen.  Your  doctor  may  wish  to  monitor  you  and provide effective treatment. If you stop using Raptiva: If you discontinue treatment with Raptiva abruptly without substitution treatment, your psoriasis may significantly worsen. (See 'Take special care with Raptiva') In  addition,  the  MAH  took  the  opportunity  to  update  the  whole  list  of  Local  Representatives  in section 6. Conclusion On 24 April 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
