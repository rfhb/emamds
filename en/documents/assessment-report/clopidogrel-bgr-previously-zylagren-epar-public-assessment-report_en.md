## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## .1 Introduction 2

ylagren 75mg  film-coated tablets are generic medicinal products containing clopidogrel as Z clopidogrel hydrogensulphate as active substance. The reference medicinal product is Plavix 75 mg film-coated tablets, which contains clopidogrel hydrogensulphate.

lopidogrel is a non-competitive inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at the platelet receptors. C The  effect  of  ADP  on  platelets  is  mediated  by  two  G-protein  coupled  P2Y  receptors  (P2Y1  and P2Y12) and the cation channel-coupled P2X1 receptor. The adenylate cyclase-coupled ADP receptor P2Y12 is the main target of clopidogrel and lead to inhibition of platelet activation, aggregation, and Gp  IIb/IIIa  receptor  activation.  Clopidogrel  is  a  thienopyridine  and  only  the S -enantiomer  is pharmacologically active.

he safety and efficacy profile of clopidogrel has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details T of  which  can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  for  Plavix.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing experience  contributing  to  the  knowledge  of  the  clinical  use  of  this  product.  Zylagren  75mg  filmcoated  tablet  contains  clopidogrel  hydrogesulphate.  Since  this  application  is  a  generic  application referring  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  Plavix,  summary  of  the  clinical  data  of  clopidogrel hydrogensulphate is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted with clopidogrel hydrogensulphate.

he  indication  for  Zylagren  is  different  from  the  reference  medicinal  product.  It  is  part  of  the T indication approved for the reference medicinal product.

ients  used  in  the  core  tablet  include  anhydrous  lactose,  microcrystalline  cellulose, Other  ingred pregelatinised starch, polyethyleneglycol 6000 and hydrogenated castor oil. The film coating consists of hypromellose 6cp, titanium dioxide, talc, red iron oxide and propylene glycol.

The tablets are packed in OPA/AL/PVC - Alu blisters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Active Substance

he chemical name of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate is (+)-(S)-Methyl α -( o -chlorophenyl)-6,7T dihydrothieno[3,2-c] pyridine-5(4 H )-acetate hydrogen sulphate.

ly insoluble in water at neutral pH, el ion It is a white to off-white or yellowish crystalline powder practical freely soluble in water at pH 1 and in some organic solvents like methanol. The chemical structure of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate has been confirmed with nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR,  13 CNMR), mass spectrometry (MS), infrared spectrometry (IR) and elemental microanalysis. Clopidogr hydrogen sulphate exists in two polymorphic forms, form I and II. The proposed manufacturing process produces consistently the form I and this has been confirmed with X-Ray powder diffract and FT-IR spectra. The molecule includes a chiral atom of carbon and therefore exhibits diasteromerism. The active substance is the S-, (+)- diastereomer.

## Manufacture ·

en  sulphate  is  synthesised  by  three  alternative  routes  from  four  key  starting Clopidogrel  hydrog materials. The manufacturing process consists of three stages: the synthesis of clopidogrel free base (stage  1),  purification  of  clopidogrel  (stage  2)  and  crystallisation  of  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate (stage 3). The active substance is manufactured in three manufacturing sites.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  immediate-release  tablets  containing qualitatively and quantitatively the same active substance and exhibiting the same bioavailability as the already marketed reference product PLAVIX 75 mg film-coated tablets in order to comply with the regulations pertaining to abridged applications in the European Union.

Zylagren  does  not  have  exactly  the  same  qualitative  composition  with  the  reference  product  with regards to excipients. In Zylagren lactose is used as filler and pregelatinised starch as binder compared to  mannitol  and  hypromellose  used  in  Plavix  respectively  However,  the  chosen  excipients  raise  no concerns  since  they  are  well-established  and  commonly  used  in  the  manufacture  of  solid  dosage forms. All excipients used in the product are of non-animal  origin and  comply  with  their corresponding European Pharmacopoeia monographs.

As clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate is unstable in the presence of excessive amounts of water direct compression was chosen for manufacturing the Zylagren tablets.  In order to cover the unpleasant taste of the active ingredient the tablets are film-coated.

The  immediate  packaging  material  consists  of  OPA-Alu-PVC  blisters  and  has  been  demonstrated through stability studies to provide a good protection from water.

Three batches of CLOPIDOGREL hydrogen sulphate 75mg, film-coated tablets have been compared to two batches of the reference PLAVIX.Related substances and enantiomeric purity results show that both products are comparable in terms of impurity profile

A discriminatory dissolution test has been developed for routine testing of the clopidogrel tablets. An acidic  dissolution  medium  has  been  chosen  (0.1  M  HCl),  because  the  solubility  of  clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate decreases as the pH values increase and the requirements for sink conditions are met only at acidic conditions (900 ml of 0.1M HCl). The influence of the particle size of the active substance (from mean 11 µm to 97 µm) on the dissolution profile has been tested and it was found that the dissolution profile is not significantly different whatever the mean particle size is within the range that is set in the active substance specifications.

Comparative dissolution profiles between the reference product and Zylagren were performed in three different dissolution media (0.1 M Hydrochloric acid, Acetate buffer solution pH 4.5 and Phosphate buffer solution pH 6.8). The results show that Zylagren expresses similar dissolution profiles in all three  dissolution  media  and  that  the  dissolution  profiles  are  comparable  with  that  of  the  reference product.

The bioequivalence study was performed using as reference the biobatch No. 600711 of Plavix 75 mg tablets  manufactured  by  Sanofi-Synthelabo  Limited,  UK  (expired  date  02/2009)  has  been  used  in bioequivalence study. The biobatch No. P11092 of Clopidogrel 75 mg tablets (hydrogen sulphate salt) manufactured by Krka, Novo Mestro, d.d., Slovenia in 11/2007 has been used as the tested product in the bioequivalence study.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  direct  compression  process  and  consists  of  the  following steps: screening, mixing, compression to tablets and film-coating.

All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. The validation report from 3 production scale batches demonstrates that the process is reproducible and provides a drug product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications.

## · Product Specification

The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for  appearance, uniformity  of  dosage  units,  identification  (HPLC,  TLC),  assay  (HPLC),  identification  of  titanium dioxide and iron oxides, related substances, microbiological quality, enantiomeric purity, dissolution, hardness, , disintegration and water content.

All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated.

Batch analysis data from 3 production scale and 6 supportive batches have been presented. All batches met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability of the Product

Stability  studies  were  carried  out  on  3  production  scale  batches  of  tablets  according  to  the  ICH requirements.  Samples  were  packaged  in  the  same  immediate  packaging  as  the  one  intended  for marketing. were stored at 25 o C/60 % RH for 24 months and in 40 o C/75 % RH for 6 months. The parameters tested were appearance, assay, water content, hardness, related substances, enantiomeric purity, dissolution, and microbiological tests. The analytical procedures used were the same as those used for routine testing and have been shown to be stability indicating. In addition photostability tests have been performed in accordance with ICH guideline Q 1 B. In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects.

The quality of Zylagren is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  in these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  packaging  material  is commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard process  that  has  been  adequately  described.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.

In comparison with the EU reference product Zylagren has been shown to have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of the active substance. The excipients used are mostly the same with some minor modifications. Both the EU reference product (Plavix) and Zylagren exhibit similar dissolution profiles.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

Clopidogrel  is  widely  used  well-known  substance.  Its  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and toxicological properties are well characterised and new non clinical studies were not provided. This generic application contains the same salt of the active substance as the reference medicinal product. A summary  of  the  literature  with  regard  to  non-clinical  data  of  clopidogrel  hydrogensulphate  were provided. Further studies are not required, because the active substance used in reference product and the  generic  product  are  the  same  and  the  overview  based  on  the  literature  is,  thus,  appropriate. Although  the in  vitro studies  did  not  reveal  any  mutagenic,  genotoxic  or  clastogenic  potential  of clopidogrel, the CHMP raised a major objection with respect to the studies on impurities, which did do not  follow  recommendations  of  the  OECD  guideline,  protocol  471  ( OECD,  1997,  Test  Guideline 47:Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test. In: OECD  Guideline  for Testing of Chemicals. Paris, Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  &amp;  Development )  and  of  the Question  &amp;  Answers  on  the CHMP  guideline  on  the  limits  of  genotoxic  impurities (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/431994/2007).    In response, adequately conducted reverse mutation assays in accordance with GLP standards and OECD guideline protocol number 471 was provided. The results of the Ames test performed with potassium ethyl  sulphate  and  clopidogrel  isopropyl  sulphate indicated  that  these two substances do not hold a mutagenic potential. Thus, the content limit for monoalkylsulphates as proposed by the applicant is acceptable to the CHMP.

Introduction  of  the  product  onto  the  market  is  unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  increase  in  the combined sales volumes for all clopidorel hydrogensulphate products, and would thus not be expected to have an adverse effect upon the environment. With this regard and on the basis of CHMP Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CPMP/SWP/4447/00), a formal environmental risk assessment is not considered necessary.

## ANALYTICAL METHODS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The plasma samples were assayed for clopidogrel and its carboxylic acid metabolite using LC/MS/MS method using the calibration range from 5.04 pg/mL - 5040 pg/mL (clopidogrel) and 4.02 ng/mL 4016 ng/mL (clopidogrel carboxylic acid). The analytical technique was validated. A partial validation was  conducted  successfully  in  order  to  allow  this  transfer.  However,  there  were  insufficient  data submitted with respect to the pre-study validation and validation of the bio-analytical technique used for determination of clopidogrel, and the CHMP questioned the validity of the bioequivalence study. Thus, a GCP inspection was requested.

## PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES

The main investigated pharmacokinetics parameters for clopidogrel and clopidogrel carboxylic acid were AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.

## STATISTICAL METHODS

Parametric ANOVA analysis on ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax was carried out for analytes, clopidogrel  and  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid.  The  statistical  model  included  sequence,  period  and treatment factors as fixed effects and subject within sequence as random effect. A non parametric test was carried out to compare Tmax.

## *log-transformed values

The following acceptance criteria were set as per clinical study report:

- -The 90% confidence interval for the exponential of the difference between the test and the reference product for the ln-transformed parameters AUC0-t and AUCinf should be within 80125% .
- -The 90% confidence interval for the exponential of the difference between the test and the reference product for the ln-transformed parameter Cmax should be within 75-133%.

The proposed 90% confidence intervals for AUCt and AUCinf are in line with the recommendation of the CHMP guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 and the observed results of the clinical study fulfil  this  requirement. However, the widening of the limits for bioequivalence conclusions for Cmax values, although not in line with the current CHMP recommendations, was not considered necessary since  the  C max results  of  the  study  are  within  the  standard  80-125%  limits  required  by  the  NƒG  on Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98.  No  significant difference in Tmax was evidenced by the non parametric test.

No serious adverse events (SEAs) were reported during this study. Overall, clopidogrel demonstrated a good safety profile. The risk of bleeding is the most important adverse effect of clopidogrel, which might be even increased when clopidogrel is concomitantly used with ASA.  No significant changes in the subjects' state of health were observed and it is believed that Zylagren 75 mg film coated tablet is safe when used according to the SmPC.

From  the  96  subjects  included  in  the  study,  four  were  withdrawn  for  personal  reasons  or  noncompliance. 92 subjects finished the study and 91 subjects were included in the data set for statistical analysis, since one subject was excluded from the statistical analysis because clopidogrel carboxylic acid  was  detected  pre-dose  in  period  one  of  the  trial.  All  withdrawn  and  discontinued  subjects  are documented and validity is justified.

-  Conclusions

Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  08-210,  Zylagren  is  considered  bioequivalent  with Plavix.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

One clinical bioequivalence trial (08-210) was provided for Zylagren (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate). At the time of approval of the reference product Plavix (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate), there was no reliable  and  validated  methodology  for  the  determination  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  parent prodrug clopidogrel, or of the active metabolite clopidogrel thiol. Thus, the pharmacokinetic profile was established based on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel carboxylic acid, which is the major nonactive metabolite.  In the meantime, a reliable bio-analytical method for determination of clopidogrel in plasma and urine has been developed. Since the pharmacokinetic profile of the active metabolite is still  not  well  established,  the  CHMP accepted the proof of bioequivalence based on the clopidogrel parent  compound  data.  Thus,  data  related  to  pharmacokinetics  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  are considered supportive, whereas data on clopidogrel parent drug is important for the confirmation of bioequivalence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The indication of Zylagren is different from that of the reference medicinal product, Plavix (please see section 2.1). Thus, the Product Information has been adequately amended to reflect this change and this is considered acceptable.

Furthermore, the recently published literature data indicate that the bioavailability of a single oral dose of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might be  increased  by  several  folds  in  the  fed  condition  compared  to  the  fasted  condition.  The  currently presented clinical studies were conducted in fasted state and thus, the CHMP requested a clarification of  this  approach  and  adequate  justification  why  bioequivalence  for  the  generic  product  should  be demonstrated only under fasting condition was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions are  normally  recommended  as  mentioned  in  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence  Guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  document  as  this  situation  would  be more sensitive to differences in pharmacokinetics. In addition the dissolution studies using clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate conducted at three different pH values (1.2, 4.5, 6.8) and mimicking the conditions of a fed state did not reveal any major differences when compared to the reference product.

The  bio-analytical  technique  and  methodology  applied  in  the  analysis  of  the  samples  during  the bioequivalence  studies  included  validation  with  the  analysis  of  calibration  curves  and  controls  at various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion of the quantitatively  major metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid to the parent drug. Considering that the plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent drug, a minimum back-conversion of the metabolite would lead to a significant over-estimation of clopidogrel plasma levels and would bias the outcome of the bioequivalence study. The back-conversion could occur in the presence of alcohol used in sample preparation and analysis. It was, indeed, reported that a possible back-conversion of clopidogrel metabolite to clopidogrel parent drug was evidenced in the presence  of  methanol.  In  order  to  avoid  this  process,  the  extraction  procedure  was  changed  and methanol-free conditions employed. Although it has been indicated that stability tests were performed in  order  to  prove  the  reproducibility  and  accuracy  of  clopidogrel  concentration  measurements,  the CHMP  questioned  these  results  since  no  clear  description  of  the  analytical  technique  including extraction procedure actually used in the initial pre-study validation process was  provided. Information on the validation procedures in study 08-210 was requested by the CHMP. In response, details of the bio-analytical methodology and full validation details were provided demonstrating that no methanol, which is needed for the conversion the acid metabolite to clopidogrel, was used and thus, no  source  of  methylation  exists  within  the  entire  methodology,  including  all  solution  preparation, plasma sample processing,  handling  storage  and  LC-MS/MS determination. The CHMP considered this issue resolved.

Considering the above difficulties in the determination of clopidogrel in plasma especially the issue related  to  the  possible  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite  to  the  parent  drug,  a  triggered  GCP inspection of the bioequivalence study was requested by the CHMP, which was of the opinion that results  of  this  inspection  and  the  satisfactory  responses  to  its  findings  were  an  integral  part  of  the evaluation procedure. The inspection identified major and minor findings that seem not to affect the overall results of the trial.

The  bioequivalence  study  08-210  and  its  statistical  evaluation  were  in  accordance  with  accepted standards  for  bioequivalence  testing,  as  stated  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  The  parameters  used  to  establish bioavailability included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma concentration  of  the  parent  compound  of  clopidogrel.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  these parameters  were  within  the  recommended  80-125%  range  for  clopidogrel,  required  by  the  above mentioned guideline. The proposed widening of the 90% confidence interval for clopidogrel Cmax to 75%-133% was found to be unacceptable by the CHMP; nevertheless, since the confidence intervals for Cmax values of clopidogrel were within the required 80-125% range, the need for widening of the intervals was not applicable. The bioequivalence with Plavix was proven.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

##  PSUR

The  PSUR  submission  schedule  for  Zylagren  should  follow  PSURs  submission  schedule  for  the reference medicinal product.

##  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system (DescPhSys 000001/16 (09 January 2009) as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.

##  Risk Management Plan

Risk Management Plan has not been submitted. Since the application concerns generics of respective reference  medicinal  products  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk  minimization activities have been identified, this considered acceptable.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application contains adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

'Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  by  consensus  the benefit/risk ratio of Zylagren in the treatment of:

'Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in:

- -Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease.'

was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
