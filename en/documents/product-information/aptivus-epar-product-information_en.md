Excipients with known effect: Each soft capsule contains 100.0 mg ethanol, 455.0 mg macrogolglycerol ricinoleate and 12.6 mg sorbitol

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Soft capsule.

Pink, oblong soft gelatin capsules imprinted with 'TPV 250' in black.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated for combination antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1 infection in highly pre-treated adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older who have a Body Surface Area (BSA) of ≥1.3 m 2 or weight ≥36 kg and with virus resistant to multiple protease inhibitors. Aptivus should only be used as part of an active combination antiretroviral regimen in patients with no other therapeutic options.

In deciding to initiate treatment with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history should guide the use of Aptivus. Initiation of treatment should take into account the combinations of mutations which may negatively impact the virological response to Aptivus, coadministered with low dose ritonavir (see section 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Aptivus must always be given with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product Characteristics of ritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with Aptivus (especially as regards the contraindications, warnings and undesirable effects sections).

Aptivus should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

## Posology

Adults and adolescents (from 12 - 18 years of age who have a BSA of ≥1.3 m 2 or weight ≥36 kg) The recommended dose of Aptivus is 500 mg, co-administered with 200 mg ritonavir (low dose ritonavir), twice daily (see section 4.4 for precautionary measures in adolescents).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Body surface area (BSA) can be calculated as follows:

Doses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy profile of the combination.

Since currently only limited efficacy and safety data are available for adolescents (see section 5.1) close monitoring of virologic response and tolerance is particularly warranted in this patient group.

## Missed dose

Patients should be advised of the need to take Aptivus and ritonavir every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed by more than 5 hours, the patient should be instructed to wait and then to take the next dose of Aptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. If a dose is missed by less than 5 hours, the patient should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately, and then to take the next dose of Aptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time.

## Elderly

Clinical studies of Aptivus did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects (see section 5.2). In general, caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of Aptivus in older people reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other therapy (see section 4.4).

## Liver impairment

Tipranavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. Liver impairment could therefore result in an increase of tipranavir exposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, Aptivus should be used with caution, and with increased monitoring frequency, in patients with mild hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class A). Aptivus is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Aptivus capsules in children aged 2 to 12 years has not been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

Also, appropriate dose adjustments for children under 12 years cannot be achieved with Aptivus capsules.

Aptivus capsules should not be used in paediatric patients less than 12 years of age as there are no clinical data supporting the use of capsules in this paediatric subset.

## Method of administration

Oral use.

Aptivus soft capsules co-administered with low dose ritonavir should be taken with food (see section 5.2).

Aptivus soft capsules must be swallowed whole and must not be opened or chewed.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Combination of rifampicin with Aptivus with concomitant low dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.5).

Herbal preparations containing St John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of tipranavir (see section 4.5).

Co-administration of Aptivus with low dose ritonavir, with active substances that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events. These active substances include antiarrhythmics (such as amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine), antihistamines (such as astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (such as dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (such as cisapride), antipsychotics (such as pimozide, sertindole, quetiapine, lurasidone), sedatives/hypnotics (such as orally administered midazolam and triazolam) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as simvastatin and lovastatin) (see section 4.5). Also the use of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist alfuzosin, and sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, co-administration of Aptivus with low dose ritonavir, and medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol given in heart failure (see section 4.5).

Co-administration of colchicine with Aptivus/ritonavir in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Aptivus must be administered with low dose ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect (see section 4.2). Failure to correctly co-administer tipranavir with ritonavir will result in reduced plasma levels of tipranavir that may be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Patients should be instructed accordingly.

Aptivus is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Patients receiving Aptivus or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV-1 infection.

## Liver disease

Aptivus is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C) hepatic insufficiency. Limited data are currently available for the use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reaction. Aptivus should be used in this patient population only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk, and with increased clinical and laboratory monitoring. In the case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products.

Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) should be closely monitored.

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. Aptivus with ritonavir should be discontinued once signs of worsening liver function occur in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, has been associated with reports of clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV disease taking multiple concomitant medicinal products. Caution should be exercised when administering Aptivus to patients with liver enzyme abnormalities or with a history of hepatitis. Increased ALAT/ASAT monitoring should be considered in these patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Aptivus therapy should not be initiated in patients with pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT greater than 5 times the Upper Limit Normal (ULN) until baseline ASAT/ALAT is stabilised at less than 5X ULN, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.

Aptivus therapy should be discontinued in patients experiencing ASAT or ALAT elevations greater than 10X ULN, or developing signs or symptoms of clinical hepatitis during therapy. If another cause is identified (eg acute hepatitis A, B or C virus, gallbladder disease, other medicinal products), then rechallenge with Aptivus may be considered when ASAT/ALAT have returned to the patient's baseline levels.

## Liver monitoring

Monitoring of hepatic tests should be done prior to initiation of therapy, after two, four and then every four weeks until 24 weeks, and then every eight to twelve weeks thereafter. Increased monitoring (i.e. prior to initiation of therapy, every two weeks during the first three months of treatment, then monthly until 48 weeks, and then every eight to twelve weeks thereafter) is warranted when Aptivus and low dose ritonavir are administered to patients with elevated ASAT and ALAT levels, mild hepatic impairment, chronic hepatitis B or C, or other underlying liver disease.

## Treatment-naïve patients

In  a  study  performed  in  antiretroviral naïve  adult  patients,  tipranavir  500 mg  with ritonavir  200 mg twice  daily,  as  compared  to  lopinavir/ritonavir,  was  associated  with  an  excess  in  the  occurrence  of significant (grade 3 and 4) transaminase elevations without any advantage in terms of efficacy (trend towards a lower efficacy). The study was prematurely stopped after 60 weeks.

Therefore, tipranavir with ritonavir should not be used in treatment-naïve patients (see section 4.2).

## Renal impairment

Since the renal clearance of tipranavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are not expected in patients with renal impairment.

## Haemophilia

There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and haemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional Factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action had not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.

## Bleeding

RESIST participants receiving Aptivus with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at 24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to 1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between treatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further monitored.

Fatal and non-fatal intracranial haemorrhages (ICH) have been reported in patients receiving Aptivus, many of whom had other medical conditions or were receiving concomitant medicinal products that may have caused or contributed to these events. However, in some cases the role of Aptivus cannot be excluded. No pattern of abnormal haematological or coagulation parameters has been observed in patients in general, or preceding the development of ICH. Therefore, routine measurement of coagulation parameters is not currently indicated in the management of patients on Aptivus.

An increased risk of ICH has previously been observed in patients with advanced HIV disease/AIDS such as those treated in the Aptivus clinical trials.

In in vitro experiments, tipranavir was observed to inhibit human platelet aggregation at levels consistent with exposures observed in patients receiving Aptivus with ritonavir.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In rats, co-administration with vitamin E increased the bleeding effects of tipranavir (see section 5.3).

Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other medical conditions, or who are receiving medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants or who are taking supplemental vitamin E. Based on the limits of exposure available from observation in clinical trials, it is recommended not to co-administer to patients more than 1,200 IU vitamin E per day.

## Weight and metabolic parameters

An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. A higher increase of blood lipids were seen with tipranavir/ritonavir than with comparators (other protease inhibitors) in clinical trials. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.

## Immune reactivation syndrome

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and pneumocystis pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. In addition, reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in clinical studies with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Rash

Mild to moderate rashes including urticarial rash, maculopapular rash, and photosensitivity have been reported in subjects receiving Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir. At 48-weeks in Phase III trials, rash of various types was observed in 15.5% males and 20.5% females receiving Aptivus coadministered with low dose ritonavir. Additionally, in one interaction trial, in healthy female volunteers administered a single dose of ethinyl oestradiol followed by Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, 33% of subjects developed a rash. Rash accompanied by joint pain or stiffness, throat tightness, or generalized pruritus has been reported in both men and women receiving Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir. In the paediatric clinical trial, the frequency of rash (all grades, all causality) through 48 weeks of treatment was higher than in adult patients.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.

## Interactions

The interaction profile of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is complex. The mechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile of tipranavir are described (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Abacavir and zidovudine

The concomitant use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with zidovudine or abacavir, results in a significant decrease in plasma concentration of these nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Therefore, the concomitant use of zidovudine or abacavir with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not-recommended unless there are no other available NRTIs suitable for patient management (see section 4.5).

## Protease inhibitors

Concomitant use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with the protease inhibitors amprenavir, lopinavir or saquinavir (each co-administered with low dose ritonavir) in a dual-boosted regimen, results in significant decreases in plasma concentrations of these protease inhibitors. A significant decrease in plasma concentrations of atazanavir and a marked increase of tipranavir and ritonavir concentrations was observed when Aptivus, associated with low dose ritonavir, was coadministered with atazanavir (see section 4.5). No data are currently available on interactions of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with protease inhibitors other than those listed above. Therefore, the co-administration of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with protease inhibitors is not recommended.

## Oral contraceptives and oestrogens

Since levels of ethinyl oestradiol are decreased, the co-administration of Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir is not recommended. Alternative or additional contraceptive measures are to be used when oestrogen based oral contraceptives are co-administered with Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir (see section 4.5). Patients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of oestrogen deficiency. Women using oestrogens may have an increased risk of non serious rash.

## Anticonvulsants

Caution should be used when prescribing carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. Aptivus may be less effective due to decreased tipranavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly (see section 4.5).

## Halofantrine, lumefantrine

Due  to  their  metabolic  profile  and  inherent  risk  of  inducing  torsades  de  pointes,  administration  of halofantrine and lumefantrine with  Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Disulfiram/metronidazole

Aptivus soft capsules contain alcohol (7% ethanol, ie 100 mg per capsule or up to 200 mg per dose) which can produce disulfiram-like reactions when co-administered with disulfiram or other medicinal products which produce this reaction (e.g. metronidazole).

## Fluticasone

Concomitant use of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).

## Atorvastatin

Tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, increases the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin (see section 4.5). The combination is not recommended. Other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be considered such as pravastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin (see section 4.5). However, if atorvastatin is specifically required for patient management, it should be started with the lowest dose and careful monitoring is necessary.

## Omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors

The combined use of Aptivus with ritonavir with either omeprazole, esomeprazole or with other proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Colchicine

In patients with normal renal and hepatic function, a reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in co-administration (see section 4.5).

## Salmeterol

Concomitant use of salmeterol and Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Bosentan

Due to the marked hepatotoxicity of bosentan and the potential for increasing the liver toxicity associated with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, this combination is not recommended.

## Warnings related to certain excipients

Aptivus contains macrogolglycerol ricinoleate which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.

This medicine contains 100 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each capsule. The amount in 250 mg of this medicine (i.e. one capsule) is equivalent to less than 3 ml of beer, or than 1 ml of wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

The interaction profile of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is complex and requires special attention in particular in combination with other antiretroviral agents.

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## Metabolic profile of tipranavir

Tipranavir is a substrate, an inducer and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A. When coadministered with ritonavir at the recommended dosage (see section 4.2) there is a net inhibition of P450 CYP3A. Co-administration of Aptivus and low dose ritonavir with agents primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in changed plasma concentrations of tipranavir or the other agents, which could alter their therapeutic and undesirable effects (see list and details of considered agents, below). Agents that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse reactions are detailed in this section, and listed in section 4.3.

A cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (digoxin). At steady state, there was a significant induction of CYP 1A2 and a slight induction on CYP 2C9. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed. P-gp activity is significantly inhibited after the first dose, but there was a slight induction at steady state. Practical recommendations deriving from this study are displayed below.

Studies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor. The in vivo net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19, indicates, through a preliminary study, an inducing potential of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, on CYP2C9 and P-gp after several days of treatment. Data are not available to indicate whether tipranavir inhibits or induces glucuronosyl transferases.

In vitro studies show that tipranavir is a substrate and also an inhibitor of P-gp.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is difficult to predict the net effect of Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir on oral bioavailability and plasma concentrations of agents that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. The net effect will vary depending on the relative affinity of the co-administered substance for CYP3A and P-gp, and the extent of intestinal first-pass metabolism/efflux.

Co-administration of Aptivus and agents that induce CYP3A and/or P-gp may decrease tipranavir concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect (see list and details of considered agents, below). Coadministration of Aptivus and medicinal products that inhibit P-gp may increase tipranavir plasma concentrations.

Known and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below.

## Interaction table

Interactions between Aptivus and co-administered medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is indicated as '↑', decrease as '↓', no change as '↔', once daily as 'QD', twice daily as 'BID', concentration at end of dosing interval as 'Cτ').

Unless otherwise stated, studies detailed below have been performed with the recommended dosage of Aptivus/r (i.e. 500/200 mg BID). However, some PK interaction studies were not performed with this recommended dosage. Nevertheless, the results of many of these interaction studies can be extrapolated to the recommended dosage since the doses used (eg. TPV/r 500/100 mg, TPV/r 750/200 mg) represented extremes of hepatic enzyme induction and inhibition and bracketed the recommended dosage of Aptivus/r.

| Colchicine No interaction study performed   | Based on theoretical considerations, colchicine concentrations may increase upon co-administration with tipranavir and low dose ritonavir, due to tipranavir/ritonavir CYP3A and P-gp inhibition. However a decrease of colchicine concentrations cannot be excluded since both tipranavir and ritonavir exhibit inducing potential towards CYP3A and P-gp. Colchicine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp (an intestinal efflux transporter). | A reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with normal renal or hepatic function if treatment with Aptivus/ritonavir is required (see section 4.4). In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, co-administration of colchicine in patients on Aptivus/ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Fluticasone propionate Interaction study performed only with ritonavir | In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co- administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%). Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide. It is unknown whether the combination of tipranavir with ritonavir might cause a larger increase in fluticasone exposure. | Concomitant administration of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are as yet unknown. |

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Contraception in males and females

Tipranavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, effective, safe method of contraception should be used during treatment (see section 4.5).

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of tipranavir in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Tipranavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

## Fertility

Clinical data on fertility are not available for tipranavir. Preclinical studies performed with tipranavir showed no adverse effect on fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue have been reported in some patients; therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If patients experience fatigue, dizziness, or somnolence they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Amongst the most common adverse reactions reported for Aptivus were gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhoea and nausea as well as hyperlipidaemia. The most serious adverse reactions include hepatic impairment and liver toxicity. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) was only observed in post marketing experience (see section 4.4).

Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, has been associated with reports of significant liver toxicity. In Phase III RESIST trials, the frequency of transaminase elevations was significantly increased in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm compared to the comparator arm. Close monitoring is therefore needed in patients treated with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir (see section 4.4).

Limited data are currently available for the use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Aptivus should therefore be used with caution in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Aptivus should be used in this patient population only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk, and with increased clinical and laboratory monitoring.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

Assessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on experience in all Phase II and III trials in adults treated with the 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir dose twice daily (n=1397) and are listed below by system organ class and frequency according to the following categories:

Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to  1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to  1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to  1/1,000)

## Description of selected adverse reactions

The following clinical safety features (hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidaemia, bleeding events, rash) were seen at higher frequency among tipranavir with ritonavir treated patients when compared with the comparator arm treated patients in the RESIST trials, or have been observed with tipranavir with ritonavir administration. The clinical significance of these observations has not been fully explored.

## Hepatotoxicity

After 48 weeks of follow-up, the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 ALAT and/or ASAT abnormalities was higher in tipranavir with ritonavir patients compared with comparator arm patients (10% and 3.4%, respectively). Multivariate analyses showed that baseline ALAT or ASAT above DAIDS Grade 1 and co-infection with hepatitis B or C were risk factors for these elevations. Most patients were able to continue treatment with tipranavir with ritonavir.

## Metabolic parameters

Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4)

## Hyperlipidaemia

Grade 3 or 4 elevations of triglycerides occurred more frequently in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm compared with the comparator arm. At 48 weeks these rates were 25.2% of patients in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm and 15.6% in the comparator arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Bleeding

This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical trials (n=6300).

RESIST participants receiving tipranavir with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at 24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to 1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between treatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further monitored.

Fatal and non-fatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) have been reported in patients receiving tipranavir, many of whom had other medical conditions or were receiving concomitant medicinal products that may have caused or contributed to these events. However, in some cases the role of tipranavir cannot be excluded. No pattern of abnormal haematological or coagulation parameters has been observed in patients in general, or preceding the development of ICH. Therefore, routine measurement of coagulation parameters is not currently indicated in the management of patients on Aptivus. An increased risk of ICH has previously been observed in patients with advanced HIV disease/AIDS such as those treated in the Aptivus clinical trials.

## Rash

An interaction study in women between tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and ethinyl oestradiol/norethindrone demonstrated a high frequency of non-serious rash. In the RESIST trials, the risk of rash was similar between tipranavir with ritonavir and comparator arms (16.3% vs. 12.5%, respectively; see section 4.4). No cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis have been reported in the clinical development programme of tipranavir.

## Laboratory abnormalities

Frequencies of marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in at least 2% of patients in the tipranavir with ritonavir arms in the phase III clinical studies (RESIST-1 and RESIST2) after 48-weeks were increased ASAT (6.1%), increased ALAT (9.7%), increased amylase (6.0%), increased cholesterol (4.2%), increased triglycerides (24.9%), and decreased white blood cell count (5.7%).

Increased CPK, myalgia, myositis and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with protease inhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). Reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster virus infections were observed in the RESIST trials.

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

In an open-label, dose-finding study of tipranavir plus ritonavir (Trial 1182.14), 28 children who were 12 years of age or above received Aptivus capsules. In general, adverse reactions were similar to those seen in adults, with the exception of vomiting, rash and pyrexia, which were reported more frequently in children than in adults. The most frequently reported moderate or severe adverse reactions in the 48 week analyses are noted below.

|------------------------------|----------|
| Events [N(%)]                |          |

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Human experience with tipranavir overdose is very limited. No specific signs and symptoms of overdose are known. Generally, an increased frequency and higher severity of adverse reactions may result from overdose.

There is no known antidote for tipranavir overdose. Treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed tipranavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed substance. Since tipranavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicine.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE09

## Mechanism of action

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) encodes an aspartyl protease that is essential for the cleavage and maturation of viral protein precursors. Tipranavir is a non-peptidic inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease that inhibits viral replication by preventing the maturation of viral particles.

## Antiviral activity in vitro

Tipranavir inhibits the replication of laboratory strains of HIV-1 and clinical isolates in acute models of T-cell infection, with 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50 and EC90) ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 µM (18-42 ng/ml) and 0.07 to 0.18 µM (42-108 ng/ml), respectively. Tipranavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M non-clade B isolates (A, C, D, F, G, H, CRF01 AE, CRF02 AG, CRF12 BF). Group O and HIV-2 isolates have reduced susceptibility in vitro to tipranavir with EC50 values ranging from 0.164-1 µM and 0.233-0.522 µM, respectively. Protein binding studies have shown that the antiviral activity of tipranavir decreases on average 3.75fold in conditions where human serum is present.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Resistance

The development of resistance to tipranavir in vitro is slow and complex. In one particular in vitro resistance experiment, an HIV-1 isolate that was 87-fold resistant to tipranavir was selected after 9 months, and contained 10 mutations in the protease: L10F, I13V, V32I, L33F, M36I, K45I, I54V/T, A71V, V82L, I84V as well as a mutation in the gag polyprotein CA/P2 cleavage site. Reverse genetic experiments showed that the presence of 6 mutations in the protease (I13V, V32I, L33F, K45I, V82L, I84V) was required to confer &gt; 10-fold resistance to tipranavir while the full 10-mutation genotype conferred 69-fold resistance to tipranavir. In vitro , there is an inverse correlation between the degree of resistance to tipranavir and the capacity of viruses to replicate. Recombinant viruses showing ≥ 3fold resistance to tipranavir grow at less than 1% of the rate detected for wild type HIV-1 in the same conditions. Tipranavir resistant viruses which emerge in vitro from wild-type HIV-1 show decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir but remain sensitive to saquinavir.

Through a series of multiple stepwise regression analyses of baseline and on-treatment genotypes from all clinical studies, 16 amino acids have been associated with reduced tipranavir susceptibility and/or reduced 48-week viral load response: 10V, 13V, 20M/R/V, 33F, 35G, 36I, 43T, 46L, 47V, 54A/M/V, 58E, 69K, 74P, 82L/T, 83D and 84V. Clinical isolates that exhibited a  10-fold decrease in tipranavir susceptibility harboured 8 or more tipranavir-associated mutations. In Phase II and III clinical trials, 276 patients with on-treatment genotypes have demonstrated that the predominant emerging mutations with tipranavir treatment are L33F/I/V, V82T/L and I84V. Combination of all three of these is usually required for reduced susceptibility. Mutations at position 82 occur via two pathways: one from preexisting mutation 82A selecting to 82T, the other from wild type 82V selecting to 82L.

## Cross-resistance

Tipranavir maintains significant antiviral activity (&lt; 4-fold resistance) against the majority of HIV-1 clinical isolates showing post-treatment decreased susceptibility to the currently approved protease inhibitors: amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir. Greater than 10-fold resistance to tipranavir is uncommon (&lt; 2.5% of tested isolates) in viruses obtained from highly treatment experienced patients who have received multiple peptidic protease inhibitors.

## ECG evaluation

The effect of tipranavir with low dose of ritonavir on the QTcF interval was measured in a study in which 81 healthy subjects received the following treatments twice daily for 2.5 days: tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg), tipranavir/ritonavir at a supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and placebo/ritonavir (-/200 mg). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 10.8 ms) for the supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose. Hence tipranavir at therapeutic dose with low dose of ritonavir did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic dose.

## Clinical pharmacodynamic data

This indication is based on the results of two phase III studies, performed in highly pre-treated adult patients (median number of 12 prior antiretroviral agents) with virus resistant to protease inhibitors and of one phase II study investigating pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Aptivus in mostly treatment-experienced adolescent patients aged 12 to 18 years.

The following clinical data is derived from analyses of 48-week data from studies (RESIST-1 and RESIST-2) measuring effects on plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 are randomised, open-label, multicentre studies in HIV-positive, triple-class experienced patients, evaluating treatment with 500 mg tipranavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir (200 mg; twice daily) plus an optimised background regimen (OBR) individually defined for each patient based on genotypic resistance testing and patient history. The comparator regimen included a ritonavir-boosted PI (also individually defined) plus an OBR. The ritonavir-boosted PI was chosen from among saquinavir, amprenavir, indinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir.

All patients had received at least two PI-based antiretroviral regimens and were failing a PI-based regimen at the time of study entry. At least one primary protease gene mutation from among 30N, 46I,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or 90M had to be present at baseline, with not more than two mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.

After Week 8, patients in the comparator arm who met the protocol defined criteria of initial lack of virologic response had the option of discontinuing treatment and switching over to tipranavir with ritonavir in a separate roll-over study .

The 1483 patients included in the primary analysis had a median age of 43 years (range 17-80), were 86% male, 75% white, 13% black and 1% Asian. In the tipranavir and comparator arms median baseline CD4 cell counts were 158 and 166 cells/mm 3 , respectively, (ranges 1-1893 and 11184 cells/mm 3 ); median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.79 and 4.80 log10 copies/ml, respectively (ranges 2.34-6.52 and 2.01-6.76 log10 copies/ml).

Patients had prior exposure to a median of 6 NRTIs, 1 NNRTI, and 4 PIs. In both studies, a total of 67% patient viruses were resistant and 22% were possibly resistant to the pre-selected comparator PIs. A total of 10% of patients had previously used enfuvirtide. Patients had baseline HIV-1 isolates with a median of 16 HIV-1 protease gene mutations, including a median of 3 primary protease gene mutations D30N, L33F/I, V46I/L, G48V, I50V, V82A/F/T/L, I84V, and L90M. With respect to mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 and 90 approximately 4% had no mutations, 24% had mutations at codons 82 (less than 1% of patients had the mutation V82L) and 90, 18% had mutations at codons 84 and 90 and 53% had at least one key mutation at codon 90. One patient in the tipranavir arm had four mutations. In addition the majority of participants had mutations associated with both NRTI and NNRTI resistance. Baseline phenotypic susceptibility was evaluated in 454 baseline patient samples. There was an average decrease in susceptibility of 2-fold wild type (WT) for tipranavir, 12-fold WT for amprenavir, 55-fold WT for atazanavir, 41-fold WT for indinavir, 87-fold WT for lopinavir, 41fold WT for nelfinavir, 195-fold WT for ritonavir, and 20-fold WT for saquinavir.

Combined 48-week treatment response (composite endpoint defined as patients with a confirmed  1 log RNA drop from baseline and without evidence of treatment failure) for both studies was 34% in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm and 15% in the comparator arm. Treatment response is presented for the overall population (displayed by enfuvirtide use), and detailed by PI strata for the subgroup of patients with genotypically resistant strains in the Table below.

Combined 48-week median time to treatment failure for both studies was 115 days in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm and 0 days in the comparator arm (no treatment response was imputed to day 0).

Through 48 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm compared to the comparator PI/ritonavir arm with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml was 30% and 14% respectively, and with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml was 23% and 10% respectively. Among all randomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the last measurement up to Week 48 was -0.64 log10 copies/ml in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir versus -0.22 log10 copies/ml in the comparator PI/ritonavir arm.

Among all randomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at the last measurement up to Week 48 was +23 cells/mm 3 in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir (N=740) versus +4 cells/mm 3 in the comparator PI/ritonavir (N=727) arm.

The superiority of tipranavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir over the comparator protease inhibitor/ritonavir arm was observed for all efficacy parameters at week 48. It has not been shown that tipranavir is superior to these boosted comparator protease inhibitors in patients harbouring strains susceptible to these protease inhibitors. RESIST data also demonstrate that tipranavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir exhibits a better treatment response at 48 weeks when the OBR contains genotypically available antiretroviral agents (e.g. enfuvirtide).

At present there are no results from controlled trials evaluating the effect of tipranavir on clinical progression of HIV.

## Paediatric population

HIV-positive, paediatric patients, aged 2 through 18 years, were studied in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (trial 1182.14). Patients were required to have a baseline HIV-1 RNA concentration of at least 1500 copies/ml, were stratified by age (2 to &lt; 6 years, 6 to &lt; 12 years and 12 to 18 years) and randomized to receive one of two tipranavir with ritonavir dose regimens: 375 mg/m 2 /150 mg/m 2 dose, compared to the 290 mg/m 2 /115 mg/m 2 dose, plus background therapy of at least two nonprotease inhibitor antiretroviral medicinal products, optimized using baseline genotypic resistance testing. All patients initially received Aptivus oral solution. Paediatric patients who were 12 years or older and received the maximum dose of 500 mg/200 mg twice daily could change to Aptivus capsules from study day 28. The trial evaluated pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, as well as virologic and immunologic responses through 48 weeks.

No data are available on the efficacy and safety of Aptivus capsules in children less than 12 years of age. Since Aptivus capsules and oral solution are not bioequivalent, results obtained with the oral solution cannot be extrapolated to the capsules (see also section 5.2). In patients with a body surface area of less than 1.33 m 2 appropriate dose adjustments cannot be achieved with the capsule formulation.

The baseline characteristics and the key efficacy results at 48 weeks for the paediatric patients receiving Aptivus capsules are displayed in the tables below. Data on the 29 patients who switched to capsules during the first 48 weeks are presented. Due to limitations in the study design (e.g. nonrandomized switch allowed according to patient/clinician decision), any comparisons between patients taking capsules and oral solution are not meaningful.

## Analyses of tipranavir resistance in treatment experienced patients

Tipranavir with ritonavir response rates in the RESIST studies were assessed by baseline tipranavir genotype and phenotype.  Relationships between baseline phenotypic susceptibility to tipranavir, primary PI mutations, protease mutations at codons 33, 82, 84 and 90, tipranavir resistance-associated mutations, and response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy were assessed.

Of note, patients in the RESIST studies had a specific mutational pattern at baseline of at least one primary protease gene mutation among codons 30N, 46I, 46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or 90M, and no more than two mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following observations were made:

##  Primary PI mutations

Analyses were conducted to assess virological outcome by the number of primary PI mutations (any change at protease codons 30, 32, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 82, 84, 88 and 90) present at baseline. Response rates were higher in tipranavir with ritonavir patients than comparator PI boosted with ritonavir in new enfuvirtide patients, or patients without new enfuvirtide. However, without new enfuvirtide some patients began to lose antiviral activity between weeks 4 and 8.

##  Mutations at protease codons 33, 82, 84 and 90

A reduced virological response was observed in patients with viral strains harbouring two or more mutations at HIV protease codons 33, 82, 84 or 90, and not receiving new enfuvirtide.

##  Tipranavir resistance-associated mutations

Virological response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy has been evaluated using a tipranavirassociated mutation score based on baseline genotype in RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 patients. This score (counting the 16 amino acids that have been associated with reduced tipranavir susceptibility and/or reduced viral load response: 10V, 13V, 20M/R/V, 33F, 35G, 36I, 43T, 46L, 47V, 54A/M/V, 58E, 69K, 74P, 82L/T, 83D and 84V) was applied to baseline viral protease sequences. A correlation between the tipranavir mutation score and response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy at week 48 has been established.

This score has been determined from the selected RESIST patient population having specific mutation inclusion criteria and therefore extrapolation to a wider population mandates caution.

At 48-weeks, a higher proportion of patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir achieved a treatment response in comparison to the comparator protease inhibitor/ritonavir for nearly all of the possible combinations of genotypic resistance mutations (see table below).

Sustained HIV-1 RNA decreases up to week 48 were mainly observed in patients who received tipranavir with ritonavir and new enfuvirtide.

##  Tipranavir phenotypic resistance

Increasing baseline phenotypic fold change to tipranavir in isolates is correlated to decreasing virological response.  Isolates with baseline fold change of &gt;0 to 3 are considered susceptible; isolates with &gt;3 to 10 fold changes have decreased susceptibility; isolates with &gt;10 fold changes are resistant.

Conclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to change with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems for analysing resistance test results.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In order to achieve effective tipranavir plasma concentrations and a twice daily dosing regimen, coadministration of tipranavir with low dose ritonavir twice daily is essential (see section 4.2). Ritonavir acts by inhibiting hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP3A, the intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and possibly intestinal cytochrome P450 CYP3A as well. As demonstrated in a doseranging evaluation in 113 HIV-negative healthy male and female volunteers, ritonavir increases AUC012h, Cmax and Cmin and decreases the clearance of tipranavir. 500 mg Tipranavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir (200 mg; twice daily) was associated with a 29-fold increase in the geometric mean morning steady-state trough plasma concentrations compared to tipranavir 500 mg twice daily without ritonavir.

## Absorption

Absorption of tipranavir in humans is limited, though no absolute quantification of absorption is available. Tipranavir is a P-gp substrate, a weak P-gp inhibitor and appears to be a potent P-gp inducer as well. Data suggest that, although ritonavir is a P-gp inhibitor, the net effect of Aptivus, coadministered with low dose ritonavir, at the proposed dose regimen at steady-state, is P-gp induction. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1 to 5 hours after dose administration depending upon the dosage used. With repeated dosing, tipranavir plasma concentrations are lower than predicted from single dose data, presumably due to hepatic enzyme induction. Steady-state is attained in most subjects after 7 days of dosing. Tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at steady state.

Dosing with Aptivus capsules 500 mg twice daily concomitant with 200 mg ritonavir twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks and without meal restriction produced a mean tipranavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 94.8 ± 22.8 µM for female patients (n=14) and 77.6 ± 16.6 µM for male patients (n=106), occurring approximately 3 hours after administration. The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the morning dose was 41.6 ± 24.3 µM for female patients and 35.6 ± 16.7 µM for male patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tipranavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged 851 ± 309 µM·h (CL=1.15 l/h) for female patients and 710 ± 207 µM·h (CL=1.27 l/h) for male patients. The mean half-life was 5.5 (females) or 6.0 hours (males).

## Effects of food on oral absorption

Food improves the tolerability of tipranavir with ritonavir. Therefore Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be given with food.

Absorption of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is reduced in the presence of antacids (see section 4.5).

## Distribution

Tipranavir is extensively bound to plasma proteins (&gt;99.9%). From clinical samples of healthy volunteers and HIV-1 positive subjects who received tipranavir without ritonavir the mean fraction of tipranavir unbound in plasma was similar in both populations (healthy volunteers 0.015%  0.006%; HIV-positive subjects 0.019%  0.076%). Total plasma tipranavir concentrations for these samples ranged from 9 to 82  M. The unbound fraction of tipranavir appeared to be independent of total concentration over this concentration range.

No studies have been conducted to determine the distribution of tipranavir into human cerebrospinal fluid or semen.

## Biotransformation

In vitro metabolism studies with human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 is the predominant CYP isoform involved in tipranavir metabolism.

The oral clearance of tipranavir decreased after the addition of ritonavir which may represent diminished first-pass clearance of the substance at the gastrointestinal tract as well as the liver.

The metabolism of tipranavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is minimal. In a 14 C-tipranavir human study (500 mg  14 C-tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir,  twice daily), unchanged tipranavir was predominant and accounted for 98.4% or greater of the total plasma radioactivity circulating at 3, 8, or 12 hours after dosing. Only a few metabolites were found in plasma, and all were at trace levels (0.2% or less of the plasma radioactivity). In faeces, unchanged tipranavir represented the majority of faecal radioactivity (79.9% of faecal radioactivity). The most abundant faecal metabolite, at 4.9% of faecal radioactivity (3.2% of dose), was a hydroxyl metabolite of tipranavir. In urine, unchanged tipranavir was found in trace amounts (0.5% of urine radioactivity). The most abundant urinary metabolite, at 11.0% of urine radioactivity (0.5% of dose) was a glucuronide conjugate of tipranavir.

## Elimination

Administration of  14 C-tipranavir to subjects (n = 8) that received 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir; twice daily dosed to steady-state demonstrated that most radioactivity (median 82.3%) was excreted in faeces, while only a median of 4.4% of the radioactive dose administered was recovered in urine. In addition, most radioactivity (56%) was excreted between 24 and 96 hours after dosing. The effective mean elimination half-life of tipranavir with ritonavir in healthy volunteers (n = 67) and HIV-infected adult patients (n = 120) was approximately 4.8 and 6.0 hours, respectively, at steady state following a dose of 500 mg/200 mg twice daily with a light meal.

## Special populations

Although data available at this stage are currently limited to allow a definitive analysis, they suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile is unchanged in older people and comparable between races. By contrast, evaluation of the steady-state plasma tipranavir trough concentrations at 10-14 h after dosing from the RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 studies demonstrate that females generally had higher tipranavir concentrations than males. After four weeks of Aptivus 500 mg with 200 mg ritonavir (twice daily) the median plasma trough concentration of tipranavir was 43.9 µM for females and 31.1 µM for males. This difference in concentrations does not warrant a dose adjustment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Tipranavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. However, since the renal clearance of tipranavir is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

In a study comparing 9 patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment to 9 controls, the single and multiple dose exposure of tipranavir and ritonavir were increased in patients with hepatic impairment but still within the range observed in clinical studies.  No dosing adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment but patients should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

The influence of moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of either tipranavir or ritonavir has so far not been investigated. tipranavir is contraindicated in moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Animal toxicology studies have been conducted with tipranavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs, and coadministered with ritonavir (3.75:1 w/w ratio) in rats and dogs. Studies with co-administration of tipranavir and ritonavir did not reveal any additional toxicological effects when compared to those seen in the tipranavir single agent toxicological studies.

The predominant effects of repeated administration of tipranavir across all species toxicologically tested were on the gastrointestinal tract (emesis, soft stool, diarrhoea) and the liver (hypertrophy). The effects were reversible with termination of treatment. Additional changes included bleeding in rats at high doses (rodents specific). Bleeding observed in rats was associated with prolonged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and a decrease in some vitamin K dependent factors. The co-administration of tipranavir with vitamin E in the form of TPGS (d-alphatocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) from 2,322 IU/m² upwards in rats resulted in a significant increase in effects on coagulation parameters, bleeding events and death. In preclinical studies of tipranavir in dogs, an effect on coagulation parameters was not seen. Co-administration of tipranavir and vitamin E has not been studied in dogs.

The majority of the effects in repeat-dose toxicity studies appeared at systemic exposure levels which are equivalent to or even below the human exposure levels at the recommended clinical dose.

In in vitro studies, tipranavir was found to inhibit platelet aggregation when using human platelets (see section 4.4) and thromboxane A2 binding in an in vitro cell model at levels consistent with exposure observed in patients receiving Aptivus with ritonavir. The clinical implications of these findings are not known.

In a study conducted in rats with tipranavir at systemic exposure levels (AUC) equivalent to human exposure at the recommended clinical dose, no adverse effects on mating or fertility were observed. At maternal doses producing systemic exposure levels similar to or below those at the recommended clinical dose, tipranavir did not produce teratogenic effects. At tipranavir exposures in rats at 0.8-fold human exposure at the clinical dose, foetal toxicity (decreased sternebrae ossification and body weights) was observed. In pre- and post-natal development studies with tipranavir in rats, growth inhibition of pups was observed at maternally toxic doses approximating 0.8-fold human exposure.

Carcinogenicity studies of tipranavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for these species, which are regarded as of no clinical relevance. Tipranavir showed no evidence of genetic toxicity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## Aptivus 250 mg soft capsules

## tipranavir

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or your pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Aptivus is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Aptivus
3. How to take Aptivus
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Aptivus
6. Contents of the pack and other information

If Aptivus has been prescribed for your child, please note that all information in this leaflet is addressed to your child (in this case please read 'your child' instead of 'you').

## 1. What Aptivus is and what it is used for

Aptivus contains the active substance tipranavir. It belongs to a group of medicines called protease inhibitors and is used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It blocks an enzyme called protease that is involved in the reproduction of HIV. When the enzyme is blocked, the virus does not reproduce normally, slowing down the infection. You must take Aptivus together with:

-  low dose ritonavir (this helps Aptivus to reach a high enough level in your blood)
-  other HIV medicines. Your doctor, together with you, will decide which other medicines you should take. This will depend on, for example:
-  which other medicines you have already taken for HIV
-  which medicines your HIV is resistant to. If your HIV is resistant to some HIV medicines, this means that the medicine will not work so well, or will not work at all.

Aptivus is specifically used for the treatment of HIV which is resistant to most other protease inhibitors. Before starting treatment, your doctor will have taken blood samples to test the resistance of your HIV. These tests will have confirmed that the HIV in your blood is resistant to most other protease inhibitors. Aptivus treatment is therefore appropriate for you. You should not use Aptivus if you have never received antiretroviral therapy or have other antiretroviral options available.

Aptivus soft capsules are indicated for:

-  adolescents 12 years of age or older who have a Body Surface Area (BSA) of ≥1.3 m 2 or weight ≥36 kg
-  adults

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you take Aptivus

You must take Aptivus in combination with low dose ritonavir and other antiretroviral medicines. It is therefore important that you know about these medicines too. You should therefore carefully read the Package Leaflets of ritonavir and your other antiretroviral medicines. If you have any further questions about ritonavir or the other medicines you are prescribed, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## Do not take Aptivus

- -if you are allergic to tipranavir or  any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will take a blood sample to test how well your liver is working (your liver function). Depending on your liver function you may have to delay or stop Aptivus treatment
- -if you are currently taking products containing:
- -rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis)
- -cisapride (used to treat stomach problems)
- -pimozide or sertindole (used to treat schizophrenia)
- -quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder)
- -lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia)
- -triazolam or oral midazolam (taken by mouth). These medicines are used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders
- -ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches)
- -astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergies or hay fever)
- -simvastatin or lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
- -amiodarone, bepridil, flecainide, propafenone or quinidine (used to treat heart disorders)
- -metoprolol (used to treat heart failure)
- -alfuzosin and sildenafil (when used to treat a rare blood vessel disorder characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary artery)
- -colchicine (when used to treat gout flares in patients with kidney or liver disease).

Do not take products containing St John's wort (a herbal remedy for depression). This may stop Aptivus from working properly.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Aptivus.

Tell your doctor if you have:

- -type A or B haemophilia
- -diabetes
- -liver disease.

If you have:

- -high liver function test results
- -hepatitis B or C infection

you are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver damage while taking Aptivus. Your doctor will monitor your liver function by blood tests before and during Aptivus treatment. If you have liver disease or hepatitis, your doctor will decide if you need additional testing. You should inform your doctor as soon as possible if you notice the signs or symptoms of hepatitis:

- -fever
- -malaise (feeling generally unwell)
- -nausea (upset stomach)
- -vomiting
- -abdominal pain
- -tiredness

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -jaundice (yellowing of the skin or the eyeballs)

## Rash:

Mild to moderate rash, including:

- -hives
- -rash with flat or raised small red spots
- -sensitivity to the sun

have been reported in approximately 1 in 10 patients receiving Aptivus. Some patients who developed rash also had:

- -joint pain or stiffness
- -throat tightness
- -generalized itching

In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection (for example fever, enlarged lymph nodes), please inform your doctor immediately.

In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

Tell your doctor if you experience fainting or a sensation of abnormal heart beats. Aptivus in combination with low dose ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart. These changes may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).

Bone problems: Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

## Children

Aptivus soft capsules should not be used by children under 12 years of age.

## Older people

If you are older than 65 years your doctor will exercise caution when prescribing Aptivus soft capsules to you and will closely monitor your therapy. Tipranavir has been used in limited number of patients 65 years or older.

## Other medicines and Aptivus

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

This is very important . If you take other medicines at the same time as Aptivus and ritonavir, this can strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines. These effects are called interactions, and can lead to serious side effects, or prevent proper control of other conditions you may have.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interactions with other HIV medicines:

- -etravirine belongs to a class of HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Taking Aptivus with etravirine is not recommended.
- -abacavir and zidovudine. These belong to a class of HIV medicines called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Your doctor will only prescribe you abacavir and zidovudine if you are unable to take other NRTIs.
- -didanosine: If you are taking didanosine enteric coated tablets, you should take them at least two hours before or after Aptivus.
- -emtricitabine: If you are taking emtricitabine your kidney function should be checked before initiation of Aptivus.
- -rilpivirine: If you are taking rilpivirine, your doctor will monitor you closely.
- -Protease Inhibitors (PIs): Taking Aptivus may cause large decreases in the blood levels of other HIV protease inhibitors. For example the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir and saquinavir will be decreased.

Taking Aptivus, with atazanavir, may cause the blood levels of Aptivus and ritonavir to increase a lot.

Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of Aptivus and protease inhibitors.

## Other medicines with which Aptivus may interact include:

- -oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT): If you are taking the contraceptive pill to prevent pregnancy you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. barrier contraception like condoms). Generally, it is not recommended to take Aptivus, with ritonavir, together with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). You should check with your doctor if you do wish to continue taking oral contraceptives or HRT. If you use oral contraceptives or HRT you have an increased chance of developing a skin rash while taking Aptivus. If a rash occurs, it is usually mild to moderate. You should talk to your doctor as you may need to temporarily stop taking either Aptivus or your oral contraceptives or HRT carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). These may decrease the
- -effectiveness of Aptivus.
- -sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines used to produce and maintain an erection). The effects of sildenafil and vardenafil are likely to be increased if you take them with Aptivus. You should not be prescribed tadalafil until you have been taking Aptivus for 7 days or more.
- -omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole (proton pump inhibitors used to reduce the gastric acid production)
- -metronidazole (used to treat infections)
- -disulfiram (used to treat alcohol dependence)
- -buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines used to treat severe pain)
- -cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus (used to prevent organ rejection (to suppress the immune system))
- -warfarin (used to treat and prevent thrombosis)
- -digoxin (used to treat heart arrhythmias and heart failure)
- -antifungal medications including fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or voriconazole

## The following medicines are not recommended:

- -fluticasone (used to treat asthma)
- -atorvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
- -salmeterol (used to achieve long-term asthma control, bronchospasm prevention with COPD)
- -bosentan (used to treat pulmonary artery hypertension)
- -halofantrine or lumefantrine (used to treat malaria)
- -tolterodine (used to treat overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence))

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -cobicistat and products containing cobicistat (used to increase effectiveness of HIV medicines).

Aptivus may lead to a loss of effectiveness of some medicines including:

- -methadone, meperidine (pethidine), used as morphine substitutes

Your doctor may have to increase or decrease the dose of other medicines which you take together with Aptivus. Examples include:

- -rifabutin and clarithromycin (antibiotics)
- -theophylline (used to treat asthma)
- -desipramine, trazodone and bupropion (used to treat depression; bupropion is also used for smoking cessation)
- -midazolam (when given by injection); midazolam is a sedative used to treat anxiety and to help you sleep
- -rosuvastatin or pravastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
- -colchicine (used to treat gout flares with normal kidney and liver function)
- -raltegravir (used to treat HIV infection)
- -dolutegravir (used to treat HIV infection).

If you take aluminium- and magnesium-based antacid (used to treat dyspepsia/gastrooesophageal reflux), the time interval between Aptivus and antacid should be at least two hours.

Tell your doctor if you receive medicines such as blood-thinning agents, or if you are taking vitamin E. Your doctor may wish to consider certain precautionary measures in such circumstances.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is not known whether Aptivus may be used safely during pregnancy.

Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.

If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible . See also Section 2, under 'Oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT)'.

Aptivus contains very small amounts of alcohol (see Aptivus capsules contain ethanol ).

## Driving and using machines

Some of the side effects of Aptivus may affect your ability to drive or operate machinery (e.g. dizziness and sleepiness). If affected, you should not drive or operate machinery.

## Aptivus capsules contain ethanol, macrogolglycerol ricinoleate and sorbitol (E420)

Aptivus contains 100 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each capsule. The amount in 250 mg of this medicine (i.e. one capsule) is equivalent to less than 3 ml of beer, or than 1 ml of wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.

Aptivus also contains macrogolglycerol ricinoleate which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.

This medicine contains 12.6 mg of sorbitol in each capsule.

## 3. How to take Aptivus

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. You must take Aptivus together with ritonavir.

The recommended dose for an adult or an adolescent 12 years and above who have a Body Surface Area (BSA) of ≥1.3 m 2 or weight ≥36 kg is:

- -500 mg (two 250 mg capsules) Aptivus together with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -200 mg (two 100 mg capsules) ritonavir twice per day with food.

## Oral use.

Aptivus capsules should be taken with food, swallowed whole and must not be opened or chewed.

Always take this medicine in combination with other antiretroviral medicines. You should follow the instructions for these medicines within the supplied Package Leaflets.

You should continue to take Aptivus for as long as your doctor tells you.

## If you take more Aptivus than you should

Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you take more than the prescribed dose of Aptivus.

## If you forget to take Aptivus

If you miss a dose of Aptivus or ritonavir by more than 5 hours, wait and then take the next dose of Aptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. If you miss a dose of Aptivus and/or ritonavir by less than 5 hours, take your missed dose immediately. Then take your next dose of Aptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time.

Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop taking Aptivus

It has been shown that taking all doses at the appropriate times:

- -greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines
- -reduces the chances of your HIV becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines

Therefore, it is important that you continue taking Aptivus correctly, as described above. Do NOT stop taking Aptivus unless your doctor instructs you to do so.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. It may be difficult to tell the difference between:

- -side effects caused by Aptivus
- -side effects caused by the other medicines you are also taking
- -complications of HIV infection.

For this reason it is very important that you tell your doctor about any changes in your health.

## Serious side effects associated with Aptivus:

- -Abnormal liver function
- -Hepatitis and fatty liver
- -Liver failure. This can lead to death
- -Increased blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of haemoglobin)

You should inform your doctor if you experience:

- -Loss of appetite
- -Nausea (upset stomach)
- -Vomiting and/or jaundice

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which may be symptoms of abnormal liver function

- -Bleeding
- -*Bleeding in the brain. This can lead to permanent disability or death, and has occurred in some patients treated with Aptivus in clinical trials.
