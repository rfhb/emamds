## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Azacitidine Accord is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with:

- -Intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS),
- -chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder,
- -acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) classification,
- -AML with &gt;30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Azacitidine Accord treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients should be premedicated with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting.

## Posology

The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline haematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m 2 of body surface area, injected subcutaneously, daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle).

It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 6 cycles. Treatment should be continued for as long as the patient continues to benefit or until disease progression.

Patients should be monitored for haematologic response/toxicity and renal toxicities (see section 4.4); a delay in starting the next cycle or a dose reduction as described below may be necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Azacitidine Accord should not be used interchangeably with oral azacitidine. Due to differences in the exposure, the dose and schedule recommendations for oral azacitidine are different from those for injectable azacitidine. Healthcare professionals are recommended to verify the name of the medicinal product, dose and administration route.

## Laboratory tests

Liver function tests, serum creatinine and serum bicarbonate should be determined prior to initiation of therapy and prior to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each treatment cycle.

## Dose adjustment due to haematological toxicity

Haematological toxicity is defined as the lowest count reached (nadir) in a given cycle if platelets ≤ 50.0 x 10 9 /l and/or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤ 1 x 10 9 /L.

Recovery is defined as an increase of cell line(s) where haematological toxicity was observed of at least half of the absolute difference of nadir and the baseline count plus the nadir count (i.e. blood count at recovery ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count - nadir count]).

Patients without reduced baseline blood counts (i.e. White Blood Cells (WBC) ≥ 3.0 x 10 9 /l and ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10 9 /l, and platelets ≥ 75.0 x 10 9 /l) prior to the first treatment

If haematological toxicity is observed following Azacitidine Accord treatment, the next cycle of the therapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved within 14 days, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days, the dose should be reduced according to the following table. Following dose modifications, the cycle duration should return to 28 days.

| Cycle Nadir     | Cycle Nadir           | Dose in the next cycle, if recovery* is not achieved within 14 days (%)   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ANC (x 10 9 /l) | Platelets (x 10 9 /l) | Dose in the next cycle, if recovery* is not achieved within 14 days (%)   |
| ≤ 1.0           | ≤ 50.0                | 50%                                                                       |
| > 1.0           | > 50.0                | 100%                                                                      |

*Recovery = counts ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count - nadir count])

Patients with reduced baseline blood counts (i.e. WBC &lt; 3.0 x 10 9 /L or ANC &lt; 1.5 x 10 9 /L or platelets &lt; 75.0 x 10 9 /L) prior to the first treatment

Following Azacitidine Accord treatment, if the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets from that prior to treatment is ≤ 50 %, or greater than 50 % but with an improvement in any cell line differentiation, the next cycle should not be delayed and no dose adjustment made.

If the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets is greater than 50 % from that prior to treatment, with no improvement in cell line differentiation, the next cycle of Azacitidine Accord therapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved within 14 days, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days, bone marrow cellularity should be determined. If the bone marrow cellularity is &gt; 50 %, no dose adjustments should be made. If bone marrow cellularity is ≤ 50 %, treatment should be delayed and the dose reduced according to the following table:

| Bone marrow cellularity   | Dose in the next cycle if recovery is not achieved within 14 days (%)   | Dose in the next cycle if recovery is not achieved within 14 days (%)   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                           | Recovery* ≤ 21 days                                                     | Recovery* > 21 days                                                     |

| < 15%                     | 100%                                                                    | 33%                                                                     |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*Recovery = counts ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [baseline count - nadir count])

Following dose modifications, the next cycle duration should return to 28 days.

## Special populations

## Elderly patients

No specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.

## Patients with renal impairment

Azacitidine can be administered to patients with renal impairment without initial dose adjustment (see section 5.2). If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mmol/l occur, the dose should be reduced by 50 % on the next cycle. If unexplained elevations in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to ≥ 2-fold above baseline values and above upper limit of normal (ULN) occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and the dose should be reduced by 50 % on the next treatment cycle (see section 4.4).

## Patients with hepatic impairment

No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). Patients with severe hepatic organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse events. No specific modification to the starting dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment prior to starting treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology laboratory values. Azacitidine Accord is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of azacitidine in children aged 0-17 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

Reconstituted Azacitidine Accord should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. Injection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened.

After reconstitution, the suspension should not be filtered. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see section 4.4).

Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Haematological toxicity

Treatment with azacitidine is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly during the first 2 cycles (see section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be performed as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at least prior to each treatment cycle. After administration of the recommended dose for the first cycle, the dose for subsequent cycles should be reduced or its administration delayed based on nadir counts and haematological response (see section 4.2). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes. Patients and physicians are also advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with extensive tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline serum albumin &lt; 30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see section 4.3).

## Renal impairment

Renal abnormalities ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death were reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to &lt; 20 mmol/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalaemia (serum potassium &lt; 3 mmol/L) developed in 5 subjects with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) treated with azacitidine and etoposide. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate (&lt; 20 mmol/L) or elevations of serum creatinine or BUN occur, the dose should be reduced or administration delayed (see section 4.2).

Patients should be advised to report oliguria and anuria to the health care provider immediately.

Although no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions were noted between subjects with normal renal function compared to those with renal impairment, patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity since azacitidine and/or its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney (see section 4.2).

## Laboratory tests

Liver function tests, serum creatinine and serum bicarbonate should be determined prior to initiation of therapy and prior to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each treatment cycle, see also section 4.8 .

## Cardiac and pulmonary disease

Patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure, clinically unstable cardiac disease or pulmonary disease were excluded from the pivotal registration studies (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 and AZA-AML-001) and therefore the safety and efficacy of azacitidine in these patients has not been established. Recent data from a clinical study in patients with a known history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease showed a significantly increased incidence of cardiac events with azacitidine (see section 4.8). It is therefore advised to exercise caution when prescribing azacitidine to these patients. Cardiopulmonary assessment before and during the treatment should be considered.

## Necrotising fasciitis

Necrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated with azacitidine. Azacitidine therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop necrotising fasciitis and appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated.

## Tumour lysis syndrome

The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken.

## Differentiation syndrome

Cases of differentiation syndrome (also known as retinoic acid syndrome) have been reported in patients receiving injectable azacitidine. Differentiation syndrome may be fatal and symptoms and clinical findings include respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, fever, rash, pulmonary oedema, peripheral oedema, rapid weight gain, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, hypotension and renal dysfunction (see section 4.8). Treatment with high-dose IV corticosteroids and haemodynamic monitoring should be considered at first onset of symptoms or signs suggestive of differentiation syndrome. Temporary discontinuation of injectable azacitidine should be considered until resolution of symptoms and if resumed, caution is advised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and glutathione transferases (GSTs); interactions related to these metabolizing enzymes in vivo are therefore considered unlikely.

Clinically significant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely (see section 5.2).

No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 6 months after treatment. Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment and must use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Studies in mice have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, azacitidine should not be used during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary. The advantages of treatment should be weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether azacitidine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the potential serious adverse reactions in the nursing child, breast-feeding is contraindicated during azacitidine therapy.

## Fertility

There are no human data on the effect of azacitidine on fertility. In animals, adverse reactions with azacitidine use on male fertility have been documented (see section 5.3). Before starting treatment, male patients should be advised to seek counselling on sperm storage.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Azacitidine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported with the use of azacitidine. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Adult population with MDS, CMML and AML (20-30% marrow blasts)

Adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of azacitidine have occurred in 97 % of patients.

The most common serious adverse reactions noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) included febrile neutropenia (8.0 %) and anaemia (2.3 %), which were also reported in the supporting studies (CALGB 9221 and CALGB 8921). Other serious adverse reactions from these 3 studies included infections such as neutropenic sepsis (0.8%) and pneumonia (2.5%) (some with fatal outcome), thrombocytopenia (3.5%), hypersensitivity reactions (0.25%) and haemorrhagic events (e.g. cerebral haemorrhage [0.5%], gastrointestinal haemorrhage [0.8%] and intracranial haemorrhage [0.5%])).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most commonly reported adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were haematological reactions (71.4 %) including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia (usually Grade 3-4), gastrointestinal events (60.6 %) including nausea, vomiting (usually Grade 1-2) or injection site reactions (77.1 %; usually Grade 1-2).

## Adult population aged 65 years or older with AML with &gt; 30% marrow blasts

The most common serious adverse reactions ( ≥ 10%) noted from AZA-AML-001 within the azacitidine treatment arm included febrile neutropenia (25.0%), pneumonia (20.3%), and pyrexia (10.6%). Other less frequently reported serious adverse reactions in the azacitidine treatment arm included sepsis (5.1%), anaemia (4.2%), neutropenic sepsis (3.0%), urinary tract infection (3.0%), thrombocytopenia (2.5%), neutropenia (2.1%), cellulitis (2.1%), dizziness (2.1%) and dyspnoea (2.1%).

The most commonly reported ( ≥ 30%) adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were gastrointestinal events, including constipation (41.9%), nausea (39.8%), and diarrhoea (36.9%; usually Grade 1-2), general disorders and administration site conditions including pyrexia (37.7%; usually Grade 1-2) and haematological events, including febrile neutropenia (32.2%) and neutropenia (30.1%; usually Grade 3-4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 1 below contains adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment obtained from the main clinical studies in MDS and AML and post marketing surveillance.

Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions are presented in the table below according to the highest frequency observed in any of the main clinical studies.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Haematologic adverse reactions

The most commonly reported (≥ 10%) haematological adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment include anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and leukopenia, and were usually Grade 3 or 4. There is a greater risk of these events occurring during the first 2 cycles, after which they occur with less frequency in patients with restoration of haematological function. Most haematological adverse reactions were managed by routine monitoring of complete blood counts and delaying azacitidine administration in the next cycle, prophylactic antibiotics and/or growth factor support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia and transfusions for anaemia or thrombocytopenia as required.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infections

Myelosuppression may lead to neutropenia and an increased risk of infection. Serious adverse reactions such as sepsis, including neutropenic sepsis, and pneumonia were reported in patients receiving azacitidine, some with a fatal outcome. Infections may be managed with the use of antiinfectives plus growth factor support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia.

## Bleeding

Bleeding may occur with patients receiving azacitidine. Serious adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal haemorrhage and intracranial haemorrhage have been reported. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding, particularly those with pre-existing or treatmentrelated thrombocytopenia.

## Hypersensitivity

Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving azacitidine. In case of an anaphylactic-like reaction, treatment with azacitidine should be immediately discontinued and appropriate symptomatic treatment initiated.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue adverse reactions

The majority of skin and subcutaneous adverse reactions were associated with the injection site. None of these adverse reactions led to discontinuation of azacitidine, or reduction of azacitidine dose in the pivotal studies. The majority of adverse reactions occurred during the first 2 cycles of treatment and tended to decrease with subsequent cycles. Subcutaneous adverse reactions such as injection site rash/inflammation/pruritus, rash, erythema and skin lesion may require management with concomitant medicinal products, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs). These cutaneous reactions have to be distinguished from soft tissue infections, sometimes occurring at injection site. Soft tissue infections, including cellulitis and necrotising fasciitis in rare cases leading to death, have been reported with azacitidine in the post marketing setting. For clinical management of infectious adverse reactions, see section-4.8 Infections.

## Gastrointestinal adverse reactions

The most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment included constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. These adverse reactions were managed symptomatically with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting; anti-diarrhoeals for diarrhoea, and laxatives and/or stool softeners for constipation.

## Renal adverse reactions

Renal abnormalities, ranging from elevated serum creatinine and haematuria to renal tubular acidosis, renal failure and death were reported in patients treated with azacitidine (see section-4.4).

## Hepatic adverse reactions

Patients with extensive tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience hepatic failure, progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment (see section-4.4).

## Cardiac events

Data from a clinical study allowing enrolment of patients with known history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease showed an increase in cardiac events in patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with azacitidine (see section 4.4).

## Elderly population

There is limited safety information available with azacitidine in patients ≥ 85 years (with 14 [5.9%] patients ≥ 85 years treated in Study AZA-AML-001).

## Paediatric population

In Study AZA-JMML-001, 28 paediatric patients (1 month to less than 18 years of age) were treated with azacitidine for MDS (n = 10) or juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) (n = 18) (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 28 patients experienced at least 1 adverse event and 17 (60.7%) experienced at least 1 treatmentrelated event. The most commonly reported adverse events in the overall paediatric population were pyrexia,  haematologic  events  including  anaemia,  thrombocytopenia  and  febrile  neutropenia,  and gastrointestinal events including constipation and vomiting.

Three (3) subjects experienced a treatment emergent event leading to drug discontinuation (pyrexia, disease progression and abdominal pain).

In Study AZA-AML-004, 7 paediatric patients (aged 2 to 12 years) were treated with azacitidine for AML in molecular relapse after first complete remission [CR1] (see section 5.1).

All  7  patients  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-related  adverse  event.  The  most  commonly  reported adverse  events  were  neutropenia,  nausea,  leukopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  diarrhoea  and  increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Two patients experienced a treatment-related event leading to dose interruption (febrile neutropenia, neutropenia).

No new safety signals were identified in the limited number of paediatric patients treated with azacitidine during the course of the clinical study. The overall safety profile was consistent with that of the adult population.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

One case of overdose with azacitidine was reported during clinical studies. A patient experienced diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/m 2 , almost 4 times the recommended starting dose.

In the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive treatment, as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for azacitidine overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, pyrimidine analogues; ATC code: L01BC07

## Mechanism of action

Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by multiple mechanisms including cytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, incorporation into RNA and DNA, and activation of DNA damage pathways. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. Incorporation of azacitidine into DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases, leading to hypomethylation of DNA. DNA hypomethylation of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle regulation, differentiation and death pathways may result in gene re-expression and restoration of cancersuppressing functions to cancer cells. The relative importance of DNA hypomethylation versus cytotoxicity or other activities of azacitidine to clinical outcomes has not been established.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adult population (MDS, CMML and AML [20-30% marrow blasts])

The efficacy and safety of azacitidine were studied in an international, multicenter, controlled, openlabel, randomised, parallel-group, Phase 3 comparative study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) in adult patients with: intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and modified chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (mCMML) according to the French American British (FAB) classification system. RAEB-T patients (21-30 % blasts) are now considered to be AML patients under the current WHO classification system. Azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 179) was compared to conventional care regimens (CCR). CCR consisted of BSC alone (n = 105), low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n = 49) or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC (n = 25). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the 3 CCR prior to randomisation. Patients received this pre-selected regimen if not randomised to azacitidine. As part of the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients with secondary MDS were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle) for a median of 9 cycles (range = 1-39) and a mean of 10.2 cycles. Within the Intent to Treat population (ITT), the median age was 69 years (range 38 to 88 years).

In the ITT analysis of 358 patients (179 azacitidine and 179 CCR), azacitidine treatment was associated with a median survival of 24.46 months versus 15.02 months for those receiving CCR treatment, a difference of 9.4 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0001. The hazard ratio (HR) for the treatment effect was 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.43, 0.77). The two-year survival rates were 50.8 % in patients receiving azacitidine versus 26.2 % in patients receiving CCR (p &lt; 0.0001).

KEY: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio

<!-- image -->

The survival benefits of azacitidine were consistent regardless of the CCR treatment option (BSC alone, low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC) utilised in the control arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When IPSS cytogenetic subgroups were analysed, similar findings in terms of median overall survival were observed in all groups (good, intermediate, poor cytogenetics, including monosomy 7).

On analyses of age subgroups, an increase in median overall survival was observed for all groups (&lt; 65 years, ≥ 65 years and ≥ 75 years).

Azacitidine treatment was associated with a median time to death or transformation to AML of 13.0 months versus 7.6 months for those receiving CCR treatment, an improvement of 5.4 months with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0025.

Azacitidine treatment was also associated with a reduction in cytopenias, and their related symptoms. Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions. Of the patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 45.0 % of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4 % of the patients in the combined CCR groups (a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001) difference of 33.6 % (95 % CI: 22.4, 44.6). In patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months in the azacitidine group.

Response was assessed by the investigator or by the Independent Review Committee (IRC). Overall response (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) as determined by the investigator was 29 % in the azacitidine group and 12% in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0001). Overall response (CR + PR) as determined by the IRC in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was 7 % (12/179) in the azacitidine group compared with 1 % (2/179) in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0113). The differences between the IRC and investigator assessments of response were a consequence of the International Working Group (IWG) criteria requiring improvement in peripheral blood counts and maintenance of these improvements for a minimum of 56 days. A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that had not achieved a complete/partial response following azacitidine treatment. Haematological improvement (major or minor) as determined by the IRC was achieved in 49 % of patients receiving azacitidine compared with 29 % of patients treated with combined CCR (p &lt; 0.0001).

In patients with one or more cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline, the percentage of patients with a major cytogenetic response was similar in the azacitidine and combined CCR groups. Minor cytogenetic response was statistically significantly (p = 0.0015) higher in the azacitidine group (34 %) compared with the combined CCR group (10 %).

Adult population aged 65 years or older with AML with &gt; 30% marrow blasts The results presented below represent the intent-to-treat population studied in AZA-AML-001 (see section 4.1 for the approved indication).

The efficacy and safety of azacitidine was studied in an international, multicentre, controlled, open-label, parallel group Phase 3 study in patients 65 years and older with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML with &gt;30% bone marrow blasts according to the WHO classification, who were not eligible for HSCT. Azacitidine plus BSC (n=241) was compared to CCR. CCR consisted of BSC alone (n=45), low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n=158), or standard intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline plus BSC (n=44). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the 3 CCRs prior to randomization. Patients received the pre-selected regimen if not randomised to azacitidine. As part of the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival.

Azacitidine was administered at a SC dose of 75mg/m 2 /day for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28 day treatment cycle), for a median of 6 cycles (range: 1 to 28), BSC- only patients for a median of 3 cycles (range: 1 to 20), low-dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4 cycles (range 1 to 25) and standard intensive chemotherapy patients for a median of 2 cycles (range: 1 to 3, induction cycle plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The individual baseline parameters were comparable between the azacitidine and CCR groups. The median age of the subjects was 75.0 years (range: 64 to 91 years), 75.2% were Caucasian and 59.0% were male. At baseline 60.7% were classified as AML not otherwise specified, 32.4% AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, 4.1% therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and 2.9% AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities according to the WHO classification.

In the ITT analysis of 488 patients (241 azacitidine and 247 CCR), azacitidine treatment was associated with a median survival of 10.4 months versus 6.5 months for those receiving CCR treatment, a difference of 3.8 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.1009 (two- sided). The hazard ratio for the treatment effect was 0.85 (95% CI= 0.69, 1.03). The one-year survival rates were 46.5% in patients receiving azacitidine versus 34.3% in patients receiving CCR.

The Cox PH model adjusted for pre-specified baseline prognostic factors defined a HR for azacitidine versus CCR of 0.80 (95% CI= 0.66, 0.99; p = 0.0355).

In addition, although the study was not powered to demonstrate a statistically significant difference when comparing azacitidine to the preselection CCR treatment groups, the survival of azacitidine treated patients was longer when compared to CCR treatment options BSC alone, low-dose cytarabine plus BSC and were similar when compared to standard intensive chemotherapy plus BSC.

In all pre- specified subgroups age [(&lt; 75 years &amp; ≥ 75 years), gender, race, ECOG performance status (0 or 1 &amp; 2), baseline cytogenetic risk (intermediate &amp; poor) , geographic region, WHO classification of AML (including AML with myelodysplasia-related changes), baseline WBC count (≤ 5 x109/L &amp; &gt;5 x 109/L), baseline bone marrow blasts (≤ 50% &amp; &gt; 50%) and prior history of MDS] there was a trend in OS benefit in favour of azacitidine. In a few pre-specified subgroups, the OS HR reached statistical significance including patients with poor cytogenetic risk, patients with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, patients &lt; 75 years, female patients and white patients.

Haematologic and cytogenetic responses were assessed by the investigator and by the IRC with similar results. Overall response rate (complete remission [CR] + complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]) as determined by the IRC was 27.8% in the azacitidine group and 25.1% in the combined CCR group (p = 0.5384). In patients who achieved CR or CRi, the median duration of remission was 10.4 months (95% CI = 7.2, 15.2) for the azacitidine subjects and 12.3 months (95% CI = 9.0, 17.0) for the CCR subjects. A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that had not achieved a complete response for azacitidine compared to CCR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Azacitidine treatment improved peripheral blood counts and led to a reduced need for RBC and platelet transfusions. A patient was considered RBC or platelet transfusion dependent at baseline if the subject had one or more RBC or platelet transfusions during the 56 days (8 weeks) on or prior to randomization, respectively. A patient was considered RBC or platelet transfusion independent during the treatment period if the subject had no RBC or platelet transfusions during any consecutive 56 days during the reporting period, respectively.

Of the patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 38.5% (95% CI = 31.1, 46.2) of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 27.6% of (95% CI = 20.9, 35.1) patients in the combined CCR groups. In patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and achieved transfusion independence on treatment, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.9 months in the azacitidine group and was not reached in the CCR group.

Of the patients in the azacitidine group who were platelet transfusion dependent at baseline, 40.6% (95% CI = 30.9, 50.8) of these patients became platelet transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 29.3% of (95% CI = 19.7, 40.4) patients in the combined CCR groups. In patients who were platelet transfusion dependent at baseline and achieved transfusion independence on treatment, the median duration of platelet transfusion independence was 10.8 months in the azacitidine group and 19.2 months in the CCR group.

Health- Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). HRQoL data could be analysed for a subset of the full trial population. While there are limitations in the analysis, the available data suggest that patients do not experience meaningful deterioration in quality of life during treatment with azacitidine.

## Paediatric population

Study AZA-JMML-001 was a Phase 2, international, multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and activity of azacitidine prior to HSCT in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed advanced MDS or JMML. The primary objective of the clinical study was to evaluate the effect of azacitidine on response rate at Cycle 3, Day 28.

Patients (MDS, n = 10; JMML, n = 18, 3 months to 15 years; 71% male) were treated with intravenous azacitidine 75 mg/m², daily on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 3 cycles and a maximum of 6 cycles.

Enrolment in the MDS study arm was stopped after 10 MDS patients due to a lack of efficacy: no confirmed responses were recorded in these 10 patients.

In the JMML study arm, 18 patients (13 PTPN11, 3 NRAS, 1 KRAS somatic mutations and 1 clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF-1]) were enrolled. Sixteen patients completed 3 cycles of therapy and 5 of them completed 6 cycles. A total of 11 JMML patients had a clinical response at Cycle 3, Day 28, of these 11 subjects, 9 (50%) subjects had a confirmed clinical response (3 subjects with cCR and 6 subjects with cPR). Among the cohort of JMML patients treated with azacitidine, 7 (43.8%) patients had a sustained platelet response (counts ≥ 100 × 109/L) and 7 (43.8%) patients required transfusions at HSCT. 17 of 18 patients proceeded to HSCT.

Because of the study design (small patient numbers and various confounding factors), it cannot be concluded from this clinical study whether azacitidine prior to HSCT improves survival outcome in JMML patients.

Study AZA-AML-004 was a Phase 2, multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of azacitidine compared to no anti-cancer treatment in children and young adults with AML in molecular relapse after CR1.

Seven patients (median age 6.7 years [range 2 to 12 years]; 71.4% male) were treated with intravenous azacitidine 100 mg/m 2 , daily on Days 1 to 7 of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 3 cycles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Five patients had minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment at Day 84 with 4 patients achieving either molecular stabilization (n = 3) or molecular improvement (n = 1) and 1 patient had clinical relapse. Six of 7 patients (90% [95% CI = 0.4, 1.0]) treated with azacitidine underwent HSCT.

Due to the small sample size, the efficacy of azacitidine in paediatric AML cannot be established. See section 4.8 for safety information.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous administration of a single 75 mg/m 2 dose, azacitidine was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations of 750 ± 403 ng/mL occurring at 0.5 h after dosing (the first sampling point). The absolute bioavailability of azacitidine after subcutaneous relative to intravenous administration (single 75 mg/m 2 doses) was approximately 89% based on the area under the curve (AUC).

Area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of subcutaneous admiminstration of azacitidine were approximately proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m 2 dose range.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution was 76 ± 26 L, and systemic clearance was 147 ± 47 L/h.

## Biotransformation

Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and glutathione transferases (GSTs).

Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. In human liver S9 fractions, formation of metabolites was independent of NADPH implying that azacitidine metabolism was not mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. An in vitro study of azacitidine with cultured human hepatocytes indicates that at concentrations of 1.0 μM to 100 μM (i.e. up to approximately 30-fold higher than clinically achievable concentrations), azacitidine does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4 or 3A5. In studies to assess inhibition of a series of P450 isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) azacitidine up to 100 μM did not produce inhibition. Therefore, CYP enzyme induction or inhibition by azacitidine at clinically achievable plasma concentrations is unlikely.

## Elimination

Azacitidine is cleared rapidly from plasma with a mean elimination half-life (t ½) after subcutaneous administration of 41 ± 8 minutes. No accumulation occurs after subcutaneous administration of 75 mg/m 2 azacitidine once daily for 7 days. Urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and/or its metabolites. Following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine, 85 and 50 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine respectively, while &lt; 1 % was recovered in faeces.

## Special populations

The effects of hepatic impairment (see section 4.2), gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been formally studied.

## Paediatric population

In Study AZA-JMML-001, pharmacokinetic analysis was determined from 10 MDS and 18 JMML paediatric patients on Day 7 of Cycle 1 (see section 5.1). The median age (range) of the MDS patients was 13.3 (1.9-15) years and 2.1 (0.2-6.9) years for JMML patients.

Following intravenous administration of a 75 mg/m 2 dose, azacitidine rapidly reached Cmax within

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.083 hours in both MDS and JMML populations. The geometric mean Cmax were 1797.5 and 1066.3 ng/mL, and the geometric mean AUC0-∞ were 606.9 and 240.2 ng∙h/mL, for MDS and JMML patients, respectively. The geometric mean volume of distribution in MDS and JMML subjects were 103.9 and 61.1 L, respectively. It appeared that the total plasma exposure of azacitidine was higher in MDS subjects; however, moderate to high between-patient variability was noted for both AUC and Cmax.

The geometric mean t½ were 0.4 and 0.3 hours, and the geometric mean clearances were 166.4 and 148.3 L/h for MDS and JMML, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic data from Study AZA-JMML-001 were pooled together and compared to pharmacokinetic data from 6 adult subjects with MDS administered 75 mg/m 2 azacitidine intravenously in Study AZA-2002-BA-002. Mean Cmax and AUC0-t of azacitidine were similar between adult patients and paediatric patients after intravenous administration (2750 ng/mL versus 2841 ng/mL and 1025 ng∙h/mL versus 882.1 ng∙h/mL, respectively).

In Study AZA-AML-004, pharmacokinetic analysis was determined from 6 of the 7 paediatric patients, which had at least one measurable postdose pharmacokinetic concentration (see section 5.1). The median age (range) of the AML patients was 6.7 (2-12) years.

Following multiple doses of 100 mg/m 2 , the geometric means for Cmax and AUC0-tau on Cycle 1 Day 7 were 1557 ng/mL and 899.6 ng∙h/mL, respectively, with high inter-subject variability (CV% of 201.6% and 87.8%, respectively) observed. Azacitidine rapidly reached Cmax, with a median time of 0.090 hours post-intravenous administration and declined with a geometric mean t1/2 of 0.380 hours. The geometric means for clearance and volume of distribution were 127.2 L/h and 70.2 L, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic (azacitidine) exposure observed in children with AML at molecular relapse after CR1 was comparable to exposure from pooled data of 10 children with MDS and 18 children with JMML and also comparable to azacitidine exposure in adults with MDS.

## Renal impairment

Renal impairment has no major effect on the pharmacokinetic exposure of azacitidine after single and multiple subcutaneous administrations. Following subcutaneous administration of a single 75 mg/m 2 dose, mean exposure values (AUC and Cmax) from subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment were increased by 11-21%, 15-27%, and 41-66%, respectively, compared to normal renal function subjects. However, exposure was within the same general range of exposures observed for subjects with normal renal function. Azacitidine can be administered to patients with renal impairment without initial dose adjustment provided these patients are monitored for toxicity since azacitidine and/or its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney.

## Pharmacogenomics

The effect of known cytidine deaminase polymorphisms on azacitidine metabolism has not been formally investigated.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Azacitidine induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in bacterial and mammalian cell systems in vitro . The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice, when administered intraperitoneally 3 times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumours in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine administered intraperitoneally for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumours.

Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44 % frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before closure of the hard palate. In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse reactions when given pre-implantation, but it was clearly embryotoxic when given during organogenesis. Foetal abnormalities during organogenesis in rats included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and others (microphthalmia, micrognathia, gastroschisis, oedema, and rib abnormalities).

Administration of azacitidine to male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm counts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in mated females (see section 4.4).

Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## Recommendations for safe handling

Azacitidine Accord is a cytotoxic medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised when handling and preparing azacitidine suspensions. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be applied.

If reconstituted azacitidine comes into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water.

## Reconstitution procedure

Azacitidine Accord should be reconstituted with water for injections. The shelf life of the reconstituted medicinal product can be extended by reconstituting with refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for injections. Details on storage of the reconstituted product are provided below.

1. The following supplies should be assembled: Vial (s) of azacitidine; vial(s) of water for injections; non-sterile surgical gloves; alcohol wipes;

5 mL injection syringe(s) with needle(s).

2. The appropriate volume of water for injections (see table below) should be drawn into the syringe, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe.
3. The needle of the syringe containing the water for injections should be inserted through the rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into the vial.
4. Following removal of the syringe and needle, the vial should be vigorously shaken until a uniform cloudy suspension is achieved. After reconstitution each mL of suspension will contain 25 mg of azacitidine (100 mg/4 mL or 150 mg/6 mL). The reconstituted product is a homogeneous, cloudy suspension, free of agglomerates. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution since this could remove the active substance. It must be taken into account that filters are present in some adaptors, spikes and closed systems; therefore such systems should not be used for administration of the medicinal product after reconstitution.
5. The rubber top should be cleaned and a new syringe with needle inserted into the vial. The vial should then be turned upside down, making sure the needle tip is below the level of the liquid. The plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required for the proper dose, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe. The syringe with needle should then be removed from the vial and the needle disposed of.
6. A fresh subcutaneous needle (recommended 25-gauge) should then be firmly attached to the syringe. The needle should not be purged prior to injection, in order to reduce the incidence of local injection site reactions.
7. When more than 1 vial is needed all the above steps for preparation of the suspension should be repeated. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, the dose should be equally divided e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial.

| Vial containing   | Volume of water for injections   | Final concentration   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 100 mg            | 4 mL                             | 25 mg/mL              |
| 150 mg            | 6 mL                             | 25 mg/mL              |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8. The contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. The syringe filled with reconstituted suspension should be allowed up to 30 minutes prior to administration to reach a temperature of approximately 20 °C-25 °C. If the elapsed time is longer than 30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates.

## Storage of the reconstituted product

For storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.

## Calculation of an individual dose

The total dose, according to the body surface area (BSA) can be calculated as follows:

Total dose (mg) = Dose (mg/m 2 ) x BSA (m 2 )

The following table is provided only as an example of how to calculate individual azacitidine doses based on an average BSA value of 1.8 m 2 .

| Dose mg/m 2 (% of recommended starting dose)   | Total dose based on BSA value of 1.8m 2   | Number of vials required   | Number of vials required   | Total volume of reconstituted suspension required   |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

| 25 mg/m 2 (33 %)                               | 45 mg                                     | 1 vial                     | 1 vial                     | 1.8 mL                                              |

## Method of administration

Reconstituted Azacitidine Accord should be injected subcutaneously (insert the needle at a 45-90°angle) using a 25-gauge needle into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.

Doses greater than 4 mL should be injected into two separate sites.

Injection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened.

## Disposal

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Azacitidine Accord is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not candidates for, including those who choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Azacitidine Accord treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of chemotherapeutic medicinal products.

Patients are to be treated with an anti-emetic 30 minutes prior to each dose of Azacitidine Accord for the first 2 treatment cycles. Anti-emetic prophylaxis may be omitted after 2 cycles, if there has been no nausea and vomiting (see section 4.4).

## Posology

The recommended dose is 300 mg azacitidine orally once daily. Each repeated cycle consists of a treatment period of 14 days followed by a treatment free period of 14 days (28 day treatment cycle).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Azacitidine Accord treatment should be continued until no more than 15% blasts are observed in peripheral blood or bone marrow or until unacceptable toxicity (see dose schedule modification guidance for disease relapse).

Azacitidine Accord should not be used interchangeably with injectable azacitidine due to differences in the exposure, dose and schedule of treatment. Healthcare professionals are recommended to verify the name of the medicinal product, dose and administration route.

## Laboratory tests

Complete blood counts should be performed prior to initiation of therapy. Complete blood count monitoring is also recommended every other week for the first 2 cycles (56 days), every other week for the next 2 cycles after dose adjustment, and monthly thereafter, prior to the start of subsequent cycles of treatment (see section 4.4).

## Dose schedule modification for AML disease relapse

In the case of disease relapse, with 5% to 15% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, in conjunction with a clinical assessment, an extension of the dosing schedule from 14 to 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles should be considered. Dosing should not exceed 21 days during any 28-day period. Azacitidine Accord should be discontinued if more than 15% blasts are observed in either the peripheral blood or bone marrow or at the physician's discretion.

## Dose adjustment for adverse reactions

Dose modification guidelines for haematologic and non-haematologic adverse reactions are recommended based on clinical and laboratory findings (see table 1).

*Grade 1 is mild, Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe, Grade 4 is life-threatening. Toxicity grades are in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.3 (NCI-CTCAE v4.3).

## Missed or delayed doses

If a dose of Azacitidine Accord is missed, or not taken at the usual time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. Then, the next scheduled dose should be taken at the normal time the following day. Two doses should not be taken on the same day.

If a dose is vomited, another dose must not be taken on the same day. Instead return to the normal time of dose administration the following day.

## Special populations

## Elderly patients

No dose adjustments are recommended for patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

Azacitidine Accord can be administered to patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment without initial dose adjustment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin (BIL) ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; ULN, or BIL 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) (see section 5.2).

Patients with moderate (BIL &gt; 1.5 to 3 × ULN) and severe hepatic impairment (BIL &gt; 3 × ULN) should be monitored more frequently for adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment should be made (see table 1).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Azacitidine Accord in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

## Azacitidine Accord is for oral use.

Azacitidine Accord can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water at about the same time each day. They should not be split, crushed, dissolved or chewed (see section 6.6).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1

Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Haematological toxicity

Treatment with Azacitidine Accord can be associated with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia (see section 4.8 for frequencies). Interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Azacitidine Accord may be necessary to manage haematological toxicities. Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes. Patients with low platelet counts should be advised to report early signs or symptoms of bleeding. Supportive care such as antibiotics and/or antipyretics for management of infection/fever and GCSF for neutropenia should be provided based on individual patient characteristics, treatment response and according to the current clinical guidelines (see section 4.2 table 1).

## Gastrointestinal toxicity

Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most frequent adverse reactions in patients treated with Azacitidine Accord (see section 4.8). Patients should be administered prophylactic anti-emetic therapy for the first 2 cycles of Azacitidine Accord treatment (see section 4.2). Diarrhoea should be treated promptly at the onset of symptoms.

Interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Azacitidine Accord may be necessary to manage gastrointestinal toxicities (see section 4.2).

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after treatment. Men have to use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment (see section 4.6).

## Lactose intolerance

Azacitidine Accord tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.

In case of concomitant administration with other antineoplastic agents, caution and monitoring is recommended as an antagonistic, additive, or synergistic pharmacodynamic effect cannot be excluded. These effects may be dependent on the dose, sequence and schedule of administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Azacitidine Accord exposure was minimally affected when co-administered with a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole). Therefore, dose modification is not required when Azacitidine Accord is coadministered with proton pump inhibitors or other pH modifiers.

An in vitro study of azacitidine with human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine was not metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYPs). Therefore, interactions with CYP inducers or inhibitors are considered unlikely (see section 5.2).

Clinically relevant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on the metabolism of cytochrome P450 substrates are unlikely (see section 5.2). No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are expected when Azacitidine Accord is co-administered with substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) OCT2.

Azacitidine is not a substrate of P-gp, therefore it is not expected to interact with P-gp inducers or inhibitors.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after treatment. Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment and have to use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of Azacitidine Accord in pregnant women. Studies in mice and rats have shown reproductive and developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Azacitidine Accord is not recommended during pregnancy (especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary) and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. The advantages of treatment should be weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case. If a patient or partner becomes pregnant while taking Azacitidine Accord, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether azacitidine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the potential serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, breast-feeding is contraindicated during Azacitidine Accord therapy (see section 4.3).

## Fertility

There are no human data on the effect of azacitidine on fertility. In animals, adverse effects of azacitidine on male fertility have been documented (see section 5.3). Patients who wish to conceive a child should be advised to seek reproductive counselling and cryo-conservation of either the ovum or sperm prior to starting Azacitidine Accord treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Azacitidine Accord has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported with the use of Azacitidine Accord. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Haematological toxicity

New or worsening Grade 3 or higher neutropenia (41.1%), thrombocytopenia (22.5%), or febrile neutropenia (11.4%) were commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with Azacitidine Accord. The first occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or febrile neutropenia occurred within the first 2 cycles in 19.9%, 10.6%, and 1.7%, respectively in patients treated with Azacitidine Accord. See section 4.2 for monitoring and management guidance.

## Gastrointestinal toxicity

Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most frequent adverse reactions in patients treated with Azacitidine Accord. Nausea (64.8%), vomiting (59.7%), and diarrhoea (50.4%) were reported in patients treated with Azacitidine Accord. Grade 3 or higher diarrhoea occurred in 5.1% of patients and Grade 3 or higher vomiting and nausea occurred in 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively in patients treated with Azacitidine Accord. The first occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea occurred within the first 2 cycles in 1.7%, 3.0%, and 1.3%, respectively, in patients treated with Azacitidine Accord. See section 4.2 for monitoring and management guidance.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and supportive treatment should be provided, as necessary, according to local recommendations. There is no known specific antidote for an overdose with Azacitidine Accord.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues, ATC code: L01BC07

## Mechanism of action

Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and epigenetic modifier. Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA and RNA following cellular uptake and enzymatic biotransformation to nucleotide

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

triphosphates. Incorporation of azacitidine into the DNA of AML cells, modified epigenetic pathways through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, and reduction of DNA methylation. This led to alteration of gene expression, including re-expression of genes regulating tumour suppression, immune pathways, cell cycle, and cell differentiation. Incorporation of azacitidine into the RNA of AML cells, inhibited RNA methyltransferase, reduced RNA methylation, decreased RNA stability, and decreased protein synthesis.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy and safety of Azacitidine Accord was studied in a multi-centre, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study QUAZAR AML-001 (CC-486-AML-001) with a double-blind, randomised, parallelgroup design which evaluated Azacitidine Accord versus placebo as maintenance therapy in AML patients. Patients were enrolled with de novo AML, AML secondary to prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML); the patients were aged ≥ 55 years, and had achieved first complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) within 4 months (+/- 7 days) after intensive induction chemotherapy with or without consolidation therapy. Patients were not eligible for HSCT at the time of randomisation, which included patients who did not have a transplant donor, or who chose not to proceed to HSCT.

Patients in both treatment arms received best supportive care as deemed necessary by the investigator. Best supportive care included, but was not limited to, treatment with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, platelet transfusions, use of erythropoiesis stimulating agent, antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy, GCSF, anti-emetic therapy, and nutritional support.

Patients who achieved a CR/CRi after completion of intensive induction therapy with or without consolidation were administered Azacitidine Accord 300 mg (N=236) or placebo (N=233) once daily on Days 1 through 14 of each 28-day cycle. In the event of disease relapse (5% to 15% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow), the dose schedule was extended to 21 days of repeated 28-day treatment cycles per medical discretion. Treatment continued until disease progression (more than 15% blasts were observed in peripheral blood or bone marrow) or until unacceptable toxicity.

A total of 472 patients were randomised 1:1 between Azacitidine Accord and placebo treatment arms. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics for the AML patient population were balanced between treatment arms as shown in table 3. The median treatment duration was 11.6 months (range: 0.5 to 74.3 months) for the Azacitidine Accord arm versus 5.7 months (range: 0.7 to 68.5 months) for the placebo arm. A total of 51 patients (21%) receiving Azacitidine Accord and 40 patients (17%) receiving placebo extended their dose schedule to 300 mg daily for 21 days due to AML disease relapse.

Of the 469 patients in the Phase 3 study who received treatment, 61% (285/469) were 65 years of age or older and 11% (51/469) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy of Azacitidine Accord were observed between these patients and younger patients.

The efficacy of Azacitidine Accord in adult patients with AML was established based on overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS).

The efficacy results are summarised in the table 5.

In patients who had their dose schedule extended to 300 mg for 21 days due to disease relapse, the median OS (22.8 months for Azacitidine Accord and 14.6 months for placebo) and median RFS (7.4 months for Azacitidine Accord and 4.6 months for placebo) were comparable to the overall study results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Azacitidine Accord demonstrated a favorable treatment effect for OS compared with placebo in both minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive and MRD-negative patients. The treatment effect for OS was more pronounced in MRD-positive patients (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.93) than in MRDnegative patients (HR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.12).

## Health related quality of life (HRQoL)

HRQoL was assessed using the Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue scale (FACIT -fatigue scale) and the Five dimensions three levels (EQ-5D-3L) health utility index and visual analogue scale (VAS). At baseline, patients had a low level of fatigue and good level of HRQoL that were generally comparable to those of the general population of similar age. This level of HRQoL was maintained over time with Azacitidine Accord, as compared to baseline, as well as to placebo. Both the time to definitive deterioration and the proportion of patients experiencing clinically meaningful deterioration was found to be similar between those receiving Azacitidine Accord and placebo. Overall, the findings demonstrate that HRQoL was similar between Azacitidine Accord treatment and placebo arms, with no clinically meaningful deterioration over time.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Exposure was generally linear with dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure; high intersubject variability was observed. The geometric mean (coefficient of variation [%CV]) Cmax and AUC values after oral administration of a 300 mg single dose were 145.1 ng/mL (63.7) and 241.6 ng h/mL (64.5), respectively. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose regimen did not result in drug accumulation.

Absorption of azacitidine was rapid, with a median Tmax of 1 hour post dose. Mean oral bioavailability relative to subcutaneous (SC) administration was approximately 11%.

## Effect of food

The impact of food on the exposure of Azacitidine Accord was minimal. Therefore, Azacitidine Accord can be administered with or without food.

## Distribution

After oral administration, the geometric mean apparent volume of distribution was 12.6 L/kg for a 70 kg person. The plasma protein binding of azacitidine was 6 to 12%.

## Biotransformation

Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs). Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase.

## Elimination

The geometric mean apparent clearance was 1 242 L/hour and the geometric mean half-life was approximately 0.5 hours. Following intravenous administration of 14 C azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Faecal excretion accounted for &lt; 1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of 14 C-azacitidine was 50%. The amount of unchanged azacitidine recovered in urine relative to dose was &lt; 2% following either subcutaneous (SC) or oral administration. Faecal excretion has not been measured following oral administration.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

The epigenetic regulatory effect of azacitidine on DNA global methylation reduction in the blood was sustained with prolonged exposure of 300 mg daily administered for 14 or 21 days of a 28-day cycle in myeloid cancers including AML patients from a Phase 1/2 study. A positive correlation was observed between azacitidine plasma exposure and the pharmacodynamic effect of reduction in global DNA methylation in blood.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

In a population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis from 286 AML patients, age (46 to 93 years) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of Azacitidine Accord. Therefore, dose modification for Azacitidine Accord is not required, regardless of patient age.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is unlikely to affect the PK to a clinically relevant extent since azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. A population PK analysis determined that AST (8 to 155 U/L), ALT (5 to 185 U/L) and mild hepatic impairment (BIL ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN, or BIL 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of azacitidine. The effects of moderate to severe hepatic impairment (BIL &gt; 1.5 × ULN and any AST) on the PK of azacitidine is unknown.

## Renal impairment

In patients with cancer, the PK of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr &gt; 80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m 2 /day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events.

A population PK analysis following a 300 mg dose of Azacitidine Accord determined that patients with mild (CLcr: ≥ 60 to &lt; 90 mL/min), moderate (CLcr: ≥ 30 to &lt; 60 mL/min), and severe (CLcr: &lt; 30 mL/min) renal impairment had 19%, 25%, and 38% increases in azacitidine plasma AUC, respectively. The effect of severe renal impairment on Azacitidine Accord was similar to the above referenced clinical renal impairment study with injectable azacitidine (~40% increase in AUC). The exposure of azacitidine (AUC) is approximately 75% lower after oral administration relative to the exposure achieved following SC administration; therefore, an increase in exposure of approximately 40% following oral administration is still considered safe and tolerable. Thus, no dose adjustment of Azacitidine Accord is recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.

## Race/ethnicity

The effects of race/ethnicity on the PK of Azacitidine Accord is unknown.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In a 14-day oral toxicity study in dogs, mortality occurred at doses of 8 and 16 mg/m 2 /day. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 4 mg/m 2 /day. At 1 or all doses, pancytopenia correlated with bone marrow hypoplasia, lymphoid depletion, gland/lumen dilation and single cell necrosis in mucosal crypts of small and large intestines and/or centrilobular hepatocellular vacuolation were observed. At the MTD, these findings were partially or completely resolved after 3 weeks. Following parenteral azacitidine administrations at comparable dose ranges, mortality and similar target organ toxicities were observed in rodents, dogs and monkeys. Non-clinical data from repeat-dose toxicity studies with azacitidine revealed no special hazard for humans.

Azacitidine induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in bacterial and mammalian cell systems in vitro . The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice, when administered intraperitoneally 3 times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumours in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine administered intraperitoneally for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis. Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before closure of the hard palate. In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse reactions when given preimplantation, but it was clearly embryotoxic when given during organogenesis. Foetal abnormalities during organogenesis in rats included: Central nervous system (CNS) anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and others (microphthalmia, micrognathia, gastroschisis, oedema, and rib abnormalities).

Administration of azacitidine to male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm counts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in mated females (see section 4.6).

## 1. What Azacitidine Accord is and what it is used for

## What Azacitidine Accord is

Azacitidine Accord is an anti-cancer agent which belongs to a group of medicines called 'antimetabolites'. Azacitidine Accord contains the active substance 'azacitidine'.

## What Azacitidine Accord is used for

Azacitidine Accord is used in adults who are not able to have a stem cell transplantation to treat:

- -higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
- -chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML).
- -acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

These are diseases which affect the bone marrow and can cause problems with normal blood cell production.

## How Azacitidine Accord works

Azacitidine Accord works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine becomes incorporated into the genetic material of cells (ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). It is thought to work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the production of new RNA and DNA. These actions are thought to correct problems with the maturation and growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill cancerous cells in leukaemia.

Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Azacitidine Accord works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Azacitidine Accord

## Do not use Azacitidine Accord

- -if you are allergic to azacitidine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

- -if you have kidney disease.
- -if you have liver disease.
- -if you have ever had a heart condition or heart attack or any history of lung disease.

Azacitidine Accord can cause a serious immune reaction called 'differentiation syndrome' (see section 4).

## Blood test

You will have blood tests before you begin treatment with Azacitidine Accord and at the start of each period of treatment (called a 'cycle'). This is to check that you have enough blood cells and that your liver and kidneys are working properly.

## Children and adolescents

Azacitidine Accord is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18.

## Other medicines and Azacitidine Accord

1. The following supplies should be assembled:
2. Vial(s) of azacitidine; vial(s) of water for injections; non-sterile surgical gloves; alcohol wipes;

5 mL injection syringe(s) with needle(s).

2. The appropriate volume of water for injections should be drawn into the syringe, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe.
3. The needle of the syringe containing the water for injections should be inserted through the rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into the vial.
4. Following removal of the syringe and needle, the vial should be vigorously shaken until a uniform cloudy suspension is achieved. After reconstitution each mL of suspension will contain 25 mg of azacitidine (100 mg/4 mL or 150 mg/6 mL). The reconstituted product is a homogeneous, cloudy suspension, free of agglomerates. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution since this could remove the active substance. It must be taken into account that filters are present in some adaptors, spikes and closed systems; therefore such systems should not be used for administration of the medicinal product after reconstitution.
5. The rubber top should be cleaned and a new syringe with needle inserted into the vial. The vial should then be turned upside down, making sure the needle tip is below the level of the liquid. The plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required for the proper dose, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe. The syringe with needle should then be removed from the vial and the needle disposed of.
6. A fresh subcutaneous needle (recommended 25-gauge) should then be firmly attached to the syringe. The needle should not be purged prior to injection, in order to reduce the incidence of local injection site reactions.
7. When more than 1 vial is needed all the above steps for preparation of the suspension should be repeated. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, the dose should be equally divided e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial.
8. The contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. The temperature of the suspension at the time of injection should be approximately 20 ºC-25 ºC. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates.

| Vial containing   | Volume of water for injections   | Final concentration   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 100 mg            | 4 ml                             | 25 mg/ml              |
| 150 mg            | 6 ml                             | 25 mg/ml              |

## Storage of the reconstituted product

## For immediate use

The Azacitidine Accord suspension may be prepared immediately before use and the reconstituted suspension should be administered within 60 minutes. If elapsed time is greater than 60 minutes, the reconstituted suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared.

## For later use

When reconstituting using water for injections that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted suspension must be placed in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) immediately after reconstitution, and kept in the refrigerator for a maximum of 8 hours. If the elapsed time in the refrigerator is greater than 8 hours, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared.

When reconstituting using refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for injections, the reconstituted suspension must be placed in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) immediately after reconstitution, and kept in a refrigerator for a maximum of 22 hours. If the elapsed time in the refrigerator is greater than 22 hours, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared.

The syringe filled with reconstituted suspension should be allowed up to 30 minutes prior to administration to reach a temperature of approximately 20 ºC-25 ºC. If the elapsed time is longer than 30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared.

## Calculation of an individual dose

The total dose, according to the body surface area (BSA) can be calculated as follows:

Total dose (mg) = Dose (mg/m 2 ) x BSA (m 2 )

The following table is provided only as an example of how to calculate individual azacitidine doses based on an average BSA value of 1.8 m 2 .

| Dose mg/m 2 (% of recommended starting dose)   | Total dose based on BSA value of 1.8m 2   | Number of vials required   | Number of vials required   | Total volume of reconstituted suspension required   |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|                                                |                                           | 100 mg vial                | 150 mg vial                |                                                     |

## Method of administration

Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution.

Reconstituted Azacitidine Accord should be injected subcutaneously (insert the needle at a 45-90 o angle) using a 25-gauge needle into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.

Doses greater than 4 mL should be injected into two separate sites.

Injection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened.

## 1. What Azacitidine Accord is and what it is used for

## What Azacitidine Accord is

Azacitidine Accord is an anti-cancer medicine that belongs to a group of medicines called antimetabolites.

Azacitidine Accord contains the active substance azacitidine.

## What Azacitidine Accord is used for

Azacitidine Accord is used to treat adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This is a form of cancer which affects your bone marrow and can cause problems with producing normal blood cells.

Azacitidine Accord is used to keep the disease in control (remission, when the disease is less severe or not active).

## How Azacitidine Accord works

Azacitidine Accord works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine, the active substance in Azacitidine Accord, works by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off. It also reduces the production of new genetic material (RNA and DNA). These effects are thought to block growth of cancer cells in leukaemia.
