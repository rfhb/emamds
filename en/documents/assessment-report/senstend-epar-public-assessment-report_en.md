## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Accordingly, the MAH of the reference product, Fortacin has provided consent to allow access to Module 2 to Module 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The complete assessment history of Fortacin is available on the EMA website. The application for Senstend consists only of Module 1 information. The proposed indication for Senstend is the same as the approved indication for the reference product. This application is for the following presentations: · Senstend 150 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml cutaneous spray, solution 2.2. Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Fortacin application, the quality data in support of the Senstend application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Fortacin dossier, which has been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.3. Non-clinical aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Fortacin application, the non-clinical data in support of the Senstend application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Fortacin dossier, which has been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.4. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Since this application is an informed consent application, the medicinal product subject to this application is intended to be administered at comparable dose levels and for indications that were already approved in the Union for Fortacin. Based on the assumption that Senstend cutaneous spray, solution is intended to substitute for identical products on the market and it is unlikely to result in any significant increase in combined sales volumes, the approval of the product does not result in an increase of the total quantity of the active ingredients released into the environment. This justification is considered acceptable and in accordance with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human uses (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 2.5. Clinical aspects 'Medicinal Product no longer authorised'

Since this application is an informed consent of the Fortacin application, the clinical data in support of the Senstend application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Fortacin dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). No additional clinical studies have been submitted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Risk Management Plan

The submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP) of Senstend (version 0.1) is in line with the current approved version of the RMP (version 3.0) for Fortacin. The safety concerns, the pharmacovigilance plan and the risk minimisations measures are identical.

However, after approval, the RMP should be updated in line with the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP) Module V version 2.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 2.7. Pharmacovigilance Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary as described by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 2.8. Product information 2.8.1. User consultation A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The Patient Information Leaflet for the reference product, Fortacin, was the subject of a user testing study, which was completed successfully. As the Patient Information Leaflet for Senstend is identical (with the exception of the product name) to that of the reference product, the user testing of the Patient Information Leaflet for the reference product can be taken to apply equally to Senstend. 2.8.2. Braille The name of the medicinal product followed by its strength is expressed in Braille format is included in the proposed labelling and mock-ups for the cartons of the product as presented below: 'Medicinal Product no longer authorised'

Senstend 150 mg/ml + 50 mg/ml cutaneous spray, solution.
