In response to this request, the product information was updated to reflect behavioural symptoms related to impulse control disorders including compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating. It was clarified that this adverse reaction can occur irrespective of the indication and at normal doses. Furthermore, regular monitoring of patients and a careful review of treatment, if symptoms occur, is recommended. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance and advice for the patient's family and carers was provided. |
