## Scientific discussion

## Introduction

Golimumab is approved in the EU in adults who have responded inadequately to previous therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with methotrexate (MTX); active and progressive psoriatic arthritis (PsA), alone or in combination with MTX; and severe, active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

For PsA and AS, the approved dose is 50 mg given once a month. The currently approved dose in RA is: 50 mg given once a month, on the same date each month. Simponi should be given concomitantly with MTX.

Across all indications, in patients weighing more than 100 kg who do not achieve an adequate clinical response  after  3  or  4  doses,  increasing  the  dose  of  golimumab  to  100  mg  once  a  month  may  be considered. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit after receiving 3 to 4 additional doses of 100 mg.

The MAH submitted a variation to add the following indication in section 4.1 (underlined text is the wording applied for in this variation):

'Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)

Simponi, alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic  arthritis  in  adult  patients  when  the  response  to  previous  disease  modifying  anti  rheumatic drug  (DMARD)  therapy  has  been  inadequate.  Simponi  has  also  been  shown  to  reduce  the  rate  of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function in this patient population.'

Furthermore,  the  MAH  also  proposes  an  update  of  section  5.1  regarding  golimumab's  continued efficacy in the maintenance of the improvement in signs and symptoms and physical function in PsA patients. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (P/84/2010) for the following conditions:

-  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
-  Psoriatic arthritis
-  Ankylosing spondylitis
-  Rheumatoid arthritis

On the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) with a deferral.

The PIP is not yet completed.

## Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody with an immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 heavy chain isotype (G1m allotype) and a kappa light chain isotype. Golimumab binds with high affinity to both soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor alpha and inhibits TNF bioactivity.

## Clinical efficacy

## Introduction

The initial marketing authorization application and approval were based primarily on 24-week safety and efficacy data from one Phase 3 PsA study with SC golimumab, C0524T08.  During the approval procedure, 52 weeks efficacy data were submitted as part of responses to Day 120 LoQ. Thus, focus of the efficacy assessment will be data beyond week 52 as well as the X-ray data.

## Study C0524T08 (GO-REVEAL)

## Methods

For details on this study, see the original approval assessment reports. In brief:

- Study Participants: Men and women, &gt;18 years of age, with a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months prior  to  first  study  agent  administration  who  had  active  PsA  despite  current  or  previous  DMARD  or NSAID  therapy,  and  who  had  not  previously  been  treated  with  anti-tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF) α therapy.

- The main inclusion criteria were: Active PsA at the time of screening and at baseline, as characterized by 3 or more swollen joints and 3 or more tender joints, and despite current or previous DMARD or NSAID therapy. DMARD therapy was defined as taking a DMARD for at least 3 months, or evidence of DMARD intolerance. NSAID therapy was defined as taking an NSAID for at least 4 weeks. Presence of at least 1 of the PsA subsets: DIP joint arthritis, polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules, arthritis mutilans, asymmetric peripheral arthritis, or spondylitis with peripheral arthritis.

- Study population: The median age was 47 years and 60% of enrolled subjects were men. Subjects had  long-standing  disease  (about  5  years  of  median  duration)  of  moderate  to  severe  activity. Polyarthritis  symmetric  was  the  more  frequent  subtype  of  PsA,  more  than  one  third  of  the  study population  was  affected  by  dactylitis  and/or  enthesitis  at  baseline  and  the  majority  had  psoriatic fingernail disease. The proportions of subjects at baseline using MTX, oral corticosteroids, or NSAIDs specifically for PsA were similar across all treatment groups. Approximately half of the subjects in each treatment group were receiving MTX at baseline with a median dose of 15 mg/week. About 3/4 were taking NSAIDs, and less than 20% oral corticosteroids. Patients were stratified by MTX use at baseline. The  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  baseline  demographics  and  disease characteristics.

## Treatment:

The first 24 weeks were placebo-controlled; the following treatments were given:

- Group I: Placebo SC injections at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20
- Group II: Golimumab 50 mg SC injections at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20
- Group III: Golimumab 100 mg SC injections at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20

## Early Escape (Week 16)

At Week 16, subjects in any group who had &lt; 10% improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender  joint  count  entered  early  escape  in  a  double-blinded  fashion,  with  the  following  treatments:

- Group I: Golimumab 50 mg SC injections at Weeks 16 and 20
- Group II: Golimumab 100 mg SC injections at Weeks 16 and 20

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects randomized to Group III, and qualifying for early escape, continued to receive golimumab 100 mg SC injections at Weeks 16 and 20.

## At Week 24: the following treatments were given

- Group I:  Golimumab 50 mg SC injections at Week 24 and  every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 48; if entered into early escape, subjects continued to receive golimumab 50 mg injections every 4 weeks through Week 48.
- Group II: Continued golimumab 50 mg SC injections at Week 24 and every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 48; if entered into early escape, subjects continued to receive golimumab 100 mg injections every 4 weeks through Week 48.

.

- Group III: Continued golimumab 100 mg SC injections at Week 24 and every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 48; if entered into early escape, subjects continued to receive golimumab 100 mg injections every 4 weeks through Week 48.

From week 52, patients entered a Long-term extension period (Weeks 52 through 268), given openlabel treatment after the Week 52.

## Two co-primary endpoints were used:

- The number of subjects who achieved an ACR 20 (American College of Rheumatology 20) response at Week 14.
- change from baseline in total PSA modified vdH-S score (referred to as total modified van der Heijde-Sharpe score) for hands and feet at Week 24

A number of additional endpoints were evaluated addressing signs and symptoms of arthritis, psoriasis, physical function, quality of life, and structural damage, see previous AR.

## Assessment of structural damage

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The 2 primary readers, and an adjudicator when required per the imaging charter, independently read each subject's radiographs in a blinded fashion. All images for a given subject (ie, baseline, Week 24, Week 52, and any radiographic taken at the time of SC study agent discontinuation) were read as a group  in  a  random  order;  the  readers  were  blinded  to  randomized  treatment  group,  the  subject's demographics and the time point at which individual radiographs were obtained.

The PsA modified vdH-S scoring method evaluated hand and feet erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) with a total score ranging from 0 to 528. This method is based on the original vdH-S scoring method used in RA trials (van Der Heijde et al, 1992), with the addition of distal interphalangeal joints in  the  hands,  and  evaluation  for  PsA  specific  radiographic  features  such  as  pencil-in-cup  (PIC)  and gross osteolysis (GO) (van der Heijde et al, 2005). It was previously used in other PsA trials with antiTNF α agents and is accepted by regulatory agencies and the rheumatology community as a method to assess the progression of structural damage in PsA (van der Heijde et al, 2007 and Antoni et al, 2008).

## Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics, such as the mean, median, SD, range, and the interquartile range (IQ range) for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables were used to summarize most data.

All statistical testing was 2-tailed, at a significance level of 0.05. In addition to statistical analyses and tabulated  descriptive  statistics,  graphical  data  displays,  and  subject  listings  were  also  used  to summarize/present the data. Complete data handling rules for each endpoint are described in the SAP. SAS (Version 8.2) was used to conduct these analyses.

The co-primary efficacy and selected secondary efficacy analyses were based on all subjects who were randomized  at  Week  0;  i.e.,  the  intent-to-treat  population.  Based  on  the  intent-to-treat  principle, subjects randomly assigned to a treatment group were included in the efficacy analyses according to their assigned treatment group whether or not they received the assigned treatment.

## Co-primary Radiographic Analysis

For the co-primary analysis, data were summarized by randomized treatment groups:

- Placebo: Subjects randomized to the placebo group
- Golimumab 50 mg: Subjects randomized to the golimumab 50 mg group
- Golimumab 100 mg: Subjects randomized to the golimumab 100 mg group

For selected radiographic efficacy parameters, data were summarized by randomized treatment groups. Other  radiographic  data  were  summarized  by  early  escape  or  crossover  status  within  randomized treatment  groups.  Analyses  were  based  on  data  with  no  missing  imputation  rules  applied  unless specified otherwise.

## Data Handling Rules

Treatment failure rule will not be applied.

## Slotting for images taken outside of visit windows

All radiographs have to be taken within a protocol-specified window of ± 4 weeks of the baseline and ± 2  weeks  for  subsequent  visits  at  Week  24,  Week  52,  Week  104,  Week  184  and  Week  256  visits. Nominal visits will still be used if the images taken within ± 8 weeks of the scheduled visit date. The images that are taken outside ± 8 weeks of the scheduled visit date will be considered out-of-window, and the x-ray data will be set to missing for that scheduled visit.

## Early escape rule:

For subjects who meet early escape criteria at Week 16 in Groups I and II, their Week 24 values will still be used for Week 24 analysis, though these subjects have a change in their dose.

## Missing data imputation rules

· If both baseline and Week 24 total modified vdH-S scores are missing, the change from baseline in total modified vdH-S scores at Week 24 will be imputed with the median change from baseline in total modified vdH-S scores of all subjects in the same stratum at Week 24.

· If baseline total modified vdH-S score is missing, but data are available for 2 time points during the period from Week 0 to Week 24 (including any out-of-window or SC study agent discontinuation visit), the  total  modified  vdH-S  scores  at  these  2  time  points  will  be  linearly  extrapolated  to  impute  the missing score at baseline. If there is not enough data for linear extrapolation, then the change from baseline  in  total  modified  vdH-S  scores  at  Week  24  will  be  imputed  with  the  median  change  from baseline in total modified vdH-S scores of all subjects in the same stratum at Week 24.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· If Week 24 total modified vdH-S score is missing, but data are available for 2 time points during the period from Week 0 to Week 24 (including any out-of-window or SC study agent discontinuation visit), the  total  modified  vdH-S  scores  at  these  2  time  points  will  be  linearly  extrapolated  to  impute  the missing score at Week 24. If there is not enough data in period from Week 0 to Week 24, but data are available for 2 time points during the period from Week 24 to Week 52 (including any out-of-window or SC study agent discontinuation visit), the total modified vdH-S scores at these 2 time points will be linearly extrapolated to impute the missing score at Week 24. If there is not enough data for linear extrapolation in either periods, then the change from baseline in total modified vdH-S scores at Week 24 will be imputed with the median change from baseline in total modified vdH-S scores of all subjects in the same stratum at Week 24.

## Sensitivity analyses for structural damage

1. The first sensitivity analysis will be performed similarly to the co-primary analysis to assess the effect of considering only subjects who complete 24 Weeks of SC study agent administrations, did not miss any dose, and have no missing data either at baseline or Week 24.
2. The  second  sensitivity  analysis  will  be  performed  in  a  similar  manner  as  the  co-primary analysis to assess the effect of considering only subjects who do not meet the early escape criteria at Week 16.
3. The third sensitivity analysis was performed similarly to the co-primary analysis to assess the effect of using the 2 primary readers' scores only, even in the cases where adjudication was employed.

Further  to  the  above,  the  CHMP  noted  that  depending  on  the  actually  observed  pattern  of  missing values neither the primary analysis nor the sensitivity analyses are necessarily conservative. The need for additional alternative analyses is discussed below.

## Results

## Disposition of patients

Figure  2  shows  the  study  disposition  throughout  w  52.  Up  to  52  weeks  18,  18,  and  11  patients discontinued  study  treatment  in  the  placebo,  50  mg,  and  100  mg  group,  respectively.  Of  those randomised  to  placebo,  50  mg,  and  100  mg,  an  additional  7,  10,  and  8  patients,  respectively, discontinued study treatment between week 52 and 104. The reason for discontinuation is presented in Table 1.

The CHMP noted the modest number of discontinuations by week (104), in total 17%. There were no major differences between placebo and the approved 50 mg group, neither with respect to the amount of discontinuations nor the cause for discontinuation.

## Baseline Radiographic Characteristics

Baseline vdH-S scores were well balanced across all treatment groups with mean values ranging from 18.2 to 23.8 and median values ranging from 9.0 to 10.5 on a scale ranging from 0 to 528, indicating the presence of structural damage at baseline in this moderately to severely active PsA population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Primary results on structural damage (week 24)

A statistically significant difference was seen between golimumab and placebo in the primary analysis of change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp score at Week 24 (Table 2).

## Sensitivity analyses

Three sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score at Week 24. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the primary analysis (See Table 3 and 4 for the first two sensitivity analyses).

The  third  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  the  effect  of  not  using  adjudication.  In  the analysis  based  on  data  from  the  primary  readers  only,  results  similar  to  the  primary  results  was obtained.

The CHMP notes that a consistent statistically significant mean difference between golimumab 50 mg and  placebo  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  primary  analysis  and  the  sensitivity  analyses.  With  the similar pattern of missing values with respect to amount and cause there is no reason to believe that the observed differences are due to any substantial bias in favour of the placebo group. There was a tendency  that  patient  discontinued  earlier  in  the  placebo  group,  but  that  should  not  have  any disturbing  impact  on  the  imputation  of  missing  modified  vdHS  scores.  Thus  a  reliable  statistically significant  effect  of  golimumab  50  mg  on  structural  damage  has  been  demonstrated  at  week  24. However, the observed mean difference does not allow any assessment of clinical relevance.

## Subgroup Analyses

At Week 24, subgroup analyses were performed for the change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score  by  weight,  disease  characteristics,  geographic  location,  and  concomitant  medications  for  PsA. The subgroup results were consistent across golimumab treatment groups. Subgroup analyses were supportive of the primary endpoint analysis (Figure 3 and 4).

The CHMP noted that only in the polyarticular arthritis subgroup, any effect on total modified Sharp score is seen; i.e. it is the only group with progression in the placebo group, which is not unexpected based on the similarity of this subgroup with the RA population. This has also been evident for other anti-TNFs.

## Empirical Cumulative Distribution

Figure 5 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function plot through Week 24 summarizing the change in total modified vdH-S score from baseline in individual  subjects. The  plot  of  the  empirical cumulative distribution function shows that the curve of the placebo group is above that of both the golimumab 50 mg and 100 mg groups, especially in the right tail of the distribution indicating greater radiographic progression in the placebo group than in the golimumab groups.

The CHMP is of the opinion that although indicative of a positive effect on structural damage, 24 weeks is too short for a cumulative distribution plot to provide any useful information for discussing clinical relevance.

## Structural damage data by type of damage

The change from baseline in modified vdH-S score at Week 24 by type of damage (ie, erosion and JSN) is provided in Table 5.

Further to the above-data, the CHMP stated that the effect demonstrated on Modified vdHS Total score is  entirely  due  to  an  effect  on  erosion  score.  The  lack  of  effect  on  joint  space  narrowing  is  not unexpected in a study of 24 weeks duration.

## Responder analysis

There  were  more  patients  with  no  further  progression  of  structural  damage  at  week  24  in  the golimumab groups compared to the placebo group (Table 6).

The  CHMP  stated  that  in  a  study  with  placebo-controlled  phase  of  only  24  weeks  duration  the percentage  of  patients  with  no  further  deterioration  is  the  only  reasonable  responder  analysis  and found it not obvious why the analysis is not based on the number of randomised patients. However counting the excluded patients as non-responders would not change the results. This analysis gives

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

some indication that there is a number of patients that could have a clinically relevant beneficial effect on structural damage.

Includes subjects who early escaped at Week 16 or crossed over at Week 24 to receive golimumab 50 mg or dose escalated after Week 52 database lock to receive golimumab 100 mg-

Includes subjects who had at least one total modified vdH-S score post Week 52.

Includes subjects who early escaped at Week 16 or dose escalated after Week 52 database lock to receive golimumab 100 mg.

Missing imputation rules were applied.

The  lack  of  mean  difference  between  golimumab  and  placebo  is  proposed  to  be  explained  by  an imputed  change  from  baseline  of  78.6.  In  a  sensitivity  analysis  without  imputations  the  difference between 50 mg and placebo was consistent with the week 24 result.

The percentage of patients with no further progression at week 52 and 104 is presented in Table 8 and 9.

The CHMP noted that since all patients were treated with active treatment from week 24 no increasing effect  on  structural  damage  can  be  expected  at  week  52  and  104.  At  best  a  sustained  difference between  patients  initially  randomised  to  active  treatment  and  placebo  could  be  expected.  The explanation for the lack of mean difference between 50 mg and placebo (imputation of an extreme value) can be accepted by the CHMP in the light of the sensitivity analysis without imputations and the responder results (which are not sensitive to extreme values) in Table 8 and 9 showing that the 24 week responder rate at week 24 for the 50 mg dose is maintained at week 52 and 104. The observed increased responder rate in the initial placebo group must be due to a higher withdrawal rate among non-responders at week 24, since an initial no-responder cannot be expected to become a responder after switching to active treatment.

## Other endpoints at week 104

In this application the MAH applies for several additions to section 5.1 based on results from the open label  extension  part  of  this  study.  Only  results  related  to  the  proposed  additions  to  the  SPC  are addressed below; namely ACR 20/50/70 response, PASI75, HAQ and DAS28.

## ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Response After Week 52 Through Week 104

## Conclusions on clinical efficacy

The joint damage claim is based on newly submitted X-ray data from and the long-term extension of study  C0524T08.  The  effect  of  golimumab  on  progression  of  joint  damage  was  assessed  using  the Modified van der Heijde-Sharpe, which is considered to be a valid instrument for assessment of X-ray data,  and  has  been  used  in  other  applications  for  the  same  claim.  The  primary  X-ray  analysis  was undertaken by comparing 24 weeks placebo and golimumab results. Thereafter, all placebo subjects were  switched  to  active  treatment.  There  was  also  an  option  for  early  escape  after  16  weeks.  The study was well conducted with only 17% of patient discontinuing during 104 weeks and with no major difference in withdrawal pattern with respect to amount or cause.

Although the progression rate was limited in the placebo group due to the short duration (24 weeks), statistically significant differences in favour of active treatment was seen for mean change in Modified van der Heijde-Sharp score as well as for percentage of patients with no progression between baseline and  week  24    (78.8%  vs  62.7%  for  golimumab  and  placebo  respectively).  Considering  the  low withdrawal rate with no differential withdrawal pattern and consistent results in sensitivity analyses, there is no reason to question the robustness of these results.

Concerning  maintenance  of  effect  an  increasing  positive  effect  on  structural  damage  cannot  be expected in study C0524T08 since all patients were given active treatment from week 24. At best a sustained difference  between patients initially  randomised  to  active  treatment  and  placebo  could  be expected, and the percentage of patients with no progression between baseline and week 52 and week 104 was similar to the responder rate at week 24 for patients initially randomised to active treatment.

Although the data is too limited to fully evaluate the clinical long term relevance of the golimumab effects on structural damage in patients with psoriatic arthritis it can be concluded that a substantial number  of  patients  could  experience  beneficial  effects  on  joint  damage  progression.  It  is  further considered that essential support can be gained from RA, where more knowledge about joint damage progression is available.

Symmetric PsA shows greatest resemblance with RA, and in subgroup analyses performed by the MAH significant effects was observed in this PsA subtype only. This is consistent with experience from other anti-TNF  agents  for  which  an  effect  in  subjects  with  symmetrical  disease  has  been  shown,  while relevant effects in subjects with asymmetrical disease have been less convincing. Thus the claim on positive effects on structural damage has been restricted to the polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of PsA.

The MAH also applies for changes to section 5.1 of the SPC to include a number of endpoints. These changes are agreed for all except PASI75 data, which was not accepted to be included by the CHMP.

## Clinical safety

## Introduction

The  safety  data  presented  in  this  submission  focus  on  the  2-year  cumulative  safety  data  in  study C0524T08.  In addition,  available safety data are presented from other studies in rheumatologic and non-rheumatologic indications through the end of those studies or completed data base locks (DBLs), including a 2-year cut off in ongoing Phase 3 studies with SC golimumab in RA (C0524T05, C0524T06, C0524T11), and AS (C0524T09). The 2-year data in RA (three of these studies) have been submitted and reviewed within a recently ended procedure; II-08. Thus, the focus below will be data from T08. All data presented below are through week 104.

## Exposure:

In the Phase 3 PsA study with SC golimumab, there were 394 subjects treated with golimumab, with the vast majority (85.0%) of subjects treated for &gt;104 weeks. Through Week 100/104, there were similar numbers of subjects exposed to golimumab 50 mg and golimumab 100 mg (248 subjects and 227 subjects, respectively) with a similar average number of administrations in both groups (18.2 and 18.5,  respectively).  Most  subjects  received  golimumab  by  at  least  Week  24  (subjects  could  have entered early escape at Week 16 or crossed over to golimumab group from the placebo group before Week 24).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a result of this study design, the average duration of follow up for subjects in the placebo group (19.6  weeks)  was  substantially  shorter  than  the  average  duration  of  follow  up  for  subjects  in  the golimumab  treatment  groups  (75.1  weeks  and  76.3  weeks  for  the  golimumab  50  mg  and  100  mg groups,  respectively).  This  substantial  difference  in  exposure  to  placebo  and  golimumab  should  be taken into consideration when interpreting the data.

## All AEs:

AEs occurred in 61.1% of the placebo group, 78.2% of subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group and in 70.9% of subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group with similar types of AEs occurring with similar frequencies  in  the  golimumab  treatment  groups.  AEs  were  most  frequently  associated  with  the Infections  and  infestations  system-organ  class  with  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  being  the  most frequent infection occurring in 20.6% of the golimumab 50 mg group and 17.6% of the golimumab 100 mg group.

## Deaths:

There were 2 deaths that both occurred in the golimumab 50 mg group. One subject died due to a metastatic  small  cell  lung  carcinoma,  and  the  other  subject  died  due  to  a  climbing  accident.  The incidence per 100 subject-years follow up was 0.56 in the golimumab 50 mg group (confidence interval [CI]: 0.07, 2.02).

## All SAEs:

SAEs occurred in: Placebo: 7.1%, Golimumab 50 mg: 6.5%, Golimumab 100 mg: 7.9%, Combined Golimumab: 8.6%. SAEs were most frequently associated with the Infections and infestations system organ class and occurred in 3.5% (4 subjects) of subjects in the placebo group, 0.8% (2 subjects) of subjects  in  the  golimumab  50  mg  group,  1.3%  (3  subjects)  of  subjects  in  the  golimumab  100  mg group, and 1.3% (5 subjects) in the combined golimumab group.

## AEs leading to discontinuation:

AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 4.4% of subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group and 5.3% of subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group. AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent occurred most frequently in the Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) systemorgan  class  and  occurred  in  0.0%  (0  subjects)  of  the  placebo  group,  1.2%  (3  subjects)  of  the golimumab 50 mg group, and 2.2% (5 subjects) in the golimumab 100 mg group.

## Serious infections:

Rerious  infections  were  observed  in  1.2%  of  subjects  in  the  golimumab  50  mg  group  and  1.3%  of subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group with similar types of serious infections occurring with similar frequencies across the golimumab treatment groups. See Table 15 below

Received placebo with or witlhout MTX.

*Confidence intervals based on an exact method.

According to the CHMP, the large difference in duration of follow up should be considered, and thus these data are difficult to interpret. There were some cases of malignancy reported during the study, and  a  relation  to  treatment  cannot  be  excluded.  The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  product information and RMP address risk for malignancy adequately.

°C0524T08. Subjects may appear in more than one columm.

Prior to Week 104, received placebo with or without MTX.

The CHMP confirmed that the data on injection reactions do not raise any concerns.

## Serum sickness-like and anaphylactic reactions:

There were no serum sickness-like reactions or anaphylactic reactions.

## Clinically important hepatobiliary events:

There was 1 subject (0.9%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (0.3%) in the combined golimumab group who developed 1 or more clinically important hepatobiliary AEs. The same subject (C0524T08 5209-80378) had a clinically important hepatobiliary AE while receiving golimumab 50 mg and another clinically important hepatobiliary AE when receiving golimumab 100 mg.

## Markedly abnormal hematology or chemistry values:

There were few subjects with &gt; 1 markedly abnormal haematology value through Week 104. The most frequent changes included decreased absolute neutrophils which occurred in 0.0% (0 subjects) of the placebo  group,  0.8%  (2  subjects)  of  the  golimumab  50  mg  group,  and  3.8%  (8  subjects)  of  the golimumab 100 mg group. There were also  a  few  subjects  with  &gt;  1  markedly  abnormal  chemistry value through Week 104. The most frequent changes included elevated ALT/SGPT which occurred in 3.6% (4 subjects) of the placebo group, 2.8% (7 subjects) of the golimumab 50 mg group, 1.4% (3 subjects) of the golimumab 100 mg group, and 2.3% (9 subjects) of the combined golimumab group.

## Safety in Special Groups and Situations:

There were no meaningful differences observed with regard to safety based on baseline demographic characteristics (sex, weight, and race).

Of  the  8  subjects  who  were  positive  for  antibodies  to  golimumab  at  Week  52,  1  subject  (12.5%) remained  positive  at  Week  100  and  had  an  increased  antibody  titer.  Seven  subjects  changed  from positive  at  Week  52  to  negative  for  antibodies  at  Week  100.  All  subjects  who  were  negative  for antibodies to golimumab at Week 52 remained negative at Week 100.

## Conclusions on clinical safety

The MAH submitted long-term extension data from the open label study T08, which included data up to 2  years  of  treatment  of  PsA  patients  with  golimumab.  The  already  established  safety  profile  of golimumab is confirmed. Infections, including some serious and severe, occurred in association with golimumab treatment. There were in total 8 malignancies reported; all in golimumab treated subjects. The  large  difference  in  duration  of  follow  up  between  placebo  (19.6  weeks)  and  golimumab  (75-76 weeks)  groups  should  be  considered.  Thus,  these  data  are  difficult  to  interpret,  but  a  relation  to treatment  cannot  be  excluded.  The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  product  information  and  RMP address risk for malignancy adequately.

In summary, the safety profile of golimumab is comparable with that already well established for antiTNF agents. No new signals are identified.

## Risk Management Plan

A new version of the EU Risk Management Plan (v.4.O, dated 19 November 2010) has been submitted within  the  submission  of  the  PSUR#3  on  December 2, 2010 (eCTD sequence 0068). This document covers  both  the  PSUR  as  well  as  this  variation  application.  Based  on  the  data  included  in  this submission, no changes to the RMP are proposed. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-risk assessment

The  MAH  applies  to  add  wording  to  the  PsA  indication,  to  reflect  data  on  structural  joint  damage measured  by  X-ray.  Changes  to  section  5.1  are  also  proposed.  These  claims  are  based  on  newly submitted X-ray data from the long-term extension of study C0524T08. This study was the basis for the initial approval of PsA.

The  effect  of  golimumab  on  progression  of  joint  damage  was  assessed  using  the  Modified  van  der Heijde-Sharpe, which is considered to be a valid instrument for assessment of X-ray data, and has been used in other applications  for  the  same  claim.  The  primary  X-ray  analysis  was  undertaken  by comparing 24 weeks placebo and golimumab results. Thereafter, all placebo subjects were switched to active  treatment.  There  was  also  an  option  for  early  escape  after  16  weeks.  The  study  was  well conducted with only 17% of patient discontinuing during 104 weeks and with no major difference in withdrawal pattern with respect to amount or cause.

Although the progression rate was limited in the placebo group due to the short duration (24 weeks), statistically significant differences in favour of active treatment was seen for mean change in Modified van der Heijde-Sharp score as well as for percentage of patients with no progression between baseline and  week  24    (78.8%  vs  62.7%  for  golimumab  and  placebo  respectively).  Considering  the  low withdrawal rate with no differential withdrawal pattern and consistent results in sensitivity analyses, there is no reason to question the robustness of these results.

Concerning  maintenance  of  effect  an  increasing  positive  effect  on  structural  damage  cannot  be expected in study C0524T08 since all patients were given active treatment from week 24. At best a sustained difference  between patients initially  randomised  to  active  treatment  and  placebo  could  be expected, and the percentage of patients with no progression between baseline and week 52 and week 104 was similar to the responder rate at week 24 for patients initially randomised to active treatment.

Although the data is too limited to fully evaluate the clinical long term relevance of the golimumab effects on structural damage in patients with psoriatic arthritis it can be concluded that a substantial number  of  patients  could  experience  beneficial  effects  on  joint  damage  progression.  It  is  further considered that essential support can be gained from RA, where more knowledge about joint damage progression is available.

Symmetric PsA shows greatest resemblance with RA, and in subgroup analyses performed by the MAH significant effects was observed in this PsA subtype only. This is consistent with experience from other anti-TNF  agents  for  which  an  effect  in  subjects  with  symmetrical  disease  has  been  shown,  while relevant effects in subjects with asymmetrical disease have been less convincing. Thus the claim on positive effects on structural damage has been restricted to the polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of PsA.

The  MAH  also  applies  for  changes  to  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  to  include  number  of  endpoints.  The inclusion of PASI75 data was not agreed by the CHMP.

With respect to safety, the MAH has submitted long-term extension data from the open label study T08, which  included  data  up  to  2  years  of  treatment  of  PsA  patients  with  golimumab.  The  already established safety profile of  golimumab is confirmed. Infections, including some serious and severe, occurred in association with golimumab treatment. There were in total 8 malignancies reported; all in golimumab treated subjects. The large difference in duration of follow up between placebo (19.6 weeks) and golimumab (75-76 weeks) groups should be considered. Thus, these data are difficult to interpret, but  a  relation  to  treatment  cannot  be  excluded.  The  product  information  and  RMP  address  risk  for malignancy, as well as the other well-established safety concerns related to treatment with an anti-TNF agent  adequately.  Thus,  the  safety  profile  of  golimumab  is  comparable  with  that  already  well established for anti-TNF agents. No new signals are identified.

The benefit-risk balance for Simponi is positive in this new indication. Furthermore, the submitted data do not modify the current benefit-risk balance.
