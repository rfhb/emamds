| C.I.13                 | C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | Type II | None               |
| C.I.4                  | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                             | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order update the safety and efficacy information following conclusion of studies MCL 3001 and CLL 3001. Update of Annex II to remove the obligation to submit final CSR of study MCL 3001. The Package Leaflet and RMP are updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) introduced minor editorial changes throughout the PI.

Submission of final CSRs for studies MCL 2001 and 1117 in fulfilment of post-authorisation measures; in addition to the above trials, data from 2 other trials are included in support of the use of ibrutinib in combination with other agents in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.

The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

On 26 April 2012, Imbruvica was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/984. Imbruvica was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Following the assessment of the data presented in this variation, the CHMP adopted a new indication and a revision of the existing indications, which falls within the above mentioned orphan designations.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is covered by a class waiver.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, potent, orally administered, covalently binding inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). It is authorized in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with:

- -relapsed or refractory MCL based on the Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study with ibrutinib 560 mg/day (Study 1104) ;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -CLL who have received at least 1 prior therapy, and as a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL, -  based on the Phase 3, open-label, randomized monotherapy study in which subjects received either ibrutinib 420 mg/day or ofatumumab (Study 1112) and on the Phase 3 open-label randomized monotherapy study in which previously untreated subjects received either ibrutinib or chlorambucil.
- -WM who have received at least 1 prior therapy or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy - based on the Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study with ibrutinib 420 mg/day (Study 1118E).

The Applicant has been requested to provide the final clinical study reports (CSR) for Studies; PCI32765MCL3001 (MCL3001), PCI-32765MCL2001 (MCL2001), PCYC-1117-CA (1117) and PCI32765CLL3001 (CLL3001);  These additional studies were performed in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL and CLL,  in order to fulfil post authorisation measures and Annex II obligations.

Studies in this application include the first randomized Phase 3 study of ibrutinib monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study MCL3001) and the first randomized Phase 3 study of ibrutinib in combination with chemoimmunotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL (Study CLL3001). Phase 2 studies in subjects with relapsed or refractory MCL (Study MCL2001) and relapsed or refractory CLL with del17p (Study 1117) are also included in this submission. In addition, data from 2 studies supportive of the use of ibrutinib combination therapy are also presented (Studies 1108 and 1109).

Based on the results of these studies changes have been proposed to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. In Annex II, the PCI-32765MCL3001 study has been deleted from the list of post-authorisation obligations. In addition the Applicant has taken the opportunity to make minor editorial amendments to the SmPC. The revised RMP version 5.1 has been included in the submission.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The previously available population pharmacokinetic model (included in original MAA) was updated with data from the studies included in this submission. The updated population pharmacokinetic analysis was submitted through a separate procedure (variation II/20).

Systemic exposure data, collected using a sparse sampling scheme in all studies included in this submission, showed substantial overlap of observed and predicted exposure values based on the previous population pharmacokinetic model, indicating that the pharmacokinetic behaviour was consistent with the previous assessments.

In study CLL3001 (a phase 3 combination study with bendamustine and rituximab), sparse pharmacokinetic samples were collected at selected sites to assess whether there was an effect of ibrutinib on the pharmacokinetic profiles of bendamustine or rituximab. The pharmacokinetic report from this study was submitted separately (variation II/20). In this study, the systemic exposure of rituximab was higher in subjects receiving ibrutinib compared to those receiving placebo. Pre-dose serum concentrations were on average 2- to 3-fold higher in the first three cycles and 1.17- to 1.71-fold higher in the subsequent cycles.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

After assessment of the primary MAA, there were some remaining uncertainties regarding the potential of ibrutinib to induce CYP1A2.  As part of a relevant post authorisation measure, the MAH submitted a new in vitro induction study indicating no potential for induction of CYP1A2. The data from study CLL3001 showed no effect of ibrutinib on bendamustine, a CYP1A2 substrate, at 1, 2, 3 and 4-8 hr post-dose. Although it is unclear whether bendamustine is sensitive to CYP1A2 induction in vivo (no interaction data of bendamustine with a known inducer appears to be published), the data from CLL3001 does not contradict the conclusion from the in vitro study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

An assessment of the pharmacokinetic data from the studies included in this submission was performed as a separate variation II/20.

It is agreed that the effect of ibrutinib treatment on rituximab concentrations is likely not a drug-drug interaction but might possibly be a secondary effect due to increased response and thereby lower targetmediated clearance of rituximab in the ibrutinib arm. Therefore, no change to section 4.5 of the SmPC on the effect of ibrutinib on rituximab is required.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

In conclusion, the updated population pharmacokinetic analysis and the analysis of the interaction with bendamustine/rituximab do not affect previous conclusions on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics, dose adjustments or interaction potential. Therefore, the SmPC remains unchanged with regards to the clinical pharmacology aspects.

Iniotigator-awowed

Pivotal study PCI-32765CLL3001: Randomized (1:1), Double-blind, Multicenter (21 countries, 133 centres), Placebo-controlled Study of Ibrutinib, in Combination with Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR) in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Main eligibility criteria:

- Relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL,
- Active disease according to IWCLL,
- EGOG 0, 1
- Measurable nodal disease (CT)
- ANC ≥ 1
- Platelet ≥50
- Adequate hepatic (ALT/AST ≤ 2.5 XULN, total bil. ≤1.5 x ULN
- Renal function (creatinine ≤2 ULN, GFR ≥ 40 ml/min)

## Excluding:

- del.17p
- prior bendamustine if need for retreatment within 24 months,
- prior ibrutinib (or other BTK inhibitor).
- Planned stem cell transplantation,
- CNS involvement
- Richter's transformation
- Anti-vitamin K
- Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Six cycles of BR + ibrutinib (420 mg) or placebo, followed by ibrutinib or placebo until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Cross-over was introduced by amendment INT-3, after IRC confirmed PD.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint: PFS

## Secondary endpoints:

- overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) + partial response (PR) + nodular partial response [nPR]),
- overall survival (OS),
- rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative remissions,
- improvement in hematologic parameters (hemoglobin, neutrophil, platelet count),
- improvement of disease-related symptoms (fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fever, and abdominal discomfort due to splenomegaly), patient-reported outcomes (PRO),
- pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib and to explore the potential relationships between ibrutinib metrics of exposure with relevant clinical or biomarker information,  biomarkers related to B-cell receptor (BCR) and compensatory signaling pathways and to explore their association with resistance to ibrutinib treatment.

The order of these endpoints were as follows: ORR, OS, MRD negative rate, time to improvement in FACT fatigue score, rate of sustained hemoglobin improvement, rate of sustained platelet improvement.

## Randomisation

Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive BR + ibrutinib vs BR + placebo

Participants were stratified by 1 prior vs. &gt;1 prior line of therapy, purine analogue refractory yes vs. no.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was double blind

## Statistical methods

Interim analysis planned after 171 events (in 289+289 patients).

## Numbers analysed

Study period: September 2012 - January 2015 (data cut-off)

## Outcomes and estimation

The DMC conducted a formal interim analysis with 239 PFS events by IRC that represented 70% of the planned total number of events (interim was originally planned for 50% of events). As a result,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the stopping guideline was updated for efficacy (1-sided p-value of 0.007). The Sponsor Steering Committee was notified that the pre-specified statistical boundary for early stopping was crossed (p-value &lt;0.0001 for the primary endpoint PFS). The DMC recommended unblinding the study.

b P-value is from a log-rank test stratified by two randomization stratification factors: refractory to purine analog therapy (yes or no) and number of prior lines of therapy (1 or &gt;1).

* Hazard ratio is from a stratified proportional hazards model. A hazard ratio &lt; 1 favors ibrutinib.

Note: Progression-free survivalis defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death, whichever is first reported. Subjects without well-documented disease progression or death at the time of analysis are censored at the date of last adequate disease assessment on study. Subjects with no baseline or any on study tumor assessments are censored atrandomization.

## Ancillary analyses

## Disease-related Symptoms

There were no overall clinically relevant shifts in disease-related symptoms (fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fever, and abdominal discomfort due to splenomegaly, anorexia)

## Immunoglobulin Effects

No clinically meaningful differences in IgA, IgG and IgM) were observed between the treatment groups.

## Patient-reported Outcomes

During the Treatment Phase, the overall compliance rates for each of the patient-reported outcomes measured (FACIT-Fatigue, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL 16, and EQ-5D-

5L) were acceptable with &lt;10% missing at most time points administered.

Mean summary scores for the FACIT-fatigue, EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL 16 Individual Items, and EQ-5D-5L utility values and visual analogue scale scores were similar for each treatment group at baseline.

No notable mean changes from baseline over time were observed in the scores within or between the treatment groups. Times to improvement and deterioration in patient-reported outcome scores were similar for each treatment group.

[1] A DLT observation period was not utilized for Group 3.

MAH's conclusions: The study results indicate that ibrutinib, when administered at an oral dose of 420 mg/day in combination with a standard regimen of ofatumumab, was well tolerated and highly active (ORR 81.7% across the three dosing sequences) in this study for subjects with heavily pre-treated relapsed or refractory CLL, SLL, PLL, or RT. With the exception of a higher rate of peripheral sensory neuropathy, the observed safety profile of the combined treatment regimen is consistent with the individual profiles of ibrutinib and ofatumumab. Most subjects (76.1%) continued ibrutinib treatment in a long-term extension study.

## Study 1117

A Single-arm, Multicenter Phase 2 Study of Ibrutinib 420 mg daily in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma with 17p Deletion.

A total of 144 subjects received at least 1 dose of ibrutinib and represents the analysis set for both efficacy and safety in this study (ie, all treated population).

Primary Endpoint - The ORR per IRC assessment was 63.9% with 95% CI (55.8%, 71.3%).

Duration of Response: At the time of data cut, 83.7% of responders were alive and did not have disease progression; the estimated median DOR per IRC was 13.2 months (95% CI: 13.2, NE).

## Methods

## Study participants

Key inclusion criteria

- 18 years of age or older.
- Diagnosis of MCL reviewed and approved by central pathology laboratory prior to randomization: diagnosis report from local laboratory must include morphology and expression of either cyclin D1 in association with one B-cell marker (eg, CD19, CD20, or PAX5) and CD5 or evidence of t(11;14) as assessed by cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or polymerase chain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reaction (PCR); if report from local laboratory is not available, diagnosis must be confirmed by central pathology laboratory based on the criteria above

- Received at least 1 prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen. Separate lines of therapy are defined as single or combination therapies that are either separated by disease progression or by a &gt; 6 month treatment-free interval.
- Documented relapse or disease progression following the last anti-MCL treatment.
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status Score 0 or 1.
- Hematology values within the following limits: ANC ≥1000/mm3 independent of growth factor support; Platelets ≥75,000/mm3 or ≥50,000/mm3 if bone marrow involvement independent of transfusion support; Hemoglobin level ≥ 8 g/dL independent of transfusion support

## Notable exclusion criteria

- Had a history of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to first dose of study drug.
- Required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists or treatment with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor.

## Treatments

Subjects randomized to Treatment A received 560 mg oral ibrutinib once daily continuously during the 21-day cycle.

Subjects randomized to Treatment B received temsirolimus IV infusion 175 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of the first cycle followed by 75 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle.

Treatment on both arms continued until disease progression (or relapse if the subject achieved a CR), or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first.

## Objectives

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Endpoints

Primary endpoint : PFS assessed by IRC and performed on the ITT population. The IRC was blinded to study treatment assignment, and both the IRC and the site performed disease evaluations according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007).

Disease evaluations included CT, MRI, PET, and clinical evaluation performed every 9 weeks for up to 15 months from the start of study drug, and every 24 weeks thereafter. Whole body FDG-PET scan (skull base to the proximal femur) will be done at Screening. For subjects who are PET-positive at baseline, PET will be done at the time of maximal tumor reduction (eg, CR or PR with 2 consecutive CT scans showing no further tumor reduction). In addition, PET will be performed at suspected disease progression, if a new lesion was detected on CT.

Key secondary endpoints: ORR, OS, 1-year survival rate, duration of response, time to response, time to next treatment, and time to worsening in the Lym subscale of the FACT-Lym.

Important exploratory endpoint : PFS2 (defined as the time interval between the date of randomization to the date of an event, defined as progressive disease as assessed by the investigator after the next line of subsequent therapy, death from any cause, or start of the second line of subsequent therapy if no disease progression is noted).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

## Key statistical elements

Open design, central 1:1 randomisation stratified by the number of prior lines of therapy (1 or 2 versus ≥ 3) and simplified MCL international prognostic index (MIPI; low risk [0-3]; versus intermediate risk [4-5]; versus high risk [6-11]).

The study was planned to enroll approximately 280 subjects (about 140 subjects to each arm) to observe 178 PFS events at the primary analysis. Assuming 57% improvement in median PFS of the ibrutinib arm over the temsirolimus arm (a hazard ratio of 0.64 for the ibrutinib relative to temsirolimus arm, under the exponential distribution assumption, or for example, an improvement in median PFS from 7 months to 11 months), with 178 events the study has at least 85% power to achieve a statistical significance level of 2.5% (1-sided).

Statistical hypothesis testing for secondary endpoints was performed in a hierarchical manner with an alpha level of 0.05 in the order of ORR, OS, time to next treatment, and time to worsening in the Lym subscale of the FACT-Lym assessment.

The end of study is defined as when 80% of the randomized subjects died, or 3 years after the last subject was randomized, or the sponsor terminates the study, whichever comes first.

## Time to worsening in the Lym subscale of FACT-Lym

Worsening was defined by a 5-point decrease from baseline. The overall compliance rates for the patientreported outcomes measured (FACT-Lym and EQ-5D-5L) were &lt;10% missing at most time points administered. The temsirolimus arm showed a lower compliance rate (by 5 to 10% compared with the ibrutinib arm) at most timepoints. The most common reason for the lower compliance rate was 'administrative failure'. Mean summary scores were similar for each treatment arm at baseline.

## Supportive studies

## 2.4.2.1. Study PCI-32765MCL2001; Phase 2, single arm

'A Phase 2, Multicenter, Single-Arm Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Single- Agent Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitor, Ibrutinib, in Subjects With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Who Progress After Bortezomib Therapy'

Study period : Study initiated: 17 July 2012; Clinical cutoff: 29 April 2014; Database lock: 20 June 2014. Note, a CSR addendum representing the final analysis at study closure (31 May 2015, the last subject, last visit date) has been provided, including further investigator-assessed data only. Patients on ibrutinib treatment at study closure could be enrolled in the CAN3001 extension study.

Study centers : Belgium (n=1 study center), France (n=2), Israel (n=6), Poland (n=1), Russia (n=4), United Kingdom (n=2), and United States (n=22).

## Key inclusion criteria

- Diagnosis of MCL confirmed by central review prior to enrollment.
- Received at least 1 prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen.

Ibrutinib

Temsirolimus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Received at least 2 cycles of bortezomib therapy (single-agent or in combination) and had documented progressive disease during or after bortezomib therapy based on Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. Documentation of progressive disease after bortezomib therapy must have been reviewed and approved by the Sponsor prior to the first dose of study drug.
- At least 1 measurable site of disease according to Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 0, 1, or 2.

## Notable exclusion criteria

- More than 5 prior lines of therapy (separate lines of therapy were defined as single or combination therapies that were either separated by disease progression or by a &gt;6 month treatment-free interval).
- History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug.
- Required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K

## Study medication

Ibrutinib 560 mg orally once per day continuously during 21-day treatment cycles.

## Endpoints

Primary endpoint : ORR, defined as the proportion of evaluable subjects who achieved CR or PR as assessed by the IRC based upon the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma.

Disease evaluations included CT, MRI, PET, and clinical evaluation performed every 9 weeks for up to 15 months from the start of study drug, and every 24 weeks thereafter. Whole body FDG-PET scan (skull base to the proximal femur) will be done at Screening. For subjects who are PET-positive at baseline, PET will be done at the time of maximal tumor reduction (eg, CR or PR with 2 consecutive CT scans showing no further tumor reduction). In addition, PET will be performed at suspected disease progression, if a new lesion was detected on CT.

Key secondary endpoints: Time to initial response/best response for subjects who achieved CR/PR, duration of response, PFS as determined by the IRC, OS.

## Key statistical elements

Single arm design. The sample size for this study was based on the assumption that the ORR for ibrutinib would be 56%, which was the lowest observed response rate in all subgroups analyzed from the then ongoing Phase 2 study, PCYC-1104-CA. With 101 evaluable subjects, the study was expected to have 90% power to declare that ORR was 40% or higher at the 1-sided significance level of 0.025. No interim analysis. The final analysis for ORR was to be conducted using a clinical cutoff date approximately 1 year after enrollment of the last subject. End of study occurred approximately 2 years after the last subject was enrolled.

With amendment INT-2 (28 August 2013; 120 subjects = fully enrolled), the clinical cutoff for the primary analysis was changed from 6 months to approximately 1 year after the last subject was enrolled.

The ORR by investigator assessment of the response-evaluable population was 66.4% (95% CI: 57.5%, 75.2%) with a CR rate of 18.2% (95% CI: 11.0%, 25.4%). The overall concordance between IRC and investigator assessments of ORR was 90.0%. At the final analysis by investigator, with a median followup of 26.7 months, ORR was unchanged but the fraction of patients with CR had increased to 24.5%.

The ORR by IRC assessment of the all-treated population (n=120) was 57.5% (95% CI: 48.7%, 66.3%), which included a CR rate of 19.2% (95% CI: 12.1%, 26.2%).

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The median/mean ages at enrolment were 64/64 and about 30% of patients were &gt;70 years of age. The efficacy of ibrutinib in patients previously treated for CLL were further evaluated in a randomised, multicenter, double-blinded phase 3 study of IMBRUVICA in combination with BR versus placebo + BR (Study CLL3001). Patients (n = 578) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily or placebo in combination with BR until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. All patients received BR for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. Bendamustine was dosed at 70 mg/m 2  infused IV over 30 minutes on Cycle 1, Days 2 and 3, and on Cycles 2-6, Days 1 and 2 for up to 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m 2  in the first cycle, Day 1, and 500 mg/m 2 Cycles 2 through 6, Day 1. Ninety patients randomised to placebo + BR crossed over to receive IMBRUVICA following IRC confirmed progression. The median age was 64 years (range, 31 to 86 years), 66% were male, and 91% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 6 years and the median number of prior treatments was 2 (range, 1 to 11 treatments). At baseline, 56% of patients had at least one tumour ≥ 5 cm, 26% had del11q.

CLL3001 enrolled patients with R/R CLL/SLL. About 50% of patients had received one line of prior therapy and about 25% were refractory to purine analogues. Due to the selected background therapy, patients with del.17p positive CLL/SLL were excluded.

The supportive Study 1108 provides supportive single arm evidence as regards the activity and safety of ibrutinib as add-on to BR. Study 1109, exploring the combination ofatumumab and ibrutinib, is of minor relevance for this submission whilst the single arm, monotherapy study 1117 provides further confirmation of the efficacy of ibrutinib in case of CLL with del 17p.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Submitted data refer to an interim analysis conducted at a PFS event rate about 20 and 60%, i.e. at a higher event rate than originally planned for. Expressed as PFS HRs the treatment difference was about 0.02 at a p-value &lt;0.001. The main difference in terms of PFS events was observed after end of induction therapy.

The reported ORRs (IRC) were 83% vs. 68%, p-value &lt;0.0001.

At event rates of 9% and 14%, there is a trend towards improved survival HR 0.63, p-value 0.06.

An increase in MRD negativity was reported in the experimental arm, 13% vs. 5% p-value 0.001 (to be viewed as exploratory due to hierarchical testing procedure).

The interim analysis was conducted at a low event rate in the ibrutinib arm, meaning that the stability of the PFS event curve is ill defined. Based on prior monotherapy studies, however, it is accepted that ibrutinib show durable responses. A formal issue is that the interim was conducted at a higher event rate than planned (OC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Submitted subgroup analyses are compatible with consistent add-on activity, but the low event rate in the ibrutinib arm undermines firm conclusions. ORR data grouped according to the co-variates used in the PFS subgroup analyses might provide some insights as regards possible heterogeneity (OC).

The main difference between study arms develops during the maintenance phase comparing ibrutinib in mono-therapy with placebo. This means that events of PD have different meaning in the two study arms. A PFS2 analysis has therefore been submitted. The event rates in this analysis were as expected low, 10 vs. 17%, HR 0.53, p-value 0.006 (exploratory). Based on the results of the interim analysis, the DMC recommended unblinding of the study

At this stage OS data cannot be used to support conclusions as regards long term benefit. The study was also opened to cross-over to ibrutinib in January 2014 when all patients were enrolled.

The prognostic value of MRD negativity relies on data  from patients who have been off therapy for some months. Its value in patients on therapy is non-established. A comparison of ORR including MRD negativity after end of induction therapy might nevertheless be informative (OC) about the value of ibrutinib during the induction phase.

## Mantle Cell Lymphoma studies

The final CSRs for study MCL3001 and MCL2001 have been provided in support of the current indication as foreseen at the time of the approval and agreed as part of the post- authorisation programme of ibrutinib in r/r MCL.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The efficacy of ibrutinib in MCL was further studied in a randomised phase 3, open-label, multicenter study including 280 patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy (Study MCL3001). Patients (n=280) were randomised 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA orally at 560 mg once daily for 21 days or temsirolimus intravenously at 175 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of the first cycle followed by 75 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 of each subsequent 21-day cycle. Treatment on both arms continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 68 years (range, 34; 88), 74% were male and 87% were Caucasian. The median time since diagnosis was 43 months, and median number of prior treatments was 2 (range: 1 to 9 treatments), including 51% with prior high-dose chemotherapy, 18% with prior bortezomib, 5% with prior lenalidomide, and 24% with prior stem cell transplant. At baseline, 53% of patients had bulky disease (≥ 5 cm), 21% had high-risk score by Simplified MIPI, 60% had extranodal disease and 54% had bone marrow involvement at screening. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) criteria.

MCL2001 was a Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study in r/r MCL after at least one prior rituximabcontaining chemotherapy regimen and documented PD after at least 2 cycles of single-agent or combination bortezomib therapy (n=120).

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the MCL3001 study, PFS by IRC, the primary outcome measure, showed a HR of 0.43 in favour of the ibrutinib arm, p&lt;0.0001, with mature data in the temsirolimus arm (79%). The median PFS was 14.6 (10.4, NE) months in the ibrutinib arm compared to 6.2 (4.2, 7.9) months in the temsirolimus arm. Sensitivity analyses and secondary outcomes, as well as PFS2, were all supportive.

A smaller proportion of patients treated with ibrutinib experienced a clinically meaningful worsening of lymphoma symptoms versus temsirolimus (27% versus 52%) and time to worsening of symptoms occurred more slowly with ibrutinib versus temsirolimus (HR 0.27, p &lt; 0.0001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the MCL2001 study, ORR by IRC, the primary outcome measure, was 63% for the response-evaluable population, with a CR rate of 21%, and 57% for the all-treated population. At the final analysis by investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, ORR was unchanged but the fraction of patients with CR had increased from 18% at the time of the cut-off for the primary analysis to 24.5%. At the primary cutoff and with 33% events the median DOR by IRC was approximately 15 months. At the final analysis by investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, DOR had increased from 12.9 months at the time of the primary analysis to 21.3 months.

Looking at activity in terms of response rates with ibrutinib across the MCL studies, the ORR was 72% in MCL3001 (vs 40.4 % in the temsirolimus arm), 63% in MCL2001 and 68% in 1104.

Inspection of the KM curve for PFS in study MCL3001 reveals a slightly higher event rate in the ibrutinib arm vs the temsirolimus arm for the first approximately 2 months and a separate analysis for the first 3 months, with PD and deaths addressed separately, was provided.

A smaller proportion of patients treated with ibrutinib experienced a clinically meaningful worsening of lymphoma symptoms versus temsirolimus (27% versus 52%) and time to worsening of symptoms occurred more slowly with ibrutinib versus temsirolimus (HR 0.27, p &lt; 0.0001). The rationale for the definition of clinically meaningful worsening in the Lym subscale of the FACT-Lym assessment as a 5point decrease from baseline in the MCL3001 study was justified.

Due to small subject numbers in several groups and the uncontrolled setting in MCL2001, subgroup data should be interpreted with caution. The analyses may, however, indicate a potentially lower activity in high risk disease and in blastoid histology.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The results of the submitted study CLL3001 demonstrate the efficacy of ibrutinib as add-on to the rituximab - bendamustine regimen as PFS favoured the ibrutinib arm with a HR for PFS estimated at 0.2 [95% CI; 0.15, 0.28] (median PFS not reached for ibrutinib arm). As the studies supporting the CLL indication granted at the time of the Marketing Authorisation included use of ibrutinib as single agent, the CLL indication is extended to the use of ibrutinib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR).

The results from the MCL studies submitted, confirm the efficacy of ibrutinib in the approved indication of MCL as PFS with ibrutinib was 14.6 (10.4, NE) as compared to 6.2 (4.2, 7.9) months in the temsirolimus group with HR of 0.43 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.58].

Study resuts were included under section 5.1 of the SmPC. The indication section was revised to include the combination of ibrutinib with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy and to specify where appropriate the use of ibrutinib as a single agent.

Note: A subject with multiple severity ratings for a given AE was counted only once under the maximum toxicity grade. Adverse events are presented by descending frequency of PT for Ibrutinib; those with the same frequency are presented alphabetically.

## Deaths - Study PCI-32765CLL3001

There were altogether 19 (6.6%, ibrutinib) and 18 TEAE (6.3%, placebo arm) with an outcome of death.

Apart from 2 cases of MDS in the ibrutinib arm all were single reports. There was one case of ventricular flutter and one case of sudden death.

In the placebo arm, two cases of PD were reported as TEAE leading to death (vs. 1 in the ibrutinib arm). With respect to infections 7 cases (sepsis 3, septic shock 1, febrile neutropenia 1, bronchopneumonia 1, pneumonia 1).

Note: A subject with multiple severity ratings for a given AE was counted only once under the maximum toxicity grade. Note: Major hemorhage includes serious or grade &gt;= 3 hemorrhage and CNS hemorrhage at any grade among bleeding events identified by haemorrhage SMQ excluding laboratory terms.

Subjects with missing toxicity grades are included in the All Grades column but not shown separately.

Adverse events are presented by descending frequency of PT within All Grades for Ibrutinib; those with the same frequency are presented alphabetically.

No major haemorrhagic events resulted in a dose reduction, but 3 events in the ibrutinib+BR treatment group (uterine haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, and haematochezia) were managed with a drug interruption and 1 event (haemoptysis) in the placebo+BR treatment group; and 2 events in the ibrutinib+BR treatment group and none in the placebo+BR treatment group led to treatment discontinuation (haemorrhage intracranial and haemorrhagic stroke).

## Hepatic Adverse Events - Study PCI-32765CLL3001

TEAEs in the SOC of Hepatobiliary Disorders of any grade were reported for 3.8% of subjects in the ibrutinib+BR treatment group and 4.2% of subjects in the placebo+BR treatment group. Grade 3 or 4 events were reported for 6 (2.1%) subjects in the ibrutinib+BR treatment group; no events were fatal.

In the placebo+BR treatment group, 4 (1.4%) subjects had Grade 3 or 4 events; and 1 subject had fatal hepatobiliary events (cholestasis and hepatocellular injury).

Of the 15 subjects in the ibrutinib arm who were reported with a TEAE leading to death, 6 subjects had progressive disease as their primary cause of death and are counted in that category in Table 22. Of the 11 subjects in the temsirolimus arm who were reported with a TEAE leading to death, 3 subjects had progressive disease as their primary cause of death and are counted in that category in Table 22.

During the first 6 months of treatment, 8 subjects (5.8%) in the ibrutinib arm and 11 subjects (7.9%) in the temsirolimus arm had a TEAE with an outcome of death. When adjusted for exposure differences between the treatment arms, the incidence rate for TEAEs leading to death was 0.811 per 100 patientmonths for the ibrutinib arm and 1.299 for the temsirolimus arm.

The 4 patients with multiorgan failure noted in the ibrutinib arm were all assessed with progressive disease concurrently or immediately prior to the multi-organ failure event.

For the pleural effusion cases, 2 subjects had a concurrent infection (1 pneumonia, 1 tuberculosis) and the other subject had a history of ' pleurisy ' and tuberculosis with no clear etiology for the event. All subjects resumed treatment for at least 6 months with the pleural effusion event reported as recovered/resolved.

## · Ocular events

Serious Grade 3-4 events were reported for 2 subjects in the ibrutinib arm (1 subject with diabetic retinopathy and 1 subject with vitreous hemorrhage) and 1 subject in the temsirolimus arm with cataract.

The EAIR for the Eye disorder SOC was 1.919 events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 3.403 events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus arm. The EAIR for conjunctivitis was 0.968 events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 0.878 events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus arm.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (all grades) from the Eye disorders SOC were reported for 17 subjects (12.2%) from each treatment arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment. Conjunctivitis was reported for 11 subjects (7.9%) in the ibrutinib arm and for 5 subjects (3.6%) in the temsirolimus arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment.

- Hypertension

The EAIR for hypertension were 0.571 events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 0.614 events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus arm.

Hypertension was reported for 6 subjects (4.3%) in the ibrutinib arm and for 3 subjects (2.2%) in the temsirolimus arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment.

- Hepatic AEs

Three subjects (2.2%) in the ibrutinib treatment arm met the laboratory criteria for potential druginduced liver injury (DILI) based on ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin laboratory abnormalities (Hy's Law). However, one event occurred in the setting of septic shock and disease progression, and one in the context of hepatitis B reactivation (day 340, 11 days after the last dose of ibrutinib) with obviously negative rechallenge. No clear alternative aetiology is reported for the 3 rd event but the patient had a negative rechallenge.

The EAIR for the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC was 0.338 events per 100 patient-months for the ibrutinib arm and 0.478 events per 100 patient-months for the temsirolimus arm.

Treatment-emergent adverse events from the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC were reported for 4 subjects (2.9%) from the ibrutinib arm and for 3 subjects (2.2%) from the temsirolimus arm during the first 6 months of drug treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- AEs in relation to age (&lt;65 versus ≥65 years)

The incidences of any grade TEAE, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and TEAEs leading to death were similar (&lt;10% difference) between the age groups for both the ibrutinib and temsirolimus treatment arms.

For the ibrutinib arm, incidences were higher (&gt;10% difference) for subjects ≥ 65 years for Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs (72.1% versus 60.4%), any serious TEAE (52.3% versus 41.5%), and drug-related serious TEAEs (25.6% versus 13.2%).

- Treatment-related lymphocytosis

Treatment-related lymphocytosis was reported for 52 subjects (38.2%) in the ibrutinib arm and for 31 subjects (22.6%) in the temsirolimus arm. The median time to lymphocytosis was 3.14 weeks for subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 2.86 weeks in the temsirolimus arm. Most events in the ibrutinib arm resolved (43 of the 52 subjects) with a median duration of 6.14 weeks.

## TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation - Study MCL3001

TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 12.9% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 29.5% of subjects in the temsirolimus arm. Serious TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 8.6% of subjects in the ibrutinib arm and 14.4% of subjects in the temsirolimus arm.

TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation in more than one patient were thrombocytopenia (3) abdominal pain (2) and pneumonia (2) in the ibrutinib arm, and fatigue (7), thrombocytopenia (4), pneumonitis (4), neutropenia (3), oedema peripheral (3), asthenia (3), pneumonia (2), confusional state (2), decreased appetite (2), mucosal inflammation (2), pyrexia (2) and rash (2) in the temsirolimus arm.

## TEAEs leading to dose reduction - Study MCL3001

TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported for 3.6% of patients on the ibrutinib arm and 43.2% of patients on the temsirolimus arm. In the ibrutinib arm, no event was reported in more than 1 patient.

## Exposure-adjusted Incidence Rates - Study MCL3001

An exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) analysis was performed to explore the influence of differences in drug exposure (median exposures: ibrutinib arm = 14.39 months; temsirolimus arm = 3.02 months) in summarising TEAEs that occurred up to 30 days from the last dose of study drug. An EAIR is reported as the incidence rate per 100 patient-months at risk.

Key: EAIR = exposure-adjusted incidence rate; TEAE= treatment-emergent adverse event; TESAE= treatment-emergent serious adverse event

* Patient-months at risk is the sum of the exposure times at the occurrence of the first TEAE for each subject. A patient's duration of exposure is given either by the time when the event has occurred (non-censored data), or by the total duration of treatment if the patient does not show the adverse event in question (censored data).

b EAIR represents the number of subjects with the event divided by 100 patient-months at risk for that event. If a patient has multipleoccurrencesofanevent,thepatientiscountedonlyonceinthenumerator.

The most frequently reported SOCs by EAIR (per 100 patient-months) were Infections and infestations (ibrutinib: 11.68 all grades, 1.64 Grade ≥ 3; temsirolimus: 30.34 all grades, 5.69 Grade ≥ 3), Gastrointestinal disorders (ibrutinib: 8.19 all grades, 0.79 Grade ≥ 3; temsirolimus: 33.36 all grades, 3.38 Grade ≥ 3), General disorders and administration site conditions (ibrutinib: 6.62 all grades, 0.84 Grade ≥ 3; temsirolimus: 26.92 all grades, 3.77 Grade ≥ 3), and Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (ibrutinib: 5.95 all grades, 0.90 Grade ≥ 3; temsirolimus: 19.01 all grades, 2.28 Grade ≥ 3).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

In the CLL studies there was an overall moderate degree of ADR related to the add-on of ibrutinib; in terms of AEs leading to treatment discontinuations, 14% vs. 12% and in terms of dose reductions 9% vs. 7%. The ADR the profile in the combination arm looks essentially as expected based on the combination of the profiles of BR and ibrutinib alone. Thus the components were administered at the same dos intensity as used for ibrutinib and BR alone.

Regarding the data in MCL, it should be noted that treatment duration was substantially different between the study arms in MCL3001, median 14.4 months for the ibrutinib arm and 3 months for the temsirolimus arm (21 vs 5 cycles), with obvious impact on AE rates. Nevertheless, all TEAE categories (grade≥3, TESAE etc), except for outcome with death, were numerically more commonly reported in the temsirolimus arm. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 12.9% of patients in the ibrutinib arm and 29.5% in the temsirolimus arm. When the analysis was restricted to the first 6 months of treatment, the differences between study arms were larger, and TEAEs with outcome of death numerically slightly lower in the ibrutinib arm. The latter outcome was also supported by an exposure time-adjusted analysis.

No new ADRs were identified, except muscle spasm and hypertension that were recently added as new ADRs through the type II variation for a broader first line indication in CLL.

The median time to atrial fibrillation/flutter was shorter in the Additional monotherapy studies (61 days; n=31) as sompared to the Current monotherapy label pool (91 days; n=29).

Based on the additional data provided with this submission the MAH proposes a revised list of ADRs for inclusion in SmPC 4.8. Except from revision of incidence information for some ADRs, dehydration, dry mouth and anemia are suggested to be removed. This is considered acceptable.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety of ibrutinib as observed in the submitted studies is in line with the already known profile and no new or unexpected findings were revealed. The list of ADRs under SmPC section 4.8 was revised in terms of changes to the incidence for some ADRs, and the removal of dehydration, dry mouth and anaemia.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP):

The PRAC considered that the RMP version 5.1 (dated 10 November 2015) is acceptable, as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur revised assessment report dated 18 February 2016.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

The PRAC and CHMP also endorsed RMP version 6.0.1 (dated 12 July 2016), combining the RMP versions 6.0 (dated 24 June 2016) and 5.1, approved within variations II-24/G (positive CHMP opinion received on 21 July 2016) and II-17/G, respectively, with the following contents.

CLL3001 enrolled patients with R/R CLL/SLL. About 50% of patients had received one line of prior therapy and about 25% were refractory to purine analogues. Due to the selected background therapy, patients with del.17p positive CLL/SLL were excluded. The median/mean ages at enrolment were 64/64 and about 30% of patients were &gt;70 years of age.

Submitted data refer to an interim analysis conducted at a PFS event rate about 20 and 60%, i.e. at a higher event rate than originally planned for. Expressed as PFS HRs the treatment difference was about 0.02 at a p-value &lt;0.001. The main difference in terms of PFS events was observed after end of induction therapy. The reported ORRs (IRC) were 83% vs. 68%, p-value &lt;0.0001. A PFS2 analysis has been submitted. The event rates in this analysis were as expected low, 10 vs. 17%, HR 0.53, p-value 0.006 (exploratory). Based on the results of the interim analysis, the DMC recommended unblinding of the study.

At event rates of 9% and 14%, there is a trend towards improved survival with HR 0.63, p-value 0.06. An increase in MRD negativity was reported in the experimental arm, 13% vs. 5% p-value 0.001 (to be viewed as exploratory due to hierarchical testing procedure).

The supportive Study 1108 provides supportive single arm evidence as regards the activity and safety of ibrutinib as add-on to BR. Study 1109, exploring the combination ofatumumab and ibrutinib, is of minor relevance for this submission whilst the single arm, monotherapy study 1117 provides further confirmation of the efficacy of ibrutinib in case of CLL with del 17p.

The final CSRs for study MCL3001 and MCL2001 have been provided in support of the current indication in r/r MCL. MCL3001 was a Phase 3, open-label, randomised monotherapy study comparing ibrutinib with temsirolimus in r/r MCL after at least one prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen (n=280, 1:1 randomisation). MCL2001 was a Phase 2, open-label, monotherapy study in r/r MCL after at least one prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen and documented PD after at least 2 cycles of singleagent or combination bortezomib therapy (n=120).

In the MCL3001 study, PFS by IRC, the primary outcome measure, showed a HR of 0.428 in favour of the ibrutinib arm, p&lt;0.0001, with mature data in the temsirolimus arm (79%). Sensitivity analyses and secondary outcomes, as well as PFS2, were all supportive.

In the MCL2001 study, ORR by IRC, the primary outcome measure, was 63% for the response-evaluable population, with a CR rate of 21%, and 57% for the all-treated population. At the final analysis by investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, ORR was unchanged but the fraction of patients with CR had increased from 18% at the time of the cutoff for the primary analysis to 24.5%. At the primary cutoff and with 33% events the median DOR by IRC was approximately 15 months. At the final analysis by investigator, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months, DOR had increased from 12.9 months at the time of the primary analysis to 21.3 months.

Looking at activity in terms of response rates with ibrutinib across the MCL studies, the ORR was 72% in MCL3001, 63% in MCL2001 and 68% in 1104.

Overall the data submitted confirm the benefit observed with ibrutinib in the approved indications.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The interim analysis was conducted at a low event rate in the ibrutinib arm in the CLL study, therefore the PFS event curve is not well established, however based on prior monotherapy studies, however, it is accepted that ibrutinib shows durable responses. At this stage OS data cannot be used to support conclusions as the study was open to cross-over to ibrutinib at the time of patients' enrolment.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

There was an overall moderate degree of ADR related to the add-on of ibrutinib; in terms of AEs leading to treatment discontinuations, 14% vs. 12% and in terms of dose reductions 9% vs. 7%. The ADR profile in the combination arm looks essentially as expected based on the combination of the profiles of BR and ibrutinib alone. Thus the components were administered at the same dose intensity as used for ibrutinib and BR alone.

It should be noted that treatment duration was substantially different between the study arms in MCL3001, median 14.4 months for the ibrutinib arm and 3 months for the temsirolimus arm (21 vs 5 cycles), with obvious impact on AE rates. Nevertheless, all TEAE categories (grade≥3, TESAE etc), except for outcome with death, were numerically more commonly reported in the temsirolimus arm. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 12.9% of patients in the ibrutinib arm and 29.5% in the temsirolimus arm. When the analysis was restricted to the first 6 months of treatment, the differences between study arms were larger, and TEAEs with outcome of death numerically slightly lower in the ibrutinib arm. The latter outcome was also supported by an exposure time-adjusted analysis.

No new ADRs were identified, except muscle spasm and hypertension that were proposed as new ADRs in the ongoing type II variation for a broader first line indication in CLL.

The median time to atrial fibrillation/flutter was shorter in the additional monotherapy studies (61 days; n=31) as compared to the current monotherapy label pool (91 days; n=29).

Based on the additional data provided with this submission the MAH proposes a revised list of ADRs for inclusion in SmPC 4.8. Except from revision of incidence information for some ADRs, dehydration, dry mouth and anemia are suggested to be removed, which is considered acceptable.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

There were no further uncertainties resulting from the assessment of the submitted studies.

## Benefit Risk

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The results from studies conducted in the CLL indication were considered of high clinical relevance. The results provided reconfirm the importance of the benefits of ibrutinib in the CLL and MCL approved indications as discussed in the original application.

Clinically relevant results were observed in patients with MCL treated with ibrutinib monotherapy in the original application for a marketing authorisation and although the pivotal study was a single arm study, the dramatic activity seen in terms of ORR, and DOR was considered unprecedented historically and sufficiently important in this heavily pre-treated patient population to support approval. Having now these results confirmed by the comparison of ibrutinib to temsirolimus is an additional reassurance to their importance.

The safety data are in line with the so far known safety profile. Subject to additional scrutiny through this assessment, some modifications of the ADRs incidences were implemented in the PI. Long term safety data are still lacking and will be provided through agreed study updates in the RMP.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The results of the pivotal study CLL3001, a placebo controlled add-on study to bendamustine + rituximab (BR) in patients with R/R CLL or SLL -which was part of the post-authorisation studies for Imbruvica- led to an extension of indication to add the combination of ibrutinib with bendamustine and rituximab to the CLL indications. These are of high clinical relevance to CLL patients, consistent across subgroups and supported by evidence as regards the activity and safety of ibrutinib as add-on to BR from supportive single arm data. The benefit - risk profile of adding ibrutinib to bendamustine + rituximab is considered favourable in patients with R/R CLL.

The final CSRs for study MCL3001 and MCL2001 have been provided in support of the current indication in r/r MCL. From a safety perspective, potentially important issues have been extensively discussed and revisions of the SPC have been agreed whilst in the overall pattern the safety profile of ibrutinib is unchanged.

## 4. Recommendations

Extension of Indication for use of Imbruvica in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the Annex II are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, a clarification is made that the indications in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and Waldenstroem's macroglobulinaemia (WM) refer to use of ibrutinib as single agent. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) introduced minor editorial changes throughout the product information. The RMP is updated accordingly (RMP version 6.1).

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore recommends its deletion from the Annex II:

## · Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

| Description                                           | Due date   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Submission of the final study report of study MCL3001 | 1Q 2016    |

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is of the opinion that Imbruvica is not similar to Arzerra and Gazyvaro within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1
