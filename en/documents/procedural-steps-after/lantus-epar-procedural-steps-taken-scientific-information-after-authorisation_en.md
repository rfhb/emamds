| II/0098   | Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC in order to provide dosing instructions for switching from Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 U/mL) to Lantus (insulin glargine 100 U/mL).The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to correct some minor mistakes in the Product Information, to include the latest renewal date in section 9 of the SmPC and to amend local representative information for Romania in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 25/06/2015   | 28/07/2015   | SmPC, Labelling and PL   | Lantus and Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml) are not bioequivalent and are not directly interchangeable. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their basal insulin regimen from an insulin regimen with once daily insulin glargine 300 units/ml to a once daily regimen with Lantus should reduce their dose by approximately 20%.   |

| II/0087   | Update of section 4.6 of the SmPC based on results of a meta-analysis of published data and a review of other published and post-marketing data of insulin glargine use during pregnancy. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

In support of the application, the MAH presented results of a meta-analysis of published data on the use of insulin glargine compared to NPH in pregnancy, as well as additional available clinical data published up to 20 May 2013 and post-marketing data. The meta-analysis comprised 8 observational cohort studies with a total of 702 women with pregestational or gestational diabetes, of whom 331 received insulin glargine and 371 received NPH insulin. The meta-analysis examined maternal outcomes for efficacy and safety, and neonatal outcomes. The results of the meta-analysis did not reveal any significant increased risk associated with the use of insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin for any of the maternal or neonatal outcomes reported. With regard to the safety of insulin glargine use during pregnancy, in comparison to NPH insulin, there was no increased risk to the mother for weight gain, severe hypoglycemia, gestational/new-onset hypertension, preeclampsia, or cesarean section. While individual studies did inconsistently report differences, many of the individual findings were favourable to insulin glargine. Glycaemic control as measured by first and third trimester HbA1c was not different between the pregnant women using insulin glargine and those using NPH insulin. The CHMP conclusion on the meta-analysis was that it supports the overall insulin glargine program results, but could not constitute a stand-alone demonstration of glargine efficacy and safety in pregnant women with diabetes due to the limitations of the observational non-   |

| SmPC because, (i) the design of the ORIGIN study was not  anticipated in order to assess the risks of cancer (ii) it is  questionable whether these results could be extrapolated to  long-standing diabetes with high doses of insulin (iii)  available epidemiological results regarding the risk of  breast cancer for longer exposures to glargine are not fully  consistent across different studies.  No unexpected safety issues were seen in this trial. As was  expected weight did increase, and hypoglycaemia was still  the major adverse event seen in association with treatment  with insulin glargine. Rates of hypoglycemia in ORIGIN  might be lower than those seen in other CV intervention  trials in diabetes; however, as no beneficial effect of insulin  glargine could be detected in this trial, an increase in the  incidence of hypoglycaemia is a disadvantage.  In summary, any benefit of early treatment with insulin on  lower levels of HbA1 without improvement in CV outcome is  outweighed by its side effects and applicability.  The following text was included in section 5.1 of the SmPC  to describe the design and results of this study:  'The ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine  INtervention) study was a multicenter, randomized, 2x2  factorial design study conducted in 12,537 participants at  high cardiovascular (CV) risk with impaired fasting glucose  (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (12% of  participants) or type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ≤1  antidiabetic oral agent (88% of participants). Participants  were randomized (1:1) to receive insulin glargine  (n=6264), titrated to reach FPG ≤95 mg/dL (5.3 mM), or  standard care (n=6273).  The first co primary efficacy outcome was the time to the  first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction   |

| (MI), or nonfatal stroke, and the second co primary efficacy  outcome was the time to the first occurrence of any of the  first co primary events, or revascularisation procedure  (coronary, carotid, or peripheral), or hospitalisation for  heart failure.  Secondary endpoints included all cause mortality and a  composite microvascular outcome.  Insulin glargine did not alter the relative risk for CV disease  and CV mortality when compared to standard of care.  There were no differences between insulin glargine and  standard care for the two co primary outcomes; for any  component endpoint comprising these outcomes; for all  cause mortality; or for the composite microvascular  outcome.  Mean dose of insulin glargine by study end was 0.42 U/kg.  At baseline, participants had a median HbA1c value of  6.4% and median on-treatment HbA1c values ranged from  5.9 to 6.4% in the insulin glargine group, and 6.2% to  6.6% in the standard care group throughout the duration of  follow up.  The rates of severe hypoglycaemia (affected participants  per 100 participant years of exposure) were 1.05 for insulin  glargine and 0.30 for standard care group and the rates of  confirmed non severe hypoglycaemia were 7.71 for insulin  glargine and 2.44 for standard care group. Over the course  of this 6 year study, 42% of the insulin glargine group did  not experience any hypoglycaemia.  At the last on treatment visit, there was a mean increase in  body weight from baseline of 1.4 kg in the insulin glargine  group and a mean decrease of 0.8 kg in the standard care  group.'   |

| WS/0208   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 6.6 for SoloStar pre-filled pen presentation for the Insuman, Insuman Human Whintrop, Apidra, Lantus and Optisulin to reinforce the appropriate use of SoloStar. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with latest QRD template version 8.0 for Insuman, Apidra, Lantus and Optisulin. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 15/03/2012 | 20/04/2012 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Update of the labelling documents for three sanofi-aventis insulins is proposed in this type II variation to reinforce the appropriate use of Solostar prefilled pen. This update is based on the experience gained since 2006 (e.g. following reports and questions raised by the pen users) and a continued evaluation of possible improvements of the Product Information. During this period a number of product technical complaints were received concerning the functionality of the pen, namely a blocked pen, where it is impossible to dial or inject a dose. The cause was identified that when dialling a dose and pushing the dose button without a needle attached to the pen, a mechanical pressure within the system builds, leading to a blockage of the pen mechanism. For this reason the Instructions for Use are updated to make the patient aware not to dial a dose or push the dose button without having a needle attached. There was no technical change made to the Solostar prefilled pen. |

| II/0072   | Update of sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SmPC) to reflect new data on insulin glargine metabolites. In addition a minor change has been done to the Package Leaflet following the latest QRD template. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 21/07/2011   | 24/08/2011   | SmPC and PL   | Insulin glargine is metabolized in the subcutaneous (SC) tissue at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain to form the two active metabolites, M1 and M2. With the availability of a new specific and quantitative bioanalytical method, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples collected in a euglycaemic clamp study were used to further explore the systemic exposure to unchanged insulin glargine and the two metabolites M1 and M2 in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and the correlation to the established glucodynamic effect. In this clinical study insulin glargine was used as a reference at single SC doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 U/kg. The results of this study demonstrated that M1 was the principle circulating compound whereas unchanged insulin glargine and metabolite M2 were detected in only very few individual patients at few time points. The glucodynamic response correlated with metabolite M1 exposure. The CHMP agreed that this new data on insulin glargine metabolites was added to the SmPC.   |

| II/0065 | Update of product information to reflect the risk of medication errors (insulin mix-up). C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 16/12/2010 | 24/01/2011 | SmPC and PL     | The portfolio of the MAH contains several different insulins with several insulin delivery devices (IDD), including the re- usable devices (OptiPen Pro and OptiClik) and the device/drug combinations (pre-filled disposable pens OptiSet and SoloStar). The complexity regarding the various insulin treatments used in a single diabetic patient, (i.e. long acting, rapid acting; with the latter needing to be administered multiple times a day) in order to achieve optimal glycaemia control has created a situation wherein product differentiation becomes increasingly important. Adverse events associated with insulins mix-ups, often result in massive overdose of the rapid-acting insulin which may subsequently lead to hypoglycaemia, which if left untreated may be life-threatening, or result in death. In most cases, however, the patients noticed the mistake and took measures to avoid hypoglycaemia, which may explain the large number of cases with no AE or non-serious cases. In order to mitigate the risk of medication errors, the MAH has focused its efforts up to now on educational activities to ensure the safe administration of their insulins. The MAH has also focused on differentiation strategies for insulin |

Additionally, the MAH will incorporate changes to the existing insulins packaging. The aim of these changes is to better differentiate the different products and to increase readability for the pharmacist, Health Care Professional or patient in order to reduce potential mix-ups.   |

At this moment, three post-marketing pharmacoepidemiology studies are initiated by the MAH to further investigate the possible increased risk of cancer associated with the use of insulin glargine. These studies are planned to be finished within the next three years. Based on this, and according to Article 14.3 of Regulation EC(N0) 726/2004, the CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal on the basis of Pharmacovigilance grounds is required. - The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit yearly PSURs. Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Lantus, which requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.   |

Section 4.8 of the SPC has been updated with the following wording: In general, the safety profile for patients </= 18 years of age is similar to the safety profile for patients > 18 years. The adverse event reports received from Post Marketing Surveillance included relatively more frequent injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, urticaria) in patients </= 18 years of age than in patients > 18 years. No clinical study safety data are available in patients below 6 years of age.\" The PL has been updated |

The MAH has performed a readability test that shows that the revised manual complies with the standard acceptance criteria (80% of participants were able to find the information requested in the PL and instructions for use manual and could show that they understand it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

For the 10 ml filling this increase in batch size has already been submitted and approved (EMEA/H/C/284/II/06). In support of the variation the company has submitted validation data, a quality expert statement and an updated process narrative/flow chart. 2 Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The bulk solution of 1600 l is distributed into movable vessels of 400 l capacity each. As a result the filling process itself remains unaffected. The effect on the filling duration is appropriately validated with media fills. The (in-process and final product quality control) results of three batches were within established limits and met all specifications approved in the MAA. A comparison with three batches prepared on the 400 ml scale indicate no differences between batches produced on the 400 ml scale and the 1600 l scale. Therefore, the proposed variation to increase the batch size for the 3 ml cartridges from 400 l into 1600 l can be approved. This variation also fulfills follow-up measure 006.   |
