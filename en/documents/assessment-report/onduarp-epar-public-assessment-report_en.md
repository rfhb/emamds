## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

This marketing authorisation application for Onduarp (telmisartan / amlodipine) has been submitted by Boehringer  Ingelheim  International  GmbH  as  an  informed  consent  application  in  accordance  with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

The MAH (Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH) for Twynsta, which was authorised on 07 October 2010, provided consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical documentation of the initial dossier of this authorised product and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Onduarp medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical  profile of  Twynsta. The  application  for  Onduarp  concerns the identical strengths to those approved for Twynsta and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found in the Twynsta CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

The approved indication is:

'Treatment of essential hypertension in adults:

## Add on therapy

ONDUARP is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine.

## Replacement therapy

Adult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of

ONDUARP containing the same component doses'

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Twynsta application, the quality data in support of the Onduarp application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Twynsta dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Twynsta  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in support  of  the  Onduarp  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Twynsta dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

Currently ongoing experimental studies are aimed to investigate the potential additive or synergistic effects due to compound specific properties that have been described for telmisartan and amlodipine in the pre-clinical/clinical literature on top of their blood pressure lowering effect.

Results of these ongoing studies on the beneficial effects of Telmisartan/Amlodipine treatment beyond blood pressure lowering should be provided.

An  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  has  been  provided,  which  is  identical  to  the  version submitted  for  the  Twynsta  initial  Marketing  Authorisation.  The  medicinal  product  subject  to  this application  is  intended  to  be  administered  at  comparable  dose  levels  and  for  indications  that  are already approved in the European Community for Twynsta. Based on the assumption that the product

Onduarp

Assessment report EMA/891763/2011

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is  intended  to  substitute  for  identical  products  on  the  market,  the  approval  of  the  referred  product should  not  result  in  an  increase  of  the  total  quantity  of  the  active  ingredients  released  in  to  the environment. Therefore, it should not result in an increase of risk to the environment during storage, distribution, use and disposal.

For the active ingredient telmisartan, all required studies for the Phase II assessment of telmisartan were provided. Based on the study results no environmental risk for the aquatic compartment and the sediment  could  be  expected.  Additionally  a  potential  of  telmisartan  to  bioaccumulate  could  be excluded. Concerning the active ingredient telmisartan no further risk assessment was required and no special  precautions  had  to  be  considered  (the  general  disposal  advice  is  included  in  the  Package Leaflet). However, because of new scientific findings, new comments concerning the water-sediment study  were  raised  by  the  CHMP.  The  study  report  on  the  OECD  308  study  on  transformation  of telmisartan  in  water/sediment  systems  indicates  that  the  following 14 C-  labelled  test  item  (labelled atom indicated by an asterisk) was used:

<!-- image -->

In  the  part  of  the  study  report  on  transformation  product  the  following  statement  is  made:  'The amount of parent substance in the total river  and  pond  systems  slowly  declined  with  time  from  an initial level of about 97-98% of the applied radioactivity to 90% and 82% after 103 days of incubation in  the  river  and  pond  total  systems,  respectively.  Besides  the  parent  compound,  three  very  minor degradation  products  were  detected,  none  individually  exceeding  2%  of  applied  in  either  total systems.'  The  conclusion  of  the  study  report  is  that  there  are  no  relevant  transformation  products produced.  Recently,  information  has  been  published  on  transformation  products  of  a  parent  active ingredient from the substance class of the 'sartans' to which telmisartan also belongs to. Kern et al. (2010) and Helbling et al. (2010) described the formation of a transformation product from valsartan (valsartan acid, 2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid) that is considerably more stable than the  parent  compound  (DT50  valsartan  acid  =  410  x  DT50  parent).  Additionally  this  persistent transformation product has been detected in the effluent from a sewage treatment plant in the low µg/L  range.  The  molecule  under  study  in  Kern  et  al.  (2010)  and  Helbling  et  al.  (2010)  is  not telmisartan, but another member of the sartan family. Despite differences in the two molecules, the moiety  forming  the  persistent  transformation  product  is  also  present  in  telmisartan  (substituted biphenyl moiety, orange circle in the figure below). In telmisartan the substituent is a carboxyl group, whereas in valsartan a tetrazole group is found in the same position. As carboxyl and tetrazole groups are  considered  to  be  bioisosteric,  this  difference  is  not  considered  to  be  substantial.  Therefore  the formation of a similar transformation product from telmisartan that has been observed from valsartan is considered possible. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The presented OECD 308 study however cannot answer the question whether such a transformation product is formed because the labelled C-atom is not located in the biphenyl moiety in question (see figure  below)  and  consequently  the  potential  transformation  product  cannot  be  detected  when  only screening for radiolabelled transformation products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP therefore recommends the following points for further investigation:

The applicant should examine the possibility of formation of a comparable transformation product as described for valsartan in the case of telmisartan. This issue could be addressed by conducting a study with a radiolabel in a suitable position, or by conducting an unlabelled study and employing analytical methods  capable  of  detecting,  identifying  and  quantifying  the  potential  transformation  product,  or finally by providing a scientific argumentation that the data as already presented in the water-sediment study for Twynsta are conclusive enough for excluding the formation of a comparable transformation product for telmisartan as described for valsartan. For the active ingredient amlodipine, a detailed environmental risk assessment was provided. Based on the  studies  results  no  environmental  risk  for  the  aquatic  environment  can  be  expected.  However,  a study on sediment dwelling organisms is missing and should be provided. Therefore, in the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation::  The  applicant  is  requested  to  submit  a  test  on  toxicity  to  sediment  dwelling  organisms according to OECD.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  identify  the  metabolite  Met1  since  according  to  OECD  308 metabolites with an amount &gt; 10 % should be identified.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  provide  an  experimental  determined  n-octanol/water  partition coefficient for amlodipine since the estimated and calculated log Kow value exceeds a value of 2.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Twynsta application, the clinical data in support of the Onduarp application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Twynsta dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP considered the safety profile of fixed dose combination of telmisartan and amlodipine well established and no safety concerns requiring risk minimisation activities have been identified. A Risk Management  Plan  (RMP)  is  therefore  not  considered  necessary.  Since  for  the  reference  product Twynsta no RMP has been established, the CHMP was of the opinion that none is required for Onduarp.

In line with the reference product Twynsta, the applicant should however closely monitor and discuss in future PSURs all cardiovascular events leading to fatal outcome.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

## PSUR

The MAH should follow the PSUR submission cycle as agreed for Twynsta, which is on a 6-monthly cycle, having 07 October -2011 as its data lock point.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Onduarp medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical  profile of  Twynsta. The  application  for  Onduarp  concerns the identical strengths to those approved for Twynsta and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found on the Twynsta CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

The  applicant  should  closely  monitor  and  discuss  in  the  PSURs  all  cardiovascular  events leading to fatal outcome. 2.6 User consultation A justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  Package Leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The Package Leaflet of Twynsta has been successfully user tested in the framework of its evaluation for which the CHMP opinion was adopted on 22 April 2010. Since the proposed Package Leaflet for the current  application  is  identical  to  the  Package  Leaflet  for  Twynsta  except  for  the  product-specific information, no further testing is warranted. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance This Marketing Authorisation application for Onduarp (telmisartan/amlodipine) has been submitted by Boehringer  Ingelheim  International  GmbH  as  an  informed  consent  application  in  accordance  with Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Twynsta initial marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-autorisation procedures, the CHMP considers that the benefit/risk balance for Onduarp is postive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Onduarp in the treatment of essential hypertension in adults:

## Add on therapy

ONDUARP is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine.

## Replacement therapy

Adult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of

ONDUARP containing the same component doses is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use
