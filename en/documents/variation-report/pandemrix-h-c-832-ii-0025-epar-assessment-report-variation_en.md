## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisation in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following  the  declaration  of  the  pandemic  phase  6  by  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO),  the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The vaccine also contains the marketing authorisation holder's (MAH's) proprietary adjuvant AS03, which is composed of squalene, DL-alpha-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The  MAH  applied  to  update  section  4.5  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  for Pandemrix  H1N1 to  reflect  the  first  preliminary  results  of  study  D-Pan-H1N1-018  (called  'H1N1018'  in  this  report  ).  This  synoptic  report  of  D21  safety  and  immunogenicity  data  (HI  only)  was assessed in the report on the specific obligation SOB 053 (circulated 10.11.09). In  support  of  this  variation  the  MAH  has  submitted  a  synoptic  report  of  day  21  (D21)  safety  and immunogenicity data (HI only) from study H1N1-018 The MAH also provided data from study 018 specific to subjects aged over 80 years and safety data by age strata that were requested following review of SOB 053. In addition, as the potential impact of temperature of the rubber stopper is considered to be related to the appearance of coring the MAH also proposed to update section 6.6 of the SPC and section 6 of the Package Leaflet in view of the instructions for reconstituting the vaccine. This variation has been submitted to fulfil SOB 053 for which the MAH committed to provide the post-dose 1 HI immunogenicity data (uncleaned) from this study to CHMP. Further data will be submitted from this study at intervals as committed in the Letter of Undertaking for the pandemic strain variation (PU-017) and described in Annex II to the Opinion. 1.2 Clinical aspects FLU D-PAN H1N1-018 Medicinal product no longer authorised

This is a phase II, randomised, observer-blind, 2 centre (Sweden) study to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose schedule with Pandemrix H1N1 containing the AS03 adjuvant when co-administered with the seasonal 2009-2010 influenza vaccine Fluarix either at the time of the first or second Pandemrix H1N1 vaccination in elderly subjects aged 61 years and older.

The two parallel vaccine groups are:

· F-PAN Group , one dose of Pandemrix H1N1 and one dose of Fluarix was given at Day 0 and one dose of Pandemrix H1N1 and one dose of placebo vaccine given at Day 21

· PAN-F Group , one dose of the  Pandemrix H1N1 and one dose of placebo vaccine given at Day 0 and one dose of the H1N1 candidate vaccine and one dose of Fluarix at Day 21.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both groups will then be followed up serologically at D42, M6 and at M12 to determine whether there is any advantage for two doses of Pandemrix H1N1 over a single dose in the longer term:  to assess whether co-administration of two influenza vaccines has an effect on immunogenicity/safety of either vaccine and additionally to assess the immune response to Fluarix when administered with a second Pandemrix H1N1 vaccine.

The study was initiated in September 2009 and is ongoing. Currently only the data obtained up to D21 after  a  single  dose  of  Pandemrix  H1N1 in the PAN-F group and a dose of Fluarix co-administered with Pandemrix H1N1 in the F-PAN group are available. The MAH provided an abridged study report that covers the post-dose I immunogenicity results (i.e. at D21) together with data on reactogenicity, AEs and SAEs.

The complete list of objectives for study D-Pan-H1N1-018 is detailed below. However, only the post Dose 1 (Day 21) results are available at this point. The co-primary objectives are: ·  To  assess  whether  vaccination  with  two  doses  of  the  H1N1  candidate  vaccine  results  in  an  HI immune  response  to  the  vaccine-homologous  virus  that  meets  or  exceeds  the  EMEA  (CHMP) guidance  targets  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccines  (seroconversion  rate  (SCR),  seroprotection  rate (SPR), and seroconversion factor (SCF)) at 21 days after the second dose of H1N1 vaccine when coadministered with Fluarix either at the time of first or second vaccination in elderly subjects aged 61 years and older. · To assess whether vaccination with one dose of Fluarix results in an HI immune response that meets or exceeds for each vaccine strain of the seasonal vaccine at least one of the EMEA (CHMP) guidance targets  for  seasonal  influenza  vaccines  (SCR,  and/or  SPR  and/or  SCF) at  21  days  after  vaccination when co-administered with either the first or second dose of the H1N1 candidate vaccine in elderly subjects aged 61 years and older. The secondary objectives are: · To  assess  the  immune  response  of  two  doses  of  the  H1N1  candidate  vaccine  in  terms  of vaccine-homologous virus HI response 21 days after each dose of H1N1 vaccine when coadministered with Fluarix either at the time of first or second vaccination in elderly subjects aged 61 years and older. · To assess the immune response of one dose of Fluarix in terms of HI response 21 days after vaccination when co-administered with either the first or second dose of the H1N1 candidate vaccine in elderly subjects aged 61 years and older. · To assess the safety of the vaccine regimens in terms of solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) 7 days post-vaccination, unsolicited AEs 21 days post-dose 1 and 63 days postdose 2, AEs of specific interest (AESIs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) for the entire study period. The placebo used in the study was saline Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study planned to enrol 168 subjects aged at least 61 years (84 subjects in F-PAN group and 84 subjects in the PAN-F group and stratified by age; 112 in the 61-70 years stratum and 56 in the &gt;70 years stratum) with allocation to two parallel vaccine groups. Subjects were to be stratified into two age strata (61-70 and &gt; 70 years)

- o The analyses reported thus far were performed on uncleaned data.
- o The primary analysis was done on the total vaccinated cohort for each age stratum and overall.
- o The  analysis  of  immunogenicity  was  done  as  a  descriptive  analysis  of  the  humoral  immune response overall and within each age stratum.

## Results

Demographics

As was planned, the study enrolled 168 subjects, including 112 aged 61-70 years and 56 aged &gt; 70 years.

Within each vaccination cohort the percentage of gender was variable but all values fell within 5056%. All subjects were Caucasian.

There is no information on whether any subject received vaccination for the 2009/10 season but the rate of prior vaccination in the individual three previous seasons ranged from 52.4% -73.8%. More subjects in the PAN-F group had a history of previous influenza vaccination (82.1%) compared with the F-PAN group (72.6%).

There  was  a  trend  for slightly  lower  rates  in  the  F-PAN  group  but  the  95%  CI  all  overlapped  and  the  lowest  rate observed was 87.5%.  There was no difference in SPR between the age groups. · The D21 seroconversion rates were high and exceeded 87% in both vaccine cohorts and both age groups. There was a trend for marginally lower rates in the F-PAN group but the 95% CI all overlapped and the lowest rate observed was 87.5%.  There was no difference in SCR between the age groups.

## Immune responses to FluA/Bri/07.HA1, Flu A/Uru/07.HA3 and FluB/Bri/08.HA

Baseline seropositivity for FluA/Bri/07.HA1, Flu A/Uru/07.HA3 and FluB/Bri/08.HA was very high in both vaccine cohorts, with a tendency for a higher level in the older groups (&gt;70 yrs).

D21 seroprotection rates raged from 67.9% (in the &gt;70 years for A/Bri/07) to 100% (both age cohorts for B/Bri/09)

Seroconversion rates were not met for those &gt;70 years for H1N1 Brisbane, H3N1 or B/Brisbane Seroconversion factor and seropositivity rates were satisfactory for both age strata.

For the age group &gt;70 years all 3 CHMP criteria are met for responses to H1N1 regardless of baseline serostatus. Immune responses to Fluarix The response to Fluarix by age showed that SCR was not met in those &gt;70yrs for H1N1Brisbane, H3N1 or B/Brisbane, but other criteria were met and so the responses passed the minimal CHMP criteria for the age group. Adults aged &gt;80 years. There were five  subjects  aged  over  80  years  in  this  study.  For  responses  to  Flu  A/Cal/09  HAI  the following were noted in them: · At baseline one of the five subjects (in the F-PAN group) was seropositive and this subject was also seroprotected. · At D21 all subjects in both vaccine cohorts were seropositive and seroprotected. · All subjects seroconverted. · The seroconversion factors exceeded the minimum requirement in both groups.

All  subjects  were  seropositive  at  baseline  and  two  of  the  three  in  the  F-Pan  group  were  already seroprotected,  which  greatly  limits  any  interpretation  of  the  data  for  this  age  group.  No  subject seroconverted and the SCF was 1.3 while all three were seroprotected after Fluarix.

## Responses to Pandemrix

The data show that all 3 CHMP criteria were met for responses to H1N1 in the 5 subjects &gt;80years regardless of baseline serostatus.

## Responses to Fluarix

It  is  difficult  to  interpret  data  on  5  subject  &gt;80  years  due  to  the  very  high  pre-vaccination seropositivity and seroprotection rates, which limited the detectable HI responses to vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall the responses to Fluarix in the total &gt;70 year group met minimal CHMP criteria for seasonal influenza vaccines.

The additional safety analysis provided data according to age 61-70 years and &gt;70 years as requested. All subjects returned their symptom records. As shown below, in both vaccine groups the rates of local symptoms were lower in the older age group. Overall the data did not consistently suggest higher rates of local or general symptoms on co-administration vs. Pandemrix alone.

General symptoms were lower in those &gt;70 years compared with the 61-70 year group. No grade 3 systemic reactions were seen in those &gt;70 years and no temperatures above 38oC were seen in either age  group.  As  for  the  total  cohort  in  study  018  general  symptoms  were  not  higher  in  those  who received co-administration of Fluarix compared with those in the PAN-F group alone.

A comparison of local symptoms following vaccination with Fluarix and Pandemrix was provided. This demonstrated that Pandemrix H1N1 was associated with very much higher rates of local reactions compared with Fluarix as was expected from all previously reported data. Local reactions were less common in the older age group with both vaccines. Incidence  and  nature  of  local  symptoms  (solicited  and  unsolicited)  reported  for  each  vaccine during the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period (Total vaccinated cohort) Grade 3 symptoms were seen in two subjects in the 61-70 year age group, one general reaction in the F-Pan group and one local reaction in the Pan-F group that was considered vaccine-related. Pain was by far the most common local symptom. Local reactions were less common in those &gt;70 years with the exception of swelling in the PAN-F group where 25% of those &gt;70 years had swelling compared with 16.1% of those in the 61-70 years group.  In the F-Pan group the rates of local swelling were similar in both age groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

The  abridged  study  report  submitted  for  this  procedure  describes  the  preliminary  safety  and immunogenicity results following vaccination with Pandemrix H1N1 (i.e. 3.75 µg HA +AS03A) coadministered  either  with  Fluarix  (F-PAN  group)  or  with  saline  (PAN-F  group)  in  adults  aged  &gt;60 years, with a good representation of subjects aged 61-70 years (112) and 56 subjects &gt;70 years.  The oldest subject was 85 years.

On  assessment  of  the  immunogenicity  of  Pandemrix  H1N1  (whether  administered  alone  or  coadministered with Fluarix) the HI data at baseline, the pre-vaccination seropositivity rates and D21 seroprotection rates were in keeping with those observed in study 008 in those aged &gt;60 years.

The CHMP criteria for HI responses were very easily met in the initial analysis in the strata 61-70 years and &gt;70 yrs. The additional analyses by baseline serostatus, prior seasonal vaccination and age strata also showed that in each analysis the three criteria were comfortably met for H1N1. Further analyses of the data from five subjects aged &gt; 80 years of age and a breakdown of safety into the  two  age  groups  (61-70  and  &gt;  70  years)  for  study  018  were  provided.  These  showed  that  the immunogenicity of Pandemrix in subjects aged &gt; 80 resulted in all seroprotected at D21 compared to only one at baseline and the SCR and SCF CHMP criteria were also met. These data supplement and agree with the results reported from five subjects aged &gt; 80 years in study 008 (see II/023) and do not suggest any interference from co-administration with Fluarix. Responses to Fluarix were considered difficult to interpret in this small number of elderly subjects due to the baseline seropositivity rates. However in study 018 the responses to Fluarix in the entire age cohort &gt;70 years met the minimal CHMP criteria for seasonal influenza vaccines. The  co-administration  of  Fluarix  did  not  impact  on  the  immunogenicity  of  Pandemrix  H1N1.  For Fluarix the responses passed minimal CHMP criteria for seasonal flu vaccine in this age group. The MAH provided safety data divided into age groups (61-70 years and &gt;70 years). The data show that local reactions occurred much more often at the Pandemrix injection site compared to the Fluarix injection site, as was expected from all previous experience with AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines. The rates for local and systemic reactions tend to be lower in those &gt;70 years and Grade 3 reactions occurred in only two subjects. The safety profile of Pandemrix H1N1 when co-administered with Fluarix is comparable to that seen with Pandemrix H1N1 (with saline placebo), and also appears to be comparable with that reported in study 008 in the older age groups. No difference in the safety profile of Pandemrix H1N1 was seen between the two vaccine groups. This suggests that co-administration of Pandemrix with Fluarix has a similar safety profile (local and systemic, solicited and unsolicited) to that seen with Pandemrix H1N1 vaccination alone. Overall, there were no new safety issues raised by these data. The  additional  information  provided  in  this  report  supports  the  co-administration  of  seasonal  flu vaccine  and  Pandemrix  H1N1.  Further  data  will  provide  information  on  whether  there  are  any differences in immunogenicity between co-administration of Fluarix with the first or second dose of Pandemrix H1N1.

## Changes to the Product Information

The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/Annex II/ /PL attached to this report. Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SPC section 4.5 - Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

This section has been revised to reflect that the seasonal vaccine used in the study was Fluarix, and that co-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to administration of Pandemrix alone.

## SPC section 6.6 -Special precautions for disposal and other handling

This section was updated to clarify that the reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
