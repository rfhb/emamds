The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 February 2014.

The applicant applied for the following indication: Sevelamer hydrochloride is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Sevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease. The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC - relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder for an authorised medicinal product. The application submitted is composed of administrative information together with a letter from Genzyme Europe BV allowing use to be made of relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data of the original marketing authorisation for Renagel.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

Hyperphosphataemia is one the most common sequalae of chronic kidney disease. According to the epidemiologic  data,  hyperphosphataemia  is  associated  with  increased  mortality  and  cardiovascular disease events both in general population and especially in chronic kidney disease patients. Preclinical and clinical data support the hypothesis that this association is mediated by cardiovascular calcification and  by  other  detrimental  effects  of  hyperphosphatemia  on  vasculature  and  heart.  Based  on  these findings, the main renal guidelines recommend strongly the restriction of dietary phosphorus and/or the use oral phosphate binders to achieve the recommended serum phosphorus level in dialysis patients and, with some reservations, also in pre-dialysis patients. Currently available authorised therapeutic agents for  hyperphosphatemia  in  Europe  include  calcium-containing  phosphate  binders  (calcium  carbonate; calcium acetate; combination of calcium acetate and magnesium carbonate), lanthanum carbonate and ion-change resins including sevelamer hydrochloride, sevelamer carbonate and colestilan. This  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  concerns  Tasermity  800  mg  tablets,  in  the  treatment  of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. It is a duplicate application to the marketing authorisation (MA) of Renagel (EMEA/H/C/000254) The active substance is sevelamer hydrochloride (ATC code: V03AE02; Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Treatment of hyperphosphataemia). The application has been submitted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and is regarded to have automatic access for substance already authorised via Centralised Procedure. Eligibility based on automatic access was confirmed by EMA on 20 February 2014. The CHMP appointed during February 2014 meeting Dr Janne Komi as Rapporteur and Dr. Bart Van der Schueren as Co-Rapporteur. The legal basis of this application is Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/ EC, Informed consent application, and accordingly a complete Module 1 is submitted. Letter of consent from the MAH of Renagel has been enclosed. The Applicant Sanofi-aventis recherché et developpement and Genzyme Europe B.V. (a Sanofi company) is the marketing authorisation holder of the reference medicinal product Renagel. 2.2 Quality aspects As Tasermity is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC, only module 1 is provided and module 3 of the duplicate dossier cross-refers to the up-to-date module 3 of the original dossier (Renagel), which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.1 Introduction

Since this application is an informed consent of the Renagel application, the non-clinical data in support of the Tasermity application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Renagel dossier, which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2 Environmental risk assessment

In accordance with the scope described in the CHMP guideline, given that this application is for products that are already authorized, the absence of a phased approach ERA as specified in the guideline, is considered  justified  in  that  the  total  quantity  of  the  drug  substance  sevelamer  hydrochloride  is  not expected to increase upon approval of this marketing authorization. Consequently, marketing approval would not add to the environmental impact.

## 2.2.3 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

In this informed consent application, there are no issues related to the non-clinical data, which have been assessed for Renagel application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. 2.4 Clinical aspects As Tasermity is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC, only module 1 is provided and module 2 of the duplicate dossier cross-refers to the up-to-date module 2 of the original dossier (Renagel), which has been assessed and approved. No new clinical data is provided. 2.5 Clinical safety The RMP version 5 being strictly identical to the RMP approved for the reference product, therefore no further assessment of the present RMP is deemed necessary. 2.6 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. 2.7 Risk Management Plan The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 5 is acceptable. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance This Marketing Authorisation application for Tasermity has been submitted by Genzyme Europe BV as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Tasermity medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Renagel. The application for Tasermity concerns the identical strengths to those approved for Renagel and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found on the Renagel CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Renagel initial marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-autorisation procedures, the CHMP considers that the benefit/risk balance for Tasermity is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Tasermity in the treatment for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is favourable. Sevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease. The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
