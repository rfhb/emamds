## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Requested Type II Group of variations

Pursuant to  Article  7.2.(b)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 1234/2008,  Merck  Serono  Europe  Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 15 June 2011 an application for a group of variations.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Medicinal product:   | International non-proprietary or common name:   | Presentations:   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Rebif                | interferon beta-1a                              | See Annex A      |

The following variations were requested in the group:

| Variations requested   | Variations requested                                                                                                                                                                 | Type   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6 a)               | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one                                                                 | II     |

The  MAH  proposed  the  update  of  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics (SmPC) and sections 1 and 3 of the Package Leaflet to include information on a new indication,  i.e.  treatment  of  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active  inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis. These updates affect the PI of the 44 mcg presentations (prefilled syringe, pre-filled pen and cartridges) and the PI of the initiation pack presentations (pre-filled syringe, pre-filled pen and cartridges).  In addition, minor editorial changes were implemented across the SmPC and the Package leaflet, and the DDPS version number was removed from Annex II.

At the same time, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.2 and 6.5 of the SmPC for the pre-filled syringe (PFS) and pre-filled pen (PFP) initiation packs in order to add additional pack sizes of 2x22 mcg PFS  +  2x8.8  mcg  PFS  and    2x22  mcg  PFP  +  2x8.8  mcg  PFP.  Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet  were proposed to be updated accordingly.

The  requested  group  of  variations  proposed  amendments  to  the  SmPC,  Annex  II,  Labelling  and Package Leaflet.

## 3. Background information on the procedure

## 3.1. Submission of the dossier

With  this  application  the  MAH  proposed  to  add  the  following  indication  'Rebif  is  indicated  for  the treatment of a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis', with consequential changes to sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. This type II variation was initially grouped with a type IB variation to introduce two additional pack sizes (2x8.8 micrograms and 2x22 micrograms initiation packages) for the pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen, corresponding to the first month supply of the 44 micrograms once weekly posology.

The  type  IB  variation  was  withdrawn  by  the  applicant  at  the  time  of  response  to  the  Request  for Supplementary Information.

## 4. Scientific discussion

## 4.1. Introduction

Rebif (interferon beta-1a) was approved in Europe on 4 May 1998. The currently approved indication is for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms, to be administered subcutaneously three times a week, whereas a lower dose of 22 micrograms three times a week is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist.

Rebif is currently not approved for patients at the early stage of the disease, i.e. when they experience a first single clinical, demyelinating event and the multiple sclerosis diagnosis is not yet confirmed.

It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  irreparable  damage  to  the  central  nervous  system  occurs  from  the earliest  stages  of  multiple  sclerosis,  even  before  clinical  manifestation  when  patients  seemingly  are doing well. This underlines the importance of treatment initiation as early as possible in the disease course.

This submission constitutes an extension of the current Rebif marketing authorisation to include the indication: 'Rebif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis'.

## 4.2. Clinical aspects

## 4.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted results of one pivotal phase III study 27025 (REFLEX) in subjects with a single demyelinating event at high risk of converting to multiple sclerosis to support the indication 'treatment of  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active  inflammatory  process,  if  alternative  diagnoses  have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis'.

## GCP

The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial conducted outside the EU was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 4.2.2. Clinical efficacy

## 4.2.2.1. Main study

One  pivotal  clinical  trial  (study  27025,  REFLEX)  supported  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Rebif  in  the indication applied for.

An overview of the study is provided in the table below.

## Methods

This  was  a  Phase  III,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  clinical  trial  of  RNF (44 mcg tiw and 44 mcg ow) in subjects considered at high risk of converting to multiple sclerosis. The double-blinded treatment duration was 24 months.

A schematic of the study design is shown in Figure 1 below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fig. 1 Trial Design of Study 27025 (REFLEX)

<!-- image -->

Study visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months post-baseline. Relapses were monitored on an ongoing basis. MRI scans were assessed at Screening and at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24. If the patient reached CDMS prior to 24 months, MRI scans were performed at 6-month intervals following conversion.

A central  neuroradiology centre  performed the central  blinded  analysis  of  all  MRI  scans.  A  separate MRI-DSMB  was  to  review  all  MRI  scans  that  met  the  predefined  alert  criteria  in  order  to  provide appropriate recommendations for the protection of individual subjects.

Subjects reaching CDMS were switched to active treatment, at the approved 44 mcg sc tiw regimen.

The study utilized an independent Adjudication Committee, responsible for the following:

-  eligibility  assessment  of  individual  subjects  prior  to  randomization,  based  on  the  subjects' screening MRI and clinical status,
-  confirmation of classification or reclassification of subjects' first demyelinating event into monofocal or multifocal (this was performed after randomization),
-  adjudication of conversion to McDonald MS,
-  adjudication of conversion to CDMS,
-  confirmation of classification or reclassification of relapses as qualifying or non-qualifying.

## Study Participants

The study enrolled adult male and female subjects 18 to 50 years of age, within 60 days following onset of a single, first clinical event suggestive of MS. The clinical event had to be a new neurological abnormality present for at least 24 hours, either mono- or polysymptomatic, other than paresthesia, vegetative or cerebral dysfunction. The T2-weighted MRI scan had to show at least 2 clinically silent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lesions,  with  a  size  of  at  least  3  mm,  at  least  one  of  which  was  ovoid  or  periventricular  or infratentorial. Subjects had to have an EDSS score between 0 and 5.0 (inclusive) before the start of treatment.

Subjects  fulfilling  the  following  criteria  were  excluded:  a  diagnosis  of  MS  (as  per  McDonald  criteria [2005]) or any other disease that could better explain the patient's signs and symptoms. Subjects with complete  transverse myelitis or bilateral optic neuritis and  subjects who  had  received prior immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant therapy were also excluded (subjects could have received oral or parenteral corticosteroids).

The CHMP considered that the revised McDonald criteria (2005) are widely accepted for a presumed diagnosis of MS under the prerequisite that they are applied to those patients with a typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS  or symptoms  consistent with CNS  inflammatory demyelinating disease and alternative diagnoses are excluded.

High risk was defined in the study protocol as having experienced an event suggestive of MS within 60 days prior to randomisation and presenting at least 2 clinically silent lesions on T2-weighted brain MRI. The CHMP considered that there is no standard definition of 'high risk of converting' and that various criteria were applied in prior studies with other MS product; the issue of defining high risk patients is further discussed in the Discussion of clinical efficacy section).

## Treatments

Subjects were allocated to one of 2 active dosage regimens (44 mcg tiw or ow) or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 randomization ratio. The blinded treatment duration was 24 months. Patients were titrated in accordance with the currently approved indication (8.8 mcg during the initial 2 weeks, 22 mcg during weeks 3 and 4, with the full dose administered from week 5 onward). Treatments were administered as subcutaneous injections using an auto-injector device, if possible at the same time (late afternoon or evening) on the same 3 days (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday), as recorded by subjects using diary cards. Patients randomized to RNF 44 mcg ow were provided with one active dose and 2 placebo doses to mimic the tiw treatment.

If subjects converted to CDMS during the blinded treatment period, they were re-titrated to open-label treatment with RNF 44 mcg tiw for the remainder of the 24 months.

## Concomitant Therapy

Subjects were recommended to take 400 mg of ibuprofen or 1000 mg of paracetamol/acetaminophen prophylactically with each injection during the first 12 weeks of treatment. If necessary, subjects could take additional doses every 4 to 6 hours thereafter during the first 24 hours (up to a maximum of 1200 mg ibuprofen or 3 g paracetamol/acetaminophen within any 24-hour period).

Subjects were treated with corticosteroids for relapses at the discretion of the treating physician. Any MRI scans conducted during the trial were to be performed before administration of steroids or at least 7 days after the last steroid dose.

Additional immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy, chronic or monthly pulse corticosteroids, cytokines or anti-cytokine therapy, plasmaferesis, telbivudine or any experimental or off-label MS treatments were not allowed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  RNF  44  mcg  (tiw  and  ow)  versus placebo  on  the  time  to  conversion  to  McDonald  multiple  sclerosis  in  subjects  with  a  first  clinal demyelinating event at high risk of converting to MS.

The main secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of RNF 44 mcg (tiw and ow) versus placebo on the time to conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) in subjects with a first clinical demyelinating event at high risk of converting to MS.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the time to conversion to MS according to the revised McDonald  criteria  (2005),  as  confirmed  by  the  independent  Adjudication  Committee.  A  subject  was considered  to  have  converted  to  MS  according  to  the  2005  McDonald  criteria  if,  following  the  first clinical  demyelinating  event,  there  was  evidence  of  dissemination  in  space  and  in  time  based  on  a clinical event or on clinical data and MRI.

The main secondary endpoint was the time to conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS). This was defined by either a second attack or a 3-month sustained increase ( ≥ 1.5 points) in the EDSS score (as confirmed by the independent Adjudication Committee).

The main MRI-based secondary endpoint was the mean number of Combined Unique Active (CUA) MRI lesions per subject per scan from randomization up to Month 24 or up to CDMS conversion, whichever occurred first.

Such MRI lesion was defined as a newly active or persistently active lesion found during a given scan on the PD/T2 sequence or the T1 Gd-enhancing sequence, without being double counted. As per the data collected, CUA MRI was computed by the sum of the new lesions and the persisting lesions on the T1 Gd-enhancing scan, plus the sum of the new lesions and the growing lesions on the PD/T2 scan not enhancing on the T1 Gd-enhancing scan. The mean number of CUA MRI lesions per subject per scan was calculated as the subject's total number of CUA lesions across all available scans during the DB period, divided by the subject's total number of available scans during that period.

Other secondary efficacy endpoints included the following:

-  Mean number of new T2 lesions per subject per scan
-  Mean number of new T1 lesions per subject per scan
-  Mean number of new Gd-enhancing lesions per subject per scan
-  T2 lesion volume
-  T1 hypointense lesion volume
-  T1 Gd-enhancing lesion volume
-  Annualized relapse rate
-  Proportion of relapse-free subjects during 12 months
-  Proportion of relapse-free subjects during 24 months
-  EDSS change from baseline over time
-  Changes from baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP considered the primary and secondary endpoints acceptable and acknowledged the use of an independent Adjudication Committee in confirming the diagnosis.

## Sample size

RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. placebo was considered the main treatment group comparison. It was estimated that a total of 450 subjects equally allocated to each of the 3 treatment groups (placebo, RNF 44 mcg ow and RNF 44 mcg tiw) would be required to achieve 165 events for the comparison of RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. placebo and 238 events in total (96 in placebo group, 73 in RNF 44 mcg ow group and 69 in RNF 44 mcg tiw group) after approximately 21 months of recruitment (assuming a recruitment of 30 subjects per month). This was to provide 90% power using a 2-sided log-rank test at a 0.05 alphaerror for detecting an HR of 0.6 in the primary efficacy endpoint for the main comparison RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. placebo, corresponding to an expected proportion of 15% free of conversion over 24 months in the placebo group and 32% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group.

Assuming  a  withdrawal  rate  of  10%  over  24  months,  the  planned  sample  size  was  increased  to 480 subjects equally allocated to each of the 3 treatment groups (i.e., 160 subjects per group).

The sample size was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomized on Day 1 in a ratio 1:1:1 to either RNF 44 mcg tiw, RNF 44 mcg ow or placebo tiw through a centralized IVRS system, using a minimization procedure to prevent imbalances between treatment groups and using the following a priori-defined stratification factors:

-  Age (&lt;30 years, ≥ 30 years),
-  Classification of first clinical demyelinating  event  (monofocal,  multifocal) according to the investigator,
-  Steroid use at first clinical demyelinating event (yes, no),
-  Presence of at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion (yes, no) according to the central MRI reading centre.

The  CHMP  considered  the  randomisation  and  randomisation  stratification  factors  acceptable  and reflective of previous interferon studies.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion. If subjects converted to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) during the blinded period, they were switched and re-titrated to the recommended posology  of  Rebif  44 micrograms  three  times  per  week  in  an  open  label  manner,  while  maintaining blinding as to their initial randomisation.

The  evaluating  physician  conducting  the  neurological  examinations  and  the  neuro-radiology  centre team assessing the MRI scans were blinded. Before the physician evaluated the subjects, all visible injection  site  reactions  were  covered  by  clothing;  these  site  reactions  were  not  examined  by  the evaluating physician.

The measures taken to maintain the blinding during the study were considered sufficient by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

The  main  analysis  population  for  the  efficacy  endpoints  was  the  ITT  population,  consisting  of  all randomized subjects. Subjects were analyzed according to their randomly allocated treatment.

The primary efficacy variable (time to conversion to McDonald MS) was analyzed by 2-sided stratified (by randomization stratification factors) log-rank test at the 0.05 significance level. The hazard ratio with  2-sided  95%  CIs  was  estimated  using  an  adjusted  Cox's  proportional  hazards  model  using treatment and the stratification factors as covariates. Subjects who did not convert to McDonald MS within the 24-month trial period from randomization up to the Month 24 visit were considered as rightcensored data. The date of the last available MRI assessment reported from randomization up to the Month 24 visit was used as time of censoring.

The secondary endpoint of time to CDMS was analyzed similarly.

For  pair-wise  comparisons  for  the  secondary  endpoint  of  CUA  lesions,  the  treatment  effect  with corresponding  95%  CIs  was  estimated  using  a  negative  binomial  model  including  treatment  and stratification  factors  as  covariates.  The  p-value  for  this  comparison  was  estimated  using  a  nonparametric ANOVA on ranks model including treatment and stratification factors as covariates.

The primary efficacy endpoint (time to conversion to McDonald MS), time to conversion to CDMS and the  main  MRI-based  efficacy  endpoint  (mean  number  of  CUA  lesions)  were  part  of  the  hypothesis testing and type I error control using a hierarchical approach in the following sequence:

- (I) RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. placebo for:
1. Time to McDonald MS at the first level of the hierarchy
2. Time to CDMS at the second level of the hierarchy
3. Mean number of CUA lesions per subject per scan at the third level of the hierarchy
- (II)  RNF 44 mcg ow vs. placebo for the same 3 endpoints in the same hierarchical order:
4. Time to McDonald MS at the first level of the hierarchy
5. Time to CDMS at the second level of the hierarchy
6. Mean number of CUA lesions per subject per scan at the third level of the hierarchy

The 6 confirmatory tests were 2-sided and performed at the 0.05 significance level in the pre-specified fixed sequence described above with confirmatory testing being continued if the current hypothesis (H0) in the sequence was rejected.

According to the study protocol, the MAH planned to conduct the first analysis for the main treatment group comparison (RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. placebo) when a total number of 107 conversions to CDMS were reached in the placebo group and RNF 44 mcg tiw group combined during the 24-month study period, as monitored by an independent statistician, unless the timing of this analysis would fall within 3 months  of  the  24-month  analysis.  The  last  projection  received  in  December  2009  estimated  that these  107  events  would  not  be  reached  at  least  3  months  prior  to  the  24-month  analysis  and accordingly, the first analysis was not performed. The CHMP considered this approach acceptable.

## Results

## Recruitment

The study was performed between 16 November 2006 (first subject, first visit) and 13 August 2010 (last subject, last visit). Eighty study centres across 28 countries randomized one or more subjects.

## Participant flow

A total of 517 subjects (ITT Population) were randomized and 515 subjects started the DB treatment (DB Safety Population), of which 339 subjects (65.8%) completed the 24-month DB treatment period; 120 subjects (23.3%) converted to CDMS and subsequently switched to OL RNF 44 mcg tiw (OL Safety Population) and 56 subjects (10.9%) prematurely discontinued treatment. The disposition of subjects is summarised in Figure 2.

## Demographics and other Baseline Characteristics

Baseline characteristics for the ITT population are summarized in table 4. The treatment groups were similar with respect to demographic, clinical and MRI parameters.

Overall, EDSS scores of randomized subjects were balanced across treatment groups at baseline. The median  EDSS  score  was  1.50  in  the  overall  population,  ranging  from  0.0  to  4.0.  The  majority  of subjects (83.9%) had a score between 1.0 and 2.5.

A single screening MRI scan was performed at least 30 days after the clinical event suggestive of MS and 10 days prior to study day 1. In the overall study population, 58.8% of subjects had no T1 Gdenhancing lesions, 17.6% of subjects had one lesion, 9.3% had two lesions and the remaining subjects had  three  or  more  lesions,  with  similar  distribution  across  the  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of subjects had at least 9 T2 lesions at screening. Furthermore, the majority of subjects received steroids for  the  first  clinical  event.  The  CHMP  noted  that  there  was  consistency  in  the  monofocal/  multifocal classification by the investigator and the Adjudication Committee. Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion that  the  study  population  was  similar  to  that  enrolled  in  other  beta  interferon  studies  and  was representative of the population observed in clinical practice.

## Outcomes and estimation

The  main  primary  endpoint  was  the  time  to  conversion  to  McDonald  MS  over  24 months,  for  RNF 44 mcg tiw and ow, as compared to placebo. The main secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to conversion to CDMS. The main efficacy results are summarized in table 5 and figures 3 and 4.

RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow statistically significantly delayed the conversion from the first clinical  event  to  McDonald  MS  as  compared  with  placebo  (adjusted  log-rank  test:  p&lt;0.001  and p=0.008, respectively). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the cumulative probability of conversion to McDonald MS over 24 months was 85.8% in the placebo group compared to 62.5% and 75.5% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow groups, respectively.

Similarly, RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow statistically significantly delayed the conversion from the  first  clinical  event  to  CDMS  as  compared  with  placebo  (adjusted  log-rank  test:  p&lt;0.001  and p=0.002, respectively). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the cumulative probability of conversion to CDMS over 24 months was 37.5% in the placebo group compared to 20.6% and 21.6% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow groups, respectively.

In an exploratory analysis, comparing the RNF 44 mcg tiw group to the 44 mcg ow group indicated a difference between the dose groups for McDonald MS (HR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.54, 0.91], log-rank test: p=0.009). This difference was not observed for time to conversion to CDMS (RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. RNF 44 mcg ow: HR = 0.90, 95% CI [0.56, 1.43], log-rank p=0.774).

## Sensitivity analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary endpoint including the following:

## Unadjusted Analysis

Treatment  group  comparison  and  treatment  effect  estimate  was  further  investigated  using  an unadjusted  Cox's  proportional  hazards  model.  The  pair-wise  comparison  of  active  treatment  groups versus placebo using a 2-sided unstratified log-rank test showed a statistically significant delay in the time to conversion to McDonald MS in RNF 44 mcg tiw (p-value &lt; 0.001) and ow (p-value = 0.004) treatment groups as compared to placebo.

## Interval-Censored Analysis

Conversion to McDonald MS could take place at a fixed time point dictated by the timing of the MRIs (every 3 months) or at the occurrence of the second clinical attack which could occur within an interval of time defined by visits. Additional sensitivity analysis was performed using statistical methods dealing with  interval-censored  type  of  data  as  parametric  estimations  using  Weibull  modelling.  Parameter estimates using both the adjusted and unadjusted Weibull models with  interval censoring showed a statistically significant reduction of the risk of converting to McDonald MS over 24 months both for RNF 44 mcg tiw (p-value &lt;0.001) and RNF 44 mcg ow (p-value = 0.001) compared to placebo.

## Analysis based on Initial Cut-Off Date

As the original First Analysis based on the McDonald conversions prior to Protocol Amendment 5 was performed  at  the  same  time  as  the  24-Month  Analysis  (as  per  Amendment  5),  the  number  of conversions to McDonald MS at the time of analysis was higher, providing higher power than initially defined. Therefore, the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint were also performed based on the initial cut-off date defined by the date when the 165 conversions to McDonald MS originally required were accumulated in the placebo group and the RNF 44 mcg tiw group combined. The results of these analyses were comparable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Per-Protocol Analysis

The primary and secondary analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, the unadjusted analysis and the interval-censored analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (as described above) were also performed on  the  PP  Population,  defined  as  all  subjects  from  the  ITT  population  who  did  not  have  any  major protocol deviations likely to interfere with the efficacy assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint.

The CHMP considered the results of sensitivity analyses to be consistent with the primary analyses.

## Subgroup analyses

The  primary  (time  to  McDonald  MS)  and  main  secondary  (time  to  CDMS)  efficacy  endpoints  were analyzed  by  subgroup,  using  the  randomization  stratification  factors:  age  (&lt;30  years, ≥ 30  years), classification of first clinical demyelinating event (Monofocal, Multifocal), steroid use at first demyelinating event (Yes, No) and presence of at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion at screening (Yes, No). Additional subgroup analyses based on other (a priori defined) factors included number of T2 lesions at screening visit (&lt;9 T2 lesions, ≥ 9 T2 lesions) and gender (Male, Female). The results are summarized in Tables 6 and 7 below.

The effect of RNF 44 mcg tiw on delaying the time to conversion to McDonald MS was maintained and statistically significant in all pre-defined subgroups except one (male [p=0.107]). The treatment effect of RNF 44 mcg ow did not reach statistical significance in several subgroups (&lt;30 years [p=0.072]; monofocal [p=0.074]; no steroid use at first demyelinating event [p=0.142]; no Gd-enhancing lesion at baseline [p=0.069] and male [p=0.694]).

Statistically  significant  effects  of  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  on  the  time  to  CDMS  were  observed  across  the subgroups  except  for  subjects  with  &lt;9  T2  lesions  at  screening  (p=0.081)  and  males  (p=0.076). Regarding RNF 44 mcg ow for time to conversion to CDMS, statistical significance was not reached in some cases (no steroid use at first demyelinating event [p=0.180]; no Gd-enhancing lesion at baseline [p=0.251]; &lt;9 T2 lesions at baseline [p=0.053] and male [p=0.138]).

## Secondary MRI-based Endpoints

## Mean number of CUA lesions

The main MRI-based secondary efficacy endpoint was the mean number of CUA lesions per subject per scan from randomization up to Month 24 or up to conversion to CDMS, whichever occurred first.

The main analysis of this endpoint consisted of the pair-wise comparison of the treatment groups at the  0.05  significance  level  using  a  non-parametric  ANOVA  on  ranks  model  including  treatment  and randomization stratification factors as covariates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within the double-blind period, the treatment with RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow reduced the mean number of CUA lesions per subject per scan (p&lt;0.001 for both). The comparison between RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow also showed statistically significant difference (p=0.002). The mean (SD) number of CUA lesions per subject per scan in the DB treatment period was 0.60 (1.15) in the RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group, 1.23 (4.26) in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group, and 2.70 (5.23) in the placebo treatment group.

## Other secondary efficacy variables

The  mean  number  of  new  T2  lesions  per  subject  per  scan  was  significantly  lower  in  subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg tiw (0.50) and in subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg ow (0.59) than in subjects randomized to Placebo (1.35).

The  mean  number  of  new  T1  hypointense  lesions  per  subject  per  scan  was  significantly  lower  in subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg tiw (0.35) and in subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg ow (0.46) than in subjects randomized to placebo (0.84).

The mean number of new Gd-enhancing lesions per subject per scan was significantly lower in subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg tiw (0.16) and in subjects randomized to RNF 44 mcg ow (0.35) than in subjects randomized to placebo (0.97).

Over the duration of 24 months in subjects with a first demyelinating event, small changes in EDSS scores were observed in all treatment groups over the entire study period, showing a mean change in EDSS score of -0.09 in the RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group, 0.01 in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group and 0.14 in the placebo treatment group. No clinically significant  changes  were  observed  for MSFC or its individual components.

## 4.2.3. Discussion of clinical efficacy

The MAH submitted results of study 27025 (a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing RNF 44 mcg tiw and 44 mcg ow vs. placebo in patients with CIS) to support the following indication:

## Rebif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing relapsing multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1).

With  respect  to  clinical  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  and  RNF  44  mcg  ow statistically  significantly  delayed  the  conversion  from  the  first  clinical  event  to  McDonald  MS  as compared  with  placebo  (adjusted  log-rank  test:  p&lt;0.001  and  p=0.008,  respectively).  Based  on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the cumulative probability of conversion to McDonald MS over 24 months was 85.8% in the placebo group compared to 62.5% and 75.5% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow groups, respectively.

Similarly, RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow statistically significantly delayed the conversion from the first clinical event to CDMS as compared with placebo (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). The cumulative  probability  of  conversion  to  CDMS  over  24  months  was  37.5%  in  the  placebo  group compared to 20.6% and 21.6% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw and RNF 44 mcg ow groups, respectively.

Thus, the CHMP was of the opinion that both dosing regimens of Rebif were indicative of an effect in delaying time to McDonald MS (2005) and time to CDMS in the study population enrolled.

Subjects had to have an EDSS score between 0 and 5.0 (inclusive) before the start of treatment. The mean  baseline  EDSS  score  was  1.53  in  the  placebo  treatment  group,  1.50  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  ow treatment  group  and  1.51  in  the  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  treatment  group.  The  median  (Q1;  Q3)  baseline EDSS score was 1.50 (1.00; 2.00) in all treatment groups. Over the duration of 24 months in subjects with a first demyelinating event, only small changes in EDSS scores were observed in all treatment groups over the entire study period, although this endpoint reached statistical significance (p=0.011) for RNF 44 mcg tiw vs. placebo at last observed value during the DB period (mean change in EDSS score: -0.09 in the RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group, 0.01 in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group, and 0.14 in the placebo treatment group). Although in the current study, conversion to CDMS was defined as  either  a  second  attack  or  a  sustained  increase  ( ≥ 1.5  points)  in  the  EDSS  score,  the  CHMP considered that there was no clinically significant increase in disability progression during the course of the study for any of the treatment groups.

During their review, the CHMP expressed concerns with respect to the definition of 'high-risk patient' used in the study 27025. This study included patients with a single, first clinical event suggestive of MS and at least 2 clinically silent T2 lesions, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which was ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. The CHMP noted that the definition of 'high risk to conversion' is not well established. Based on prior studies with other interferon products for similar indications, a more conservative  approach  was  previously  applied,  whereby  patients  with  at  least  nine  T2  hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan have been referred to in the product information. In a prior study with Betaferon (BENEFIT), a higher risk for progression to CDMS within 2 years was seen in monofocal patients with at least 9 T2 lesions or Gd-enhancement on the brain MRI at baseline. The risk of CDMS in the placebo group for patients with these characteristics increased from 31% in patients with &lt;9 T2 lesions to 55% in patients with ≥ 9  T2  lesions.  Similarly,  the  risk  of  CDMS  increased  from  36%  in  patients  without  Gd-enhancing lesions to 63% in patients with Gd-enhancing lesions.

Similar  trends  were  observed  in  the  current  study  27025.  Placebo  patients  with ≥ 9  T2  lesions  at baseline  had  an  estimated  40%  risk  of  developing  CDMS  over  2  years  as  compared  with  32%  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with less than 9 lesions. Placebo patients with Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline had 46% risk of developing CDMS, compared with 31% of patients with no such lesions.

Similarly,  placebo  patients  with ≥ 9  T2  lesions  at  baseline  had  an  estimated  96%  risk  to  develop McDonald MS over 2 years as compared with 62% of patients with less than 9 lesions. Placebo patients with Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline had 94% risk to develop McDonald MS, compared with 79% of patients with no such lesions. Considering these data, the CHMP was of the view that those patients with ≥ 9 T2 lesions at baseline and/or those patients with Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline could be seen as a population at highest risk of conversion within 2 years.

In the current study, statistically significant reductions in time to CDMS were only observed in those patients with ≥ 9 T2 lesions and/or presence of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, in both the 44 mcg tiw and ow dose groups. For time to McDonald MS, statistically significant effects were observed for all four subgroups, but only for the RNF 44 mcg tiw dose. The CHMP considered that positive trends were seen in all patient categories and the lack of statistical significance could be due to a lower number of subjects in some subgroups.

Overall, given the current data, the CHMP concluded that patients with ≥ 9 T2 at baseline and/or with Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline could be seen to be at highest risk of conversion within 2 years, and requested that the MAH revise the text in section 5.1 of the SmPC as follows:

'For  the  time  being  there  is  no  well  established  definition  of  a  high  risk  patient,  although  a  more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk.'

The CHMP considered that steroid treatment of the first event was not mandated by the protocol, but given at the discretion of the investigator. Overall, 365 out of 517 randomized subjects (71%) received steroids  (i.v.  in  most  cases)  to  treat  the  first  clinical  demyelinating  event.  Subjects  who  received steroids at baseline and who were allocated to placebo, RNF 44 mcg ow and RNF 44 mcg tiw had a cumulative probability of 86%, 74% and 65%, respectively of converting to McDonald MS, compared with 85%, 78% and 56%, of subjects who did not, respectively. Similarly, subjects receiving steroids and who were allocated to placebo, RNF 44 mcg ow and RNF 44 mcg tiw had a cumulative probability of  39%,  22%  and  24%,  respectively  of  converting  to  CDMS,  compared  with  34%,  21%  and  12%, respectively  who  had  not.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  subgroup  with  no  prior  steroid  therapy  was relatively small (approximately 30% of the population), but considered that the data indicated a very similar magnitude of effect in both patient categories. In this context, the CHMP was of the opinion that intravenous steroid treatment need not be a mandatory component for selecting high-risk patients for treatment with Rebif. Thus, the CHMP concluded that restricting the indication to patients severe enough to warrant treatment with intravenous steroids was not necessary.

The CHMP considered that exploratory analyses were done comparing the two dosing regimens; these showed no statistically significant differences between the 44 mcg tiw and ow dose groups with respect to  CDMS  (p=0.774).  However,  the  difference  between  the  tiw  and  ow  dose  groups  for  time  to McDonald  MS  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.009).  Furthermore,  44  mcg  tiw  was  observed  to statistically  significantly  reduce  the  mean  number  of  CUA  lesions  per  subject  per  scan  (p=0.002) compared to 44 mcg ow.

Overall, the CHMP concluded that study 27075 has shown a benefit of treatment with Rebif in patients with CIS. Based on the current data this was most consistently shown for the 44 mcg tiw treatment group. The results were statistically significant for both time to McDonald MS (2005) and time to CDMS in those patient categories previously considered by CHMP as 'high risk', namely those patients with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

≥ 9 T2 lesions and/or those patients with presence of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, and regardless of monofocal or multifocal disease presentation.

The rationale for the alternative 44 mcg ow dosing regimen was questioned by the CHMP. Although it was acknowledged that once-weekly dosing may enhance patient adherence to therapy, the CHMP was concerned that based on the data available, efficacy of this dosing regimen could be inferior to the thrice weekly treatment and requested that the MAH should further discuss the rationale for proposing a 44 mcg ow dose regimen from an efficacy and safety/tolerability point of view. Eventually, the MAH took the decision not to pursue the once-weekly posology in the current procedure. Consequently, the Type IB variation to introduce additional pack sizes for the PFP and PFS initiation packs, relevant to the once weekly dosing, was no longer needed and therefore, the MAH withdrew the type IB variation.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The  double  blind  (DB)  safety  population  consisted  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least one dose of study drug.  A subpopulation, referred to as the 'OL safety population' consisted of all subjects from the DB safety population who received at least one open label study treatment injection with RNF 44 mcg tiw after having converted to CDMS. The DB Safety Population included 515 subjects, 171 subjects in the placebo treatment group, 173 in the RNF 44 mcg ow group and 171 in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group (see section Participant flow).

A total of 130 subjects converted to CDMS and of these, 120 subjects (59 in the placebo treatment group, 30 in the RNF 44 mcg ow group and 31 in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group) switched to OL RNF 44 mcg tiw and were included in the OL safety population. A descriptive summary of the safety population is provided in table 2.

Demographic characteristics of subjects in the DB safety population were balanced across treatment groups and similar to the ITT population.

## Treatment exposure

Table  9  summarises  the  study  drug  exposure  during  the  DB  treatment  period  (up  to  24 months  or conversion to CDMS, whichever occurred first). The mean time on treatment was slightly lower in the placebo treatment group (533.1 days) as compared to the active treatment groups (604.0 days in the RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group and 609.5 days in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group). This was consistent with the higher CDMS conversion rate in the placebo treatment group as compared to both active treatment groups. Treatment exposure during the OL period was similar between the treatment groups (initial placebo, initial RNF 44 mcg ow and initial RNF mcg tiw).

During the blinded treatment period, the RNF treatment groups showed an AE pattern as expected for IFN beta-1a, with a higher incidence of AEs such as influenza-like illness, pyrexia and injection site erythema than placebo. The injection site erythema AEs occurred more frequently in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group than in the 44 mcg ow group. The incidence of influenza like illness and pyrexia was slightly higher for the RNF 44 mcg ow group than the 44 mcg tiw group. Most AEs across the treatment groups were mild or moderate in intensity.

## AEs of special interest

Adverse  events  of  interest  with  interferon-beta-1a  treatment  included  the  following  pre-specified groups: flu-like syndrome, cytopenia, hepatic disorders, thyroid disorders, hypersensitivity reactions, skin rashes, depression and suicidal ideation and injection site reactions. The incidence of these events is summarized in table 14.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Increased  incidence  of  AEs  related  to  IFN  beta-1a  treatment  was  observed  in  the  RNF  44  mcg treatment groups as compared to placebo.

A similar analysis for the OL treatment showed an increased incidence of flu-like illness and injection site  reactions  in  newly  exposed  subjects  (those  subjects  initially  in  the  placebo  group),  which  was considered expected by the CHMP.

## Serious adverse events

Two deaths occurred during the study, both in the placebo group during the DB treatment period (one patient with a history of cholecystolithiasis died of severe acute pancreatic necrosis and one patient died due to fatal hematoma after surgery for subtotal excision of glioblastoma).

Serious adverse events (SAEs) other than the two fatal events were reported in 12 subjects (7.0%) in the placebo treatment group, 8 subjects (4.6%) in the RNF 44 mcg ow group and 6 subjects (3.5%) in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group.

There were 6 subjects in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group with one or more SAEs (other than death) that occurred  during  the  DB  treatment  period,  including  cases  of  appendicitis  (3),  dermoid  cyst  (1), tonsillitis  (1),  drug  hypersensitivity (1), deafness congenital (1) and acute myocardial infarction (1). There were 8 subjects in the RNF 44 mcg ow group that experienced one or more SAEs: spontaneous abortion (1), hypacusis (1), cervical polyp (1), varicella (1), nasal septum deviation (1), iron deficiency anemia (1), tibia fracture (1), muscle rupture (1) and tonsillar disorder (1).

These SAEs were either assessed unlikely to be related or unrelated to the IMP by the MAH, the CHMP also considered a possible relationship to Rebif in these cases unlikely.

SAEs assessed as possibly related to study drug included a case of varicella in one subject treated with RNF 44 mcg ow and 2 spontaneous abortions, one in a subject receiving placebo and one in a subject receiving RNF 44 mcg ow.

The SAE of varicella concerned a 26-year-old female with a history of varicella infection. She developed symptoms  of  varicella  approximately  20  weeks  after  starting  treatment  with  RNF  44  mcg  ow.  She received treatment with acyclovir and the event was considered resolved within a week. According to the  narrative,  a  search  of  the  safety  database  identified  other  confirmed  reports  of  varicella infection/herpes zoster/shingles in patients treated with Rebif (with lack of clarity as to whether this includes any cases of primary infection).

In the OL period, SAEs were reported in one subject initially randomized to placebo (brief psychotic disorder)  and  one  subject  initially  randomized  to  RNF  44  mcg  tiw  (cholelithiasis).  Both  events  were assessed as unrelated to the study drug by the investigator.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

During the DB treatment period, 6 subjects (3.5%) in the placebo treatment group, 4 subjects (2.3%) in the RNF 44 mcg ow treatment group and 5 subjects (2.9%) in the RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment group permanently discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. Two additional subjects in the placebo treatment group discontinued due to pregnancy.

The most common reason for discontinuation was influenza-like illness (2 subjects each in the RNF 44 mcg ow and 44 mcg tiw group). One subject in the 44 mcg tiw group was discontinued due to mild increase in liver transaminases considered possibly related to study drug.

During  the  OL  treatment  period,  three  subjects  permanently  discontinued  treatment  because  of increase in ALT and AST, one in each treatment group. In addition, one subject initially treated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

RNF 44 mcg tiw discontinued  treatment  permanently  due  to  injection  site  pain.  One  subject  in  the initial placebo group switching to RNF tiw discontinued treatment due to pregnancy.

## Laboratory findings

Most laboratory parameters remained within the normal range during the DB treatment period.

## Haematology

The  majority  of  worst  post-baseline  CTCAE  grades  in  the  DB  treatment  period  for  each  of  the haematology assessments were Grade 0 or 1 for all treatment groups. The most notable toxicity shifts were seen for haemoglobin, WBC count, neutrophils and lymphocytes. There was a greater frequency of Grade 2 and Grade 3 toxicity for WBC count, neutrophils and lymphocytes in the two RNF treatment groups compared with the placebo group. One Grade 4 shift was observed in the placebo group for neutrophils in a subject with a normal baseline value. No Grade 4 toxicities were observed in the RNF treatment groups.

## Biochemistry

The majority of the worst post-baseline CTCAE toxicity grades in the DB treatment period for each of the biochemistry assessments were Grade 0 or 1 for all treatment groups. The most notable toxicity shifts were reported for total bilirubin, AST and ALT.

In the placebo group, there was one case of Grade 2 toxicity for total bilirubin in a subject who had a normal  value  at  baseline.  Two  subjects  with  normal  baseline  values  and  one  subject  with  Grade  1 baseline  value  shifted  to  Grade  2  toxicity  for  AST.  Six  subjects  with  normal  baseline  values  and one subject with Grade 1 baseline value shifted to Grade 2 toxicity for ALT and 1 subject with normal baseline value developed Grade 3 toxicity.

In the RNF 44 mcg ow group, a shift to Grade 2 toxicity for total bilirubin occurred in one subject with normal baseline value and one subject with Grade 1 baseline value. Five subjects with normal baseline values  shifted  to  Grade  2  toxicity  for  AST.  Seven  subjects  with  normal  baseline  values  and  three subjects with Grade 1 baseline values shifted to Grade 2 toxicity for ALT, whereas five subjects with normal baseline values and one subject with Grade 1 baseline values shifted to Grade 3 toxicity.

In the RNF 44 mcg tiw group, thirteen subjects with normal baseline values shifted to Grade 2 toxicity for AST and two subjects shifted to Grade 3. Nineteen subjects with normal baseline values and three subjects with Grade 1 baseline values shifted to Grade 2 toxicity for ALT. Eight subjects with normal baseline values and three subjects with Grade 1 baseline values shifted to Grade 3. A shift from normal to Grade 4 toxicity was reported for one subject.

Overall, haematology parameters such as haemoglobin, platelets, WBC counts, lymphocyte counts and neutrophil  counts  were  lower  in  both  active  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group, generally with a dose dependent decrease. The RNF 44 mcg tiw treatment regimen showed a higher frequency of abnormally high AST and ALT values compared with the RNF 44 mcg ow regimen.

## Immunogenicity

Samples  for  immunogenicity  assessments  were  taken  at  6-monthly  intervals.  No  sampling  was performed at conversion to CDMS (at the end of the DB Period). The same ELISA for binding antibodies (BAbs)  and  the  same  cell-based  assay  for  the  determination  of  neutralizing  anti-interferon-beta antibodies (NAbs), i.e. the cytopathic effect (CPE) assay that was used for previous Rebif studies, was used in study 27025.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  samples were screened for BAbs and BAb positive samples were further tested for NAbs, as the ELISA test for BAbs was found to be an effective screening procedure for NAbs. NAb positivity was defined by a titer of ≥ 20 NU/ml.

Twenty-five (14.8%) subjects treated with RNF 44 mcg tiw were NAb-positive at the Last Observed Visit (LOV) of the 24-month study period. The proportion of subjects treated with RNF 44 mcg tiw who were  NAb-positive  at  any  time  during  the  24  months  was  15.4%;  the  median  NAb  titer  was  1345 NU/ml. Twenty-eight (16.7%) subjects treated with RNF 44 mcg ow were NAb-positive at the LOV of the whole study period. The proportion of subjects treated with RNF 44 mcg ow who were NAb-positive at any time during the 24 months was 18.5%; the median NAb titer was 393 NU/ml.

The  CHMP  considered  that  similar  NAb-positive  rates  were  observed  with  ow  and  tiw  dosing,  at  a frequency in line with that previously observed with RNF treatment. Median titers were lower with the 44 mcg ow treatment. Antibody formation will be further followed in an extension study, which the CHMP considered of interest with regard to long-term efficacy and safety.

## 4.2.4. Discussion of clinical safety

The CHMP considered that during the blinded treatment period, the RNF treatment groups showed an AE pattern as could be expected of interferon beta-1a, with a higher incidence of adverse events such as influenza-like illness, pyrexia and injection site erythema compared to placebo.

In the context of varicella reports identified in the MAH´s safety database, the CHMP requested that the MAH discuss whether 'varicella infection' and/or 'herpes zoster' should be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In response to this request, the MAH provided a cumulative review and a detailed analysis of herpes zoster and varicella Infection cases. The CHMP was of the opinion that the review did not indicate an increased risk of herpes zoster/ varicella in MS patients treated with Rebif and agreed that the company will continue to monitor these cases as part of the routine pharmacovigilance activities.

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  incidence  of  injection  site  erythema  AEs,  as  well  as  laboratory abnormalities such as elevated liver transaminases was slightly lower in the RNF  44 mcg ow group than in the 44 mcg tiw group, whereas the incidence of influenza-like illness and pyrexia was slightly higher. Over the double-blind period of study 27025, the proportion of patients experiencing flu-like symptoms at any time was 70.5% in the RNF 44 mcg ow group compared with 54.4% in the RNF 44 mcg tiw group. Similarly, 12.7% of patients in the 44 mcg ow group experienced pyrexia, compared with 3.5% in the tiw group. The CHMP considered that this could be a random finding or, as discussed by the MAH, the difference in incidence could be explained by the more sustained level of IFN-beta effect  with  fewer  peaks  and  troughs  in  the  tiw  compared  with  the  ow  dosing.  As  mentioned  in  the clinical  efficacy  section,  the  alternative  ow  dosing  regimen  was  withdrawn  by  the  MAH  during  the procedure and thus, the CHMP agreed that this observation did not need to be discussed further.

From a safety perspective, the CHMP concluded that the overall safety and tolerability profile for Rebif was as expected and did not lead to any new safety concerns.

## 4.3. Risk management plan

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  dossier,  was  of  the  opinion  that  no  new pharmacovigilance activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the safety of the product.

With  this  procedure,  the  opportunity  was  taken  to  introduce  the  standard  text  regarding  the  risk management plan submission requirements in the Annex II.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed (new text= underlined, deleted text= strikethrough). The changes shown below are those related to the extension of indication, for a complete set of changes see Attachment 1 to this report.

## Summary of Product Characteristics

## Section 4.1

Rebif is indicated for the treatment of

-  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active  inflammatory  process,  if  alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1)
-  patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1).

Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapsing activity (see section 5.1).

## Section 4.2

Posology

...

## First demyelinating event

The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif given three times per week by subcutaneous injection.

## Section 4.8

...

The data presented isare obtained from pooled controlled clinical studies in multiple sclerosis (placebo=824 patients; Rebif 22 micrograms three times per week (TIW)=398 patients; Rebif 44 micrograms TIW=727 patients) and shows the frequency of adverse reactions observed at six months (in excess over placebo). Adverse reactions are listed below by frequency of occurrence and by MedDRA System Organ Class.

## Section 5.1

## Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis

One 2-year  controlled  clinical  trial  with  Rebif  was  performed  in  patients  with  a  single  clinical  event suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had  at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.

Patients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per  week,  Rebif  44 micrograms  once  weekly,  or  placebo.  If  a  second  clinical  demyelinating  event

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occurred  confirming  definite  multiple  sclerosis,  patients  switched  to  the  recommended  posology  of Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to initial randomisation. Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this study are as follows:

For  the  time  being  there  is  no  well  established  definition  of  a  high  risk  patient,  although  a  more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk.

## Package Leaflet

## Section 1

Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients who have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis.

## Section 3

Dose

## Patients who have experienced a single clinical event

The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week for adults and adolescents from 16 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Norway and Romania.

## 5. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Overall, the CHMP was of the view that results of study 27075 supported a positive benefit-risk balance of Rebif in the treatment in patients with clinically isolated syndrome to delay a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Based on the available data, this was most consistently observed with the 44 mcg tiw (three times a week) treatment group. The results were statistically significant for both time to McDonald MS (2005) and time to CDMS in those patient categories previously considered by CHMP as 'high risk', namely those patients with ≥ 9 T2 lesions and/or those patients with presence of Gd-enhancing lesions at  baseline  and  regardless  of  the  monofocal  or  multifocal  disease  presentation.  From  a  safety perspective, the overall safety and tolerability profile of Rebif was as expected and did not lead to any new safety concerns.

In conclusion, the submitted data were considered to support the following indication:

'Rebif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  a  single  demyelinating  event  with  an  active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1).

Section 5.1

...

For  the  time  being  there  is  no  well  established  definition  of  a  high  risk  patient,  although  a  more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk.'

The CHMP noted that the MAH is conducting an extension study REFLEXION, a double-blind extension of  the  study  27025  to  obtain  long-term  follow-up  data  in  patients  with  clinically  definite  MS  and patients with a first demyelinating event at high risk of converting to multiple sclerosis, treated with Rebif New Formulation. The CHMP was of the view that this extension study could provide additional comparative  data  on  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  both  dosing  regimens  (tiw  and  ow)  and recommended that these be submitted for review once available.

With  respect  to  the  Type  IB  variation  initially  submitted  in  a  group  with  the  Type  II  variation  extension of indication, the CHMP concluded that the approval of the additional pack sizes was linked to the approval of the 44 mcg once weekly dosing regimen. Since the MAH decided not to pursue the alternative ow dosing regimen, the above mentioned type IB variation was withdrawn at the time of response to  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  and  the  evaluation  procedure  was  finalised accordingly (see section 6 - Recommendations).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   |                                                                                                                      | Type   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6 a)             | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Extension of indication: Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and sections 1 and 3 of the Package Leaflet to include information on a new indication, i.e. treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis. These updates affect the PI of the 44 mcg presentations (pre-filled syringe, pre-filled pen and cartridges) and the  PI  of  the  initiation  pack  presentations  (pre-filled  syringe,  pre-filled  pen  and  cartridges).    In addition, minor editorial changes were implemented across the SmPC and the Package leaflet, and the DDPS version number was removed from Annex II. Furthermore, Annex II was updated to introduce the  standard  text  regarding  the  risk  management  system.  The  MAH  also  took  the  opportunity  to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet.

## Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## Pharmacovigilance system

The  MAH  must  ensure  that  the  system  of  pharmacovigilance  presented  in  Module  1.8.1  of  the Marketing Authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

## Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The  MAH  shall  perform  the  pharmacovigilance  activities  detailed  in  the  Pharmacovigilance  Plan,  as agreed  in  the  RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  and  any  subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

-  When  new  information  is  received  that  may  impact  on  the  current  Safety  Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities
-  Within  60  days  of  an  important  (pharmacovigilance  or  risk  minimisation)  milestone  being reached
-  At the request of the European Medicines Agency

## PSURs

The MAH will submit PSURs on an annual basis until otherwise specified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 7. EPAR changes

The  EPAR  will  be  updated  following  Commission  Decision  for  this  variation.  In  particular  the  EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of indication: Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and sections 1 and 3 of the Package Leaflet to include information on a new indication, i.e. treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis. These updates affect the PI of the 44 mcg presentations (pre-filled syringe, pre-filled pen and cartridges) and the  PI  of  the  initiation  pack  presentations  (pre-filled  syringe,  pre-filled  pen  and  cartridges).    In addition, minor editorial changes were implemented across the SmPC and the Package leaflet and the DDPS version number was removed from Annex II. Furthermore, Annex II was updated to introduce the  standard  text  regarding  the  risk  management  system.  The  MAH  also  took  the  opportunity  to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

## Summary

The revised CHMP variation assessment report will be published as part of the EPAR, following review/ deletion of confidential information.
