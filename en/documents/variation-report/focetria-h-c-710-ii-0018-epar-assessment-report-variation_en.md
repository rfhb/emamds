## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## I.1. Introduction

Focetria  is  a  pandemic  H1N1v  vaccine.  The  strain  change  of  the  mock-up  vaccine  from  H5N1  to H1N1v was approved on 29/09/09 (EMEA/H/C/710/PU/05).

Medicinal product no longer authorised The current posology reflected in the product information was based initially on data from the mockup  H5N1  vaccine  and  data  from  clinical  trials  with  the  H1N1  vaccine  strain.  The  marketing authorisation  holder  (MAH)  continues  with  the  programme  of  H1N1  studies  to  fulfil  the  specific obligations  agreed  and  results  are  submitted  at  regular  timepoints.  In  this  framework,  the  CHMP assessed  the  interim  analysis  including  immunogenicity  and  safety  data  as  available  up  to  27 November  2009 for the study V111\\_03 in children and adolescentsin the context of SOB 28.1. Based on the assessment of the data, the Committee considered that a type II variation should be submitted to update the product information (PI). The MAH provided the abridged  study report of study V111\\_03 post  day  1  on  16  December  2009.  The  submission  of  the  report  fulfils  one  of  the  MAH's  specific obligations  as  outlined  in  Annex  II  to  this  opinion.  This  report  will  be  the  subject  of  an  additional assessment. Furthermore  Section  4.8  is  updated  at  the  request  of  the  CHMP  following  the  evaluation  of  the simplified periodic safety update report 1 (sPSUR 1) (reporting period 5 October 2009 - 02 November 2009) and sPSUR 2 (reporting period 03 November - 30 November 2009) to include adverse drug Reactions reported for Focetria in post marketing surveillance. I.2 Clinical immunogenicity and safety Study design Study V111\\_03 is an ongoing, randomised, single-blind, dose-ranging study in infants, children and adolescents  from  6  months  to  17  years  of  age  aimed  to  evaluate  immunogenicity,  safety  and tolerability of different formulations of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted egg-derived, inactivated novel swine origin A/H1N1 monovalent subunit influenza virus vaccine in healthy subjects. The study includes 4 cohorts and recruitment started in parallel for subjects of cohorts 1-3 (17-9 years of age, 9-3 years of age, 3-1 year of age, respectively). Enrolment of the subjects in cohort 4 (children aged 6 to 11 months) started after 7-day safety and reactogenicity data of the first dose administered to the first 120 subjects enrolled in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 was assessed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Two doses of vaccine were administered intramuscularly (IM) three weeks apart. After approximately 12  months  from  the  first  vaccination,  all  subjects  will  receive  a  third  vaccine  dose  (booster).  All subjects will be analysed for safety and immunogenicity. Subjects will be followed until approximately 6 months after the last (booster) dose, for safety assessment. The vaccination groups were defined as noted below: 3.75ug\\_50: 7.5ug\\_100 15ug\\_0

Immunogenicity  analyses  were  based  on  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  and  subjects  were  analysed  as randomised.  Measurements  were  made  against  CHMP  criteria  as  determined  by  hemagglutination inhibition  (HI).  The  MAH  also  presented  data  for  measures  of  immunogenicity  as  determined  by microneutralisation (MN).

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to identify the preferred vaccine formulation (with or without MF59), dosage (1/2 vs 1 dose of antigen and adjuvant) and schedule (one or two administrations) of the  egg-derived  H1N1sw  monovalent  vaccine  in  healthy  children  and  adolescents  based  on  CHMP criteria and pairwise statistical comparisons for immunogenicity, safety and tolerability.

Secondary objectives include the evaluation of immunogenicity of a booster dose of the egg-derived H1N1sw monovalent influenza vaccine administered 12 months after the primary course with respect to  CHMP  criteria;  and  the  evaluation  of  the  non-inferiority  of  the  post-vaccination  (day  43)  HI, geometric  mean  titer  (GMT)  of  the  half  dose  (3.75  µg  of  HA  +  half  MF59)  of  the  egg  derived H1N1sw monovalent vaccine to the corresponding GMTs of the full dose (7.5 µg of HA + full MF59) of the egg derived H1N1sw monovalent vaccine, after two doses administered 3 weeks apart in the pooled children population.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Safety  objectives  include  the  evaluation  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  egg-derived  H1N1sw monovalent vaccine for 3 weeks after first and second vaccination and up to 6 months after the last (booster) vaccination. Study population The study population included healthy males and females aged 6 months to 17 years on the day of enrollment.  The  demographic  characteristics  of  the  different  cohorts  were  presented  and  no  major difference was detected across vaccination groups. The number of subjects available for the analysis of immunogenicity and safety is shown in the table below.

In the age-group 9-17 years the results from the second dose are almost complete, while data for only half of the children in the age-group 3-8 at day 43 are reported.  In the age-groups 12-35 months and 3-8 years a small group of subjects has received the non-adjuvated vaccine. Partial data are reported.

Medicinal product no longer authorised IMM= immunogenicity; L&amp;S=local &amp; systemic reactions for 7 days post vaccination; AE=adverse events * most adverse events relate to the period post 1 st vaccination. Exposure times differed. ** available in database at cut-off for data inclusion (28 October 2009) The data provided were used for the interim assessment of the effect of vaccination at day 22 and day 43 in cohorts 1 (children and adolescents aged 9-17 years of age) and cohort 2 (children aged 3-8 years of age). Data for the younger subjects (cohorts 3 and 4) are incomplete due to the slow enrollment of subjects in these age groups.

Data are considered insufficient in the younger cohorts, while data for cohort 1 and 2 was considered sufficient. Results for cohorts other than 1 and 2 are sometimes reported for completeness.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The CHMP criteria were met with both formulations of the adjuvated vaccines. At day 22 GMR were higher  in  subjects  seronegative  at  baseline.  Subjects  seropositive  at  baseline  show  higher  GMR following  the  administration  of  the  full  dose  of  Focetria.  However  the  clinical  meaning  of  these observations is  unclear.  Seroconversion  or  significant  increase  in  antibody  titres  was  systematically higher in recipients of full dose of Focetria. The second dose added further benefit. Presence of functional antibodies induced by vaccination was assessed in a subgroup of study subjects. Results of MN were provided and are shown below.

Although precise cut-off points have not been defined for MN assay it was noted that at day 22 a very high proportion of tested subjects show an increase of titres of at least 4 times.

A  good  immune  response  was  also  shown  when  results  were  tabulated  by  presence  of  antibodies detectable at baseline with HI or MN assay. High proportions of subjects show MN titres as high as 1:160.

## Clinical Safety

For  subjects  aged  3  to  17  years  (cohorts  1  and  2)  local  reactions  included  ecchymosis,  erythema, induration,  swelling  and  pain  at  injection  site  and  systemic  reactions  headache,  arthralgia,  chills, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, nausea and sweating.

For subjects aged 6 to 35 months (cohorts 3 and 4) local reactions comprised ecchymosis, erythema, induration, swelling and tenderness and systemic reactions sleepiness, diarrhoea, vomiting, irritability, change in eating habits, shivering and unusual crying.

There was no potentially life threatening event reported.

In  the  cohort  4  (6-11  months)  there  was  no  description  of  severe  local  reactions.  Most  common systemic reactions were irritability, sleepiness, diarrhoea, change in eating habits and unusual crying. There were no cases of fever above 40° C although the number of observations is still low to detect uncommon reactions.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The use of a reduced dose of the vaccine is associated with a slight reduction of local reactogenicity in subjects of any age. Reactogenicity at the second dose is generally lower compared to the first dose. The  reactogenicity  for  the  subgroup  recipient  of  non  adjuvanted  vaccine  is  reduced  only  for  local reactions. In the cohort 3 (12-35 months) most common systemic reactions after both the doses were sleepiness, irritability and unusual crying. There were 2 cases of fever above 40 C in the 3.75 ug group after the first dose.

The proposed changes to SPC section 4.8 regarding the addition of post marketing data for Focetria has been agreed by the CHMP.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Gastrointestinal disorders Nervous system disorders Immune system disorders * Category Anaphylaxis, as defined via the narrow definition of the SMQ 'Anaphylactic reaction' and the narrow definition of the SMQ 'Angioedema': 5 anaphylactic reaction - 3 anaphylactic shock - 1 circulatory collapse- 17 urticaria- 5 angioedema- 3 eyelid oedema- 4 laryngeal oedema- 1 periorbital oedema- 2 pharyngeal oedema- 2 swelling face- 2 lip swelling- 1 swollen tongue II. CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION The proposed changes to sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) were reviewed and generally agreed with. Although study V111\\_03 is still ongoing, the data on cohort 2 (3-8) is considered quantitatively sufficient to be added to the Product Information.  The committee noted that the preliminary H1N1 data  in children aged 3-8 years show that there is a further immune response  to  a  second  dose  of  0.5  ml  administered  after  an  interval  of  three  weeks.  The  posology section  has  been  re-worded  to  reflect  this.  In  addition  further  data  are  available  in  the  9-17  years cohort. This has been reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC.  Immunogenicity data from younger cohorts, and data from the half dose is also reassuring, although numbers are too small to allow any definitive conclusion at this point in time. The respective changes were introduced in the package leaflet (PL). A revision of the wording was submitted taking into account the results of the assessment and this was agreed with by the CHMP.

Other changes made to the product information include a change to the order of data presentation in section 5.1, to present H1N1 data at the beginning of this section. In addition the MAH updated Annex II regarding the specific obligations. Due to slow enrolment there will be a delay in the availability of data in Cohort 4.  In addition the version number of the Detailed Description of the Pharmacovigilance System (DDPS) has been corrected.

## III. OVERALL DISCUSSION AND BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT

Preliminary  data  from  study  V111\\_03  have  previously  shown  that  the  use  of  a  single  full  dose  of Focetria in subjects aged 9-17 years may be sufficient. Further data now available from study V111\\_3 showed that the CHMP criteria were met, and in particular results were  considered relevant for an update of the posology related to children aged 3-8 years. In the 3-8 year old cohort, 100% of subjects were seroprotected, with 99% seroconversion or significant increase and GMR of 29. The subgroup analyses by baseline serostatus were reassuring with seronegative subjects also reaching the CHMP criteria.  Although  the  data  presented  are  reassuring  regarding  the  effect  of  a  single  full  dose  of Focetria in subjects aged 3-8 years, preliminary  data indicate  that there is a further immune response to a second dose:   an increase in overall GMT from 281 to 667 was observed  and an increase in GMT from 218 to 733 in children who were seronegative at baseline. This has been reflected in the Product Information.  Study V111\\_03 is on-going and further results will provide indications about the effect of the second dose and its potential benefit.

Medicinal product no longer authorised With  regards  to  data  in  the  younger  cohorts  and  the  half  dose  of  Focetria  it  was  agreed  that  the available data are so far too premature to allow for a change of posology. Considering the ongoing immunisation  program,  and  the  current  recommended  posology  of  administering  two  full  doses  of Focetria,  the  inclusion  of  results  of  the  first  dose  is  appropriate  while  considerations  about  the adoption of half dose are to be postponed to the availability of the complete analyses of data to be submitted in January 2010. Additional statistical analyses by history of flu vaccinations, serostatus at baseline, and age-groups are requested to be included in the final report to be submitted.  Variability in immunological results obtained by subjects enrolled across the study sites should also be described. The preliminary safety data after the first dose in children and adolescents 3-8 years of age suggest a comparable safety profile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation. The use of reduced dose of vaccine is associated with a slight reduction of local reactogenicity in subjects of any age. Reactogenicity after the second dose is generally lower compared to the first dose.
