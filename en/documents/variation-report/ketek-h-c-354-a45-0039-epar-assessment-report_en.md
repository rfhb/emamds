## I. INTRODUCTION

On 10 December 2008, the MAH submitted 35 completed paediatric studies for Ketek, in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC)No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Ketek and that there is no consequential regulatory action. In addition, the following documentation has been included as per the procedural guidance: -A line listing II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION Telithromycin, a ketolide antibiotic chemically related to the macrolides, was introduced to the European market 2001.  Telithromycin was originally approved for the treatment of community acquired lower and upper respiratory tract infections.   In June 2007, the CHMP decided to restrict the indication due to safety concerns to: When prescribing Ketek, consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents and the local prevalence of resistance (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). Ketek is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: In patients of 18 years and older: · Community-acquired pneumonia, mild or moderate (see section 4.4). · When treating infections caused by known or suspected beta-lactam and/or macrolide resistant strains (according to history of patients or national and/or regional resistance data) covered by the antibacterial spectrum of telithromycin (see sections 4.4 and 5.1): - Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, - Acute sinusitis In patients of 12 years and older: ·Tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by S treptococcus pyogenes , as an alternative when beta lactam antibiotics are not appropriate in countries/regions with a significant prevalence of macrolide resistant S. pyogenes , when mediated by ermTR or mefA (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Following the partly revised benefit/risk evaluation by the CHMP in June 2007, mainly based on safety concerns regarding risk for hepatotoxicity, visual disturbances, transient loss of consciousness as well as potential to increase QT interval, the MAH took the decision to stop the paediatric development program of telithromycin, dated 3 October 2007. On the 13 December 2007 the CHMP adopted the conclusion to support the decision to stop the paediatric development, and committed to assess the clinical study reports when available. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In an EMEA letter dated 4 December 2008 (ref. EMEA/648008/2008) the MAH was requested to dispatch to the CHMP members and EMEA all existing data/information of telithromycin in paediatric patients, submitted according to Article 45 regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study reports of the completed paediatric clinical phase III studies were previously submitted by sanofi-aventis in June 2008, as per regulation 1901/2006, Article 46. Data included a summary of the telithromycin paediatric data (pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical) that supported the initiation of the clinical program and the results of the phase III telithromycin clinical paediatric studies that were initiated in June 2005 and voluntarily stopped by sanofi-aventis in September 2007. This article 46 procedure was finalised in March 2009. As it was mutually agreed October 2007 to stop the paediatric development program of telithromycin, neither the MAH nor the CHMP intend to include a paediatric indication. However, as a result of the article 46 procedure the MAH was requested to submit a type II variation addressing the required amendments in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2, related to paediatric use of telithromycin, see below.

Oral  administration  of  a  standard  and  an  impurity-enriched  batch  for  2  days  at  doses  of  50  or  150 mg/kg/day to juvenile rats (dosing starting on postnatal Day 5) induced mortality at 150 mg/kg/day (15/20 and 19/20 pups, respectively, within 2 days). The death of a single pup at 50 mg/kg/day with the impurityenriched batch was considered most likely incidental and not related to compound administration. Daily oral administration of standard batches to juvenile rats at 50 mg/kg/day for 7 days produced no deaths, no clinical signs and no body weight changes. Therefore, under these study conditions, the dose level of 150 mg/kg/day given as a solution was a lethal dose and the dose of 50 mg/kg/day was a No-Observed Effect Level,  based  on  clinical  endpoints.  There  was  no  clear  difference  in  the  toxicity  profile  between  the standard and the impurity-enriched batches.

II.1 Non-clinical aspects The  non-clinical  paediatric  development  for  telithromycin  consisted  of  studies  carried  out  in  juvenile animals, to  specifically  address  potential  toxicity  in  these  animals.  Single  and  repeat  dose  studies  were performed in young rats and young dogs. See list of non-clinical studies above. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a 4 week rat study there were no compound-related changes in organ weights, and no compound-related macroscopic observations. There were no compound-related microscopic changes in rats treated with the impurity-enriched  batch.  Very  minimal  compound-related  microscopic  changes,  consisting  of  very minimal foamy alveolar macrophage collections in the lungs or minimal epithelioid macrophages in the medullary cords and paracortex of the mesenteric lymph node, were observed in occasional rats treated with  the  standard  batch  at  25  and  75  mg/kg/day.  These  observations  were  consistent  with  changes observed in previous studies in adult rats.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data  from  these  studies  do  not  provide  any  new  information  that  raises  any  further  need  for  SPC amendments regarding paediatric use of Ketek.

However, as already discussed during the article 46 procedure for Ketek (EMEA/H/C/354 P46 038; AR submitted 2008-12-12), the new information gained from the interrupted paediatric clinical program, renders a need for updating the sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 in the SPC. It is of importance that the prescribers are informed of the reason for absence of a specific paediatric indication, as well as of the current PK and safety information for this group of patients.

II.2 Clinical aspects See list of clinical studies above. The phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies are all previously assessed in the article 46 procedure for Ketek (EMEA/H/C/354 P46 038; Rapporteur's AR submitted 2008-12-12). In addition, the MAH now submitted study synopsis for three Japanese open label phase 3 clinical studies. Data from these studies do not provide any new information that raises any further need for SPC amendments regarding paediatric use of Ketek, except the minor amendment currently discussed in the ongoing article 46 procedure. III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  Overall conclusion Sanofi-aventis initiated a paediatric program aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telithromycin oral suspension 25 mg/kg once daily in the treatment of acute otitis media, tonsillitis/pharyngitis and community-acquired pneumonia. Following an overall by indication safety assessment by the CHMP leading to restricted indications in June 2007 due to a partly revised benefit/risk evaluation, the MAH decided to terminate all ongoing and planned studies in the paediatric program. This decision was supported by the CHMP in December 2007. The Phase III clinical program was terminated before the planned number of subjects could be randomized. The submitted study synopsis of the three open-labeled Japanese studies did not raise any additional concerns. Across all of the submitted non-clinical and clinical studies, the results of the safety evaluation of telithromycin were consistent with the known profile of the product. Regarding the new data presented in this submission, there is no new safety signal identified in the studied paediatric population compared to the approved labeling for use of telithromycin in adults and as a second line indication tonsillitis/pharyngitis in patients of 12 years of age and older, that would warrant a change of the safety information or other information concerning paediatric patients in the SPC of Ketek.

As a result of article 46 procedure for Ketek (EMEA/H/C/354 P46 038, the CHMP adopted the following conclusions on 19 March 2009:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to the overall safety profile of telithromycin, the CHMP considers that the overall benefit/risk ratio for the use of Ketek in children with benign indications such as acute otitis media and tonsillitis/pharyngitis,  is  negative.  Accordingly,  the  CHMP  concurs  with  the  MAH  that  a  specific paediatric  indication  besides  the  already  approved  second-line  indication  for  tonsillitis/pharyngitis  in adolescents above 12 years of age, is not supported. However, based on the available data on patients 6 months to 12 years, some amendments in the SPC are required.

List of Questions: 1. The MAH should update sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SPC as follows: Section 4.2 In children: Ketek is not recommended for use in children below 12 years of age due to lack of limited data on safety and efficacy (see section 4.4 and 5.2). Section 4.4 The paediatric program was terminated before the planned number of subjects was randomised, based on the overall benefit/risk balance for adults. Limited data in patients from 6 months of age with acute otitis media or tonsillitis/pharyngitis, receiving telithromycin oral suspension, indicate a safety profile consistent with that of adults. 2. The current statement in section 5.2 of the SPC regarding subjects below the age of 12 years is no longer correct. MAH is requested to present available PK data and to suggest valid concise information concerning this population, to be stated in section 5.2. The MAH was requested to submit a type II variation by 10 July 2009 addressing these conclusions.  Recommendation Due to the overall safety profile of telithromycin, the Rapporteur considers that the overall benefit/risk ratio for the use of Ketek in children is negative. Accordingly, the Rapporteur concurs with the MAH that a specific paediatric indication besides the already approved second-line indication for tonsillitis/pharyngitis in adolescents above 12 years of age, is not supported.  Necessary amendments in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 52 will be addressed in the requested type II variation which is expected in July 2009. No further action is considered required in relation to the present procedure (EMEA/H/C/354/P45). Fulfilled No further action required. Medicinal product no longer authorised
