| II/0113 | Submission of the final report from study CNTO148UCO1001 (PURSUIT PEDS PK) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a phase 1b open-label study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered golimumab, a human anti-TNFα antibody, in pediatric subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The RMP version 26.1 has also been submitted. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 06/07/2023 | n/a        | Study CNTO148UCO1001 was a Phase 1b open label study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered golimumab in paediatric subjects aged 2 to 17 years with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Thirty-five (35) patients were included and around 29% of the patients were between 2- 11 years old and around 43% of the patients had a weight <45 kg (including 5 patients with a weight<30kg). The serum golimumab concentrations appeared to be relatively comparable between paediatrics with UC with a body weight ≥45 kg and adults with UC when compared within the same body weight categories. There seemed to be a trend towards lower mean serum concentration in paediatrics weighing < 45 kg (who received the BSA- adjusted dose regimen) as compared to those weighing ≥ 45 kg and compared to the reference adults UC population (who received the flat fixed dose regimen). The overall safety profile in this small paediatric UC study was consistent with the known safety profile of golimumab with no new safety concerns identified. |

| II/0111   | Update of section 4.6 of the SmPC in order to update information on pregnancy based on final results from PASS study CNTO148ART4001 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is an observational prospective cohort study to collect and analyse information pertaining to pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to golimumab during pregnancy. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 25.1 has also been submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 12/05/2023   | 01/02/2024   | SmPC and PL   | There is a moderate amount (approximately 400) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to golimumab resulting in live birth with known outcomes, including 220 pregnancies exposed during the first trimester. In a population-based study from Northern Europe including 131 pregnancies (and 134 infants), there were 6/134 (4.5%) events of major congenital anomalies following in utero exposure to Simponi vs 599/10,823 (5.5%) events for non- biologic systemic therapy compared to 4.6% in the general population of the study. Confounder-adjusted odds ratios were OR 0.79 (95% CI 0.35-1.81) for Simponi vs. non- biologic systemic therapy and OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.42-2.16) for Simponi vs. the general population, respectively. Due to its inhibition of TNF, golimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the newborn. Studies in animals do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The available clinical experience is limited. Golimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.   |

The results of the RABBIT cohort 2 report on Simponi showed a lower risk for serious infections in patients treated with Simponi compared to patients of comparator groups I (other bDMARDs) and III (nonbionaїve csDMARDs), but not for comparator group II (bionaїve csDMARDs). No significant risk increase was shown for Simponi vs. all investigated comparator groups for the outcomes of myocardial infarction, overall malignancies, first malignancies, non-melanoma skin cancer and all-cause mortality. Overall, the results suggest that the use of Simponi for the treatment of RA patients in daily rheumatologic care is a safe and generally well-tolerated   |

| II/0107 | Update to section 5.1 of the SmPC to add the results of the final report from study MK-8259-038 (Go- BACK) in order to fulfil MEA/30.2. This is a phase 4, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, withdrawal, post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) of golimumab in adult participants, aged 18 to 45 years, with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 16/02/2023 | 01/02/2024 | SmPC and PL | The efficacy and safety of continued golimumab treatment (full or reduced dosing frequency) compared with treatment withdrawal was assessed in adult patients (18-45 years of age) with active nr-axSpA who demonstrated sustained remission during 10 months of monthly treatment with open label Simponi (GO-BACK). Eligible patients (who achieved a clinical response by Month 4 and an inactive disease status (ASDAS <1.3) at both Months 7 and 10) entering the double-blind withdrawal phase were randomised to continued monthly treatment with Simponi (full-treatment regimen, N = 63), every 2-month treatment with Simponi (reduced treatment regimen, N = 63) or monthly placebo treatment (treatment withdrawal, N = 62) for up to approximately 12 months.                                                                                                               |

Patients who experienced a flare, i.e., had an ASDAS collected at 2 consecutive assessments that both showed either an absolute score of ≥ 2.1 or post-withdrawal increase of ≥ 1.1 relative to Month 10 (end of open-label period), reinitiated monthly Simponi in an open-label retreatment phase to characterise clinical response. Among the 188 patients with inactive disease who received at least one dose of double-blind treatment, a significantly (p<0.001) greater proportion of patients did not experience a disease flare when continuing Simponi with either the full-treatment (84.1%), or reduced treatment (68.3%) regimens compared with treatment withdrawal (33.9%). In the placebo group, flares started approximately 2 months after Simponi was withdrawn, with the majority of flares occurring within 4 months of treatment withdrawal.

In addition, the RMP (version 20.0) is updated to reflect the final study report from study CNTO148ART4002 and to revise the list of safety concerns in accordance with the GVP Module V guideline (rev. 2). The Annexes II and IIIA of the product information are updated to remove congestive heart failure and to add breakthrough infection after administration of live vaccine in infants exposed to golimumab in utero from the patient reminder card and labelling. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some editorial changes in the SmPC. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority   |            |            |                     | claims database to estimate the long-term safety profile in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who are initiating Simponi treatment and/or other types of biologic and non- biologic treatments. Based on the information in this report, no specific safety concerns in patients with RA, PsA, or AS treated with Simponi relative to those patients treated with a non-biologic medication were noted. Results of the current safety evaluation are consistent with reports of Simponi safety and are generally comparable with observations from other studies in patients with rheumatic disease. Overall, no new safety signals arose from this study warranting updates to the product information, but some methodological issues remain. There are some uncertainties with regards to 'Serious depression including suicidality' and this should remain as an important potential risk in the risk management plan (RMP) and the risk should be reviewed in the next PSUR. The list of safety concerns in the RMP is also updated in accordance with Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) Module V, revision 2. With this update, congestive heart failure is removed from the list of important identified risk in the Simponi RMP, this results in an amendment of the Annex II condition and Annex IIIA (labelling); namely to remove 'congestive heart failure' from the patient reminder card. Breakthrough infection after administration of live vaccine in infants exposed to golimumab in utero is added in the patient reminder card   |

The educational programme consists of a patient reminder card to be held by the patient. The card is aimed at both serving as a reminder to record the dates and outcomes of specific tests and to facilitate the patient sharing of special information with healthcare professional(s) treating the patient about on-going treatment with the product. The patient reminder card shall contain the following key messages: • A reminder to patients to show the patient reminder card to all treating HCPs, including in conditions of emergency, and a message for HCPs that the patient is using Simponi. • A statement that the brand name and batch number should be recorded. • Provision to record the type, date, and result of TB screenings. • That treatment with Simponi may increase the risks of serious infection, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis B reactivation, and congestive heart failure; and |

Efficacy evaluation in the study extension was based among others on changes in corticosteroid use. Among patients who entered the study extension, the proportion of subjects who remained corticosteroid free was generally maintained through week 216. Of patients that continued in the study extension and had evaluable samples through week 228, antibodies to golimumab were detected in 4% (23/604) of golimumab treated patients.

For safety, in addition to the 268-week data from the 5 studies, safety data from 2 other clinical trials have been added to the integrated database as support for the changes in section 4.8 of the SmPC. A revised RMP was also submitted. Interim data (week 52 and week 104) for RA studies C0524T05 and C0524T06 as well as for the PsA study C0524T08 had been evaluated previously. Overall, data from all studies through Week 268 support a sustained beneficial effect and a safety profile similar for other anti- TNFα agents.   |

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/07/2013 | 19/09/2013 | SmPC and PL            | The review of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in relation to golimumab contains many reports with important confounding factors. These include therapies with other drugs known to cause ILD and lung toxicity, such as MTX, as well as disease states (RA, UC) that have a pulmonary involvement have a high rate of association with ILD, making a definitive assessment challenging. However, there are several cases with a close temporal relationship to the start of golimumab therapy that make a causal association between golimumab therapy and the development of ILD at least a reasonable possibility. To support this finding as a class effect, other TNF inhibitors also have ILD as an ADR within their labelling. Based on this review, ILD is an ADR for golimumab. Although the post-marketing reporting frequency is 2 cases per 10,000 PY and the CIOMS frequency category is Rare, the clinical trial frequency for ILD (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis) is 3 cases per 1,000 subjects and the CIOMS frequency category is Uncommon.

| WS/0400 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add information regarding administration of live vaccines and therapeutic infectious agents concurrently with Remicade and Simponi. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 27/06/2013 | 25/07/2013 | SmPC and PL           | The MAH's proposal to revise the PI was prompted by a single post-marketing case of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) disseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection after concurrent use of infliximab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and use of BCG by bladder instillation for the treatment of bladder cancer. A clear causal association between infliximab and the onset of disseminated BCG infection could not be determined due to confounding factors but could not be excluded. Upon analysis, the MAH concluded that this case represented a situation similar to receiving a live vaccine because BCG is a live attenuated form of Mycobacterium bacillus. The risks of infection and complications from infections following administration of a live vaccine have been reported to be much higher in patients whose immune systems have been compromised than in the healthy population. The MAH therefore proposed to update the product information to change the section heading of the Vaccination section to reflect the need to consider other therapeutic infectious agents, not just vaccines and to add a warning to not administer therapeutic infectious agents concurrently with Remicade or Simponi. This was agreed by the CHMP. |

In addition, 3 subjects, where screening results were negative or not reported, received prophylaxis which may indicate clinical suspicion of latent TB. Thus, a total of 8 subjects developed TB on golimumab treatment, despite having received prophylactic treatment. One of the cases, occurring within a clinical study, was fatal. It is acknowledged that it is not proven that all the cases were reactivations and not a second primary disease. However it seems unlikely that a second community acquired infection, i.e. new exposure was the reason in all cases. In the fatal case this explanation is particularly improbable, since it was a disseminated infection and no known TB exposure. The product information has therefore been updated to raise awareness that cases of active tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with Simponi during and after treatment for latent tuberculosis. Patients receiving Simponi should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis, including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis, patients who are on treatment for latent tuberculosis, or patients who were   |

In more than 50% of the cases there were associated risk factors limiting the causality assessment with the drugs. Based on the overall data, it remains unclear whether a causal relationship exists between infliximab or golimumab use and the development of melanoma, however the possible contribution of infliximab or golimumab use to the risk cannot be excluded. Based on the data, the frequency category of melanoma is 'rare' (1/10,000 and <1/1,000) for both infliximab and golimumab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| II/0035 | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add skin exfoliation as a new adverse reaction. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Editorial changes have also been made to section 3 and 4 of the Package Leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH | 19/07/2012 | 10/09/2012 | SmPC and PL | The MAH had provided a review of reports of skin exfoliation. No cases with the diagnosis erythema multiforme, Steven Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, representing severe skin reactions were retrieved. In clinical trials, two serious cases (dermatitis exfoliative and skin exfoliation) were reported in patients who received golimumab with concomitant therapy. In the postmarketing setting, six nonserious cases of skin exfoliation were reported: 3 cases of nonserious psoriatic- like desquamation, 2 cases with skin lesions likely due to other etiology, and one case of skin exfoliation with concomitant methotrexate use. All cases reported a plausible temporal relationship between exposure to golimumab and skin exfoliation. It was concluded that the development of skin exfoliation is reasonably likely to be causally associated with the use of golimumab and that the term skin exfoliation should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. The frequency 'rare' was based on the two cases reported from clinical studies, in relation to in total 5,100 patients treated in these studies. |

| II/0010 | Based on pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 study C0524T14 the MAH has updated section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties with regard to the concomitant use of golimumab and methotrexate (MTX). In this study, concomitant use of MTX reduced golimumab apparent total systemic clearance (CL/F) by approximately 36% after 6- month treatment with SC golimumab in subjects with RA. While the number of evaluable patients in study C0524T14 was limited, the proposed estimate is in agreement with the previous text on the effect of MTX on the clearance of subcutaneously administered golimumab which was based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of a larger number of subjects.

| II/0003 | Update of the SmPC in sections 4.4 and 4.8 with reagrd to malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders as well as concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and anakinra and on switching between biological DMARDS. Corresponding changes were introduced in the package leaflet as appropriate. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/02/2010 | 23/03/2010 | SmPC and PL | A previous safety analysis of clinical and post-marketing data of TNF-blocking agents revealed a potential safety signal involving the occurrence of malignancies in paediatric patients, leukaemia, and psoriasis-like lesions associated with this class of products. In order to better reflect these safety concepts appropriately in the product information for Simponi, an addditional review was undertaken by the MAH to assess the individual cases available to the MAH. From the data presented by the MAH on leukaemias and paediatric malignancies, it is agreed that there are a number of uncertainties regarding whether there is a causal association between anti-TNF agents and leukaemias or paediatric malignancies or not. Nevertheless, given the mechanism of action of these agents, the possible risks for the development of such malignancies with use of agents of this class cannot be excluded. Thus, the amendments to the warning in section 4.4 have been introduced addressing the potential risk for the |

Addition of names of local representatives of the MAH in section 6 of the PIL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/02/2010 | 23/03/2010 | SmPC and PL | After concerns were raised about documentation and data collection practices at one single clinical trial site of study C0524T11, selected key efficacy parameters at Week 24 such as primary endpoint, major secondary endpoints, and other key secondary endpoints were re-analyzed by the MAH excluding the data from this site. Safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data were left unchanged. Overall the conclusions regarding the statistical significance of the results in the C0524T11 study were unchanged with the following 2 exceptions: \" The difference between the golimumab 50 mg group and the placebo group in improvement from baseline in HAQ score at Week 24 for subjects who discontinued prior anti-TNF? therapy(s) due to lack of efficacy changed from being significant (p=0.045) to not significant (p=0.067). \" The number of subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group who had an ACR 90 response changed from being |

In addition, the removal of the efficacy data collected at this site changed the p-value for the primary endpoint (ACR 20 response of the golimumab 50 mg group) from p<0.001 to p=0.001; however, the primary endpoint remained statistically significant. The reanalysis of efficacy data did not critically change the overall results for key efficacy parameters (such as the co- primary endpoint, percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at week 14).
