## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive disease of the small pulmonary arteries that is characterised by vascular proliferation and remodelling. It results in increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance and, ultimately, right ventricular heart failure and death.

Ventavis is the trade name for inhaled iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue, which has been developed in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) under orphan drug status in Europe as designated by the EU Commission on 29 December 2000. Ventavis was removed from the Community register of orphan medicinal products in September 2013 at the end of the 10-year period of market exclusivity.

The first marketing authorization for Ventavis 10 μg/mL (iloprost) inhalation solution was granted by the European Commission on 16 September 2003 under exceptional circumstances with the specific obligation to gather further data on longer-term safety and efficacy.

On May 2013, the exceptional circumstances status was left and the marketing authorization of Ventavis 10 was renewed. See Procedure EMEA/H/C/000474/R/02

The current indication is: \"Treatment of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III, to improve exercise capacity and symptoms.

The approved product is dispensed as a ready-to-use 10 µg/ml solution in glass vials of 1 ml and 2 ml containing 10 µg and 20 µg of iloprost, respectively. Patients self-administer the product 6 to 9 times daily.

Ventavis 10 µg/ml is recommended to be used with one of 4 nebulizer systems that were assessed and considered suitable for administration of Ventavis 10 µg/ml: 2 compressed air nebulizer systems: the HaloLite Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) system and the ProDose AAD system, one ultrasonic battery powered nebulizer: the Venta-Neb and one portable vibrating mesh technology nebulizer system: the I-Neb AAD system.

The devices were approved as suitable ones to deliver the approved dose of either 2.5 or 5 μg iloprost ex-mouthpiece with estimated inhalation times comprised between 4 to 10 minutes (depending on the nebulizer systems and dose to be inhaled). But in practice, some patients require prolonged inhalation time, frequently exceeding 15 minutes, to inhale the 5 µ g dose using Ventavis 10. The sponsor received reports from physicians who were concerned that the effectiveness of Ventavis 10 µg/ml treatment may be reduced in patients who require long inhalation times to achieve the recommended dose of 5 µ g.  Physicians had expressed particular concern for patients with long inhalation times who fail to receive their required Ventavis doses and for whom compliance is poor. It was postulated that a 20 µ g/mL solution of iloprost administered in the approved breath-actuated nebulisers would require half the volume to administer the same 5 µ g dose, and could be inhaled with half the number of breaths compared to the 10 µ g/mL concentration of Ventavis 10 solution.  The expected result for patients who experience prolonged inhalation times ( &gt; 15 min) was a drug delivery that approaches the intended dosing rate of 5 µ g inhaled within approximately 8 - 10 minutes.

The 20 mcg/ml ampoules containing 1 ml solution (i.e. 20 µg of iloprost) was approved by the FDA in August 2009. Actelion is the NDA holder for Ventavis in the USA and Bayer cooperation partner. It is marketed in USA since September 2009 for patients who are maintained at the 5 µg dose and who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times with Ventavis 10 µg/ml. It is recommended to be administered using exclusively the I-Neb AAD System using a smaller medication chamber (0.25 ml

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nebulized volume instead of 0.5 mL) specifically designed with gold color coded latch to achieve the 5 µ g dose with this higher concentration.  The manufacturer of I-Neb AAD system Philips Respironics delivers only I-Neb devices equipped with power level 6 discs to all US patients to be treated with Ventavis.

The present application is for a line extension to Europe for the double concentration for Ventavis 20µg/mL nebulizer solution provided in 1 ml glass ampoules containing 20 µg of iloprost with the same quality of excipients as Ventavis 10 microgram / ml. In Europe, the 'Ventavis discs' provided to patients by Philips Respironics have a power level 10 setting.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product is presented as a nebuliser solution containing 20 µg/ml of iloprost (as iloprost trometamol) as active substance.

Other ingredients are: trometamol, ethanol 96%, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), water for injections.

The product is available in 1-ml ampoules, colourless, glass type I, containing 1 ml nebuliser solution, ring coded with two coloured rings (yellow-red).

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

The chemical name of iloprost  is :  5-{(E)-(1S,5S,6R,7R)-7-Hydroxy-6-[(E)-(3S,4RS)-3-hydroxy-4methyl-1-octen-6-ynyl]-bicyclo[3.3.0]oct-3-ylidene}-pentanoic acid. Iloprost has the following structure:

<!-- image -->

The active substance used in the 20 µg/ml nebuliser solution is the same active substance as the one approved for the currently authorised strength Ventavis 10 µg/ml. The drug substance is manufactured

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

according to the approved manufacturing process. An additional manufacturing site has been introduced for the final process step. The synthetic route, operating procedures and process parameters remain unchanged. Comparative results between two batches produced at the site approved for the 10 µg/ml strength and three batches produced at the new site show that the batches are of the same quality.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

Iloprost 20 μg/ml was designed for patients who are maintained at the 5 μg dose and have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times with Ventavis 10 μg/ml, which could result in incomplete inhalation. It enables to shorten inhalation times by inhaling only 0.25 ml of the iloprost 20 μg/ml formulation instead of the 0.5 ml of the currently approved 10 μg/ml formulation.

A parenteral solution of iloprost 20 μg/ml is already marketed for many years. The formulation of 20 μg/ml iloprost nebuliser solution is identical to the formulation of 20 μg/ml iloprost parental therefore a formulation development for iloprost solution 20 μg/ml nebuliser solution was not carried out.

Ventavis 20 μg/ml has the same qualitative composition than Ventavis 10 μg/ml.

The 20 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml formulations contain the functional excipients ethanol 96 % and trometamol in the same ratio to the drug substance. The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing.

Comparative in vitro data of the nebulised aerosol generated by Ventavis 10 μg/ml versus Ventavis 20 μg/ml solutions have been provided using the I-neb AAD system device equipped with power disk 10. A higher mean emitted dose was observed for Ventavis 20 µg/ml as compared to approved Ventavis 10µg/ml i.e. 5 µg compared to 4.1 µg respectively. But results showed similar particle size distribution between Ventavis 10 and Ventavis 20 based on MMAD, mean (GSD) and FPF (&lt; 4.7µm) with a shorter delivery rate with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10. All batches used for in vitro tests and for the PK study comply with the specifications, especially with regard to drug content. As an aqueous solution, all batches will provide equivalent aerosolisation. The clinical impact of the differences on the in vitro characteristics of the aerosols generated by Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 are discussed below in Clinical Part.

The primary packaging is 1-ml ampoules, colourless, glass type I, ring coded with two coloured rings (yellow-red). The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: dissolution of trometamol and sodium chloride in water for injection, dissolution of iloprost in ethanol and a mixing of the 2 phases, followed by pH adjustment, volume adjustment, and a filtration on a 0.2 µm filter. After filling of the solution, the ampoules are sealed and sterilized at 121°C for 20 min, and visually checked. The process is the same as the process used for Ventavis 10. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process taking into account the applicant's experience for iloprost solution manufacture.

For the critical steps, the in-process controls performed are: control of pH and iloprost content for bulk solution, filter integrity test, filled weight check and extractable volume, control of sterilization conditions. The in-process controls are considered adequate for this type of manufacturing process.

Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The validation was performed prospectively with three consecutive batches at commercial scale of 100 kg at the current manufacturing site. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.

## Product specification

The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. At release, the product is examined for appearance of the solution: colour and clarity (visual / EP 2.2.1), pH (potentiometry), extractable volume (gravimetry), identification of iloprost and trometamol (TLC and HPLC), sterility. The assay of iloprost and determination of impurities are performed by validated HPLC methods.

Identical specifications are applied at release and end of shelf life.

Batch analysis results are provided for 4 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing.

## Stability of the product

Iloprost solution 20 μg/ml 1 ml for inhalation has the same composition and manufacturing process than the drug product iloprost solution 20 μg/ml for infusion (ILOMEDIN 20). Therefore the available stability data of iloprost solution 20 μg/ml for infusion (ILOMEDIN 20) have been presented and are considered as representative for iloprost solution 20 μg/ml 1 ml for inhalation.

Stability data of 3 production scale batches of finished product stored 60 months under long term conditions (at 25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of ILOMEDIN 20 are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested according to iloprost solution 20 μg/ml 1 ml for inhalation release specifications. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.

The product complies with the requirements of the specification through 60 months at 25 °C/60 % RH, and 30 °C/65 % RH and 6 months at 40 ºC / 75 % RH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On-going stability studies on two validation batches (production scale) of iloprost solution 20 μg/ml solution for infusion, 1 ml ampoules (ILOMEDIN 20) have been performed and 36-months data at 25 °C/60 % RH are reported. Results comply with specifications. A commitment is made to continue stability studies for iloprost solution 20 μg/ml 1 ml in glass ampoules post approval through the proposed shelf life.

Furthermore a commitment is made to start ICH stability studies for iloprost solution 20 μg/ml 1 mL for inhalation in glass ampoules through the proposed shelf life.

Thermal stress testing on iloprost solution 20 μg/ml 1 ml was performed using temperatures up to 80°C up to 31 days. Assay, Z-Isomers, polar and non-polar related substances impurities/degradation products were investigated. Severe thermal stress conditions lead to an increase of impurities. As a conclusion iloprost solution 20 μg/ml is stable when stored at temperatures up to 40 °C.

In addition, a photostability study conducted on one batch of iloprost solution 10 μg/ml for inhalation showed that light exposure (overall irradiation of more than 1.2 million lux hours as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products) has no effect on ilosprost solution. It is considered that the results can be extended to iloprost solution 20 μg/ml 1 ml for inhalation. Indeed according to literature it is stated that a concentrated solution is likely to be more stable than the same product in a diluted form.

Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

N/A

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Regarding this application for line extension, the applicant has performed an environmental risk assessment to meet the requirements of Directive 2004/27/EC.

The applicant has determined iloprost PEC surface water of 0.000225 µg/L, based on a maximum recommended daily dose of iloprost of 9 x 5μg, equivalent to 45 μg (0.045 mg) administered as aerosol by a nebulizer and a default Fpen of 1. In addition, a logKow of 1.6 was measured by the applicant based on a study performed with the flask-shaking method following OECD guideline 107. Therefore, iloprost PEC surface water value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5.

The newly available strength/potency is not expected to result in an increased risk to the environment.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The systemic exposure to iloprost following administration of Ventavis 20 has been investigated and compared to that observed after administration of Ventavis 10 using the Ineb-AAD nebulizer power disk 10 in Study 15762 (CSR A59983).

This study was conducted in healthy volunteers, according to a single-center (Germany), randomized, open-label, cross-over design. The study drug was administered as two single inhalations of 5 µg iloprost using one of two different formulations (10 µg/mL or 20 µg/mL iloprost) separated by a washout period of at least 24 h.  Adequate analytical and statistical methods have been used in this study.

The outcome of the study showed that AUC and Cmax are respectively approximately 10% and 27 % higher with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 in healthy volunteers dosed with a single 5µg iloprost dose. In response to the CHMP Day 80 LOQ, the applicant has provided the results from study 15762 based on the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of the population geometric means for AUC and Cmax according to CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev.1/Corr. Results are as follows:

. 90% CI for AUC (0-tlast) was 1.094 [0.941; 1.272],

. 90% CI for Cmax was 1.271 [1.173; 1.377]

Ventavis 10 and Ventavis 20 are not bioequivalent with respect to Cmax and the upper limit of AUC (1.272) is slightly above the 90% CI limit of 1.25 as defined in the bioequivalence guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev.1/Corr. The slightly higher systemic exposure with Ventavis 20 could be explained by the shorter mean inhalation time (i.e.: 12 minutes versus 17 minutes) in this PK study and by taking into account the in vitro data showing a higher drug delivery rate (i.e.: 1.62 µg/minutes versus 0.48 µg/minutes in vitro ) and a higher emitted dose (5.0 µg versus 4.1 µg in vitro ) with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 (see Quality part above). The differences in systemic exposure between Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 can however, be considered as weak. As a reminder, it is noticed that the plasma concentrations curve of iloprost observed in this study is superimposable to that observed in a previous PK study conducted in 2007 with a single dose of 5 µg of Ventavis 10 µg/ml using the I-Neb nebuliser (Study 310932 (CSR A36582)) which is currently approved in the SmPC of Ventavis 10.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic study is provided in support of Ventavis 20 application.

This is acceptable as same indication and posology are claimed for this line extension as compared to Ventavis 10µg/ml.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Ventavis 10 and Ventavis 20 are not bioequivalent with respect to Cmax and the upper limit of AUC (1.272) is slightly above the 90% CI limit of 1.25. The slightly higher systemic exposure with Ventavis 20 could be explained by the shorter mean inhalation time. The differences in systemic exposure between Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 can however, be considered as weak, and it is worth mentioning that the plasma concentrations curve of iloprost observed in this study is superimposable to that observed in a previous PK study conducted in 2007 with a single dose of 5 µg of Ventavis 10 µg/ml using the I-Neb nebuliser (Study 310932 (CSR A36582)) which is currently approved in the SmPC of Ventavis 10. The CHMP therefore considers that the bioavailability is sufficiently addressed with no outstanding issues.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

No controlled clinical efficacy study was conducted with Ventavis 20 µg/ml. No efficacy end point was defined in the 2 in vivo trials using Ventavis 20 µg/ml, the PK study 15762 (A59983) and the phase 4 retrospective study (CONVERT, AC-063A407).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The efficacy of inhaled iloprost was primarily based on the results of two studies that were submitted within the original dossier for Ventavis 10 µg/ml. These data consisted of a phase 2 randomized controlled study ME98008 (report A02237) including 63 PAH patients, and a phase 3 placebo controlled study ME97218 (AIR) (report A02997) including 203 PAH patients. These studies used the aircompressed nebulising device HaloLite. The two air-compressed nebulising devices, Halolite and its successor Prodose were mentioned in the initial SmPC as suitable nebuliser systems for the administration of Ventavis 10 µg/ml. In July 2005, a portable, hand-held ultrasonic nebuliser VentaNeb-ir was approved as a third suitable nebuliser based on in vitro data which showed superimposable characteristics of the aerosol output measurement and droplet sizes distribution with Ventavis 10 µg/ml as compared to Prodose nebuliser system. The fourth additional nebulising device I-Neb, a vibrating mesh technology nebuliser system, was approved and mentioned in the SmPC as suitable for Ventavis 10µg/ml in March 2006 (EMEA/H/C/00474/II/006). The in vitro data provided were not superimposable compared to ProDose  . The results of a post commitment PK study (310932CSRA36582) comparing a single dose of 5 µg iloprost administered using Ventavis 10 µg/ml solution via the I-Neb nebulising system equipped with power disk 10 versus the ProDose  system (the successor of Halolite which was no more available) showed a higher Cmax and AUC (0-tlast) as well as shorter Tmax following Ventavis 10 inhalation via I-Neb nebulizer as compared to the ProDose nebulizer. The estimated inhalation times were 3.2 minutes and 6.5 minutes for 2.5 µg and 5 µg of iloprost delivered at the mouth piece, respectively. However, in practice, patients may experience longer time of inhalation.

The available data with Ventavis 20 do not suggest any loss of efficacy as compared to the approved Ventavis 10 currently used in Europe. The in vitro comparative data showed a higher emitted dose with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 using I-Neb equipped with power disk 10 (i.e.: 5.0 µg and 4.1 µg/ml, respectively), with similar particle size distribution based on MMAD and FPF measurements (See Quality part). These results strongly suggest that lung deposition will be similar and that equal (or even higher) doses of iloprost will reach the targeted pulmonary vasculature to exert the vasodilatating effect on pulmonary arteries.

In addition to the sought higher delivery rate showed in vitro with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 (i.e.: 1.62µg/minutes as compared to 0.48 µg/minute, respectively ), the PK study 15762 showed a shorter inhalation time with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 (i.e.: 12 minutes versus 17 minutes = approximately 30 % shorter time) while slightly higher systemic exposure was observed with Ventavis 20 as a demonstration that at least the same dose of iloprost had been inhaled during this time.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

No controlled clinical efficacy study has been conducted with Ventavis 20 µg/ml. This is acceptable as it can be agreed that based on the available data ( in vitro measurement and the comparative PK study) the efficacy of Ventavis 20 µg/ml with I-Neb system equipped with power disk 10 will not be less than the efficacy of the Ventavis 10 µg/ml currently approved in Europe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, it is assumed that adding Ventavis 20 µg/ml would give patients who are taking a maintenance dose of 5 μg and experiencing compliance issues and withdrawal due to extended inhalation duration using the 10 μg/mL concentration, the option of shortening their drug delivery time aiming at achieving the targeted drug exposure within the intended inhalation time.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

Clinical safety results specifically obtained with Ventavis 20 µg/ml and submitted by the applicant in support of the present application are from:

1. the clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic study no.15762 conducted in Germany in 21 healthy male subjects aged from 18 to 45 years (also described in section 2.1. Pharmacokinetics above).
2. a phase 4 retrospective, multicenter study of 19 PAH patients who converted from the Ventavis 10 to the Ventavis 20 inhalation solution using the I-Neb AAD System conducted in USA from July 2010 to August 2011 sponsored by Actelion (NDA holder in USA) after launch of Ventavis 20 in USA (CONVERT study, report study dated on 7 February 2013, no: AC-063A407, document no. D12.584).
3. post-marketing data following marketing authorization in the USA obtained for a 3 year period from 01 Sep 2009 (date of first launch in USA) through 31 Oct 2012 (estimated patients exposure 3633 patients).

## Patient exposure

1. Clinical pharmacokinetic study no 15762 (A59983) entitled \"A randomised, open- label, single center crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics of iloprost following inhalation of Ventavis 10 or Ventavis 20 solution with the I-Neb nebulising device in healthy male volunteers under the condition of an extended inhalation time.\" was conducted from May 2012 to June 2012 by Bayer Health Care in one center in Germany (study report signed on 17 April 2013). The objectives of the study were to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), acute safety and tolerability of single dose inhalations of 5 µg iloprost using Ventavis 10µg/ml and using Ventavis 20µg/ml both via the I-Neb AAD system equipped with power disk 10  in 21 adult healthy male subjects under condition of extended inhalation time.

The 21 subjects included were told to inhale with the same breathing pattern during both treatment periods as determined during a previous training for an extended inhalation time between 15 to 20 minutes achieved with the I-Neb nebulizer with the purple chip (5 µg / Ventavis 10). All 21 subjects received one single dose of 5 µg using Ventavis 20 µg/ml.

One subject prematurely discontinued after period 1 (Ventavis 20) due to an adverse event (presyncope). Consequently, only 20 subjects received the second single dose of 5 µg using Ventavis 10.

In this study the median durations of inhalation of 5 µg iloprost according to the predefined extended inhalation scheme were 17 minutes [min: 5 minutes; max: 40 min] and 12 min [min: 5 minutes; max: 17 minutes] with Ventavis 10 and Ventavis 20 respectively. This corresponds to approximately 30% reduction in the mean inhalation time when using Ventavis 20.

Systemic exposure was slightly higher with Ventavis 20 as compare to Ventavis 10 (Cmax and AUC were respectively 30% and 10 % higher with Ventavis 20 µg/ml as compared to Ventavis 10 µg/ml (see PK Section above).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Phase 4 Study no.AC-063A407 (CSR: D-12.584) was entitled 'A phase 4, retrospective, multicenter study of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension treated with iloprost (inhalation) evaluating inhalation times, compliance, safety and tolerability when converting from the iloprost inhalation solution 10 µg/ml to the 20 µg/ml with the I-Neb AAD system and power disk-6'. It was conducted by Actelion (NDA holder of Ventavis in USA) from July 2010 to August 2011 after launch of Ventavis 20 in USA (study report dated on 7 February 2013).

For this study PAH patients were identified retrospectively by reviewing the medical charts and related information of patients who had completed at least 28 days of dosing with Ventavis 20 µg/ml. Patients were considered evaluable if they had received at least 28 days each of Ventavis 10 (Period 1) and Ventavis 20 (Period 2) at 5 µg/dose) administered by the I-Neb AAD system using PD-6. Iloprost inhalation data were captured electronically by a memory chip in the I-neb® AAD® device used to deliver iloprost by the INSIGHT software in the hand-piece, which supports a Patient Logging System (PLS). The primary objective was to compare the inhalation times between the Ventavis 10 in Period 1 (i.e. the last 28 days on Ventavis 10 prior to the 1 st  shipment of Ventavis 20) and the Ventavis 20 in Period 2 (i.e. the last 28 days on Ventavis 20 prior to entry into the study). Secondary objectives were to evaluate iloprost dosing compliance (dose frequency and percentage of complete doses) during Period 1 (28 days with Ventavis 10) and Period 2 (28 days with Ventavis 20), to collect treatmentemergent AEs and SAEs associated with the use of iloprost inhalation solution 20 mcg/mL concentration occurring in Period 2 (20 mcg/mL), vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) measured at the in-clinic visit.

Patients served as their own control for comparing inhalation time and compliance between Period 1 (28 days with Ventavis 10) and Period 2 (28 days with Ventavis 20).

Nineteen (19) adult patients (mean age : 60.6 years ranging from 24 to 86 years) with the different types of PAH belonging to Dana Point classification Group 1 were enrolled in 4 study sites in US.

The average inhalation time was lower with the 20 mcg/mL iloprost (5.5 minutes) than with the 10 mcg/mL iloprost (11.1 minutes). The mean decrease after switching from the 10 mcg/mL to the 20 mcg/mL was 5.6 minutes and statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001). Their reduction in average inhalation time observed during Post-Switch (just after switch to 20 mcg/mL) was maintained during Period 2 (20 mcg/mL) i.e. average inhalation time increased slightly and non-significantly from PostSwitch (20 mcg/mL) to Period 2 (20 mcg/mL), from 4.4 to 4.8 minutes (P = 0.596).

The average number of daily doses was similar between Period 1 (10 mcg/mL) and Period 2 (20 mcg/mL): 4.8 (range: 1.5-6.7) and 4.6 doses (range: 1.8-6.1), respectively (p= 0.501), and between Pre-Switch (10 mcg/mL) and Post-Switch (20 mcg/mL): 5.2 and 5.3 doses, respectively (p = 0.720).

The percentage of patients with complete doses (100% complete doses during the 28 days as recorded on the memory chip in the I-neb® AAD® system. was higher in Period 2 : 94.3% (20 mcg/mL) than in Period 1: 89.6%, (10 mcg/mL), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.205). Similarly, the percentage of total inhalations that were considered complete (100%, full) doses was slightly higher in Period 2 (20mcg/mL) compared to Period 1 (10 mcg/mL): 96.1% and 90.0%, respectively. The percentage of patients with complete doses was statistically significantly higher during Post-Switch (20 mcg/mL just after switching from Ventavis 10 to Ventavis 20) compared to Pre-Switch (10 mcg/mL, just before switching from Ventavis 10 to Ventavis 20): 98.0% and 90.2%, respectively (P = 0.012). Similarly, the percentage of total inhalations that were considered complete (100%, full) doses was higher in Post-Switch (20mcg/mL) compared to Pre-Switch (10 mcg/mL): 98.3% and 90.0%, respectively.

## 3. Post marketing reports from US:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As Ventavis 20 has been approved and marketed in US since 1 st  September 2009 by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Inc., post marketing of Ventavis 20 and Ventavis 10 data for a 3-year period from 01 Sep 2009 through 31Oct 2012 has been submitted in support of the present application.

As per the pharmacovigilance agreement with the license partner Actelion Pharmaceuticals, Bayer Health Care holds the Global Pharmacovigilance Safety Database and all US Ventavis case reports are being forwarded by Actelion to Bayer HealthCare and entered into the Global Pharmacovigilance Safety Database.

Based on the amount of vials of the inhalation solution distributed in the US market through October 31, 2012, the US patient exposure of Ventavis 20 µg/ml can be estimated to be 3633 patients (assuming 7.5 vials per day for 6 month per patient). The US patient exposure of Ventavis 10 is estimated to be 1481 patients during the same period. Thus, more than 70% of the patients were treated with Ventavis 20 µg/ml during this 3-year period.

According to the report, the majority of the US adverse events for Ventavis are received either through an organized data collection/patient contact program by specialty pharmacies in place for all patients, or from an additional voluntary patient support program in the United States sponsored by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc, or from registries, funded by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US,Inc.

In the US both concentrations of Ventavis (10 and 20 µg/mL) are exclusively administered with the I Neb nebulizer (Power Chip 6).

## Adverse events

Clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic study no 15762 (A59983) in healthy volunteers. No deaths or other SAEs occurred in this study.

There was one event of presyncope (rated as 'moderate' 'vasovagal reaction without loss of consciousness' that began 13 minutes after the start of his inhalation of Ventavis 20 (with an inhalation duration of 16 minutes ) systolic blood pressure dropped from 110 to 86 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure dropped from 53 to 37 mmHg during vasovagal reaction. The patient withdrawn prematurely from the study and did not received Ventavis 10.

The number of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) following Ventavis 20 treatment was greater than the number associated with Ventavis 10

Most reports were of 'flushing' for 7 (33%) and 2 (10%) subjects with Ventavis 20 and Ventavis 10 respectively (without evidence for an association of higher frequency with higher Cmax following treatment with Ventavis 20). All other single case adverse events occurred after treatment with Ventavis 20 only (blood creatinine increase (1), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (1), headache (1) spontaneous penile erection (1)). All of them were considered related to the study drug except one (headache). All adverse events were rated as 'mild', except for the single case of presyncope (after Ventavis 20), which was rated as 'moderate'. Laboratory events were mild and transient and therefore they can be considered as not being of special concern. There was no clear trend toward any change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure over the period of administration (before dosing as well as 5 and 30 minutes after dosing) either with Ventavis 10 or with Ventavis 20.  Six hours after dosing a slight trend towards higher systolic blood pressure was found for both treatments. However, in summary no difference between the two treatments was established.

As conducted with a single dose, this study only allows the assessment of acute tolerance. Moreover, it relates to healthy volunteers with stable hemodynamic status but not to PAH patients prone to frail and unstable hemodynamic status.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## In the Phase 4 Study no. AC-063A407 (no. D-12.584)

For the purpose of this study, patients were interviewed at the in-clinic visit for any emergent AEs and SAEs occurring over the last 28 days prior to study entry.

During period 2 (28 days with 20 mcg/mL), 5 of 19 patients (26.3%) reported 7 AEs (headache, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, chest pain, upper respiratory tract infection and cough). Of the 7 events, 6 were considered mild and one was considered moderate and 2 events (both headache) were considered related to study treatment. No deaths or other serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.

No data are provided for period 1 in the study report submitted by the applicant.

There were no remarkable findings in vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) at this in-clinic visit while patients are under treatment with Ventavis 20.

When asked to compare the convenience of the 20 mcg/mL iloprost inhalation solution to the 10 mcg/mL, all patients responded that the 20 mcg/mL was better. Additionally, the majority of patients (12 patients; 63.2%) indicated that they felt better while on the 20 mcg/mL compared to the 10 mcg/mL. Seven patients (36.8%) said they felt no change after converting from the 10 mcg/mL to the 20 mcg/mL.

This study has limitation as it was conducted retrospectively on a selected and limited sample of 19 patients. Adverse effects were recorded at the in-clinic visit by the interview for any emergent AEs and SAEs occurring over the last 28 days prior to study entry (period 2). Therefore, the collection of adverse effects may be biased by the fact that it is based on patients' memory. As adverse effects during period 1 were not collected, no comparison can be made between period 2 (Ventavis 20 µg/ml) and period 1(Ventavis 10 µg/ml).

## Post marketing data in US:

Using the specific US system for data collection the company has provided a comparison of post marketing pharmacovigilance data with Ventavis 20 and Ventavis 10 in USA for the 3 year period from 01 September  2009 (date of launch of Ventavis 20 in USA) trough 31 Oct 2012.

The updated retrieval from the Global Pharmacovigilance Safety Database resulted in a total of 2106 single cases with Ventavis 20 µg/mL during a 3-year period which included a total of 5495 AEs (one case may contain more than one reported AE). For Ventavis 10 µg/mL a total of 2373 US single cases were received for the same period which included a total of 6383 AEs (one case may contain more than one reported AE). In addition, there are 60 cases (with 359 reported AEs) where both concentrations were reported in one single case.

Adverse drug reactions with Ventavis 20 were similar in profile with those already known with Ventavis 10 including cough, dyspnea, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, flushing and pain in jaw.

Reported rate of bronchospasms, syncope and hypotension were 0.018, 0.063, 0.098 with Ventavis 10 respectively and 0.002, 0.023, and 0.016 with Ventavis 20 respectively.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 522 fatal case reports with Ventavis 10 µg/mL were received and included 628 AEs with fatal outcome. A total of 356 fatal cases with Ventavis 20 µg/mL were received and included 442 AEs with fatal outcome.

A total of 3 fatal cases were reported in cases with both concentrations. The most frequent AEs leading to fatal outcome in cases with Ventavis 10 µg/mL treatment were respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension/pulmonary arterial hypertension. The same events were the most commonly reported fatal events in patients with Ventavis 20 µg/mL therapy. The absolute numbers as well as the reporting rates of fatal events or reported causes of death under Ventavis 10 µg/mL (0.424) or Ventavis 20 µg/mL therapy (0.122) did not indicate more fatalities under Ventavis 20 µg/mL or towards different causes of death.

In summary, the reporting number of AEs and the respective reporting rates do not indicate more serious AEs or an overall increase in AEs in patients treated with ventavis 20 µg/ml.

## Haemorrhages

A total of 121 single cases were identified which included 146 bleeding AEs for Ventavis 10 and a total of 87 single cases were identified which included 102 bleeding AEs for Ventavis 20 i.e. frequencies were 0.099 and 0.028 for Ventavis 10 and Ventavis 20 respectively.

The most frequent bleeding AEs under Ventavis 10 µg/mL were epistaxis (N=52), haemoptysis (N=21), and contusion (N=12). The same bleeding types were the most commonly reported with Ventavis 20 µg/mL therapy; epistaxis (N=34), haemoptysis (N=16), and contusion (N=8). The frequency of total number and the respective reporting rates do not hint towards more frequent or more serious bleeding events under Ventavis 20 µg/mL therapy.

## De-challenge/re-challenge

Out of 2144, 20 cases (20/2144, 0.9%) were identified which can be interpreted as positive dechallenge with resolving symptoms after discontinuation of Ventavis 20, a switch back to the Ventavis 10 concentration, and/or a reduction in dose.

In 11/20 cases symptoms improved after Ventavis 20 discontinuation ; these cases mainly included side effects that are known to be associated with inhaled iloprost: headache (5), vomiting (2), nausea (3), diarrhoea (1), cough (3), bronchospasm (1), palpitation (2), heart rate increase (1), tachycardia (1), dizziness (1), dyspnoea (1), chest pain (1), epistaxis (1), allergy (1), fatigue (2), stress (1), and decreased appetite (1).

In 7/20 case reports symptoms improved after switching back to the Ventavis 10 concentration. In one patient dizziness, fatigue, migraines, flushing and vertigo improved after Ventavis 20 was switched to Ventavis 10. In 6 patients improvement of dyspnea (2), wheezing (1), headache (3), nausea (1), and fatigue (1) was reported after switching back to the 10 µg/mL concentration.

From the case information it is not clear whether patients stayed on 5 µg/ml on Ventavis 10 or whether they simultaneously reduced the dose to 2.5 µg.

In 2 further cases it was explicitly described that the dose was reduced to 2.5 µg/mL which led to improvements of headache (n=1) and hair loss (n=1).

Positive re-challenge under Ventavis 20 with recurring symptoms of headache, nausea, and fatigue were reported for 2 patients after resuming therapy or increasing inhalation frequencies.

In one case de-challenge results were reported to be negative in a patient who experienced hoarseness under Ventavis therapy.

## Drug discontinuation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Next to the above cases with positive de-challenge after drug discontinuation, in about 25 cases patients reportedly discontinued Ventavis therapy due to following AEs (de-challenge results unknown):

AE not further specified, oral disorders, oral pain, headache, agitation, feeling abnormal, flushing, throat irritation, tongue and oral mucosal blistering, glossodynia, PAH worsening, fatigue, chest pain/discomfort, cough, musculoskeletal pain, throat irritation, dyspnea, oedema/fluid retention, blurry vision, nausea, dizziness, and presyncope.

Overall, inhalation time was rarely addressed in the single case reports.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Clinical safety results obtained specifically with Ventavis 20 were collected from the postmarketing data following marketing authorization in the USA obtained from 01 Sep 2009 through 31 Oct 2012, from a phase 4 retrospective study in 19 US patients with PAH who converted from the Ventavis 10 to the Ventavis 20 inhalation solution using the I-Neb AAD System (CONVERT study) and from the clinical pharmacology study no. 15762 in 21 healthy adult male subjects conducted in Germany.

Based on the 3-year review of US postmarketing data, the most frequently reported events with Ventavis 20 were the same in nature as compared to Ventavis 10. No new safety concern has been identified with Ventavis 20 µg/mL compared to Ventavis 10 µg/mL. Reporting rates and total number of events for bronchospasm, syncope, hypotension, cough, dizziness, nausea, pain in jaw, dyspnoea, headache, and flushing were similar or lower than with Ventavis 10 µg/mL. The frequency of hypotension, syncope or bronchospasm, where not shown to be higher or more serious with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10. Similarly, hemorrhages or the types of bleeding events were comparable between the two concentrations. Causes of death were as expected mainly associated to spontaneous reporting system, this review cannot be considered as proper controlled data, but it is based on a homogeneous setting i.e. all from the US coding, and it helps to provide a safety comparison between Ventavis 10 and Ventavis 20 in real life practice. It is noticed that according to the applicant, more than 70% of the patients were treated with Ventavis 20 suggesting a good tolerance as compared to Ventavis 10 in clinical practice.

Cases of challenge and dechallenge after the switch from 10 µg/ml to the 20 µg/mL concentration route of administration related to the shorter inhalation time with Ventavis 20 and then more rapid dose study 15762 conducted in healthy volunteers. The higher Cmax observed with Ventavis 20 as compared to Ventavis 10 in the PK study 15762 would suggest possible higher acute systemic exposure that may subsequently translate in more acute undesirable events relating to systemic vasodilatation.

the underlying progression of PAH and other conditions. The data do not indicate more fatalities under Ventavis 20 µg/mL or towards different causes of death compared to Ventavis 10 µg/mL. As based on and/or improved after switching back to Ventavis 10 were mainly vasodilating nature or the inhalative delivery of iloprost. As well it can be the interpretation of the higher rate of flushing cases in the single

The safety data from USA (3-year post marketing and CONVERT phase 4 study) were issued from patients using I-Neb system equipped with power disk 6. In Europe only the I-Neb system equipped with power disk 10 will be used. In response to Day 180 list of question, the applicant has provided clarifications on the impact of the power of the control disk of I-Neb system i.e. 6 versus 10. Power disk level (6 versus 10) had no impact on particles size distribution with Ventavis 20 µg/ml reflecting similar pulmonary deposition when using power disk 6 or 10. The drug delivery rate measured in vitro

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was slightly faster in average with power level 10 disk as compared to power disk 6 (i.e.: 1.30 µg/min versus 1.62 µg/min, respectively with Ventavis 20 µg/ml) but there was a widely overlapping range between power disk 10 and power disk 6 (dose delivery time ranges: 139-247 seconds versus 156-338 seconds, respectively) allowing to consider that safety post marketing experience in USA remains contributory despite a slightly shorter time of inhalation is possible with I-Neb AAD system for some patients in Europe (power disk 10 ) as compared to USA (power disk 6).

Ventavis 20 is intended for patients who are maintained at the 5 µg dose and who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times which could result in incomplete dosing, those patients will remain with a slow breathing pattern, even if transitioning to the 20 mcg/mL concentration using the INeb-AAD System will decrease treatment times. This would contribute to individually minimising the higher Cmax observed in the European PK study (15762 (A59983) conducted with I-neb equipped with power disk 10) that would lead to acute adverse reactions when switching. Moreover, Section 4.2 of the SmPC adequately mentions that supervision by the treating physician is necessary if a switch is made from Ventavis 10 µg/ml to Ventavis 20 µg/ml in order to control the acute tolerance.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The safety of Ventavis 20 is considered acceptable in those patients maintained at the 5 mcg dose with Ventavis 10 and who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times which could result in incomplete dosing, and provided the switch from Ventavis 10 to Ventavis 20 is made under medical supervision in order to control the acute tolerance is acceptable.

Initially, doses of2.5 microgram shouldbe administered using Ventavis 10 microgram/mL with dosing intervals of 3-4 hours (corresponds to administration ofmax.6 times per day). Thereafter, dosing intervals may be shortened cautiously based on individual tolerability.If a further increase in the dose upto5microgram is indicated, again dosing intervals of 3-4 hours should be chosen initially and shortened according to                                                                                                                                                        | Not applicable                                      |

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Reduced time of inhalation has been shown when using the double concentration of iloprost solution 20 µg/ml in ampoule of 1 ml with I-Neb system for 5 µg at mouth piece as compared to Ventavis 10 µg/ml solution.

Hence, it provides those patients who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times with Ventavis 10 µg/ml (and which could result in incomplete inhalation), with a more convenient medication expected to shorten their inhalation times with the aim to improve dose completion.

No efficacy study has been conducted but this is considered acceptable, as in vitro and PK data are strongly in favour of similar lung deposition and efficacy on pulmonary vasculature as compared to Ventavis 10.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

Available studies do not allow to formally concluding that compliance to treatment is indeed improved when using Ventavis 20 µg/ml. However, from a pragmatic point of view, it is noticed that since Ventavis 20 is marketed in US, 70% of patients are treated with Ventavis 20.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data only refers to I-Neb AAD system. No data are available with the other nebuliser systems currently mentioned as suitable for Ventavis 10 µg/ml i.e.: Prodose, Venta-Neb. Therefore, only I-Neb is recommended in the SmPC. This is acceptable as I-Neb is the most frequently nebulizer system used.

## Risks

Relating to the double concentration of the solution and subsequent shorter inhalation time, the delivery rate of iloprost is slightly increased leading to possible increase of acute adverse effects relating to the vasodilatory effect of iloprost. Though no cluster is identified based on the 3-year US Pharmacovigilance database, cases challenge and dechallenge after the switch from 10 µg/ml to the 20 µg/mL concentration and/or improved after switching back to Ventavis 10 were reported through post marketing reports in US. Moreover, flushing was reported more frequently with Ventavis 20 than with Ventavis 10 in the small study single dose study conducted in Europe in 21 healthy subjects.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Despite differences observed in vitro and in study 15762 between Ventavis 20 as compared to the currently approved Ventavis 10 a positive benefit/risk balance is maintained .

For a maintenance dose of 5 µg, the estimated inhalation time is 6.5 minutes. However, in practice some patients need an extended inhalation time, frequently exceeding 15 minutes, to inhale the 5 µ g dose using Ventavis 10 and this may raise compliance issues due to failing completed doses.

With the aim to shorten inhalation time, Ventavis 20 offers to deliver a 5 µ g single dose to patients who have repeatedly experienced extended inhalation times. In those patients, the shortened inhalation duration resembles the one administered in clinical trials with Ventavis 10. Data on individual patient inhalation duration and compliance can be recorded and stored in their individual INeb AAD System.  Physicians are therefore able to select those patients with compliance issues and evaluate their responses through monitoring of well-being and inhalation duration.

Compared to the 10 µ g/mL iloprost nebuliser solution, Ventavis 20 requires half the volume to be nebulized allowing about half the amount of nebulisation time to receive the same 5 µ g at the mouthpiece.  Therefore, the amount of drug substance in the medication chamber of the device will not change and the total dose delivered at mouthpiece will remain unchanged.

The manufacturer of I-Neb AAD system, Philips Respironics, is using a colour coding for the dedicated setting for Ventavis allowing differentiation of Ventavis doses. The colour code 'red' (i.e. colour of the latch of the medication chamber and the control disk that activate the system) is used for a 2.5 µg dose with Ventavis 10, purple for a 5 µg dose with Ventavis 10 and golden for a 5 µg dose with Ventavis 20.

Experience has been gained for more than 3 years in US since the marketing of Ventavis 20 µg/ml and it is used by a high rate of patients is US. The clinical experience to date confirms that this concentration may be a useful alternative for patients maintained at 5 µg but experiencing prolonged inhalation time with Ventavis 10 µg/ml

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

The overall B/R of Ventavis 20 µg/ml is positive for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension in those patients maintained at the 5 mcg dose with Ventavis 10 µg/ml and who have repeatedly experienced extended treatment times which could result in incomplete dosing and provided the switch

from Ventavis 10 to Ventavis 20 is made under medical supervision in order to control the acute tolerance as stated in the SmPC.

## 4. Recommendations

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ventavis is not similar to Revatio, Volibris, Opsumit, Adempas within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Ventavis, 20 microgram / ml nebuliser solution in the treatment of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, classified as NYHA functional class III, to improve exercise capacity and symptoms is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use
