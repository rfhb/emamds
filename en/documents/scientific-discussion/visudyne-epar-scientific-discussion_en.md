## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Visudyne. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 December 2003. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Visudyne contains a new active substance, verteporfin INN, a benzoporphyrin derivative, which is a photosensitiser (i.e. light-activated) molecule developed for photodynamic therapy (PDT) with visible light.  Visudyne  was  initially  indicated  for  the  treatment  of patients  with  predominantly  classic subfoveal choroidal  neovascularisation  due  to  age-related  macular  degeneration  (AMD),  which  was later  extended  through  a  Type  II  variation  to  subfoveal  choroidal  neovascularisation  secondary  to pathological  myopia  (PM).  A  further  Type  II  variation  extended  the  indication  to  the  treatment  of patients  with  age-related  macular  degeneration  with  occult  subfoveal  choroidal  neovascularisation with evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression.

Verteporfin  has  also  been  studied  in  other  therapeutic  areas  (psoriasis  and  malignant  cutaneous lesions), however, these indications are not claimed in this application.

AMD is a degenerative eye disease with increasing  prevalence  in  old  age.  It  causes  severe  loss  of vision  and  is  the  most  common  cause  of  severe  irreversible  loss  of  vision  in  elderly  subjects  in industrialised  countries.  PM  is  a  similar  degenerative  eye  disease  that  occurs  in  myopic  patients  of younger age.

The  central  retina  around  the  fovea  has  a  very  high  metabolic  turnover  and  in  some  patients  the efficiency of recycling metabolic waste fails, with deposition of abnormal material in the retina and breakdown of tissue integrity. Two forms of AMD are known:

1. The  \"dry\"  form  of  the  disease,  which  is  the  most  frequent  form,  characterised  by  atrophic changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
2. The  'neovascular'  form  occurring  in  approximately  10  %  of  AMD  patients.  It  is  the  more aggressive  form  of  the  disease  responsible  for  90  %  of  severe  vision  loss  from  AMD.  Also known as the 'wet' or exudative form, this form is characterised by CNV when aberrant blood vessels grow into the fovea from the choroid beneath. These newly-formed blood vessels may leak  fluid,  lipid  and  blood,  and  may  form  a  disciform  scar  which  permanently  damages  the fovea.  The  neovascular  type  of  AMD  usually  progresses  in  extent  and  character,  from  a localised submacular process consisting of delicate new vessels through an intermediate phase with  serous  exudation  and  haemorrhage to  an end-stage  with  an  involuted  fibrous  membrane underlying the entire macula with complete or near-complete loss of vision. Overall, it has been estimated that 70 % of eyes with CNV will have severe loss of vision within two years from diagnosis.

The general mechanism of PDT with porphyrins is the release of cytotoxic species (such as the highly reactive short-lived 'singlet oxygen'). These species are generated in situ, on exposure to visible light energy.  In  this  specific  case  in  the  context  of  CNV,  the  cytotoxic  effect  damages  endothelial  cells, ultimately  resulting  in  localised  vascular  occlusion  of  the  CNV.  It  is  proposed  that  this  selective occlusion of leaking blood vessels results in stabilisation of vision, or reduction in the rate of vision loss.

Current therapeutic strategies for neovascular AMD  are few, and include Thermal Laser Photocoagulation, submacular surgery, radiotherapy or interferon alfa 2a. Of these, Laser photocoagulation is  the  only  clinically-proven  treatment  available  for  the  wet  or  exudative  form  of AMD characterised by CNV, but the prevalence of recurrence in the two main subgroups of CNV is in the  region  of  50  -  80%  and  furthermore  only  15%  of  patients  are  considered  eligible  for  laser treatment.  Therefore,  exudative  AMD  could  be  regarded  as  an  intractable  disease  with  a  need  for alternative  treatments,  which  can  control  CNV  whilst  not  affecting  the  surrounding  and  overlying tissues.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Visudyne  is  a  lyophilised  powder,  which  is  reconstituted  to  a  liposomal  solution  and  given  by intravenous  infusion.  The  product  has  been  co-developed  by  Novartis  Ophtalmicis  AG  (formerly CibaVision AG), Switzerland and QLT Inc. (formerly QLT Phototherapeutics Inc.), Canada.

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

The composition of this product is complex. Due to the very low solubility of the active substance, a lipid-based system is employed, consisting chiefly of phosphatidylglycerol (egg) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine,  with  antioxidants  buylated  hydroxytoluene  and  ascorbyl  palmitate. Lactose is added to adjust osmolarity and to protect the system during the lyophilisation process.

The product is presented as a freeze-dried powder, 15 mg verteporfin per glass vial, to be reconstituted into  solution  as  a  concentrate,  then  diluted  for  infusion  in  accordance  with  the  SPC  to  give  a recommended dose of 6 mg/m 2 in 30 ml of infusion solution.

## Active substance

Verteporfin INN is a semisynthetic mixture of porphyrins also known as Benzporphyrin Derivative Monoacid Ring A (BPD-MA). It consists of an equimolar mixture of the regioisomers BPD-MAC &amp; BPD-MAD and each regioisomer is a racemate of two isomers. It exists as a dark green-to-black solid, insoluble  in  water,  and  is  produced  from  porcine  hemin  as  a  starting  material.  The  ability  of  the manufacturing process to remove or inactivate animal-derived pathogens has been investigated in a number of viral safety studies and the process has been shown to be acceptably safe from a virological point of view.

Verteporfin  has  been  characterised  by  a  range  of  physicochemical  methods  and  the  specification includes  tests  with  satisfactory  limits  for  assay,  regioisomer  ratio,  related  impurities  etc,  as  well  as microbiological tests including bacterial endotoxins.

A  number  of  related  impurities  has  been  identified  and  quantified  by  means  of  HPLC.  The pharmacodynamic activity of each is uncertain, but the impurity specification is considered justified with reference to material used in animal toxicology studies.

Stability  of  verteporfin  has  been  shown  by  studies  on  7  batches  using  validated  stability-indicating methods. A photostability study according to the ICH guideline indicates that the storage containers give adequate protection, and in general the results support storage at -20 o C during the retest period following batch release.

## Other ingredients

The composition includes a number of phospholipids, antioxidants and lactose PhEur.

Since  some  of  these  may  have  an  animal  origin,  their  microbiological  status  is  important.  Their potential  to  transmit  animal-derived  pathogens  has  been  investigated  in  a  number  of  viral  safety studies, and they have been shown to be acceptably safe.

## Product development and finished product

A lipid-based  formulation  is  reasonable  for  this  insoluble  active  substance.  It  is  also  proposed  that lipid  binding  may  be  relevant  with  regard  to  this  indication,  as  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL) receptors  are  abundant  in  neovascular  tissue.  Unlike  some  liposomal  systems,  liposome  size  in  this case does not appear to be critical with regard to specific 'targetting' and disposition. Selectivity in this  indication  (and  PDT  in  general)  is  also  related  to  the  performance  characteristics  of  the  light irradiation system, shape of lesion vs. shape of light beam etc.

This complex formulation cannot be autoclaved, and sterilisation by means of filtration is reasonable in this case.

The manufacturing process involves mixing and evaporating the ingredients from dichloromethane to form an intermediate product ('presomes'). Lactose is added in a hydration and size reduction process, followed  by  a  pre-filtration step, two  0.22  micron  sterile  filtration steps, aseptic filling  and lyophilisation. This process has been validated in a satisfactory way.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The specification includes tests for assay, related substances with limits slightly increased compared to the active substance, osmolality, antioxidant content, uniformity of content etc. The average size of the liposomes  is  less  than  100nm  and  there  are  also  tests  for  particulate  matter  above  10  microns, pyrogens and sterility.

Batch analyses (n=3) indicate satisfactory compliance with specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability data have been generated from 6 small-scale batches, and no significant degradation has been observed during the conditions of study (25 o C/60%RH, 30 o C/60%RH, 40 o C/75%RH.)

Temperature cycling and photostability studies have also been performed and no significant changes were  recorded.  The  results  indicate  a  stable  product  that  needs  no  special  storage  requirements, although storage in the original outer carton is recommended (to protect from light), for the period defined in the SPC.

Stability studies after reconstitution of product one year old indicate a storage time of 4h would be acceptable for the reconstituted product.

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

The general mechanism of PDT with porphyrins is the release of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species like free radicals and singlet oxygen. These molecules are generated in situ when certain porphyrins are exposed to visible light, in variable amounts depending on the quantum yield.

The quantum yield for singlet oxygen production from verteporfin is 0.78, i.e. 8 of 10 photons that are absorbed  produce  singlet  oxygen.  It  can  be  calculated  that  500,000  singlet  oxygen  molecules  are produced by a verteporfin molecule in one second. Singlet oxygen can react directly with proteins, lipids  and  nucleic  acids,  generating  products  that  can  subsequently  initiate  the  production  of  free radicals leading to auto-oxidation and breakdown of these molecules.

A photosensitizer can be activated with light at any wavelength within its absorption spectrum. The optical absorption spectrum of verteporfin is shown in Figure I. The action spectrum of verteporfin is known to follow  its  absorption  spectrum  in  vitro,  however  in  vivo,  red  light  because  of  its  deeper penetration, is more effective. Oxyhemoglobin has minimal absorption at the maximal absorption peak of  verteporfin  (689  nm),  it  will  therefore  interfere  minimally  with  verteporfin  activation  at  this wavelength. Therefore, 685-693 nm (red) light is the wavelength range of choice for applications in which  hemoglobin  could  attenuate  the  effect.  This  wavelength  range  has  been  chosen  for  PDT  in AMD and PM, and has been shown to be safe for the retina.

In  vivo  studies  with  animal  tumour  models  demonstrated  that  the  association  of  verteporfin  with plasma  lipoproteins  enhances  its  photodynamic  cytotoxicity.  LDL  receptors  are  present  on  tumour cells and endothelial cells and may be involved in the uptake of lipoprotein bound verteporfin by these cells.  Moreover,  morphological  studies  have  shown  the  occurrence  of  early  vascular  damage consisting of congestion, stasis and haemorrhage in PDT-treated tumours and normal tissues.

A General Pharmacological Study of verteporfin was performed and did not show any effects on the CNS system in mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg. Furthermore, no marked changes were observed in the respiratory  and  cardiovascular  system  in  anesthetized  rabbits  after  intravenous  administration  of  LBPD-MA at 0.2, 2 and 20 mg/kg. Intravenous administration of L-BPD-MA at 0.2, 2 and 20 mg/kg did not induce any effects on the gastrointestinal or renal system in rats.

## Pharmacokinetics

In vitro studies showed that verteporfin was metabolised to a 'diacid' metabolite by human liver S9 and  human  liver  microsomes  (HLM).  The  amounts  of  the  diacid  increased  linearly  with  time, however,  the  formation  of  the  diacid  could  only  account  for  approximately  60%  of  the  parent regioisomers  in  incubations  with  S9.  The  results  suggest  that  the  parent  compound  is  metabolised further to unknown metabolites.

After  iv  administration  the  primary  metabolic  pathway  is  esterase  hydrolysis.  The  end  product  of hydrolysing BPD-MAC and BPD-MAD is considered to be the same, a common diacid resulting from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the removal of the methyl group linked to C or D respectively. Excretion is mainly in the bile and with the  faeces,  as  would  be  expected  for  highly  lipophilic  molecules  with  a  relatively  high  molecular weight.

In  rats  given  radiolabelled  verteporfin,  some  90%  of  the  radioactivity  is  recovered  in  the  faeces following i.v. administration, with approximately 3.5% of the radioactivity retained in the carcass on day 7 post dose. Since the proposed patient treatment is a single dose, the low level retained in the carcass for a period of days is not a cause for concern. Further identification of the composition of the 90% recovered radioactivity is difficult since endogenous porphyrins and their metabolites occur in faeces in both rat and man. The identification of porphyrin metabolites in faeces is further complicated by the action of bacterial flora, which can either synthesise various porphyrins de novo or metabolise porphyrins present in gut contents.

In  summary,  animal  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  demonstrated  plasma  lipoprotein  affinity.  The substance  is  primarily  excreted  in  bile  with  a  half-life  below  5  hours  in  dogs  and  monkeys.  The substance  concentrates  in  dividing  cells  and  tumors,  however  only  very  low  levels  of  radioactivity were  observed  in  the  testes,  indicating  that  this  organ  should  not  have  a  high  potential  for phototoxicity.  Similarly  low  levels  were  found  in  the  skin,  although  in  pigs  dermal  phototoxicity appears to correlate with plasma levels rather than dermal tissue levels.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

The results of single dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs show that the primary findings were skin lesions, damage to subcutaneous tissue and muscles. The extent and severity was dose related to both verteporfin and light. The dog was the most sensitive species with a NOEL of 0.1 mg/kg at 50 J/cm 2

## Repeated dose toxicity

Repeated  administration  i.v.  to  rats  and  dogs  indicated  similar  findings  to  the  above  single  dose studies.

Treatment resulted in dose-related damage to skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle at the irradiation site in the absence of any indication of systemic effects. In the rat, where the dose levels of verteporfin were  higher,  the  local  effects  at  the  irradation  sites  were  accompanied  by  haematological  changes. Haemolysis  occurring  at  the  higher  dose  levels  was  accompanied  by  increased  spleen  weight, moderate increase in extramedullary haematopoiesis in spleen, slight to moderate erythroid hyperplasia  of  bone  marrow and  minimal extramedullary haematopoiesis in the liver. In dogs daily administration  in  2  weeks  of  10  and  20  mg/kg  resulted  in  perivascular  neutrophilic  infiltrate  in  the liver, interstitial nephritis and increased renal tubular basophilia together with increased erythropoiesis in bone marrow.  Increased haematopoiesis in the spleen was observed in all groups except the sham injected control animals,  i.e including  the control animals  receiving  the placebo  lipid  based formulation.  The  classes  of  lipids  used  as  excipients  in  Visudyne  are  known  to  be  haemolytic  at appropriate concentrations.

A 14-day study in rats in the absence of light irradiation resulted in  mild  extravascular  haemolysis with increased bilirubin and enhanced haematopoietic response. High dose animals were dosed with undiluted lipid based verteporfin, while low dose groups received lipid based formulation which had been diluted with 5% dextrose. Control animals received 5% dextrose.

The toxicity observed in a 28-day study, without irradiation, in rats was qualitatively similar in nature to the findings in the 14-day study, but with pigment accumulation in the kidney and liver at the higher doses. The haemolysis and associated findings were related to the verteporfin dose and, as in the 14day study, to the excipient concentration.

A major consistent finding in repeated dose studies of the formulation with or without verteporfin is haemolysis and regenerative haematopoesis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Update arising from Type II Variation (II/01):

Anaesthetised  pigs  receiving  a  bolus  injection  of  verteporfin  have  been  found  to  show  severe cardiovascular / haemodynamic effects with some fatalities after rapid or slow IV injection - a finding not observed in conscious pigs. These cardiovascular events were prevented by an antihistaminic drug (diphenhydramine)  and  were  interpreted  as  an  anaphylactoid  reaction  to  verteporfin  in  conjunction with  anaesthesia,  possibly  due  to  the  rapid  activation  of  Complement.  In  addition,  a  study  in  four young Landrace-Yorkshire pigs which received repeated IV injections of verteporfin at 2 mg/kg shows that two formulations of verteporfin and a placebo can all induce symptoms such as patchy red skin, decreased  and  weakened  heartbeat,  and  problems  with  breathing  culminating  in  apnoea  which  are consistent  with  those  of  an  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid  reaction  caused  by  Complement  activation. This study again suggests that pigs in particular are highly sensitive to this phenomenon. The study was performed under conditions of administration similar to those in humans but it may be regarded as a pilot study, which does not allow any firm quantitative conclusions. The clinical relevance of these results  in  humans  is  therefore  not  clear.  An in  vitro study  carried  out  on  human  blood  shows  that verteporfin is able to activate the Complement system in humans (although no direct evidence of this was observed in the clinical studies).

## Skin phototoxicity

Severe skin phototoxicity was demonstrated in mice exposed to whole-body light irradiation 3 hr after 10 or 20 mg/kg verteporfin, with no effect at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Whole-body irradiation 24 and 48 hr after verteporfin dosing did not elicit skin reactions.

In a study in pigs, the species usually considered to be the most appropriate model for human skin, the strongest  skin  reactions  were  observed  within  the  first  45  minutes  with  0.5  mg/kg  lipid-based verteporfin and exposure to 100 J/cm 2 of light, at exposure to 50 J/cm 2 in the first 30 minutes and at 25 J/cm 2 only observed at 0 and 15 minute timepoints. The pharmacokinetic data from this study suggest that early development of phototoxicity correlates with plasma verteporfin levels.

In a study, which can be described as a phototoxicity tolerance study, albino rabbits were exposed to 14 PDT treatments at weekly intervals. The verteporfin dose was 0.5 mg/kg, which was followed with whole body exposure to 40% and 80% of the minimum erythematous light dose. Controls received no treatment or were treated with light only. The animals were sacrificed 16 weeks after the last PDT treatment. There were no significant differences between control and experimental groups in a wide range of parameters

## Ocular Effects

The safety of single and multiple verteporfin and light treatments in the eye was investigated in studies in rabbits and monkeys in which laser light was used to activate verteporfin. These studies consistently and reproducibly demonstrated that the degree of damage caused by verteporfin PDT is dependent on drug dose, light dose and timing of photoactivation. Clearly the correct timing of infusion and light activation is very important in determining the necessary selectivity in therapy, whereby neovascular lesions are occluded but surrounding normal tissue is not damaged. The clinical timings involved in Visudyne PDT were based on the findings in these rabbit and monkey studies. In the rabbit studies, pigmented and albino strains were used. No differences were seen in the responses in pigmented and non-pigmented eyes. Sensitivity to light following verteporfin administration was investigated in dogs exposed to sunlight at 1 to 4 days after drug infusion. No evidence of retinal or other ocular toxicity was observed.

## Genotoxicity

The mutagenic potential of verteporfin in the absence and presence of light irradiation was studied in four in vitro studies and one in vivo study. The source of light used in the in vitro studies was white fluorescent lighting. Due to the low solubility of the substance the actual exposure of the cells studied is not known. However, cytotoxicity taken as indicator of exposure was demonstrated at high doses.

In all bacterial strains without light irradiation and the Salmonella strains with light irradiation (1.04 J/M2) revertant frequencies were not increased over controls while in WP2uvrA, approximately 2 fold increases compared to control values were seen in the presence of light irradiation at doses of 15.4 and 46.1 µ g/plate without S9.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In CHO cells 0.1 µ g/ml verteporfin with 0, 105, 210, 315, 420, 525 and 630 J/m 2 light exposures did not increase mutant frequency.

Cells treated with f 0.09 µ g/ml and 360 J/m 2 produced a 43% reduction in relative cell growth in the 36-hour harvest while the activated 3.7 µ g/ml irradiated with 300 J/m 2 produced a 54% reduction in cell growth in the 30-hour harvest. No statistically significant differences in chromosome aberrations were found between treated and control groups.

## Control groups were not light activated.

In the in vivo micronucleus assay, mice that were irradiated with light were exposed to whole-body irradiation  with  simulated  sunlight.  The  solvent  for  verteporfin  in  the in  vitro assays  was  aqueous DMSO; verteporfin was administered as Visudyne in the micronucleus assay. All of the studies were GLP-compliant and, where appropriate, procedures were performed in subdued light.

Verteporfin  (0.01 µ g/ml  with  0-5000  J/m 2 )  did  not  induce  unscheduled  DNA  synthesis  (UDS)  in primary rat hepatocytes.

A micronucleus study was performed in mice with a single i.v. dose of 2, 5 or 10 mg/kg verteporfin. The animals were maintained in subdued light for 3 hr and then treated with approximately 90 J/cm 2 of  light  irradiation.  Animals,  which  received  10  mg/kg  with  light  showed  clear  evidence  of phototoxicity with loss of weight, dermal lesions and death.

At  the  24-hr  sampling,  a  marginally  significant  increase  (p=0.044)  was  observed  in  the  number  of micronucleated PCEs in the verteporfin groups treated with light irradiation.

At the 48-hr sampling, the mid and high dose group values were statistically different in comparison to solvent control group values, as statistically significant dose trend was also observed. The number of micronucleated  PCEs  in  the  mid  and  high  dose  groups,  however,  was  1.0  per  1000  PCEs,  a  value within the range of concurrent solvent control group values.

At  the  72-hr  sampling  there  was  no  significant  dose  response  trend  and  no  statistically  significant differences  in  the  number  of  micronucleated  PCEs  in  the  treated  groups  versus  the  light-irradiated groups.

Concerning genotoxicity, it must be mentioned that a genotoxic effect  may be expected in general, considering  the  mechanism  of  action  of  PDT  itself  and  the  generation  of  reactive  oxygen  species which are known to be genotoxic. However, this is a function of drug concentration and disposition and  irradiation  energy  and  time.  Furthermore,  verteporfin  concentrates  in  the  membrane  and cytoplasm  of  cells  rather  than  in  the  nucleus.  Since  the  diffusion  path  length  of  singlet  oxygen  is extremely  short,  its  effect  on  cellular  structures  is  confined  to  the  cytoplasmic  region  where verteporfin  is  localised.  Therefore,  a  direct  effect  of  verteporfin  on  DNA  is  not  expected  in  this particular case.

## Carcinogenicity

The CPMP accepts that verteporfin is essentially a single dose therapy in the context of this clinical indication, and it is not necessary to evaluate carcinogenic potential in life-span rodent studies.

## Reproduction Toxicity

The  effects  of  verteporfin  on  reproduction  were  evaluated  in  standard  3  segment,  GLP-compliant studies. Animals were maintained in lighting conditions at intensities below 20 foot-candles.

In  a  fertility  and  general  reproduction  study  in  rats  the  dose  levels  were  1,  3  or  10  mg/kg/day  of verteporfin as Visudyne.

In  the  rat  teratogenicity  study  the  dose  levels  of  verteporfin  were  2,  10  or  25  mg/kg/day.  The developmental NOEL for verteporfin is 10 mg/kg/day. The 25 mg/kg/day dosage was associated with increases in malformations (anophthalmia/microphthalmia and bent/wavy ribs) that commonly occur at maternally toxic dosages. No other effects on embryo-foetal viability, growth or external, soft tissue or  skeletal  morphology were observed in litters  of dams  at doses as high as  25  mg/kg/day. Results from  a  placental  transfer  study  indicated  only  a  small  amount  (&lt;1%)  of  verteporfin  crossed  the placental barrier. Hence, the effects observed may be attributed to maternal toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following  a  dose-ranging  study,  verteporfin  was  administered  to  rabbits  at  dosages  of  1,  3  or  10 mg/kg/day  on  days  6  through  18  of  gestation.  In  the  dose-finding  study  25  mg/kg/day  caused numerous clinical signs including death, and 10 mg/kg/day signs of anaemia. All surviving animals were  killed  on  day  29  of  gestation.  There  are  no  toxicokinetic  data  available  for  rabbits;  however dosing at the maximum tolerated dose by the i.v.route means that maximum possible exposure of the foetuses was achieved. No adverse effects on embryo-foetal viability, growth or external, soft tissue or skeletal morphology were identified in litters of dams at doses as high as 10 mg/kg/day.

In general, at dose levels causing maternal haematological effects, no significant effects were seen in rats and rabbits on reproduction, apart from malformation commonly seen at maternally toxic doses.

## Local tolerance

Not relevant in this case.

## Other toxicity

A  separate  safety  evaluation  of  the  excipients  in  Visudyne  was  provided,  as  some  of  the  placebo material  used  in  the  animal  toxicity  studies  included  the  excipients.  It  was  clear  from  some  of  the placebo results that effects seen  may be attributed to the lipid constituents, possibly by dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine  (e.g.  in  a  rat  14  day  study  -  mild  extravascular  haemolysis  accompanied  by  a compensatory haematopoeitic response in bone marrow, spleen and liver).

## Ecotoxicity / Environmental risk assessment

No significant  impact  on  the  environment  can  be  expected  to  arise  from  the  use  of  the  product  in accordance  with  the  SPC.  However,  occupational  exposure  during  use  and  disposal  needs  to  be considered as verteporfin is active in low concentrations when exposed to light, and this is addressed in the SPC.

## Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects

All concerns raised by the CPMP during the evaluation process are now resolved for Part III:

The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles were correctly investigated. The pharmacodynamic  data  properly supported the conditions of use in humans.  The  lipid-base formulation, which is that tested in humans, is necessary to ensure a rapid distribution to the target organ (choroid) in patients. Evidence for selective accumulation of verteporfin in choroid neovascular endothelial cells has been demonstrated.

The  systemic  exposure  to  verteporfin  was  assessed  in  different  animal  models  tested  during  the preclinical programme. Additional information on metabolites (especially their respective stereoisomers)  profile  observed  in  different  animal  models  was  provided.  Esterase  stereospecificity was shown in vitro, in the absence of lipoproteins, therefore there is no obvious relationship between stereospecific  metabolism of verteporfin regioisomers and lipoprotein affinity. No other metabolites than the diacid were identified.

Tissue distribution was investigated in the main organs and no accumulation was observed.

The toxicological file is acceptable for the present indication i.e. one single i.v. injection which may be repeated at three month intervals. A satisfactory set of experiments was performed to demonstrate the  safety  of  verteporfin  after  light  irradiation,  especially  on  skin  and  eye  which  can  be  directly exposed.  All  the  excipients  were  presented  as  safe  for  use  in  the  formulated  product  and  the explanation given for the haematopoietic effects observed with high and repeated doses in the animal studies is that high concentrations of lipids lead to haematopoiesis, due to lysis of erythrocytes caused by membrane fluidity changes.

In the original dossier, no preclinical studies where verteporfin was repeatedly administrated indicated that the compound is immunogenic. However, updated toxicology information has confirmed the risk of severe cardiovascular/haemodynamic reactions in sedated/anaesthetised pigs - symptoms of patchy red  skin,  decreased  and  weakened  heartbeat,  and  problems  with  breathing  culminating  in  apnoea which  are  consistent  with  those  of  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid  reaction  caused  by  Complement activation. Verteporfin was also found to activate complement in an in vitro human blood study.

Taken  together  with  a  possible  anaphyllactoid  reaction  in  one  patient,  these  pre-clinical  findings support the statement on risk of allergic reactions, as mentioned in the SPC, sections 4.4 and 5.3. Concerning genotoxicity, it is a consequence of PDT that any compound producing reactive oxygen species (ros) may be expected to be genotoxic because ros react with DNA and induce DNA single and double-strand breaks in genotoxicity studies. However, verteporfin concentrates in the cytoplasm rather  than  the  nucleus  and  singlet  oxygen  has  a  very  short  half-life  and  diffusion  path.  Therefore DNA damage may not necessarily arise in this particular case. The test cell systems were exposed to verteporfin at appropriate concentrations, and therefore the observed results are valid.

It was clearly demonstrated that the degree of damage caused by verteporfin as well as its specificity for the targeted tissues is dependent on drug dose, i.e. blood level, light dose, and timing of activation.

The only remaining issue is the duration of the skin photosensitivity period. Assessed in an animal model, this duration has only little relevance to clinical situations, as the animal doses were several times higher than the proposed human doses. Based on the human data the applicant recommends that the patient avoids exposure to strong light for 48 hours.

The SPC has been adequately amended where necessary.

## 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects

The clinical development program comprises 3 pharmacokinetic studies in volunteers (total n = 73), an uncontrolled  ocular  study  in  patients  with  CNV  (n  =  142),  two  'main'  controlled  ocular  studies  in patients  who  have  CNV  lesions  secondary  to  AMD  (n  =  609),  and  one  multicentre,  double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised study in patients with subfoveal CNV caused by pathologic myopia (n=120 patients, 81 Visudyne, 39 placebo). (Another study in CNV  secondary to Ocular Histoplasmosis  Syndrome  (BPD  OCR  004,  n=26)  was  reported  but  the  CPMP  considered  that  the evidence was not sufficient to support an indication in OHS).

Safety data were accumulated from the combined uncontrolled and controlled ocular clinical studies, together with supportive data from studies in a few dermatological indications.

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

No pharmacodynamic studies in healthy volunteers or patients were carried out.

Verteporfin  is  a  1:1  mixture  of  two  structural  isomers  (regioisomers)  of  benzoporphyrin  derivative mono  acid  A  ring  i.e.  BDP-MAC  and  BDP-MAD.  A  HPLC  method  with  ultraviolet  detection  was developed for plasma and urine to determine the concentrations of BDP-MAC, BDP-MAD, and their main  metabolite  benzoporphyrin  derivative  diacid  (BPD-DA).  Plasma  concentrations  of  BDP-MAC and  BDP-MAD  were  added  to  obtain  verteporfin  concentrations.  This  method  has  been  properly validated with a limit of quantification of 2 or 5 ng/ml in plasma (according to the site of the study) and 0.5 ng/ml in urine. Capillary electrophoresis was used to determine the ratio of enantiomers of BPD-MAC, BPD-MAD and BPD-DA, which was also present as a pair of enantiomers. This method was satisfactorily validated with a limit of quantification of 2.5 ng/ml for BPD-MAC, BPD-MAD, and of 12.5 ng/ml for BPD-DA in plasma. The limit of quantification was 2.5 ng/ml for BPD-MAC, BPDMAD and BPD-DA in urine.

## Studies PK 001A &amp; 001B:

The  plasma  concentration  profiles  of  the  verteporfin  isomers  BPD-MAC  and  BPD-MAD,  and  their sum,  verteporfin,  exhibited  similar  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  across  the  doses  and  rates  of administration studied, and also in Caucasian compared  with  Japanese subjects. All  plasma concentration  profiles  were  bi-exponential,  with  a  rapid  distribution  phase  followed  by  a  slower elimination phase.

The mean half-life of the regioisomer BPD-MAC was similar to that of BPD-MAD (5.3 - 6.2 hours). A small  volume  of  distribution  (Vss  0.6  l/kg)  was  found  for  BPD-MAC,  BPD-MAD  and  verteporfin. Verteporfin is highly protein bound. In whole blood, 10 % of verteporfin is associated with red blood cells and 90% is found in plasma. 90 % of plasma verteporfin was found in lipoprotein owing to its high  lipid solubility. It  was  not  possible  to determine  the  unbound  fraction  (see  preclinical assessment).  Inspection  of  the  data  shows  that  total  body  clearance  of  BDP-MAC  seemed  slightly lower  (80  -  108)  ml/h / kg)  than  that  of  BDP-MAD  (89  -  127  ml/h / kg)  resulting  in  slightly  higher exposure  (AUC)  of  BPD-MAC.  The  determination  of  the  enantiomeric  ratios  for  each  of  the  two regioisomers  showed  that  the  enantiomers  of  BDP-MAC  but  not  those  of  BDP-MAD  are  subject  to stereospecific disposal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mean verteporfin values for all elimination parameters were always very close to those reported for BDP-MAC and BDP-MAD. Cmax of verteporfin and its two regioisomers is an important parameter from an efficacy perspective when the photodynamic light is applied. For the dose group administered 6 mg/m² over 10 minutes, the mean Cmax was 1.2 - 1.3 mg/l for both Caucasian and Japanese groups.

When 6 mg/m² of verteporfin for injection was administered as a bolus, mean Cmax for BDP-MAC, BDP-MAD and verteporfin was 36 %, 13 % and 22 % higher compared with 6 mg/m² as a 10 minute infusion.  None  of  these  differences  in  Cmax  was  statistically  significant,  suggesting  that  the  two dosing regimens provide adequate and rapid delivery of verteporfin into the bloodstream.

The  interindividual  variability  of  Cmax  and  AUCinf expressed  as  coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  was moderate (CV ≤ 25 %).

The  results  of  in  vitro  metabolism  studies  suggest  that  NADPH-dependent  enzymes  such  as cytochrome P450 isozymes do not play a significant role in the disposition of verteporfin. Likewise, conjugation  of  either  BDP-MAC,  BDP-MAD  or  BDP-DA  does  not  seem  to  occur.  Metabolism  is apparently carried out uniquely by plasma and hepatic esterases.

The cumulative urinary recovery of analytes was extremely low. Combined excretion of BDP-MAC, BDP-MAD and BDP-DA in urine was less than 0.004 % in Caucasian and Japanese subjects. These data strongly suggest that the majority of verteporfin (about 90 %) is eliminated by the liver.

Plasma  concentrations  of  the  metabolite,  BDP-DA  were  near  the  limit  of  detection  at  all  times following dosing. Based on the AUC ratio, the extent BPD-DA exposure represented 5 - 10 % of the verteporfin exposure.

Dose proportionality and linear pharmacokinetics were demonstrated only in Japanese subjects within the dose range studied i.e. 3 - 14 mg/m². No ethnic or gender effect was noted.

## Pharmacokinetics in subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction. (study BPD-004 )

Because preclinical studies as well as studies in healthy volunteers showed that verteporfin is cleared by the liver, the effect of hepatic dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of verteporfin was investigated. Eight  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  and  9  subjects  with  mild  hepatic  dysfunction  were enrolled and received an intravenous infusion of verteporfin (0.3 mg/kg) over a 45 minute period. This dose  was  approximately  twice  the  usual  recommended  dose.  Hepatic  dysfunction  was  not  graded according  to  the  Child-Pugh  classification.  The  extent  of  exposure  in  subjects  with  mild  hepatic dysfunction was greater ( ≈ 40  %)  but  not  statistically  significant  compared  to  normal  subjects.  The apparent  volume of  distribution  indicated  that  the  distribution  was  similar  between  the  two  groups. The  maximal  concentration  values  were  very  close  in  the  two  groups.  The  exposure  (AUC0-24h)  of verteporfin,  BDP-MAC and BDP-MAD was 1.42, 1.38 and 1.52 fold higher respectively in patients with  abnormal  function.  The  differences  were  not  statistically  significant.  Only  the  half-lives  of verteporfin and BDP-MAD were significantly increased in the subjects with hepatic dysfunction (4.9 vs 5.9 h and 4.7 vs 6.5 h respectively). No information was gathered relating to BDP-DA.

It  may  be  noted  that  in  the  clinical  uncontrolled  study  BPD-  OCR  001,  pharmacokinetic  data  were gathered for 22 patients who had at least one cutaneous lesion caused by metastatic disease and who received single intravenous doses 0.15, 0.20, 0.375 or 0.50 mg/kg over 45 minutes. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of verteporfin and its regioisomers determined in these patients were similar to those found in healthy volunteers.

## General principles

## Irradiation sources

PDT studies have used a laser delivery system providing a uniform intensity narrow bandwidth red light at subthermal intensity, λ ~689 nm, applied over a circular area. Some degree of over-treatment is inevitable for linear lesions. Two different laser systems have been used, each complying with the relevant requirements of the Medical Devices legislation, and having comparable optical properties. There  is  no  reason  to  suggest  that  the  two  systems  differ  significantly  in  their  performance characteristics in a way that would compromise the study results.

## CNV closure

CNV closure was a main indicator of efficacy in the dose evaluation study, and a secondary efficacy variable in the two controlled pivotal studies.

Four grades of CNV closure were predetermined: 100%, &lt;100% to 50%, &lt;50%, and 'progression'; they were evaluated by angiographic assessment of leakage of fluorescein from CNV lesions.

## Visual Acuity (VA) Measurement

The  other  main  indicator  of  efficacy  in  these  studies  was  visual  acuity  changes,  ideally  the stabilisation of VA or more realistically a reduced decline in VA compared to placebo.

Measurement  of  VA  was  based  on  the  procedure  developed  for  the  Early  Treatment  of  Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). A standard Snellen chart has been used for  measuring the refraction. Charts 1 and 2 were used for testing the right eye and the left eye, respectively. The features of the charts are 14 lines of letters to be read at distance of 2 metres, and 3 lines of letters to be read at a distance of 1 meter for patients with reduced vision. Each line shows five high-contrast 'Sloan' letters and  has  a  visual  acuity  equivalent  recorded  next  to  it.  The  lines  are  equally  difficult  and  show  a geometric  progression  of  letter  size  (and  thus,  an  arithmetic  progression  of  the  logarithm  of  the minimum angle of resolution) from line to line.

## Dose-response studies and main clinical studies

## Dose-response study BPD OCR 001

## Design

The evaluation of the dosage regimen was carried out in one open-label study in 142 patients. The study  results  were  checked  by  a  Photograph  Reading  Center,  an  independent  and  central  reading center.

## Objectives

Dose  escalation  assessment  was  only  one  of  the  secondary  objectives  of  the  study.  Protocol amendments  were  made  to  evaluate  different  dose  regimens  and  to  expand  the  number  of  patients treated  from  20-30  to  142.The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  assess  ocular  safety  and  to demonstrate preliminary efficacy of PDT using different drug-dose/light-dose regimens of verteporfin.

## Inclusion criteria

Patients ≥ 21 years of age with subfoveal CNV from any cause and a best corrected VA &lt;20/40.

Lesions should be characterised as following: presence of classic CNV in any proportion; evidence that the CNV involves the geometric centre of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ); a lesion size diameter ≤ 12 Macular Photocoagulation Study Disc Area units (MPS DA units) i.e. 5200µm.

## Efficacy parameters

- The primary efficacy parameter was CNV closure determined by angiographic assessment of fluorescein leakage from CNV lesions.
- The  secondary  efficacy  parameter  was  visual  acuity  (VA)  measured  using  the  ETDRS procedure.
- Assessments were made 1, 4 and 12 weeks after the first exposure to PDT with verteporfin.

Five treatment regimens were defined on the basis of both pre-clinical data in primates and clinical experience in oncology:

a verteporfin infused at a rate of 3 ml/min (10-minute infusion) except in Regimen 5, which utilised a rate of 6 ml/min (5-minute infusion).

Retreatment for up to three courses was allowed.

## Results

Demographic and baseline characteristics:

Of the 142 patients, 53 % were male and 47 % were female. All but one patient were Caucasian and the mean age was 72 years. Most of the patients had CNV secondary to AMD. 80 % of patients had a baseline visual acuity for the treated eye ≥ 20/200.

Classic CNV closure after the first course (number and percent of AMD patients a )  is  shown in the table below:

- Regarding the ability to  produce  classic  CNV  closure,  Regimens  2  and  4  appeared  to  be  the most effective of the five treatment strategies tested with a minor advantage for Regimen 4 at week 1. The incidence of complete closure range reaches a maximum of 100%, and by week 4 it continued to have the highest incidence of complete closure (29%).
- Conversely, Regimen 5 was the less effective regimen (week 4 = 0%).
- The results found in occult CNV closure after the first course did not match those seen in classic CNV closure: at week 1 the highest incidence of complete closure was observed in Regimens 1 and 3. Notable differences between regimens in complete closure were not seen at other visits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- For all  regimens,  except  Regimen  3,  mean  visual  acuity  after  the  first  course  increased  from baseline at Weeks 1 and 4. Regimen 4 showed the highest and most persistent mean increases in VA at Week 4 (+1.1 line).
- No observable light-dose response was detected relative to classic or occult CNV closure.
- Non-selective  closure  of  retinal  arterioles  at  light  doses  of  150J/cm 2 administered  either 20 minutes after 6mg/m 2 VTP or 30 minutes after 12mg/m 2 was found and thus, considered as a non tolerated light doses for these regimen.

On balance, Regimen 4 was selected to be used in clinical studies as it was considered the « lowest » drug  dose  and  light  combination  producing  classic  CNV  closure.  This  regimen  corresponds  to  a 6 mg/m 2 10-minute infusion of verteporfin and a light dose of 50 J/cm 2 applied 15 minutes after the start of infusion.

## Main Clinical studies BPD OCR 002A &amp; 002B

## Study objective

The primary objective was to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of PDT with verteporfin compared to placebo in limiting the decrease in visual acuity in patients with subfoveal CNV due to AMD.

## Study design

Two  identical  placebo-controlled  and  randomised  trials  involving  a  total  of  609  patients  were conducted in Europe and North America under the same protocol: BPD OCR 002 A &amp; 002 B

Both were planned for a two-year duration.

Selected patient population:

The selected inclusion criteria were:

- -male and female patients over 50 years old ,
- -with  new  or  recurrent  subfoveal  CNV  lesions  secondary  to  AMD including  a  component  of classic CNV and angiographic evidence of the extent of CNV under the geometric centre of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ),
- -occult CNV lesions could also be included,
- -area  of  classic  plus  occult  CNV  lesions  were  defined  as ≥ 50%  of  the  total  lesion  and  the greatest linear dimension of the entire lesion were defined as ≤ 9 MPS disc area units (i.e 5400 µm),
- -the specified best corrected visual acuity in the selected eye was 34 -73 letters.

Inclusion criteria comply with a frequently-encountered clinical situation. The selection criteria allow the  possibility  to  eliminate  isolated  extra-  or  juxta-foveal  CNVs,  which  are  indications  of  laser treatment. 'Pure', isolated or predominantly occult CNV is also excluded, as the diagnosis is difficult and sometimes uncertain.

## Primary efficacy parameter

The primary efficacy parameter was visual acuity response relative to baseline:

The responder rate was defined as the proportion of patients who lost less than 15 letters (i.e. 3 lines) of visual acuity at month 12; the sample size was calculated on this parameter.

The proportion of patients in whom VA decreased from baseline by less than 30 letters (i.e. 6 lines) was also selected as a primary efficacy parameter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary efficacy parameters

- -Secondary efficacy parameters were the proportion of patients whose VA became less than 34 letters (i.e. &lt;20/200), the time until a patient had moderate or severe decrease of visual acuity from baseline (i.e. ≥ 15 or 30 letters, respectively), the mean change from baseline in VA.
- -Other  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  also  employed,  e.g.  CNV  closure  determined  by angiographic assessment of fluorescein leakage from classic &amp; occult CNV lesions compared to baseline.
- -Some  secondary  measures  were  defined  post  hoc,  i.e.  the  time  until  a  patient's  VA  score became less than 34 letters (not defined in the protocol), mean change from baseline in contrast sensitivity using the Pelli-Robson chart, lesion size measurement (not specified in the protocol).

## Dose and duration of treatment

As indicated by the dose ranging study, the Regimen 4 was used in clinical studies, i.e. a single10minute intravenous infusion of 6mg/m 2 body surface area of verteporfin (or placebo) was administered, followed by application of red light with a wavelength of 689 nm at a dose of 50 J/cm 2 delivered at a fluence of 600mW/cm 2 over 83 seconds, 15 minutes after the start of the infusion.

## Only one eye per patient was allowed to be treated.

Retreatment  was  allowed  every  three  months,  up  to  a  maximum  of  four  treatments  per  year  if necessary (i.e. if evidence of CNV leakage was detected by fluorescein angiography).

The total duration of treatment for each patient was 24 months.

## Statistical analysis

## Randomisation

Patients were randomised in a ratio of 2:1 (2 Visudyne for 1 placebo); a stratification by centre and baseline visual acuity was made and two classes were defined 54-73 letters and 34-53 letters.

## Sample size

For  each  study,  it  was  estimated  that  50%  of  the  placebo  patients  would  loose  less  than  3  lines  of visual  acuity  (i.e.  15  letters)  compared  to  baseline  after  one  year.  Then  a  total  sample  size  of  225 would provide approximately 94% power to detect a difference from placebo of 25% and 80% power to detect a difference from placebo of 20%. Statistical tests were 2-sided with significance level ( α ) of 0.05.

## Efficacy analysis

The primary data set for efficacy analysis was the intent-to-treat (ITT). Analyses were performed on both intent-to-treat and evaluable-patient populations.

Between treatment comparisons of the proportion of responders were performed using a chi-square test and a logistic regression was made taking into account the gender, and the two states defined for baseline visual acuity, time interaction between these two variables and the treatment.

The time to a moderate or a severe decrease in visual acuity as well as the time to visual acuity &lt;34 letters were analysed using a Cox model: the analysis comprises efficacy data for over 21 months.

The main reason for absence of retreatment was the absence of CNV leakage detected by fluorescein angiography.

Most of the patients were treated at least 3 times a year.

At Month 12 compared to baseline, verteporfin was statistically significantly superior to placebo in both Study A and Study B. At 12 months, the difference in the proportion of responders was 14.8% in favour of verteporfin, for Studies A &amp; B combined. For the subgroup of patients with predominantly classic CNV, the difference was 27.5% (p&lt;0.001)

The  results  of  the  logistic  regression  model  indicated  that  the  odds  of  being  a  responder  at  month 12 for patients treated with verteporfin were approximately 1.9 times the odds of being a responder for patients treated with placebo. This risk is significantly different from 1 (p=0.009).

The second analysis at Month 24 confirmed the treatment effect seen at Month 12, indicating that the treatment benefit continues through 24 months of follow-up. At Month 24, the difference between the verteporfin  and  placebo  groups,  favouring  verteporfin,  was  15.3%  for  all  patients  in  studies  A+B (p&lt;0.001). This difference at Month 24 was statistically significant in both Study A (11.7%, p=.049) and Study B (19.1%, p= 0.002).

Concerning  those  patients  with  predominantly  classic  CNV,  the  difference  calculated  from  the combined studies is 28% (p&lt;0.001)

Considering the elderly patient population and the long duration of the study, a high percentage of patients had visual acuity assessments. Approximately 94% at month 12 (i.e. verteporfin n=379 and placebo n= 194; and 87% at month 24 (i.e. verteporfin n=351 and placebo n= 178), for all patients in studies  A+B.  A  similar  high  percentage  of  patients  had  acuity  assessments  in  the  predominantly classic CNV subgroup in studies A+B (i.e. verteporfin 87% and placebo 88%).

## · Secondary efficacy variables results in intent-to-treat analysis

Time-to-event analysis (month 0 - through month 21 inclusive):

For both studies (A&amp;B respectively), treatments were statistically significant compared to placebo for the  time  to  a  moderate  decrease  in  visual  acuity  as  well  as  for  the  time  to  severe  decrease  with  a decrease in risk by 30% and 38% ( ≤ 15 letters) and by 43% and 51% ( ≤ 30 letters).

Conversely,  treatment  was  not  statistically  significant  for  the  time  for  visual  acuity  to  become  less than 34 letters in study A (p=0.246) but statistically significant in study B (p=0.024) with a decrease in risk of 33%.

Change from baseline in visual acuity scores at month 12:

For both studies (A&amp;B respectively): the adjusted means showed a 13.3 and 10.6-letter decrease in verteporfin-treated patients compared to a decrease of 19.2 and 17.7 letters in the placebo group. The differences between the two groups were significant (5.9 letters - p=0.004 and 7.1 letters - p=0.001).

* for all patients including those who did not have classic CNV at baseline.

** for all patients including those who did not have occult CNV at baseline.

At month 12, the angiography results of both studies A&amp;B were significantly in favour of verteporfin patients  either  on  complete  plus  partial  classic  CNV  closure  or  in  slowing  down  classic  CNV progression compared to placebo.

No conclusion could be raised for occult CNV. The efficacy that was shown is due to the effect on 'classic' CNV.

Various sub-group analyses were realised. Overall, results were consistent with the previous results showing  a  higher  percentage  of  12-month  responders  in  verteporfin  groups  compared  to  placebo groups. The only main difference was observed between predominantly classic CNV (i.e. classic CNV ≥ 50%  compared  to  occult  CNV  (i.e  classic  CNV  &lt;50%)  at  the  inclusion.  The  results  show  a difference in favour of the classic CNV group.

## 1. Study in subfoveal CNV related to Pathologic Myopia (PM).

Study BPD OCR 003: After the original authorisation of Visudyne, this study was later submitted as a Type II variation to extend the indication (See 'Steps taken after granting the authorisation'). It is a placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomised study on a total of 459 patients with new subfoveal CNV  secondary  to  AMD  (n=339)  or  subfoveal  CNV  secondary  to  Pathologic  Myopia,  i.e.  PM (n=120).  The  study  was  stratified  by  pathologies  and  thus,  separate  reports  for  the  AMD  and  PM populations were presented. The following table summarises the findings for the 120 PM patients:-

The posology, visual acuity assessments etc. were the same as in the AMD studies BPD OCR 002 A and B reported above.

## Primary efficacy parameter

The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients who were classified as responders to the treatment, based on the visual acuity response at Month 12 relative to baseline.

The responder rate was originally defined prospectively in the protocol as the proportion of patients who lost less than 1.5 lines of visual acuity (i.e. 8 letters) in the treated eye. However, following an FDA recommendation, responders were re- defined as the proportion of patients who lost less than 3 lines of visual acuity (i.e. 15 letters) in the treated eye.

## Secondary efficacy parameter

Secondary criteria were the same as those selected for BPD OCR 002 A and B studies.

i.e. the proportion of patients whose VA became less than 34 letters (i.e. &lt; 20/200), the time until a patient had moderate or severe decrease of visual acuity from baseline (i.e. ≥ 15 or 30 letters decrease respectively).

In general, based on the one-year results from this trial, the efficacy of PDT with verteporfin has been demonstrated in the treatment of 120 patients with pathologic myopia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The loss in visual acuity was significantly lower in patients receiving verteporfin. Moderate and severe decreases  in  visual  acuity  were  significantly  reduced  by  the  treatment.  The  treatment  brings  a moderate benefit but of clinical importance in slowing down the loss of visual acuity and also in some cases, in improving vision, which was not obtained up to now by other therapy.

The extension of the indication for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia (PM) was authorised in March 2001 on the basis of the 1-year results. It was concluded that the benefit/risk at 1-year was acceptable for patients with pathological Myopia.

The  CPMP,  however,  requested  the  complete  two-year  results  as  a  follow-up  commitment  for  the variation, in order to confirm the long-term benefit/risk balance in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovasculariasation secondary to pathological myopia. The complete two-year results were provided by the MAH in July 2001. It was concluded that the results of the 2-year follow up no longer reached statistical significance and suggested that the clinical benefit may decrease over time. However, results showed  more  variability  than  a  clear  temporal  trend  and  were  numerically  still  in  favour  of verteporfin. No additional safety concerns were raised from the safety data in PM patients.

The CPMP recommended to update the section 5.1 of the SPC to reflect the clinical results of study BPD OCR 003 PM at 24 months and to add that the clinical benefit may diminish over time. These changes were introduced to the SPC through a Type II variation.

## Extension of indication to include the indication of occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation due to age-related macular degeneration

Visudyne was initially  approved  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  predominantly  classic  subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and through a Type II varition also to patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathologic myopia (PM).

The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  applied  for  a  Type  II  variation,  to  extend  the  current  use  of verteporfin to a broader AMD  patient population who have occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation. The study supporting the MAH's request is Study BPD OCR 003. The study is a placebo-controlled,  double-masked,  randomised  study  involving  a  total  of  339  patients,  225  were randomised to verteporfin and 114 to placebo. Clinical studies procedures and measurement tools used in  the  additional  clinical  study  were  the  same  as  they  were  in  the  original  file  for  AMD  patients (studies OCR 002 A &amp; B). The exclusion criteria were the same as those selected for AMD patients previously analysed.

The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients who were classified as responders to the treatment, based on the visual acuity response at Month 12 relative to baseline.

The responder rate was defined prospectively in the protocol as the proportion of patients who lost less than 3 lines of visual acuity (i.e.15 letters) in the treated eye.

A change of 15 letters is a moderate decrease in visual acuity and represents a doubling in the visual angle.  This  is  of  clinical  significance  and  is  consistent  with  the  definition  previously  used  in  BPD OCR 002 A and 002 B studies for AMD patients.

Secondary efficacy criteria  were:  change  from  baseline  of  mean  visual  acuity  scores,  proportion  of patients with a decrease from baseline of less than 30 letters, the proportion of patients whose visual acuity decreased to less than 34 letters, time until a patient had a decrease from baseline in BCVA of 15 letters or more and of 30 letters or more, the change from baseline in the level of classic and occult CNV,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  no  classic  CNV  at  baseline  but  developed  classic  CNV during the study, lesion size measurements, the change from baseline in the mean subjective visual performance scores and assessment of change in contrast sensitivity.

The primary analysis of efficacy was when all patients had completed 12 months of follow-up (cut-off date: October 29, 1999). A second analysis was planned when all patients had completed 24 months of follow-up.

Between treatment comparisons of the proportion of responders at one year were performed using a chi-square  test  and  a  logistic  regression  was  made  taking  into  account  the  demographic  and  lesion characteristics,  the  two  strata  defined  for  baseline  visual  acuity,  time  interaction  between  these variables and the treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The time to a moderate decrease ( ≥ 15 letters) or a severe decrease ( ≥ 30 letters) in visual acuity were analysed using a Cox model. The baseline visual acuity was included in the model.

The intent-to-treat analysis was the primary set of efficacy analyses, which included all available data from patients who have evidence of CNV in their lesion at baseline as assessed by the photograph reading centre. For ITT analysis, data were imputed for all missing values by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. The evaluable-patients analysis included all available data from patients who follow the protocol without significant deviation.

Three data sets were analysed as intent-to-treat samples:

- -The first was the overall study patient sample (n=339).
- -The second was comprised of patients who had occult with no classic CNV lesions at baseline (n=258, i.e. 76% of the overall population).
- -The third included patients who had occult with no classic CNV lesions and either a smaller lesion  (  4 MPS DA i.e. Macular Photocoagulation Study Disc Area) or a poorer visual acuity score (  65 letters) at baseline (n=187, i.e. 55% of the overall population).

The  two  first  data  sets  were  defined  prospectively,  the  third  presented  as  explanatory.  For  each  of these data sets, missing efficacy values were imputed by the method of LOCF except for the time-toevent analyses.

At baseline, the mean visual acuity scores were comparable: verteporfin 66.3 and placebo 65.4 letters. Lesion characteristics were for verteporfin group and placebo group, respectively: 97.8% and 97.4% of patients showed evidence of CNV in ≥ 50% of the treatable lesion, subfoveal in 84.9% and 80.7% of the lesions, a classic component documented in 24% and 18.4% and an occult CNV was seen in 92.9 and 95.6% of patients.

Overall, demographic and lesion characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups except for contrast sensitivity (p=0.017).

The number (percentage) of Patient Responders a (&lt;15-letter Decrease in Visual Acuity) at Months 12 and 24 for the overall population (n=339) are shown below:

a A responder was a patient who had a decrease from baseline of &lt; 15 letters in VA.

b At month 12, the sample sizes were 225 and 114 for the verteporfin and placebo groups, respectively. b At month 24, the sample sizes were 225 and 114 for the verteporfin and placebo groups, respectively.

c Wald Chi-square used to test significance.

d Wald 95% Confidence Interval for Odds Ratio.

e Odds Ratio : verteporfin treatment group compared to placebo group ; a ratio higher than 1 indicates a greater odds of response with verteporfin.

f For visual acuity, &lt;65 vs ≥ 65 letters ; For age &lt;75 vs ≥ 75 years.

g For treatment by visual acuity interaction, patients with worse visual acuity (&lt; 65 letters) generally had a better treatment effect than patients with better visual acuity  ( ≥ 65 letters).

At Month 12 , the ITT analysis shows 49.3% of verteporfin eyes had a loss of less than 15 letters to treatment versus 45.6% of placebo eyes. The difference in favour of verteporfin was not statistically significant  (3.7%;  (p  =  0.517).  The  results  of  the  evaluable  patients  also  show  a  non  significant difference p=0.948).

The analysis using the logistic regression as well as the analysis performed in the evaluable-patients data set (p=0.948) yields to similar results.

At Month 24 , the difference in responder rate increases to 12.9% and becomes statistically significant (p=0.023). A secondary confirmatory analysis performed without LOCF shows a difference between groups no longer statistically significant (11.2%; p=0.065).

Analysis  using  the  logistic  regression  shows  that  the  overall  treatment  effect  was  confounded  by  a significant interaction between treatment and Visual acuity stratum. This interaction indicates that the treatment  effect  is  inconsistent  across  the  two  VA  strata:  patients  with  worse  visual  acuity  (&lt;  65 letters) generally had a better treatment effect than patients with better visual acuity  ( ≥ 65 letters) (p=0.020).

Results from the evaluable data show a difference of 9.8% in favour of verteporfin but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.146).

The differences in the subgroup of patients with occult CNV and no classical lesions (n=258, 76% of the population), as well as the level of significance, are similar to those observed in the overall study population (4.2%; p=0.515 and 13.7%; p=0.032 at Months 12 and 24 respectively). In the subgroup of patients with occult CNV, the results of the analysis performed without LOCF showed at 24 months a non significant difference (13.9%, p=0.41).

The subgroup of patients with classic-containing CNV was small and no statistical difference between groups was observed.

Analysis using the logistic regression showed at month 12, a significant interaction between treatment and baseline visual score (p=0.041) and at month 24, a significant interaction between treatment and baseline visual score (p=0.003) and baseline lesion size (p=0.024).

a Chi square test, log rank test, ANCOVA, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, Wicoxon rank sum test

b Moderate VA decrease: 15 or more letters lost from baseline

c Severe VA decrease: 30 or more letters lost from baseline

At Month 12, the  negative  results  are  confirmed  for  decrease  from  baseline  of  less  than  6  lines  of visual acuity (i.e. 30 letters) and severe decrease in visual acuity to less than 34 letters, which is an important criterion as it corresponds to the threshold of severe visual handicap. For mean visual acuity decrease  a  difference  between  groups  of  only  3.9  letters  is  observed.  The  results  of  analysis  of variance show a significant difference in adjusted mean change of 4.6 letters (i.e 1 line) in favour of verteporfin (p=0.027); however, this result is not clinically relevant (i.e. =1 line).

Results on classic or occult CNV progression, contrast sensitivity and and lesion size are statistically in favour of verteporfin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At Month 24, all secondary efficacy variables except progression of occult CNV showed a statistical difference.  These  differences  increased  from  Month 12  to  Month 24.  The  difference  in  mean  visual acuity decrease reaches 6 letters.

Fewer  verteporfin-treated  occult  patients  developed  progression  of  classic  CNV  compared  with placebo-treated  patients  (23.1%  vs.  33.3%  and  42.1%  at  Months  12  and  24,  respectively)  over  the course of the study.

## Results  Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints  for  subpopulation  with  no  classical  lesions  or  with  classiccontaining lesions

For  patients  who  had  occult  only  CNV,  most  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  favourable  to verteporfin  at  Month  12.  At  Month  24,  results  for  all  secondary  visual  acuity  and  angiographic variables  become  statistically  significantly  different  from  placebo  except  for  progression  of  occult CNV.

Visual  acuity  scores  show  a  mean  decrease  between  groups  in  favour  of  verteporfin  of  5.2  letters (p=0.024) at Month 12 and of 6.5 letters at Month 24 (p=-.002).

At Months 12 and 24, respectively only 29.5% and 27.1% of verteporfin-treated patients compared with 42.4% and 48.9% of placebo-treated patients developed a classic CNV component in the Lesion.

## Exploratory subgroup analysis for patients with occult but no classic CNV lesions with either baseline lesion size 4 MPS DA* or poorer baseline visual acuity &lt;65 letters

## (* 4 MPS DA : Macular Photocoagulation Study Disc Area)

Univariate subgroup analyses and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the primary efficacy variable. These analyses were conducted in the overall patient population but also in the occult with no classic CNV patient population.

For  patient  population  who  had  occult  with  no  classic  lesions  at  baseline,  these  analyses  revealed statistically significant interactions between the treatment effect and:

- a) baseline lesion size,
- b) baseline visual acuity scores.

They also indicated that:

- a) smaller  lesions  at  baseline  (4  MPS  DA)  had  significantly  better  treatment  benefit  than  larger lesions ( ≥ 4 MPS DA);
- b) patients  with  poorer  visual  acuity  at  baseline  (&lt;65  letters)  had  significantly  better  treatment benefit than patients with better visual acuity score ( ≥ 65 letters).

Thus, unplanned exploratory analyses based on baseline lesion size and visual acuity were repeated by the MAH for primary and secondary variables on a subgroup of patients 'with occult but no classic CNV lesions with either baseline lesion size 4 MPS DA or poorer baseline visual acuity &lt;65 letters.' This subgroup contains 187 patients, 123 in the verteporfin group and 64 in the placebo group  ( i.e. 55% of the total population).

## Primary efficacy variable results:

At  month  12,  the  difference  between  verteporfin  and  placebo  is  not  statistically  significant  for  ITT analysis  (14.6%,  p=0.058).  At  month  24,  that  difference  becomes  statistically  significant  (26.2%  in favour of verteporfin; p&lt;0.001).

## Secondary efficacy variables results:

Overall,  the  differences  between  treatments  were  in  favour  of  verteporfin.  Generally,  a  statistically significant effect is reached either at month 12 or at month 24.

This is particularly true for visual acuity scores, which show in addition a clinically relevant benefit at month 24 (10.8 letters; p&lt;0.001) but a lower effect at month 12 (7.7 letters; p=0.003). These findings are confirmed for decrease from baseline of less than 6 lines of visual acuity (i.e. 30 letters) and severe decrease in visual acuity to less than 34 letters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Angiographic criteria follow the same trend. At 2-year, angiographic results in this subgroup suggest that  verteporfin  treatment  could  reduce  the  development  and  the  progression  of  classic  CNV.  This finding is of great clinical interest as the development of classic CNV is a sign of a severe progression of the disease.

The CPMP questioned the negative results for the primary endpoint in the Request for Supplementary Information and the lack of robustness in the 24 month results in the global population and in several subgroups of patients. The MAH responded that the 12-month time point was selected in the analysis plan of Study BPD OCR 002 to allow for the earliest possible submission if a benefit was shown. In Study BPD OCR 003, the 12-month time point was also selected as the primary analysis time point for consistency  with  Study  BPD OCR 002.  When  the  protocol  for  Study  BPD OCR 003  was  designed, limited information was available on occult choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) progression and there was no evidence to contradict the choice of the 12-month time point (based on the classic-containing CNV studied in Study BPD OCR 002).

The MAH further argued that the robustness of the results of Study BPD OCR 003 is confirmed by the logistic regression analysis (odds ratio = 3.35, p = 0.002) and the fact that the results were consistent over  time  in  the  second  year.  The  difference  in  the  responder  rate  was  in  favour  of  verteporfin  at Months 18,  21,  and  24  with  a  95%  confidence  interval  not  containing  0  at  each  of  the  last  3  time points. In the AMD study population of Study BPD OCR 003, results of the 15-letter responder rate at 24 months are very similar in terms of treatment benefit with verteporfin in both analyses with LOCF (12.9%,  p = 0.023),  without  LOCF  (11.2%,  p = 0.065)  and  also,  for  evaluable  patients  (9.8%, p = 0.146)  without  LOCF.  The  changes  in  p-value  were  due  to  the  smaller  sample  size  of  the considered populations and not to an unbalanced effect between treatment groups of carrying forward the  last  observation  or  excluding  protocol  deviators.  In  this  context,  the  differences  between  the different analyses are too small to conclude that they invalidate the observed treatment effect.

Moreover, the logistic regression analysis of the primary efficacy variable (15-letter responder rate) in evaluable  patients  confirmed  the  treatment  effect  observed  in  the  ITT  population  (odds  ratio  in evaluable  patients  =  3.17  in  favor  of  verteporfin,  p = 0.010).  Also,  the  analysis  of  the  30-letter responder  rate  with  and  without  LOCF  (p = 0.001  and  0.005,  respectively)  and  for  the  evaluable patients (p = 0.014) was statistically significant at 24 months. These results support the robustness of a treatment effect on vision outcomes at Month 24.

Following the oral explanation the majority of the CPMP found that it is acceptable to interpret the reported  difference  in  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  between  verteporfin  treatment  and  placebo treatment of 3.7 % (p=0.517) at 12 months, with a responder rate of 49.3 % and 45.6 % in the two groups, respectively, in connection with the corresponding 24 months results of a difference of 12.9 % (p=0.023),  with  46.2  %  versus  33.3  %  responders  in  the  two  groups,  respectively.  The  observed benefit occurs later than anticipated, but this may reflect the slow progression of the decrease in vision in this population.

As for the secondary efficacy parameters: The proportion of patients who lost fewer than 30 letters in VA, the mean VA change from baseline, the proportion of patients whose VA decreased to fewer than 34 letters, mean contrast sensitivity changes, progression of classic and occult CNV, all results were statistically different from those observed with sham treatment in favour of verteporfin at 24 months, except  for  progression  of  occult  CNV.  For  contrast  sensitivity  and  progression  of  classic  CNV statistically significant differences were obtained also at 12 months.

In  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  the  CPMP  also  asked  the  MAH  to  comment  on  the clinical relevance of the positive results observed on the total and occult populations at 24 months. The MAH responded that the clinical relevance of the results at 24 months is dependent on the clinical importance  of  vision  and  other  outcomes  that  were  prospectively  planned  efficacy  variables.  The MAH focused on five efficacy variables (15-letter responder rate, 30-letter responder rate, percentage of patients with &lt; 34 letters, The development of classic CNV and mean visual acuity) as clinically important  and  in  terms  of  all  of  them  evidence  of  benefit  was  suggested  at  Month  12  and  was conclusive at Month 24 time points with the exception of the 15- and 30-letter responder rates where the evidence of benefit was only confirmed at the 24 month time point.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the oral explanation the MAH presented calculations of the number patient to be treated to have a 3-line  responder  (7.8  patients),  a  6-line  responder  or  to  avoid  legal  blindness  VA&lt;20/200  (5.7 patients).  The  MAH  also  argued  by  comparing  the  percentage  of  3-line  and  6-line  responders,  the percentage of patients with VA&lt;20/200 and the mean VA decrease that the disease progression was delayed by a year or more.

The majority of the CPMP concluded that although the total numerical benefits obtained may seem moderate the results should be considered in the perspective of the poor prognosis for the population, acknowledging that even a modest amelioration in the visual capacity may be of significance to these patients.  Also  in  the  application  of  low  visus  aids/optics  even  a  slightly  better  visual  capacity  is  of significance in the daily life of the patient. Apart from the VA results and the proportion of patients with  a  visual  acuity  below  34  letters,  the  parameter  contrast  sensitivity  is  of  major  importance, indicating a better paracentral visus, which is helpful for the patient. The majority of the CPMP felt that  there  is  a  need  for  an  additional  study  in  this  indication  and  the  MAH  agreed  to  perform  and report the requested additional study as a Follow-Up Measure.

After 24 months of follow-up, the percentage of patients who reported at least one adverse event (AE) considered  as  related  by  the  investigator  was  higher  in  VTP  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group (43 % vs 18 %).

The  incidence  of  visual  disturbances  (vision  decreased,  vision  abnormal,  visual  field  defect)  in  the BPD OCR 003 was higher than in the controlled BPD OCR 002 A and B studies.

Visual disturbances in the study eye occurred with a higher incidence in the treated group than in the placebo group (42 % vs 23 % for all AE / 30 % vs 8 % for related AE). Blepharitis is the other AE, which occurred with a difference in incidence between VTP and placebo ≥ 5 % (6 % vs 1 %).

Most of visual disturbances related to VTP :

- -were considered as mild or moderate (74 patients of 94) ;
- -occurred in the first 2 courses of treatment and within the first week after the treatment (about 65 % of visual disturbances were reported from 3 to 7 days after each treatment) ;
- -seemed to resolve within a few days to a few weeks. However, about 50 % of the visual field defects were ongoing at the end of the 24 months follow-up;

In  contrast,  the  majority  of  visual  disturbances  in  the  placebo  group  started  a  long  time  after  any treatment and most did not resolve.

Among the 20 serious cases of visual disturbances, 11 (no placebo patient) were cases of severe vision decrease (a severe decrease in vision was defined as a decrease in visual acuity of at least 20 letters relative to pre-treatment and confirmed clinically within 7 days of treatment), i.e. 4.9 % of patients in this study:

- -most of cases occurred after the first course of treatment (9 of 11 patients), and mostly within the first 2 days (7 of 9 patients). It is to be noted that one case occurred during the second year of treatment (course 7);
- -for  most of patients, vision decrease was still severe 3 months after the initial event and was comprised between -18 letters  to -70 letters  (average = - 28 letters). Independently, only one patient had gained 3 letters at the 3 month follow-up visit.
- -the  mechanism  evoked  by  the  MAH  may  be  an  increase  in  sub/intraretinal  hemorrhage  or neurosensory detachment.

Other serious ocular AE reported were mostly vitreous or subretinal hemorrhages (6 cases).

The incidence of visual disturbance events seems to be higher in patients with baseline VA ≥ 65 VA score  than  in  patients  with  VA  score  &lt; 65  letters  except  for  vision  abnormal  in  placebo-treated patients. However, it is to be noted that the difference is not statistically significant (p=0,09 ; Fisher test).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The adverse event, visual disturbance, is defined as the combination of three individual events: Vision abnormal, vision decreased and visual field defect. The incidence of this adverse event is higher in the present study (BPD OCR 003 AMD), namely between 10.7 % and 18.7 %, as opposed to 4.2 to 8.5 % in  the  classic-containing  study  (BPD  OCR  002).  The  argumentation from the  MAH that the higher incidence can  be  subscribed  to  the  better  baseline  visual  acuity  and  therefore  with  correspondingly more to loose in VA was accepted by the CPMP.

A partial  or  complete  recovery  vision  baseline  values  has  been  observed  for  most  of  patients  with severe vision decrease. No  risk  factor  (treatment  anomalies,  predisposing  medical  history  or concomitant  medication)  for  developing  severe  vision  decrease  can  be  evidenced.  The  risk  of experiencing severe decrease of vision is described in section 4.4 and section 4.8 of the SPC and the MAH agreed to add the percentage of patients with severe vision decrease to the SPC as requested by the CPMP.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No specific clinical data in patients with impaired renal function were provided in the file but these patients were not excluded from the studies. In any case, no effect of renal dysfunction is expected in view of the pharmacokinetic data.

The effect of hepatic dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of verteporfin was investigated in subjects with  mild  hepatic  dysfunction  and  compared  with  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  showing  a significant increase in half-lives of verteporfin in subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction (4.9 vs 5.9 h and 4.7 vs 6.5 h respectively).

The  SPC  clearly  reflects  that  there  are  no  data  related  to  renal  impairment  and  mentions  a contraindication in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Studies  were  carried  out  with  a  large  proportion  of  elderly  patients  (mean  age  approximately 75 years), which is the target population for AMD. No studies have been performed in children, since the specific form of macular degeneration cited in the indications is age-related.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The clinical development programme has involved a total of 878 subjects:

| Study BPD OCR 001   |   142 |
|---------------------|-------|
| Study BPD OCR 002 A |   311 |
| Study BPD OCR 002 B |   298 |
| Study BPD OCR 003   |   459 |
| Study BPD OCR 004   |    26 |
| Study BPD 004       |    17 |
| Study BPD 002       |    21 |
| Study BPD PSI 001   |     6 |
| Study BPD 001       |    35 |
| Study BPD PK 001 A  |    24 |
| Study BPD PK 002 B  |    24 |

The safety data were collected from two sources:

1. Ocular studies, 751 elderly patients participated in ocular studies, the posologies used were the following:
2. -BPD OCR 001, dose escalation study: light and drug doses were variable, 6 to 12 mg/m 2 for Verteporfin dose and 12.5-150 J/cm 2 for light dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -BPD OCR 002 A and B, two identical placebo controlled studies: as defined in dose escalation study  and  as  reflected  in  the  SPC,  light  and  drug  doses  were  6  mg/m 2 for  verteporfin  and 50  J/cm2  for  light  dose.  These  studies  were  planned  for  two  years.  A  global  analysis  of  all patients  up  to  at  least  12  months  was  provided  in  the  original  Integrated  Safety  Summary.  A Safety Update was provided later for all patients up to at least 18 months.

In the two main ocular studies A &amp; B, a total of 2164 verteporfin treatment courses were administered to 402 patients, giving an average number of 5.4 verteporfin courses per patient. (These figures are derived from an 18-month Safety Update report, and include data at the 21-month point for a limited number of patients).

## 2. Extra ocular studies

The  exposure  to  verteporfin  was  higher  (6-20  mg/m 2 +  light  40.5-150  J/cm 2 )  and  the  mean  age  of patient population was lower (58 years) than in ocular studies. Thus, these trials are of interest to study systemic adverse events:

BPD 004: comparative study between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with mild hepatic impairment.

BPD 002 and BPD PSI 001: in psoriasis.

BPD 001: in cutaneous malignancies.

The  target  population  is  elderly  patients  (mean  age:  74.2  years  for  verteporfin  and  76  years  for placebo).  The  medical  history  of  these  elderly  patients  explain  the  observed  frequent  use  of concomitant medications, and this in turn may explain some of the adverse events (AEs) encountered during the studies. From the safety point of view, no drug-interactions were detected from the clinical studies.

In the Verteporfin group (544), 396 patients reported at least one adverse event and, in the placebo group (207), 178 patients reported at least one adverse event (72,8 % versus 86 %).

Two body systems (ocular system and blood and lymphatic system) show clearly more frequent AEs in the Verteporfin group than in placebo treated patients.

## -Ocular system AEs :

| ALL                 | VERTEPORFIN N=544   | PLACEBO N=207   |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Vision abnormal     | 9.6%                | 9.2%            |
| Vision decreased    | 6.1%                | 4.3%            |
| Visual field defect | 3.7%                | 2.4%            |

## -Back pain:

Back pain was reported by 21 patients (3.9 %) in the Verteporfin group (11 cases (2 %) including low back pain. In the placebo group, back pain was reported in 6 patients (2.9 %). In one case, low back pain was responsible of the discontinuation of the treatment.

- -Local reaction:

Injection site adverse events in studies BPD OCR 002 A&amp;B:

6  adverse  events  were reported  more  frequently  in  the  verteporfin  treated group  versus  the  placebo group.

- -Blood and Lymphatic System:

Verteporfin was involved in 36 cases (6.6 %) and placebo in nine (4.3%). 16 anaemias were reported: 2.9 % versus 1.9 % for the placebo group. The erythrocyte count was altered: 6 patients at 6 months and 5 at 12 months. At the same date: 2 patients of the placebo group had a change in the erythrocyte count.

Deaths in the two controlled studies 002A &amp; 002B:

12 deaths were reported in controlled studies: 8 in the Verteporfin group (2 %), and 4 in the placebo group (2 %) in studies BPDOCR 002 A and B. The causes were:

Cardiopulmonary disease: 8

Malignancies: 3

Pancreas: 1.

10 deaths were considered as not related to treatment and only 2 were considered as unlikely related to treatment: a necrotizing pancreatitis in the verteporfin group and arrhythmia in the placebo group.

In such an elderly population, some reports of death are not unexpected.

## Serious Adverse Events

Serious adverse events were reported in the two controlled studies (BPD OCR 002 A and B):

- -66 in the Verteporfin group (16 %),
- -36 in the placebo group (17 %).

These concerned mainly cardiopulmonary events and malignancies.

In the verteporfin group, 60 were quoted as unlikely or not related to treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6  patients  of  the  Verteporfin  group  exhibited  adverse  events,  which  were  quoted  as  'possibly'  or 'probably' or 'definitely' related to the treatment:

- -3 ocular reactions:

large subretinal pigmented epithelium haematoma visual acuity decrease, decrease in reading and distant vision.

The symptoms started from a few hours to two days after treatment and these cases were quoted possibly for the first and probably related for the two others.

- -2 local reactions:

2 paravenous infusions with, in one case, photosensitivity following exposition to sunlight. The site of these adverse events make these reactions « definitely related ».

- -1 anaemia:

The patient was hospitalised but had previous iron deficiency anaemia.

## Patients withdrawn from treatment due to adverse events

12  patients  discontinued  treatment  because  of  adverse  events  in  studies  BPD  OCR  002  A  and  B, 11 from Verteporfin group (2.7 %), and 1 from the placebo group (0.5 %).

3 vitreous haemorhage, 1 retinal detachment, 1 suprachoroidal haemorrhage and 1 extensive subretinal haemorrhage were encountered in 3 patients, one of them being a placebo treated patient.

These events were considered as « possibly » related to treatment, but 2 vitreous haemorrhages were considered as unlikely related to treatment.

## Site injection

1 pain at injection site 'definitely' related to treatment.

## Others

3 allergic reactions: one with shortness of breath and increase of blood pressure, and an other with a skin rash attributed to fluorescein, were considered as possibly related. Another case was an allergic reaction to mydriatics and was considered as not related to treatment.

## Laboratory findings

Slighly higher incidences were reported for change in serum creatinine in the verteporfin group : in the studies BPDOCR 002 A and B, 5 patients exhibited an increase in serum creatinine at month 6 and 10 patients at month 12.

Hypercholesterolemia:  22  patients  group  (5,4  %)  were  reported  with  hypercholesteremia  in  the Verteporfin and 14 in the placebo group (6,7 %).

## Safety Update (18 months)

The Safety Update (representing an additional 6 months of data in the ongoing trials) confirms the ocular  adverse  event  and  systemic  safety  profile  for  verteporfin  as  originally  presented  in  the Integrated Safety Summary, ISS:

The overall incidence of ocular adverse events was slightly higher in the Safety Update (43% and 37% for verteporfin and placebo, respectively) than in the ISS (37% and 31% for verteporfin and placebo, respectively) and this difference was mainly due to a slightly higher incidence of visual disturbance events (21% and 16% in the verteporfin group and the placebo group, respectively).

Subretinal  haemorrhage  incidence  in  verteporfin  group  was  slightly  higher  for  verteporfin  in  the Safety  Update  (2.2%)  than  in  the  ISS  (1.5%)  while  the  incidence  in  the  placebo  remains  the  same (1.0%).

Both sets  of  data  are  consistent  in  showing  that  a  higher  percentage  of  verteporfin-treated  patients than placebo-treated patients had study eye adverse events.

The occurrences of injection site pain have decreased with more experience in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only  one  additional  patient  experienced  photosensitivity  reaction  and  one  another  experienced infusion-related back pain, these two reactions occurred on the day of treatment and resolved quickly (within one day).

In the supportive ongoing masked Study OCR 003, most patients had completed their 6-month followup. The data show similar results for AMD population than in studies OCR 002 A and B except for the incidence of visual disturbance and severe vision decrease that appeared at higher incidence. This was already pointed out in ISS. No further severe vision decrease was reported in the Safety Update.

Non ocular studies: additional serious adverse events and deaths were not related to the treatment.

The likelihood of a continuously acceptable safety profile is acknowledged. There is little reason to be concerned  about  ocular  safety,  however,  because  of  the  poor  prognosis  for  subfoveal  classical neovascularisation.

Apart from the specific AE profile, a general safety issue common to both the ISS and the Update is that  some degree of light sensitivity may be expected considering the mechanism of action of PDT itself.  Therefore  a  recommendation  has  been  added  to  the  SPC  to  the  effect  that  the  patient  should avoid strong light for 48h after the therapy.

## Safety Update following the Type II Variation (II/01), authorised 2001

## i.e. includes the 1-year results from Study BPD OCR 003 in PM patients and Study BPD OCR 004 in OHS patients :

In  addition  to  the  safety  data  from  studies  BPD  OCR  002A  &amp; 002B in an  AMD population whose mean age was 75 years and in whom the medical history explained the frequent use of concomitant medications, the more recent ocular studies BPD OCR 003 PM and BPD OCR 004 give information related to a younger patient population of around 50 years of age with Pathologic Myopia or Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome (this last indication was not authorised).

The comparison of the analysis of the safety data by body systems for the OCR 002 A&amp;B-studies at two years and the OCR 003-study at one year with that of the additional studies confirms that a higher incidence  of  adverse  events  could  be  related  to  Visudyne  than  to  placebo  for  some  of  the  body systems,  but  do  not  indicate  additional  verteporfin  toxicity  on  a  specific  organ  system,  or  any difference with the verteporfin safety profile of the AMD population as previously analysed.

However, arising from BPD OCR 003, at the cut-off date of June 15, 2000, two serious adverse events in 2 verteporfin PM patients led to study discontinuation:

- colon cancer with liver metastasis diagnosed two months after the last treatment, in a 60-yearold Asian woman who received two courses of VTP treatment (patient V13P51),
- allergic  reaction  with  dyspnoea  during  the  verteporfin  infusion  in  a  41-year-old  caucasian woman

The allergic reaction was considered related to Visudyne (the colon cancer was not).

No death was reported in either Study BPD OCR 003 PM or Study BPD OCR 004.

This suggests that case reports of suspected allergic reactions occurring in Visudyne-treated patients should be closely documented, especially as this is supported by the results of pre-clinical studies (In sedated  or  anaesthetised  pigs,  a  Visudyne  dose  significantly  higher  than  the  recommended  dose  in patients given as a bolus injection caused severe haemodynamic effects including death, probably as a result of complement activation). The SPC section 4.4 highlights this allergic risk.

## Safety in special populations

All data relate to adult patients. No studies have been performed in children since the specific form of macular degeneration cited in the indication is age-related.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety Update following the first and second PSUR

In the assessment report for the first PSUR, the MAH was asked to provide a cumulative safety review on cardiovascular events.

The data provided from the placebo-controlled studies including 627 AMD patients showed that the incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events is similar in VTP and placebo groups. However, data from post-marketing surveillance showed that clinical symptoms indicative of vasospastic angina could  occur  in  patients,  with  or  with  no  cardiovascular  medical  history  (occurrence  during  VTP infusion,  outcome  rapidly  favourable  after  trinitrine  treatment,  normal  cardiac  evaluation).  The physiopathologic mechanism is still unknown.

The occurrence of chest pain was already mentioned in section 4.8. of the SPC, however, the CPMP requested that the term \"chest pain\" was added to section 4.4. of the SmPC, which was introduced through a Type II variation.

Three cases of vaso-vagal attacks, which occurred during the verteporfin infusion were notified during the  period  covered  by  the  second  PSUR:  one  serious  case  of  asystolic  cardiac  arrest,  syncope,  and vasovagal reaction, one serious case of collapse associated with back pain and one non serious vasovagal episode. Moreover, follow-up information received for a case described in the first PSUR led to reclassification of a case of cardiac event as serious vaso-vagal reaction associated with syncope, and grand mal seizure, 2 minutes into the verteporfin infusion, in a patient considered as \"extremely tense before the procedure\".

Two serious cases of hypersensitivity were reported during the period covered by the second PSUR : In both cases, the outcome was favourable on stopping verteporfin infusion and single treatment with a  histamin-1  receptor  blocking  drug.  Additionally,  four  non-serious  cases  of  allergic  reaction  were reported.

The occurrence of serious hypersensitivity reactions and vaso-vagal reactions during the infusion of verteporfin were added to the SPC (section 4.4 and 4.8) and to the Package Leaflet through a Type II variation.  |It  was  also  added  to  section  4.4.  of  the  SPC  that  patients  should  be  under  close  medical supervision during the Visudyne infusion.

## 5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

## Quality

The  applicant  has  developed  a  product  of  satisfactory  quality  in  relation  to  the  clinical  use,  i.e.  a stable, sterile powder suitable for solution for injection. The manufacturing process has been validated and provides a satisfactory assurance that the product will be sterile when opened for the first time. Methods used for batch control and stability studies have been validated and should ensure a product of reproducible quality.

## Pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The toxicological file is acceptable for the present indication i.e. one single i.v. injection which may be repeated at three month intervals. A satisfactory set of experiments was performed to demonstrate the  safety  of  verteporfin  after  light  irradiation,  especially  on  skin  and  eye,  which  can  be  directly exposed.  All  the  excipients  were  presented  as  safe  for  use  in  the  formulated  product  and  the explanation given for the haematopoietic effects observed with high and repeated doses in the animal studies is that high concentrations of lipids lead to increased extramedullary haematopoiesis, due to lysis of erythrocytes caused by membrane fluidity changes.

No preclinical studies where verteporfin was repeatedly administrated indicated that the compound is immunogenic. In genotoxicity studies the test cell systems were exposed to verteporfin at appropriate concentrations, and therefore the observed results are valid.

It was clearly demonstrated that the degree of damage caused by verteporfin as well as its specificity for the targeted tissues is dependent on drug dose, i.e. blood level, light dose, and timing of activation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical efficacy

Full  ADME  studies  were  not  performed,  however,  trials  were  properly  designed,  realised  and analysed.  The CPMP considered that the kinetic  data provided  were not sufficient to define a light protection period for the patient after PDT with verteporfin; this was defined on the basis of the safety data generated in the controlled clinical trials.

As sample sizes in the dose evaluation study were small, further optimisation of the treatment regimen may be possible. The observed results in both controlled trials were consistent for both primary and secondary  efficacy  parameters.  Overall,  compared  to  placebo  group,  the  loss  in  visual  acuity  was lower in patients receiving Visudyne.  Moderate  and  severe  decreases  in visual acuity  were significantly reduced by the treatment.

The combined one-year main efficacy results have shown acceptable efficacy (+14.8% of responders in verteporfin  group  as  compared  to  placebo)  in  slowing  down  the  vision  loss  in  the  two placebo-controlled trials (BPD OCR 002 A and 002 B) in which a total of 609 patients were enrolled.

Concerning the subgroup of patients with predominantly classic CNV, the difference at one year was 27.5% favouring verteporfin (combined studies A &amp; B).

Considering  the  elderly  patient  population  and  the  long  duration  of  the  study,  the  majority  were actually followed up and had visual acuity assessments.

The  combined  two  years  main  efficacy  results  (studies  A  &amp;  B)  show  that  verteporfin  efficacy  is maintained in the entire population studied (+15.3% of responders in verteporfin group as compared to placebo) as well as in the prospectively determined subgroup 'predominantly classic CNV' (+28% of responders in verteporfin group as compared to placebo).

Concerning Pathologic Myopia, and considering :

- -the clinical importance of the benefit in relatively young patients,
- -the degree of the observed improvement of visual acuity which appears more pronounced than in AMD patients,
- -the two-year experience of verteporfin in AMD,

The CPMP considered that PDT of CNV related to pathological myopia could be recommended.

The majority of the CPMP  considered that the indication of occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation  due  to  age-related  macular  degeneration  was  acceptable.  Although  the  total numerical benefits obtained may seem moderate the results should be considered in the perspective of the poor prognosis for the population, acknowledging that even a modest amelioration in the visual capacity may be of significance to these patients. Also in the application of low visus aids/optics even a slightly better visual capacity is of significance in the daily life of the patient.

Retreatment is allowed every 3 months if necessary, and up to four times a year.

## Clinical safety

There is no major safety concern arising from the analysis of the safety data, which rests on the main ocular efficacy studies plus additional supportive dermatological studies.

The safety analysis as expected indicates that adverse events were observed at the injection site and in the eye, which are target organs due to the route of administration and modality of PDT for AMD &amp; PM. However, there also appears to be a high rate of back pains observed during the studies, and this is  also  reflected  in  the  SPC.  Arising  from  a  Type  II  Variation  (II/01)  to  extend  the  indication,  and preclinical  studes,  the  case  reports  of  Visudyne  patients  with  allergic  reactions  should  be  closely documented. This is related to the case observed in a PM patient and to pre-clinical data related to the activation of Complement in anaesthetised pigs although no clinically relevant complement activation was reported in clinical trials. The SPC section 4.4 highlights the allergic risk.

The incidence of visual disturbances (vision decreased, vision abnormal, visual field defect) is higher in the study BPD OCR 003 AMD, namely between 10.7 % and 18.7 %, as opposed to 4.2 to 8.5 % in the  classic-containing  study  (BPD  OCR 002). Visual disturbances in the  study eye occurred with a higher incidence in the treated group than in the placebo group (42 % vs 23 % for all AE / 30 % vs 8 % for related AE).

A partial  or  complete  recovery  vision  baseline  values  has  been  observed  for  most  of  patients  with severe vision decrease. No  risk  factor  (treatment  anomalies,  predisposing  medical  history  or concomitant medication) could be determined. The risk of experiencing severe decrease of vision is described in section 4.4 and section 4.8 of the SPC as well as the percentage of patients with severe vision decrease.

One of the general safety concerns of PDT therapy is the duration of the period for light protection to be recommended. In this case, the CPMP considered that the period for light protection should be 48 hours, which is that studied in controlled ocular clinical trials for AMD.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Considering that there appears to be no major safety concern arising from the use of Visudyne, and the efficacy data are satisfactory in the indication as defined in Section 4.1 of the SPC, the benefit/risk analysis for this product is positive.

It is clear from the 2-year efficacy results in CNV related to AMD that the treatment slows down the loss  of  visual  acuity  rather  than  improves  vision.  The  treatment  has  been  shown  effective  in  CNV closure.  However,  most  of  the  patients  (80%)  required  repeated  treatments  at  least  3  times  a  year because of early recurrences. The efficacy of PDT with verteporfin has been demonstrated from the two-year results of both clinical trials in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration in patients with predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation.

Concerning the  1-year  efficacy  results  in  CNV  related  to  PM,  the  CPMP  expected  that  the  benefit could  be  maintained  similarly  to  the  experience  of  PDT  in  AMD.  As  there  are  no  alternative treatments in patients with subfoveal CNV in myopic eyes, the CPMP therefore considered that the two-year  results  could  be  provided  as  a  post-authorisation  measure.  .  The  two-year  results  were submitted in April and July 2001. The results no longer reached statistical significance and suggested that  the  clinical  benefit  may  decrease  over  time.  However,  the  CPMP  concluded  that  the  results showed  more  variability  than  a  clear  temporal  trend  and  were  numerically  still  in  favour  of verteporfin.

The majority of the CPMP  considered that the indication of occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation  due  to  age-related  macular  degeneration  was  acceptable.  Although  the  total numerical benefits obtained may seem moderate the results should be considered in the perspective of the poor prognosis for the population, acknowledging that even a modest amelioration in the visual capacity may be of significance to these patients. Also in the application of low visus aids/optics even a slightly better visual capacity is of significance in the daily life of the patient.

Thus,  in  total,  the  indication  in  the  SPC  reflects  the  patient  population  in  which  efficacy  has  been demonstrated.

Concerning  safety,  an  18  months  analysis  was  available  at  the  time  of  the  original  opinion,  later supplemented by the full 24-months analysis as for efficacy.

Therefore, based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered that the benefit /risk profile of Visudyne was favourable in the following indication:

for the treatment of patients with age-related macular degeneration with

- Predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation
- Occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation with evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression

or patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia.
