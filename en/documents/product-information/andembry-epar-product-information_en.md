## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

ANDEMBRY is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

This medicinal product should be initiated under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the management of patients with HAE.

Posology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The recommended dose of ANDEMBRY, in adults and children 12 years of age and above, is an initial loading dose of 400 mg administered subcutaneously as two 200 mg injections on the first day of treatment, followed by a monthly dose of 200 mg.

Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients with normal C1-INH HAE (nC1INH) who have shown insufficient reduction in attacks after 3 months of treatment (see section 4.4 and 5.1).

ANDEMBRY is not intended for the treatment of acute HAE attacks (see section 4.4).

## Missed doses

If a dose of ANDEMBRY is missed, the patient should be instructed to administer the dose as soon as possible.

## Special populations

Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for patients above 65 years of age (see section 5.2).

## Renal and hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of garadacimab in children less than 12 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

ANDEMBRY is intended for subcutaneous  use only.

Each ANDEMBRY unit (pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen) is intended for single use only (see section 6.6).

The injection should be restricted to the following injection sites: the abdomen, the thighs and the upper outer arms (see section 5.2). Rotation of the injection site is recommended.

ANDEMBRY may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on subcutaneous injection technique by a healthcare professional.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypersensitivity reactions have not been observed but may theoretically occur. In case of severe hypersensitivity reactions, administration of garadacimab should be discontinued, and appropriate treatment instituted.

## General

ANDEMBRY is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of breakthrough HAE attack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medicinal product.

There are limited data available on the use of garadacimab in HAE patients with nC1-INH  (see section 5.1).

Some subcategories of nC1-INH HAE may not respond to treatment with garadacimab due to alternative pathways that do not include FXII activation. It is recommended to perform genetic testing, if available, according to the current HAE guidelines and to discontinue the treatment if clinical response is not observed (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## Interference with coagulation test

ANDEMBRY can prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of garadacimab with the aPTT assay. The extent of aPTT prolongation could be variable depending on drug exposure as well as additional parameters, such as natural variation in FXII levels, and other coagulation factors. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic coagulation through the activation of FXII in the contact system, therefore inhibition of plasma FXIIa by ANDEMBRY can prolong aPTT in this assay.

## Excipients

This medicinal product contains 19.3 mg of proline in each pre-filled syringe/pen which is equivalent to 16.1 mg/mL. Proline may be harmful for patients with hyperprolinaemia, a rare genetic disorder in which proline builds up in the body.

This medicinal product contains 0.24 mg of polysorbate 80 in each pre-filled syringe/pen which is equivalent to 0.2 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted in humans. Garadacimab has only been studied as a monotherapy and not in combination with other products indicated for long-term prophylaxis of HAE. The use of analgesic, antibacterial, antihistamine, anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic medications had no effect on the PK of garadacimab. For breakthrough HAE attacks, use of rescue medications such as plasma-derived and recombinant C1-INH or icatibant had no effect on the PK of garadacimab.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of garadacimab in pregnant women. Monoclonal antibodies such as garadacimab are transported across the placenta mainly during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy. A pre- and postnatal development study conducted in pregnant rabbits revealed no evidence of harm to the developing fetus. (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of garadacimab during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is unknown whether garadacimab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, and decrease to low concentrations soon afterwards. Consequently, transfer of IgG antibodies to the newborns through milk may happen during the first few days. In this short period, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Afterwards, garadacimab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.

## Fertility

Effect on fertility has not been evaluated in humans. Garadacimab had no effect on male or female fertility in rabbits (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

ANDEMBRY has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with ANDEMBRY were injection site reactions (ISR) including injection site erythema, injection site bruising,  injection site pruritus and injection site urticaria, headache and abdominal pain.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 1 summarises adverse reactions observed in the VANGUARD pivotal trial , which included 39 subjects with HAE who received at least 1 dose of ANDEMBRY.

The frequency of adverse reactions listed in Table 1 is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000), very rare (&lt;1/10 000).

Table 1: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) obtained from clinical studies with ANDEMBRY

| System organ class                                   | Adverse drug reaction     | Frequency   |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| General disorders and administration site conditions | Injection site reactions* | Common      |
| Nervous system disorders                             | Headache                  | Common      |
| Gastrointestinal disorders                           | Abdominal pain            | Common      |

*Injection site reactions include, erythema, bruising, pruritus, and injection site urticaria

## Paediatric population

The safety of ANDEMBRY was evaluated in a subgroup of 11 subjects aged 12 to &lt; 18 years old. No difference from the overall safety profile was seen between adults and children.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no available information to identify potential signs and symptoms of overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in hereditary angioedema, ATC code: B06AC07

## Mechanism of action

Garadacimab is a fully human IgG4/lambda recombinant monoclonal antibody which binds to the catalytic domain of activated Factor XII (FXIIa and βFXIIa) and inhibits its catalytic activity. The inhibition of FXIIa, the first factor activated in the contact system, prevents HAE attacks by blocking the activation of prekallikrein to kallikrein and the generation of bradykinin, which is associated with inflammation and swelling in HAE attacks.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Concentration-dependent inhibition of FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity was demonstrated after subcutaneous administration of ANDEMBRY once monthly in patients with HAE.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## VANGUARD pivotal study

The efficacy of ANDEMBRY for the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older with Type I or II HAE was studied in a phase 3, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study.

The study contained 64 patients aged 12 years and older including 58 adult and 6 pediatric patients who experienced at least 2 attacks during the up to 2-month run-in period. Patients were randomised into 2 parallel treatment arms in a 3:2 ratio (garadacimab 200 mg monthly after an initial 400 mg loading dose or volume-match placebo) for a 6-month treatment period. Patients were required to discontinue other prophylactic HAE treatment prior to entering the study. All patients were allowed to use on-demand medications for treatment of HAE attacks during the study.

Overall, 87.5% of patients had Type I HAE. A family history of HAE was reported for 89.1%, a history of laryngeal edema attacks for 59.4% of patients and 32.8% were on prior prophylactic HAE treatments. During the study runin period, attack rates of ≥ 3 attacks/month were observed in 59.4% of patients overall. Mean baseline number of attacks per month was 3.07 in the ANDEMBRY group compared to 2.52 in the placebo group.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the time-normalised number of HAE attacks from day 1 through the end of the 6-month treatment period. The key secondary endpoints were: the percent reduction in the mean time-normalised number of HAE attacks, the number of subjects who were attack free from day 1 through the end of the first 3-months the percent of subjects with good or excellent responses to the SGART from day 1 through the end of the 6-month treatment period.

* A hierarchical testing procedure controls for the overall alpha level of 5% (2-sided)

Additional non-hierarchically tested secondary endpoints from day 1 to 182 were the mean (median) time-normalised number of HAE attacks requiring on-demand treatment, 0.23 (0.0) in subjects treated with ANDEMBRY compared to 1.86 (1.35) in the placebo group, and the mean (median) time-normalised number of moderate to severe HAE attacks, 0.13 (0.0) in subjects treated with ANDEMBRY compared to 1.35 (0.83) in the placebo group.

The exploratory endpoint of Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) total and domain (functioning, fatigue/mood, fear/shame, and nutrition) scores, compared to the placebo at day 182 (Table 3) showed improvement in the ANDEMBRY treated patients. A reduction of six points in the AE-QoL has been defined as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Changes from baseline greater than the MCID were observed in 88% of patients treated with ANDEMBRY.

The efficacy profile in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older (n=6) was consistent with that of the overall population.

## VANGUARD Open Label Extension Study

Patients who completed VANGUARD (n=57) in addition to patients from a phase 2 study (n=35) rolled over into the VANGUARD open-label extension study which also enrolled 69 new patients. From the start of treatment through 16.7 months (median duration of exposure 9.49 months) 96/161 (59.6%) patients remained attack-free. The safety and efficacy profile in adolescent patients ages 12 years and older (n=10) was consistent with that of the overall population.

## Normal C1-INH HAE population

Normal C1-INH HAE includes patients with known or unknown mutations. The safety and efficacy of garadacimab was evaluated in 6 patients with known mutations: HAE-FXII (n=3) or HAE-PLG (plasminogen) (n=3) in the phase 2 study 2001.

Among the three genetically confirmed HAE-FXII patients enrolled, one withdrew during the second month of the treatment period due to lack of efficacy after showing a reduction in overall attack rate from 4.35 to 3.51 attacks per month and a reduction in severe attacks from 1.09 to 0.58 attacks per month. The remaining two patients completed the initial 12-week treatment period, with one demonstrating a reduction in attack rate from 3.24 to 0.36 attacks per month and the other becoming attack-free from an initial attack rate of 3.20 attacks per month. Both patients continued garadacimab for the duration of the second treatment period of 20 and 17 months, after which both patients rolled over into the phase 3 extension study and received garadacimab for an additional 18 months and remained attack free.

Additionally, the 3 patients with HAE-PLG completed the initial 12-week treatment period and did not continue into the treatment extension period. One patient reported a decrease in their monthly overall attack rate to 1.75 and a severe attack rate to 0.35 during the treatment period, compared to 3.20 and 1.60, respectively, during the run-in period. The remaining two patients reported an increase in their monthly attack rates to 6.8 and 3.17 during the treatment period compared to 2.28 and 1.45 during the run-in period respectively. None of the reported attacks was classified as severe attack.

Overall, the safety profile of garadacimab in patients with nC1-INH was similar to that observed in patients with HAE-C1-INH.

## Immunogenicity

Treatment with ANDEMBRY has been associated with development of low-titer treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in 2.9% (5/172) of treated subjects. Due to the low titer of ADA registered in these subjects, neutralizing antibodies could not be detected. However, although the clinical relevance of ADA could not be fully established, available data indicate that there was no apparent impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with ANDEMBRY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In the VANGUARD pivotal trial , patients treated with 200 mg garadacimab subcutaneous once monthly presented mean (SD) area under the curve over the dosing interval at steady-state (AUCtau,ss), maximum concentration at steady-state (Cmax,ss), and minimum concentration at steady-state (Cmin,ss) of 10300 (3380) mcg ∙h/mL, 21.2 (6.58) mcg/mL, and 9.30 (3.73) mcg/mL, respectively. Steady-state exposure of garadacimab was achieved after the initial subcutaneous administration of loading dose of 400 mg (2 doses of 200 mg).

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous administration, the time to maximum concentration is approximately 6 days. The site of subcutaneous injection (thigh, arm, or abdomen) did not affect the absorption of garadacimab. The absorption rate of garadacimab was 0.00824/h. The mean absolute bioavailability of garadacimab in HAE patients was 39.5% on the basis of the population pharmacokinetic analysis.

## Distribution

The mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution of garadacimab in patients with HAE was 7.42 litres (4.20). Garadacimab is a monoclonal antibody and is not expected to bind to plasma proteins.

## Biotransformation

Similar to other monoclonal antibodies, garadacimab is expected to be degraded by enzymatic proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids. Therefore, specific metabolism studies were not conducted with garadacimab.

## Elimination

Garadacimab had a mean (SD) apparent clearance of 0.0217 L/h (0.00793) and a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 19 days.

## Special populations

No dedicated studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of garadacimab in special patient populations including gender, age, pregnant women.

In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, after correcting for body weight (43.3 to 153 kg), no influence of gender, age (12 to 73 years), race, or ethnicity was apparent on clearance or volume of distribution of garadacimab.

Although body weight was identified as an important covariate describing the variability of clearance and volume of distribution, the difference was not clinically relevant and no dose adjustments are recommended.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

Dedicated studies on subjects with renal or hepatic impairment were not conducted.

As IgG monoclonal antibodies are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism, renal impairment or hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of garadacimab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of garadacimab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

I n a population pharmacokinetic analysis, renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate: ≥90 mL/min [normal, N=149], 60 to &lt;90 mL/min [mild, N=22], and 30 to &lt;60 mL/min [moderate, N=1]) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of garadacimab.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and repeated-dose toxicity.

## Reproductive toxicity

Male and female fertility were unaffected based upon no observed adverse findings on mating, fecundity, fertility indices, on maternal reproductive parameters, embryo survival or sperm assessment in sexually mature rabbits that received garadacimab intravenously once every three days resulting in approximately 83- and 103-fold the exposure (based on AUC) in females and males, respectively, at the recommended human dose of 200 mg subcutaneously once monthly.

In a pre- and post-natal development study, pregnant rabbits were administered garadacimab subcutaneously once every five days from implantation through weaning. There was no maternal and off-spring, through six months of age, garadacimab-related toxicity in rabbits receiving subcutaneous garadacimab resulting in approximately 53-fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the recommended human dose of 200 mg subcutaneously once monthly.

Garadacimab crossed the placenta in rabbits. With subcutaneous administration of garadacimab corresponding to approximately 53-fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the recommended human dose of 200 mg subcutaneously once monthly, at gestation day 29, fetal plasma concentrations were 40.8% of maternal concentrations.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

1. What ANDEMBRY is and what it is used for

3. How to use ANDEMBRY
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store ANDEMBRY

7. Instructions for use

## 1. What ANDEMBRY is and what it is used for

ANDEMBRY contains the active substance garadacimab.

ANDEMBRY is a medicine used in patients aged 12 years and older with hereditary angioedema (HAE) to prevent angioedema attacks.

HAE is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of rapid swelling, known as HAE attacks, in different parts of the body, including the

- hands and feet;
- face, eyelids, lips or tongue
- voice-box (larynx) and throat, which may make breathing difficult;
- genitals;
- stomach and gut

HAE attacks may be painful and disabling. Attacks that affect your throat or larynx may be dangerous or even life threatening.

HAE often runs in families, but some people may not have a family history. Three types of HAE are known, based on the type of genetic defect and its effect on a protein that circulates in your blood, named C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). A person can have low levels of C1-INH in the body (type I HAE), poorly functioning C1-INH (type II HAE), or HAE with normal functioning C1-INH (type III HAE). The last type is extremely rare. All three types produce the same clinical symptoms of localized swelling.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

C1-INH regulates a process in the body that controls the production of an inflammatory substance called bradykinin. Overproduction of bradykinin causes swelling and inflammation in people with HAE.

The active substance in ANDEMBRY, garadacimab, blocks the activation of a protein known as factor XIIa (FXIIa), which is involved in stimulating bradykinin production. By blocking FXIIa activity, garadacimab reduces the level of bradykinin, thereby preventing HAE attacks. Some subcategories of normal C1-INH HAE may not respond to treatment with garadacimab. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about your medicine.

## 2. What you need to know before you use ANDEMBRY

## Do not use ANDEMBRY

- -if you are allegic to garadacimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

- Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ANDEMBRY.
- If you have a severe allergic reaction to ANDEMBRY with symptoms such as hives, tight chest, difficulty breathing, wheezing, hypotension or anaphylaxis, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately .
- Treat a hereditary angioedema attack with your regular rescue medicine without taking additional doses of ANDEMBRY.

## Keeping a record

It is strongly recommended that every time you have a dose of ANDEMBRY, you write down the name and batch number of the medicine. This is so that you keep a record of the batches used.

## Laboratory tests

Tell your doctor if you are using ANDEMBRY before you have laboratory tests to measure how well your blood is clotting. This is because ANDEMBRY may interfere with some laboratory tests, leading to inaccurate results.

## Children and adolescents

ANDEMBRY is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age. This is because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and ANDEMBRY

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

ANDEMBRY is not known to affect other medicines or be affected by other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting ANDEMBRY. There is limited information on the safety of ANDEMBRY use during pregnancy and breast-feeding. As a precaution, it is preferable to avoid the use of ANDEMBRY during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Driving and using machines

This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## ANDEMBRY contains proline

This medicine contains 19.3 mg of proline in each pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 16.1 mg/mL. Proline may be harmful for patients with hyperprolinaemia, a rare genetic disorder in which proline builds up in the body. If you (or your child) have hyperprolinaemia, do not use this medicine unless your doctor has recommended it.

## ANDEMBRY contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 0.24 mg of polysorbate 80 in each pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 0.2 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How to use ANDEMBRY

ANDEMBRY is provided in single-use pre-filled syringes with a needle safety device. Your treatment will be started under the supervision of and managed by a healthcare provider.

Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure or have any further questions on the use of this medicine.

## How much ANDEMBRY to use

The recommended dose of ANDEMBRY is an initial loading dose of 400 mg given as two 200 mg injections on the first day of treatment followed by one 200 mg injection given once a month.

## How to inject ANDEMBRY

You can self-inject ANDEMBRY or a caregiver can inject it. In both cases, you or your caregiver must carefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, 'Instructions for Use'.

- ANDEMBRY is for injection under the skin ('subcutaneous injection') in the tummy (abdomen), thigh or upper arm.
- A doctor, pharmacists or nurse should show you how to inject ANDEMBRY properly before you use it for the first time. Do not self-inject or allow a caregiver to inject you until you have been trained to inject the medicine.
- Use each pre-filled syringe only once.
- If the pre-filled syringe with needle safety device does not perform as intended, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible.
- Rotation of the injection site is recommended.

## If you take more ANDEMBRY than you should

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you take too much ANDEMBRY.

## If you forget to use ANDEMBRY

If you miss a dose of ANDEMBRY, inject your dose as soon as possible. If you are not sure when to inject ANDEMBRY after a missed dose, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

- Do not try to speed up the warming process in any way. Do not microwave the pre-filled syringe, run hot water over it, or leave it in direct sunlight.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 2. Check the expiry date

- Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe (see Figure D ).
- Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the expiry date has passed.
- Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it has been stored at room temperature for longer than 2 months.
- If the expiry date has passed or the syringe has been stored at room temperature for longer than 2 months, then safely dispose of the pre-filled syringe and take a new one (see Step 12. Disposing of the syringe ).

Figure D

<!-- image -->

## Step 3. Inspect the pre-filled syringe

- Inspect the medicine through the clear window of the pre-filled syringe (see Figure E and Figure F ).
- Peel back the label to inspect the medicine if you cannot see enough of the medicine through the clear window of the pre-filled syringe (see Figure F ).
- It is normal to see air bubbles. Do not try to remove the air bubbles.
- The medicine should be brownish-yellow to yellow and may appear slightly opalescent to clear.
- If the medicine is discolored or contains particles (see Figure E ), then do not use it. Safely dispose of the pre-filled syringe and take a new one (see Step 12. Disposing of the Syringe ).
- Check the pre-filled syringe. If it looks damaged, has cracks or is leaking medicine, or has been dropped, safely dispose of the pre-filled syringe and take a new one.

## Figure C

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure F

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Choose and prepare an injection site

## Step 4. Clean your hands

- Wash your hands well with soap and water or use hand sanitizer (see Figure G ).

Figure G

<!-- image -->

## Step 5. Select the injection site

- Inject into the thigh or belly (abdomen) area, but stay 2 cm away from the belly button (navel) (see Figure H ).
- If somebody else (like a caregiver) gives you the injection, you can also use the upper arm.
- Rotate your injection sites. Do not inject in the same injection site multiple times if you see that the skin is damaged.
- Do not inject into the belly button, moles, scars or bruises, or into areas where the skin is tender, red, hard, or injured.

Figure H

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 6. Prepare the injection site

- Clean the injection site with an alcohol pad in a circular motion (see Figure I ).
- Allow the injection site to air dry.
- Do not touch the cleaned injection site before giving the injection.
- Do not fan or blow on the skin area that you cleaned.

Figure I

<!-- image -->

## Injecting the medicine with the pre-filled syringe

## Complete the injection without stopping. Read all steps first before beginning.

## Step 7. Remove needle cap and dispose of the cap

- Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject.
- Hold the pre-filled syringe by the body, with the needle facing away from you.
- Pull the needle cap straight off with one hand while holding the pre-filled syringe with the other hand (see Figure J ). If you cannot remove the cap, you should ask a caregiver for help or contact your healthcare provider.
- Do not touch or hold the plunger during needle cap removal.
- Do not re-cap the pre-filled syringe.
- Dispose of the needle cap in a sharps container or puncture resistant container.
- You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal.
- The needle should be kept sterile after removing the needle cap.  Do not touch the needle or let it touch any surfaces after removing the needle cap.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure J

<!-- image -->

## Step 8. Pinch the skin and insert the needle

Immediately after removing the needle cap, complete the following steps without stopping:

- Gently pinch the area of cleaned skin around the injection site and hold that area firmly until the injection is complete (see Figure K ).
- Fully insert the needle at an angle between 45˚ and 90˚. Do not change the angle during the injection.  (see Figure K : images show an example of injection at a 90˚ angle).
- Do not hold or push on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin.

<!-- image -->

## Step 9. Inject medicine

- Hold the pre-filled syringe in place and inject all of the medicine by firmly pushing the plunger all the way down (see Figure L ).
- Press the plunger all the way down until it stops to get the full dose. Push firmly on the plunger until the end of the injection (See Figure M ).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure L

<!-- image -->

Figure M

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 10. Release plunger

- After the plunger has been fully pushed down and the full dose injected, slowly remove your thumb from the plunger before removing the syringe from the skin (see Figure N ). This will make the needle retract inside the syringe.

Caution: Do not remove the syringe from the skin before removing your thumb, as this could result in a needle stick injury.

Figure N

<!-- image -->

Step 11. Release the pinch and remove the pre-filled syringe

- Release the pinch around the skin and remove the pre-filled syringe from the injection site (see Figure O ).
- If there is a little bleeding at the injection site, you can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site.
- Do not rub the injection site.
- If needed, you may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage.

Figure O

<!-- image -->

## Disposal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 12. Disposing of the syringe

- Do not reuse the pre-filled syringe.
- After injecting the dose, put the syringe into a sharps disposal container or closed punctureresistant container (see Figure P).
- If you do not have a sharps disposal container or closed puncture-resistant container, you may use a household container that is:
- o Made of heavy-duty plastic
- o Can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, to keep sharps safely inside
- o Upright stable during use
- o Leak-resistant
- o Properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container
- When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your local guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. Ask your pharmacist / healthcare provider for more information on how to dispose of your sharps container.
- Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your local guidelines permit this.
- Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

3. How to use ANDEMBRY
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store ANDEMBRY

7. Instructions for use

## 1. What ANDEMBRY is and what it is used for

ANDEMBRY contains the active substance garadacimab.

ANDEMBRY is a medicine used in patients aged 12 years and older with hereditary angioedema (HAE) to prevent angioedema attacks.

HAE is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of swelling, known as HAE attacks, in different parts of the body, including the:

- hands and feet;
- face, eyelids, lips or tongue;
- voice-box (larynx) and throat, which may make breathing difficult;
- genitals;
- stomach and gut.

HAE attacks may be painful and disabling. Attacks that affect your throat or larynx may be dangerous or even life threatening.

HAE is a condition that often runs in families, but some people may not have a family history. Three types of HAE are known, based on the type of genetic defect and its effect on a protein that circulates in your blood, named C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). A person can have low levels of C1-INH in the body (type I HAE), poorly functioning C1-INH (type II HAE), or HAE with normal functioning C1INH (type III HAE). The last type is extremely rare. All three types produce the same clinical symptoms of localized swelling.

C1-INH regulates a process in the body that controls the production of an inflammatory substance called bradykinin. Overproduction of bradykinin causes swelling and inflammation in people with HAE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The active substance in ANDEMBRY, garadacimab, blocks the activation of a protein known as factor XIIa (FXIIa), which is involved in stimulating bradykinin production. By blocking FXIIa activity, garadacimab reduces the level of bradykinin, thereby preventing HAE attacks. Some subcategories of normal C1-INH HAE may not respond to treatment with garadacimab. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about your medicine.

## 2. What you need to know before you use ANDEMBRY

## Do not use ANDEMBRY

If you are allegic to garadacimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

- Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ANDEMBRY.
- If you have a severe allergic reaction to ANDEMBRY with symptoms such as hives, tight chest, difficulty breathing, wheezing, hypotension or anaphylaxis, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately .
- Treat a hereditary angioedema attack with your regular rescue medicine without taking additional doses of ANDEMBRY.

## Keeping a record

It is strongly recommended that every time you have a dose of ANDEMBRY, you write down the name and batch number of the medicine. This is so that you keep a record of the batches used.

## Laboratory tests

Tell your doctor if you are using ANDEMBRY before you have laboratory tests to measure how well your blood is clotting. This is because ANDEMBRY may interfere with some laboratory tests, leading to inaccurate results.

## Children and adolescents

ANDEMBRY is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age. This is because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and ANDEMBRY

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

ANDEMBRY is not known to affect other medicines or be affected by other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting ANDEMBRY. There is limited information on the safety of ANDEMBRY use during pregnancy and breast-feeding. As a precaution, it is preferable to avoid the use of ANDEMBRY during pregnancy.Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ANDEMBRY contains proline

This medicine contains 19.3 mg of proline in each pre-filled pen which is equivalent to 16.1 mg/mL. Proline may be harmful for patients with hyperprolinaemia, a rare genetic disorder in which proline builds up in the body. If you (or your child) have hyperprolinaemia, do not use this medicine unless your doctor has recommended it.

## ANDEMBRY contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 0.24 mg of polysorbate 80 in each pre-filled pen which is equivalent to 0.2 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## ANDEMBRY solution for injection in pre-filled pen subcutaneous use

## Read the following safety information:

- Keep the pre-filled pen in its original carton box until use, to protect it from light.
- Do not remove the clear pre-filled pen cap until you are ready to inject.
- Do not put the clear pre-filled pen cap back on the pre-filled pen after it has been removed because this could start the injection and cause injury.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The pre-filled pen contains 1 dose and is for single-use only. Do not try to reuse the same prefilled pen.
- Do not use the pre-filled pen if the expiry date has passed.
- The pre-filled pen is for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection only.
- Do not use the pre-filled pen if it looks damaged, has cracks, is leaking medicine, or has been dropped. In these cases, throw away the pre-filled pen as described in Step 11 and use a new one.
- Do not inject through clothing.
- Do not touch or try to remove the grey needle shield at any time.
- Keep ANDEMBRY out of reach of children.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have any questions.

## How should I store ANDEMBRY?

- Store ANDEMBRY pre-filled pen in a refrigerator, between 2 ˚C to 8 ˚C in its original carton until use, to protect it from light.
- Do not freeze. If the pre-filled pen has been frozen, do not use the pre-filled pen even if it is thawed.
- Take the pre-filled pen out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use, allowing it to reach room temperature.

## Alternative storage (room temperature)

- If needed, for example when traveling, the pre-filled pen may be stored at room temperature ( up to 25˚C ) for a single period of up to 2 months, but not beyond the expiry date.
- If you decide to store the pre-filled pen at room temperature:
- o In the space provided on the carton box, write the date you first removed the pre-filled pen from the refrigerator to help you keep track of how long it has been stored at room temperature.
- o do not put the pre-filled pen back in the refrigerator after it has reached room temperature.
- o throw away the pre-filled pen if it has been stored at room temperature for longer than 2 months (see Step 11. Disposing of the pre-filled pen ).

## Supplies needed for your pre-filled pen injection ( see Figure B) :

Included in the carton box:

- 1 Single-dose pre-filled pen

Required supplies but not included in the carton box:

- 1 alcohol pad
- 1 cotton ball or gauze pad
- 1 sharps container or puncture-resistant container for disposal (see Step 11. Disposing of the pre-filled pen )

## Preparing for an Injection

Do not remove the clear pre-filled pen cap until immediately before the injection.

## Step 1. Let the pre-filled pen reach room temperature

- Remove the pre-filled pen from the carton box and place it laying down on a clean flat surface.
- Wait 30 minutes for the medicine to reach room temperature if it was stored in the refrigerator (see Figure C ).
- Injecting the medicine cold could be uncomfortable.
- Do not try to speed up the warming process in any way. For example, do not warm it in a microwave, in hot water, or leave it in direct sunlight.

Room temp.

## Step 2. Check the expiry date

- Check the expiry date on the pre-filled pen label (see Figure D ).
- Do not use the pre-filled pen if the expiry date has passed.
- Do not use the pre-filled pen if it has been stored at room temperature for longer than 2 months.
- If the expiry date has passed or if stored at room temperature for longer than 2 months, then safely dispose of the pre-filled pen and take a new one (see Step 11. Disposing of the prefilled pen ).

## Step 3. Inspect the pre-filled pen and the medicine

- Check the pre-filled pen for damage .
- Check the medicine through the viewing window of the pre-filled pen (see Figure E ).
- It is normal to see air bubbles, do not try to remove the air bubbles.
- The medicine should be brownish-yellow to yellow and may appear slightly opalescent to clear.
- Do not use the pre-filled pen, safely dispose of it and take a new one (see Step 11. Disposing of the pre-filled pen ) if :
- o The medicine is discoloured or contains particles
- o The pre-filled pen looks damaged or has cracks
- o The pre-filled pen is leaking
- o The pre-filled pen has been dropped on a hard surface, even if it does not look damaged

## Choose and prepare an injection site

## Step 4. Clean your hands

- Wash your hands well with soap and water or use hand sanitizer (see Figure F ).

Figure F

<!-- image -->

## Step 5. Select the injection site

- Inject into the thigh or belly (abdomen) area , but stay 2 cm away from the belly button (navel) (see Figure G )
- If somebody else (caregiver) gives you the injection, they can also use the upper arm. Do not try to inject into the upper arm yourself.
- Change (rotate) your injection site with each injection. Do not inject in the same place multiple times if the skin is damaged.
- Do not inject into the belly button, moles, scars or bruises, or into areas where the skin is tender, red, hard, or injured.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 6. Prepare the injection site

- Clean the injection site with an alcohol pad (see Figure H ).
- Let your skin dry on its own.
- Do not touch this area again before injecting.
- Do not fan or blow on the skin area that you cleaned.

## Injecting the Medicine with the Pre-filled pen

Complete the injection without stopping. Read all steps first before beginning. Do not remove the clear cap until you are ready to inject.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 7. Remove clear pre-filled pen cap and dispose of the cap

- Hold the pre-filled pen with one hand and pull the clear pre-filled pen cap straight off with the other hand.
- Do not twist the Clear Cap, (see Figure I ). If you cannot remove the Clear Cap, ask a caregiver for help or contact your healthcare provider.
- The Clear Cap has a metal part inside, this is normal.
- Do not put the Clear Cap back on after it has been removed, because this could start the injection and cause injury.
- Dispose of the Clear Cap in a sharps container or closed puncture-resistant container.

## Important:

- Do not touch the grey needle shield of the pre-filled pen to avoid injury.
- Do not put the pre-filled pen down after removing the Clear Cap.

## Step 8. Pinch the skin and place the pre-filled pen on the injection site

Immediately after removing the clear pre-filled pen cap, complete the following steps without stopping:

- Gently pinch the area of cleaned skin around the injection site and hold the area firmly until the injection is complete (see Figure J ).
- Place the pre-filled pen at a 90˚ angle on the cleaned injection site (see Figure J ).
- Make sure you can see the viewing window.

Figure K

<!-- image -->

- Do not remove the pre-filled pen until the yellow plunger has stopped moving and completely filled the viewing window, and 5 seconds has passed after the Second 'click.'
- Do not remove, tilt, or rotate the pre-filled pen during the injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 10. Release the pinch and remove the pre-filled pen

- Release the pinch and remove the pre-filled pen at a 90° angle from the skin (see Figure L ).
- As the pre-filled pen is lifted from the skin, the grey needle shield will return to the original (before use) position, and lock into place, covering the needle.

Figure L

## Important: If you think that you have not received the full dose contact your healthcare provider right away.

- If there is a little bleeding at the injection site, you can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site.
- Do not rub the injection site.
- If needed, you may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Disposal

## Step 11. Disposing of the pre-filled pen

- Do not try to reuse the pre-filled pen.
- After injecting your dose, put the pre-filled pen into a sharps container or closed punctureresistant container (see Figure M ).
- If you do not have a sharps container or closed puncture resistant container, you may use a household container that is:
- o Made of heavy-duty plastic
- o Can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out
- o Upright stable during use
- o Leak-resistant
- o Properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container
- When your sharps container is almost full, you will need to follow your local guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps container. Ask your pharmacist / healthcare provider for more information on how to dispose of your sharps container.
- Do not dispose of your used sharps container in your household trash unless your local guidelines permit this.
- Do not recycle your used sharps container.
