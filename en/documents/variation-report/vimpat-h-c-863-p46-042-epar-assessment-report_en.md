## 1. Introduction

On 19 Jan 2022, the MAH submitted the results of EP0090, a post-marketing survey including children, a completed survey study including paediatric patients for Vimpat, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

EP0090 was a postmarketing survey intended to determine the incidences of adverse reactions, evaluate efficacy, and consider factors that may affect the safety and efficacy of Vimpat (lacosamide).

Patients who had newly initiated treatment with the Survey Drug as 'a monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization' were observed over a period of 26 weeks. The patients were followed as per current clinical practices for their condition. A total of 300 patients were planned in the survey.

The summary below presents disposition, demographics, dosing history, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for the 6 paediatric patients from EP0090 to fulfill the requirement of reporting paediatric data as outlined in Article 46.
