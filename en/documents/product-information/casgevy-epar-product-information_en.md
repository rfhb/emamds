<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## β -thalassemia

Casgevy is indicated for the treatment of transfusiondependent β -thalassemia (TDT) in patients 12 years of age and older for whom haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related HSC donor is not available.

## Sickle cell disease

Casgevy is indicated for the treatment of severe sickle cell disease (SCD) in patients 12 years of age and older with recurrent vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) for whom haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related HSC donor is not available.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Casgevy must be administered in an authorised treatment centre by a physician with experience in HSC transplantation and in the treatment of patients with β -haemoglobinopathies and trained for administration and management of patients treated with the medicinal product.

Before mobilisation, apheresis and myeloablative conditioning are initiated, confirm that haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is appropriate for the patient.

## Posology

Casgevy is intended for autologous use (see section 4.4).

Treatment consists of a single dose containing a dispersion for infusion of viable CD34 + cells in one or more vials.

The minimum recommended dose of Casgevy is 3 × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg of body weight.

See the accompanying Lot information sheet (LIS) for additional information pertaining to dose.

## Mobilisation and apheresis

Patients are required to undergo CD34 + HSPC mobilisation followed by apheresis to isolate the CD34 + cells for medicinal product manufacturing.

Maximise CD34 + cell collection for product manufacturing during each mobilisation and apheresis cycle. Perform two consecutive days of cell collection for product manufacturing per cycle, if clinically tolerated. A total collection target of at least 20 × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg is recommended for product manufacture. Collected cells should be sent for product manufacturing even if the total collection target is not achieved. In addition, at least 2 × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg are required to be collected for back-up unmodified rescue cells. A third day of cell collection can be used to obtain back-up rescue cells, if needed.

If the minimum dose of Casgevy is not met after initial medicinal product manufacturing, the patient will need to undergo additional cycles of mobilisation and apheresis to obtain more cells for additional product manufacture. Each mobilisation and apheresis cycle must be separated by a minimum of 14 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The backup collection of ≥ 2 × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg of unmodified rescue cells must be collected from the patient and be cryopreserved prior to myeloablative conditioning and infusion with Casgevy.

The unmodified cells may be needed for rescue treatment under any one of the following conditions: compromise of Casgevy after initiation of myeloablative conditioning and before Casgevy infusion; neutrophil engraftment failure; or loss of engraftment after infusion with Casgevy.

See section 5.1 for a description of the mobilisation regimen used in the clinical study. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the mobilisation medicinal product(s) prior to treatment with Casgevy.

## β -thalassemia

Prior to apheresis procedure it is recommended that patients receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion(s) with a goal to maintain total haemoglobin (Hb) concentration ≥ 11 g/dL.

## Sickle cell disease

Prior to apheresis it is recommended that patients receive RBC exchange or simple transfusion(s) with a goal of maintaining haemoglobin S (HbS) levels &lt; 30% of total Hb while keeping total Hb concentration ≤ 11 g/dL.

Disease modifying therapies (e.g., hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide, crizanlizumab, voxelotor) must be discontinued 8 weeks before the planned start of mobilisation and conditioning.

Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) must not be administered for mobilisation in patients with sickle cell disease.

## Pre-treatment conditioning

Full myeloablative conditioning must be administered before infusion of Casgevy. Conditioning must not be initiated until the complete set of vials constituting the full dose of Casgevy has been received at the authorised treatment centre, and the availability of the back-up collection of unmodified CD34 + cells is confirmed. See section 5.1 for a description of the conditioning regimen used in the clinical study. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the myeloablative conditioning medicinal product(s) prior to treatment.

## β -thalassemia

It is recommended that patients maintain total Hb concentration ≥ 11 g/dL for 60 days prior to myeloablative conditioning.

## Sickle cell disease

It is recommended that patients receive RBC exchange or simple transfusion(s) for at least the 8 weeks prior to the initiation of myeloablative conditioning with a goal of maintaining HbS levels &lt; 30% of total Hb while keeping total Hb concentration ≤ 11 g/dL. At initiation of red blood cell exchanges or simple transfusions, discontinue disease modifying therapies (e.g., hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide, crizanlizumab, voxelotor).

Iron chelation therapy must be stopped at least 7 days prior to myeloablative conditioning.

Prophylaxis for seizures should also be considered. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the myeloablative conditioning medicinal product used for information on drug interactions.

Prophylaxis for hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome should be considered, per institutional guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Prior to starting the myeloablative conditioning regimen, confirm availability of the complete set of vials constituting the dose of Casgevy, and unmodified rescue cells. See the Lot information sheet (LIS) provided with the product shipment for confirmation of the number of vials and total dose of Casgevy.

## Pre-medication

It is recommended that pre-medication with paracetamol and diphenhydramine, or equivalent medicinal products, be administered per institutional guidelines, before the infusion of Casgevy, to reduce the possibility of an infusion reaction.

## Special populations

## Patients aged 35 years and older

Casgevy has not been studied in patients &gt; 35 years of age. The safety and efficacy of Casgevy in this population has not been established. The benefit of treatment in individual patients should be considered against the risks of HSC transplantation.

## Renal impairment

Casgevy has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . No dose adjustment is required.

## Hepatic impairment

Casgevy has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Casgevy in patients &lt; 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)

Casgevy has not been studied in patients with HIV-1, HIV-2, HBV, or HCV. Perform screening for HIV-1, HIV-2, HBV, and HCV and any other infectious agents in accordance with local guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Casgevy must not be used in patients with active HIV-1, HIV-2, HBV or HCV.

## Patients with prior HSC transplant

Casgevy has not been studied in patients who have received a prior allogeneic or autologous HSC transplant. Treatment with Casgevy is not recommended in these patients.

## Method of administration

## Casgevy is for intravenous use only.

After completion of the myeloablative conditioning regimen, a minimum of 48 hours must elapse before Casgevy infusion. Casgevy must be administered between a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 7 days after the last dose of myeloablative conditioning.

Before thawing and administration, it must be confirmed that the patient's identity matches the unique patient information on the Casgevy vial(s) and accompanying documentation. The total number of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vials must also be confirmed with patient specific information on the Lot information sheet (LIS) (see section 4.4).

Casgevy is administered as an intravenous bolus via a central venous catheter. Casgevy infusion must be completed as soon as possible and no more than 20 minutes after thawing. In the event that more than one vial is provided, all vials must be administered . The entire volume of each vial must be infused.

For detailed instructions on preparation, administration, measures to take in case of accidental exposure and disposal of Casgevy, see section 6.6.

## After Casgevy administration

Standard procedures for patient monitoring and management after HSC transplantation must be followed after Casgevy infusion, including monitoring of complete blood counts and transfusion needs.

Blood products required within the first 3 months after Casgevy infusion must be irradiated.

Restarting iron chelation after Casgevy infusion may be necessary. Avoid the use of non-myelosuppressive iron chelators for at least 3 months and use of myelosuppressive iron chelators for at least 6 months after Casgevy infusion. Phlebotomy can be used in lieu of iron chelation, when appropriate (see section 4.5).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Contraindications to mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning medicinal products must be considered.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Warnings and precautions of mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning medicinal products must be considered.

## Traceability

The traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. To ensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient must be kept for a period of 30 years after expiry date of the medicinal product.

## Autologous use

Casgevy is intended solely for autologous use and must not under any circumstances be administered to other patients. Casgevy must not be administered if the information on the product labels and Lot information sheet (LIS) does not match the patient's identity.

## Transmission of an infectious agent

Although Casgevy is tested for sterility, mycoplasma and endotoxins, a risk of transmission of infectious agents exists. Healthcare professionals administering Casgevy must, therefore, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections after treatment and treat appropriately, if needed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypersensitivity reactions

There is a potential for hypersensitivity reactions with Casgevy, including due to Cas9. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis may occur due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dextran 40 in Casgevy. Patients should be observed closely during and after infusion. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) and the occurrence of any symptoms should be monitored prior to the start of the infusion, and approximately every 30 minutes from when the first vial of Casgevy is infused until 2 hours after the last vial of Casgevy is infused.

## Potential neutrophil engraftment failure

Neutrophil engraftment failure is a potential risk in haematopoietic stem cell transplant, defined as not achieving neutrophil engraftment after Casgevy infusion and requiring use of unmodified rescue CD34 + cells. Patients must be monitored for absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and infections must be managed according to standard guidelines and medical judgement. In the event of neutrophil engraftment failure, patients must be infused with rescue CD34 + cells (see section 4.8).

## Delayed platelet engraftment

Longer median platelet engraftment times have been observed with Casgevy treatment compared to allogeneic HSC transplantation. There is an increased risk of bleeding until platelet engraftment is achieved.

Patients should be monitored for bleeding according to standard guidelines and medical judgement. Frequent platelet counts must be conducted until platelet engraftment and platelet recovery are achieved. Blood cell count determination and other appropriate testing must be performed whenever clinical symptoms suggestive of bleeding arise (see section 4.8).

## Risk of insufficient mobilisation/apheresis in patients with SCD

Patients with SCD may require more cycles of mobilisation and apheresis compared to patients with TDT and are at higher risk of failure of sufficient mobilisation/apheresis. See section 4.2 for the recommended total CD34 + cell collection target. See section 5.1 for information regarding the average number of cycles of mobilisation and apheresis, and overall discontinuation rates.

## Gene-editing related oncogenesis

No cases of myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma have been reported in clinical studies with Casgevy. There is a theoretical risk of oncogenesis related to gene editing. Patients should be monitored at least annually (including complete blood count) for 15 years after treatment with Casgevy. If myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma are detected, the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder should be contacted to determine appropriate samples for analysis.

The risk of unintended, off-target editing in an individual's edited CD34 + cells cannot be ruled out. A search spanning the human genome identified off-target editing at a single variant site. The variant was identified in 3.3% (3/91) of patient samples analyzed (edited CD34 + cells). The currently

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identified off-target site is located in an intron of a gene not expressed in haematopoietic cells so no adverse effects are expected (see section 5.3).

## Immunogenicity

No immune-mediated reactions were observed in clinical studies with Casgevy. It is unknown whether pre-formed antibodies to Cas9 including following recent Streptococcus pyogenes infection could result in immune-mediated reactions and/or clearance of cells with residual Cas9.

## Blood, organ, tissue, and cell donation

Patients treated with Casgevy must not donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for transplantation.

## Long-term follow-up

Patients must be monitored annually (including complete blood counts) according to standard guidelines and medical judgement. Patients are expected to be enrolled in a long-term follow-up scheme in order to better understand the long-term safety and efficacy of Casgevy.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains 5.3 mg to 70 mg sodium in each vial. This is equivalent to 0.3 to 4% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

The drug-drug interaction of mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning medicinal products must be considered.

No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Casgevy is not expected to interact with the hepatic cytochrome P-450 family of enzymes or drug transporters.

Use of hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide must be discontinued at least 8 weeks prior to start of mobilisation and conditioning. There is no experience on the use of hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide after Casgevy infusion.

Discontinue the use of voxelotor and crizanlizumab at least 8 weeks prior to start of mobilisation and conditioning, as their interaction potential with mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning medicinal products is not known.

Iron chelators must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to initiation of myeloablative conditioning, due to potential interaction with the conditioning medicinal product. Some iron chelators are myelosuppressive. Avoid the use of non-myelosuppressive iron chelators for at least 3 months and use of myelosuppressive iron chelators for at least 6 months after Casgevy infusion. Phlebotomy can be used instead of iron chelation, when appropriate.

## Live vaccines

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Casgevy treatment has not been studied. As a precautionary measure, vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of the conditioning regimens, during Casgevy treatment, and until haematological recovery following treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females

A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of each mobilisation cycle and re-confirmed prior to myeloablative conditioning. There are insufficient exposure data to provide a precise recommendation on duration of contraception following treatment with Casgevy. Women of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child must use effective method of contraception from start of mobilisation through at least 6 months after administration of myeloablative conditioning. Please also refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the myeloablative conditioning medicinal product.

## Pregnancy

There are no clinical data from the use of exagamglogene autotemcel in pregnant women. No animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with exagamglogene autotemcel to assess whether it can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It is not known whether exagamglogene autotemcel has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. Casgevy must not be administered during pregnancy because of the risk associated with myeloablative conditioning. Pregnancy after Casgevy infusion should be discussed with the treating physician (see guidance on contraception, above).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether exagamglogene autotemcel is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding child. There are no data available.

Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning medicinal product(s) for guidance on their use during breast-feeding. Because of the potential risks associated with myeloablative conditioning, breast-feeding should be discontinued during conditioning.

The decision to breast-feed after Casgevy treatment should be discussed with the treating physician, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child versus any potential adverse events from Casgevy or from the underlying maternal condition.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of exagamglogene autotemcel on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. Data are available on the risk of infertility with myeloablative conditioning. It is therefore advised to consider fertility preservation options such as cryopreservation of semen or ova before treatment if possible.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Casgevy has no influence on the ability to drive or use machines.

The effect of mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning medicinal products on the ability to drive or use machines must be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of Casgevy was evaluated in two open-label, single-arm studies (study 111 and study 121) and one long-term follow-up study (study 131), in which 97 adolescent and adult patients with TDT or SCD were treated with Casgevy.

Treatment with Casgevy was preceded by peripheral blood mobilisation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor in patients with TDT and plerixafor only in patients with SCD, followed by apheresis and myeloablative conditioning with busulfan.

The safety profile was generally consistent with that expected from busulfan myeloablative conditioning and HSC transplant after mobilisation and apheresis.

The median (min, max) duration of follow-up after being administered Casgevy was 22.8 (2.1, 51.1) months for patients with TDT (N=54), and 17.5 (1.2, 46.2) months for patients with SCD (N=43).

Serious adverse reactions attributed to Casgevy occurred in 2 (3.7%) patients with TDT: 1 (1.9%) patient with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, and headache; 1 (1.9%) patient with delayed engraftment and thrombocytopenia. No patient with SCD had serious adverse reactions attributed to Casgevy.

A life-threatening serious adverse reaction of cerebellar haemorrhage occurred in 1 (1.9%) patient with TDT and was attributed to busulfan myeloablative conditioning.

One (2.3%) patient with SCD died due to a COVID-19 infection and subsequent respiratory failure. The event was not related to Casgevy.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10) and common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 are lists of adverse reactions attributed to mobilisation/apheresis with G-CSF and plerixafor, mobilisation/apheresis with plerixafor only, myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, and Casgevy, respectively, experienced by patients with TDT and SCD in clinical studies with Casgevy.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Platelet engraftment

Platelet engraftment was defined as 3 consecutive measurements of platelet counts ≥ 20 × 10 9 /L in patients with TDT and 3 consecutive measurements of platelet counts ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L in patients with SCD, obtained on 3 different days after Casgevy infusion without administration of platelet transfusions for 7 days. All patients achieved platelet engraftment.

In study 111, the median (min, max) time to platelet engraftment in patients with TDT was 44 (20, 200) days (n=53), with one remaining patient achieving platelet engraftment after the time of the interim analysis. The median (min, max) time to platelet engraftment was 45 (20, 199) days in adolescent patients and 40 (24, 200) days in adult patients. Patients without a spleen had an earlier median time to platelet engraftment than patients with an intact spleen. Median (min, max) time to platelet engraftment was 34.5 (20, 78) days in patients without a spleen and 46 (27, 200) days in patients with an intact spleen.

In study 121, the median (min, max) time to platelet engraftment for patients with SCD was 35 (23, 126) days (n=43). The median (min, max) time to platelet engraftment was 44.5 (23, 81) days in adolescent patients and 32 (23, 126) days in adult patients.

There was no association observed between bleeding events and time to platelet engraftment after Casgevy treatment.

## Neutrophil engraftment

Neutrophil engraftment was defined as 3 consecutive measurements of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 500 cells/µL on 3 different days after Casgevy infusion, without use of the unmodified rescue CD34 + cells. All patients achieved neutrophil engraftment, and no patients received rescue CD34 + cells.

In study 111, the median (min, max) time to neutrophil engraftment in patients with TDT was 29 (12, 56) days (n=54). The median (min, max) time to neutrophil engraftment was 31 (19, 56) days in adolescent patients and 29 (12, 40) days in adult patients.

In study 121, the median (min, max) time to neutrophil engraftment in patients with SCD was 27 (15, 40) days (n=43). The median (min, max) time to neutrophil engraftment was 28 (24, 40) days in adolescent patients and 26 (15, 38) days in adult patients.

There was no association observed between infections and time to neutrophil engraftment.

## Paediatric population

The safety of Casgevy was evaluated in 31 adolescent patients aged 12 to less than 18 years with TDT or SCD. The median (min, max) age of adolescent TDT patients was 14 (12, 17) years, and for SCD patients was 15 (12, 17) years. The median (min, max) duration of follow-up was 19.6 (2.1, 26.6) months for adolescent TDT patients and 14.7 (2.5, 18.7) months for adolescent SCD patients. The safety profile was generally consistent among adolescent and adult patients. Engraftment times were similar in adolescent and adult patients.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Not applicable.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, other haematological agents, ATC code: B06AX05

## Mechanism of action

Casgevy is a cell therapy consisting of autologous CD34 +  HSPCs ex vivo edited by CRISPR/Cas9-technology. The highly specific guide RNA enables CRISPR/Cas9 to make a precise DNA double-strand break at the critical transcription factor binding site (GATA1) in the erythroidspecific enhancer region of the BCL11A gene. As a result of the editing, GATA1 binding is irreversibly disrupted and BCL11A expression reduced. Reduced BCL11A expression results in an increase in γ -globin expression and foetal haemoglobin (HbF) protein production in erythroid cells, addressing the absent globin in transfusiondependent β -thalassemia (TDT) and the aberrant globin in sickle cell disease (SCD), which are the underlying causes of disease. In patients with TDT, γ -globin production is expected to correct the α -globin to nonα -globin imbalance, thereby reducing ineffective erythropoiesis and haemolysis and increasing total haemoglobin levels. In patients with severe SCD, HbF expression is expected to reduce intracellular HbS concentration, preventing the red blood cells from sickling.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of Casgevy was evaluated in adolescent and adult patients with transfusion-dependent β -thalassemia (TDT) or sickle cell disease (SCD) in two open-label, single-arm studies (study 111 and study 121) and one long-term follow-up study (study 131).

## Transfusiondependent β -thalassemia

Study 111 is an ongoing open-label, multicentre, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Casgevy in adult and adolescent patients with transfusiondependent β -thalassemia. After completion of 24 months of follow-up in study 111, patients were invited to enrol in study 131, an ongoing long-term safety and efficacy study.

Patients were eligible for the study if they had a history of requiring at least 100 mL/kg/year or 10 units/year of RBC transfusions in the 2 years prior to enrolment. Patients were also required to have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score of ≥ 80%.

Patients were excluded from the study if they had an available HLA-matched related HSC donor. Patients who had severely elevated iron in the heart (i.e., patients with cardiac T2* less than 10 msec by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), or advanced liver disease were excluded from the study. MRI of the liver was performed on all patients. Patients with MRI results demonstrating liver iron content ≥ 15 mg/g underwent liver biopsy for further evaluation. Patients with a liver biopsy demonstrating bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis were excluded.

Of the 59 patients who initiated mobilisation in study 111, 3 patients (5.1%) discontinued prior to Casgevy infusion, all due to withdrawn consent.

## Mobilisation and apheresis

To maintain a total Hb concentration ≥ 11 g/dL patients underwent RBC transfusions prior to mobilisation and apheresis and continued receiving transfusions until the initiation of myeloablative conditioning.

To mobilise stem cells for apheresis, patients in study 111 were administered granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Patients with a spleen were administered a planned dose of 5 mcg/kg G-CSF approximately every 12 hours via intravenous or subcutaneous injection for 5 to 6 days. Splenectomised patients were administered a planned dose of 5 mcg/kg G-CSF once daily for 5 to 6 days. The dose was increased to every 12 hours in splenectomised patients if there was no increase in white blood cell (WBC) or peripheral blood CD34 + counts. After 4 days of G-CSF administration, all patients received plerixafor at a planned dose of 0.24 mg/kg administered via subcutaneous injection approximately 4- to 6 hours prior to each planned apheresis. Apheresis was carried out for up

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to 3 consecutive days to achieve the target collection of cells for manufacture and for the unmodified rescue CD34 + cells. The mean (SD) and median (min, max) number of mobilisation and apheresis cycles required for manufacture Casgevy and for the collection of rescue CD34 + cells were 1.3 (0.7) and 1 (1, 4), respectively.

## Pre-treatment conditioning

All patients received full myeloablative conditioning with busulfan prior to treatment with Casgevy. Busulfan was administered for 4 consecutive days intravenously via a central venous catheter at a planned starting dose of 3.2 mg/kg/day once daily or 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours. Busulfan plasma levels were measured by serial blood sampling and the dose adjusted to maintain exposure in the target range. For once daily dosing, four-day target cumulative busulfan exposure was 82 mg*h/L (range: 74 to 90 mg*h/L), corresponding to AUC0-24h of 5000 μM*min (range: 4500 to 5500 μM*min). For dosing every 6 hours, the four-day target cumulative busulfan exposure was 74 mg*h/L (range: 59 to 89 mg*h/L), corresponding to AUC0-6h of 1125 μM*min (range: 900 to 1350 μM*min).

All patients received anti-seizure prophylaxis with agents other than phenytoin prior to initiating busulfan conditioning. Phenytoin was not used for anti-seizure prophylaxis because of its induction of cytochrome P-450 and resultant increased clearance of busulfan.

Prophylaxis for hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was administered per institutional guidelines.

## Casgevy administration

Patients were administered Casgevy with a median (min, max) dose of 8.0 (3.0, 19.7) × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg as an intravenous infusion. All patients were administered an antihistamine and an antipyretic prior to Casgevy infusion.

## After Casgevy administration

G-CSF was not recommended within the first 21 days after Casgevy infusion. As Casgevy is an autologous therapy, immunosuppressive agents were not required after initial myeloablative conditioning.

## Efficacy results β -thalassemia

An interim analysis (IA) was conducted with 42 patients administered Casgevy and eligible for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy set (PES) was defined as all subjects who had been followed for at least 16 months after Casgevy infusion. At the time of the interim analysis 59 patients were enrolled and 54 patients had been administered Casgevy. The median (min, max) total duration of follow-up was 22.8 (2.1, 51.1) months from the time of Casgevy infusion.

The efficacy of Casgevy was assessed based on evaluation of patients with at least 16 months of follow-up. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving transfusion independence for 12 consecutive months (TI12), defined as maintaining weighted average Hb ≥9 g/dL without RBC transfusions for at least 12 consecutive months any time within the first 24 months after Casgevy infusion in study 111, evaluated starting 60 days after the last RBC transfusion for post-transplant support or TDT disease management.

Efficacy data are presented in Table 6 and Table 7. Table 6 shows the primary endpoint for (1) all patients enrolled in study 111 and (2) all patients infused with Casgevy in study 111. Table 7 shows secondary endpoints for patients infused with Casgevy in study 111.

†  N represents the total number of enrolled patients who signed informed consent, and excludes patients who were waiting to receive Casgevy at the time of the analysis, or patients who were not yet evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint.

‡ N represents the total number of patients in the primary efficacy set (PES), a subset of the full analysis set (FAS). The PES was defined as all subjects who had been infused with Casgevy and had been followed for at least 16 months after Casgevy infusion. Patients who had less than 16 months of follow-up due to death, or discontinuation due to Casgevy-related adverse events, or continuously received RBC transfusions for more than 12 months after Casgevy infusion were also included in this set.

§  TI12 is defined as maintaining weighted average Hb ≥9 g/dL without RBC transfusions for at least 12 consecutive months any time after Casgevy infusion. The evaluation of TI12 starts 60 days after last RBC transfusion for post-transplant support or TDT disease management.

*  Interim analysis conducted based on April 2023 data cut.

† N represents the total number of patients in the primary efficacy set (PES), a subset of the full analysis set (FAS). The PES was defined as all patients who had been infused with Casgevy and had been followed for at least 16 months after Casgevy infusion. Subjects who had less than 16 months follow-up due to death or discontinuation due to Casgevy-related adverse events, or continuously received RBC transfusions for more than 12 months after Casgevy infusion were also included in this set.

SD: Standard Deviation

All patients who achieved TI12 remained transfusion-independent, with a median (min, max) duration of transfusion-independence of 22.3 (13.5, 48.1) months and normal weighted average total Hb levels (mean [SD] 13.2 [1.4] g/dL). The median (min, max) time to last RBC transfusion for patients who achieved TI12 was 28 (11, 91) days following Casgevy infusion. Three patients did not achieve TI12. These patients had reductions in frequency of RBC transfusions over time, and then stopped receiving transfusions between 12.2 and 21.6 months after Casgevy infusion, consistent with an overall slower haematopoietic recovery.

Total Hb (g/dL) and HbF (g/dL) levels over time are provided in Figure 1 for all patients administered Casgevy for the treatment of β -thalassemia.

<!-- image -->

Mean values are plotted in the line, mean +Standard Error (SE) and mean -SE values are plotted as bars at each visit. The numbers of patients with values available at the corresponding visits are shown beneath the figure.

Increases in mean (SD) total Hb and HbF levels were observed as early as month 3 after Casgevy infusion and continued to increase to 12.2 (2.0) g/dL and 10.9 (2.7) g/dL respectively at month 6. After month 6, levels of total Hb and HbF were maintained ther eafter, with HbF comprising ≥ 88% of total Hb.

All patients who achieved TI12 in study 111 (n=39) had normal (28/39 patients, 71.8%) or near-normal (11/39 patients, 28.2%) weighted average total Hb levels. The patients with near-normal weighted average total Hb levels included 6 males and 5 females, with weighted average total Hb within &lt; 0.1 to 0.7 g/dL and within &lt; 0.4 to 1.4 g/dL of the WHO age and sex dependent reference threshold, respectively.

Subgroup analyses evaluating the effects in age, sex, race or genotype subgroups on transfusion-related endpoints and haematological parameters did not suggest differences due to these factors.

## Sickle cell disease

Study 121 is an ongoing open-label, multicentre, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Casgevy in adult and adolescent patients with severe sickle cell disease. After completion of 24 months of follow-up in study 121, patients were invited to enrol in study 131, an ongoing long-term safety and efficacy study.

Patients were eligible for the study if they had a history of at least 2 severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) events per year in the 2 years prior to screening, which were defined as:

- Acute pain event requiring a visit to a medical facility and administration of pain medications (opioids or intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or RBC transfusions
- Acute chest syndrome
- Priapism lasting &gt; 2 hours and requiring a visit to a medical facility
- Splenic sequestration.

Patients with Hb S/S , Hb S/β0 and Hb S/β+ genotypes were eligible for inclusion. Patients were also required to have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance score of ≥ 80%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were excluded from the study if they had an available HLA-matched related HSC donor. Patients were excluded if they had advanced liver disease, history of untreated Moyamoya disease, or presence of Moyamoya disease that in the opinion of the investigator put the patient at risk of bleeding. Patients aged 12 to 16 years were required to have normal transcranial doppler (TCD) and patients aged 12 to 18 years were excluded if they had any history of abnormal TCD in the middle cerebral artery and the internal carotid artery.

Of the 58 patients that initiated mobilisation in study 121, 11 patients (19.0%) discontinued after starting mobilisation and apheresis and prior to Casgevy administration. Six patients (10.3%) did not achieve the minimum dose. Five patients (8.6%) discontinued due to noncompliance, withdrawn consent, or no longer meeting eligibility requirements.

The key demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 8, below, for (1) all patients enrolled in study 121 and (2) all patients infused with Casgevy in study 121.

## Mobilisation and apheresis

Patients underwent red blood cell exchange or simple transfusions for a minimum of 8 weeks before the planned start of mobilisation and continued receiving transfusions or red blood cell exchanges until the initiation of myeloablative conditioning. HbS levels were maintained at &lt; 30% of total Hb while keeping total Hb concentration ≤ 11 g/dL.

To mobilise stem cells for apheresis, patients in study 121 were administered plerixafor at a planned dose of 0.24 mg/kg via subcutaneous injection approximately 2 to 3 hours prior to each planned apheresis. Patients underwent apheresis for up to 3 consecutive days to achieve the target collection of cells for manufacture and for the unmodified rescue CD34 + cells. The median (min, max) and mean (SD) number of mobilisation and apheresis cycles required for manufacture Casgevy and for the collection of rescue CD34 + cells were 2 (1, 6) and 2.21 (1.30), respectively.

## Pre-treatment conditioning

All patients received full myeloablative conditioning with busulfan prior to receiving Casgevy. Busulfan was administered for 4 consecutive days intravenously via a central venous catheter at a planned starting dose of 3.2 mg/kg/day once daily or 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours. Busulfan plasma levels were measured by serial blood sampling and the dose adjusted to maintain exposure in the target range. For once daily dosing, the four-day target cumulative busulfan exposure of 82 mg*h/L (range 74 to 90 mg*h/L), corresponding to AUC0-24h of 5000 μM*min (range: 4500 to 5500 μM*min). For dosing every 6 hours, the four-day target cumulative busulfan exposure of 74 mg*h/L (range 59 to 89 mg*h/L), corresponding to AUC0-6h of 1125 μM*min (range 900 to 1350 μM*min).

All patients received anti-seizure prophylaxis with agents other than phenytoin prior to initiating busulfan conditioning. Phenytoin was not used for anti-seizure prophylaxis because of its induction of cytochrome P-450 and resultant increased clearance of busulfan.

Prophylaxis for hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was administered, per regional and institutional guidelines.

## Casgevy administration

Patients were administered Casgevy with a median (min, max) dose of 4.0 (2.9 to 14.4) × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg as an intravenous infusion. All patients were administered an antihistamine and an antipyretic prior to Casgevy infusion.

## After Casgevy administration

G-CSF was not recommended within the first 21 days after Casgevy infusion. As Casgevy is an autologous therapy, immunosuppressive agents were not required after initial myeloablative conditioning.

## Efficacy results - sickle cell disease

An interim analysis was conducted with 29 patients administered Casgevy and eligible for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy set (PES) was defined as all patients who had been followed for at least 16 months after Casgevy infusion. At the time of the interim analysis 63 patients were enrolled and 43 patients had been administered Casgevy. The median (min, max) total duration of follow-up was 17.5 (1.2, 46.2) months from the time of Casgevy infusion.

The efficacy of Casgevy was based on evaluation of patients with at least 16 months of follow-up. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who did not experience any severe VOCs for at least 12 consecutive months any time within the first 24 months after Casgevy infusion in study 121 (VF12, primary efficacy endpoint). For this endpoint, a severe VOC was defined as either (a) an acute pain event requiring a visit to a medical facility and administration of pain medications (opioids or intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or RBC transfusions), (b) acute chest syndrome, (c) priapism lasting &gt; 2 hours and requiring a visit to a medical facility, or (d) splenic sequestration. The proportion of patients who did not require hospitalisation due to severe VOCs for at least 12 consecutive months (HF12, key secondary endpoint) was also assessed. The evaluation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

VF12 and HF12 began 60 days after last RBC transfusion for post-transplant support or SCD management.

Efficacy data are presented in Table 9 and Table 10. Table 9 shows the primary endpoint for (1) all patients enrolled in study 121 and (2) all patients infused with Casgevy in study 121. Table 10 shows secondary endpoints for all patients infused with Casgevy in study 121.

† N represents the total number of patients in the primary efficacy set (PES), a subset of the full analysis set (FAS). The PES was defined as all patients who had been infused with Casgevy and had been followed for at least 16 months after Casgevy infusion. Subjects who had less than 16 months follow-up due to death, or discontinuation due to Casgevy-related adverse events, or continuously received RBC transfusions for more than 12 months after Casgevy were also included in this set. ‡ HF12 is defined as no severe VOC-related inpatient hospitalisations sustained for at least 12 months after Casgevy infusion. The evaluation of HF12 starts 60 days after last RBC transfusion for post-transplant support or SCD management.

Total Hb (g/dL) and HbF (g/dL) levels over time is provided in Figure 2 for all patients administered Casgevy for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Figure 2: Mean total Hb (g/dL) and HbF (g/dL) levels over time in patients with SCD

<!-- image -->

Mean values are plotted in the line, mean +SE and mean -SE values are plotted as bars at each visit. The numbers of patients with values available at the corresponding visits are shown beneath the figure.

Increases in mean (SD) total Hb levels were observed as early as month 3 after Casgevy infusion, continued to increase to 12.5 (1.8) g/dL at month 6 and were maintained thereafter.

The mean (SD) proportion of Hb comprised by HbF was 43.2% (7.6%) at month 6 and was maintained thereafter.

Consistent with the increase in HbF levels, for all patients dosed the mean (SD) proportion of circulating erythrocytes expressing HbF (F-cells) at month 3 was 70.4% (14.0%) and continued to increase over time to 93.9% (12.6%) at month 6, with levels remaining stable thereafter, indicating sustained pan-cellular expression of HbF.

Subgroup analyses evaluating the effects in age, sex, race or genotype subgroups on VOC-related endpoints and haematological parameters did not suggest differences due to these factors.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Casgevy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in β -thalassemia and sickle cell disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Casgevy is an autologous cellular therapy medicinal product consisting of CD34 + cells that have been edited ex vivo by CRISPR/Cas9. The nature of Casgevy is such that conventional studies on pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Casgevy is a CD34 + cell product edited with CRISPR/Cas9 technology; therefore, conventional mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and fertility, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted.

Toxicological characteristics were assessed in sub-lethally irradiated, immunodeficient NSG mice treated with a dose of 3.33 × 10 7 edited CD34 + cells/kg of body weight. There was no evidence of target organ toxicity or tumorigenicity in the 20-week study.

During preclinical development, the potential for off-target editing was assessed at over 5000 sites, including those nominated based on human genetic variation. No off-target editing was observed in edited CD34 + cells from healthy donors and patients. A post-marketing non-clinical study (Study U270) evaluated 33 additional candidate off-target editing sites nominated based on the presence of genetic variations. No off-target editing was observed at 32 of these sites in edited CD34 + cells from patients. One site had off-target editing due to a minor variant allele present in 3 of 91 patient samples (3.3%). This variant leads to a binding motif for Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex in the intronic region of the gene encoding for carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1).The off-target editing was observed at a low fraction of alleles ( ≤ 1%) and included a balanced inversion (&lt;0.25%). Gene editing in this minor allele is not expected to have any adverse effects in patients as the off-target site is within an intron and CPS1 is not expressed in haematopoietic cells.

## Preparation for the infusion

- Coordinate the timing of Casgevy thaw and infusion. Confirm the infusion time in advance and adjust the start time for thaw so that Casgevy is available for infusion when the patient is ready, as Casgevy must be administered within 20 minutes of thawing the vial. Thaw and infuse the content of one vial at a time.
- Before thaw, confirm the patient's identity matches the patient information on the Casgevy vial(s). Do not remove the Casgevy vials from cryo-storage if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient.
- A dose of Casgevy may be contained in one or more cryopreserved patient-specific vial(s). Account for all vials and confirm each vial is within the expiry date using the accompanying Lot information sheet (LIS).
- Inspect the vial(s) for any breaks or cracks prior to thawing. If a vial is compromised, do not infuse the contents.
- Assemble supplies needed to thaw and withdraw the product from the vial(s). With the exception of the water bath, these supplies are single use. Assemble sufficient supplies for each vial to be administered:
- o Water bath
- o Alcohol swabs
- o Vial adapter (to allow for needle-less extraction)
- o 18 micron stainless steel filter
- o 30 mL luer-lock syringe
- o Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (5 to 10 mL needed for each vial)
- o 10 mL luer-lock syringe for sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection rinse

## Thawing the Casgevy vials

- When the dose consists of multiple vials, thaw and administer one vial at a time. While thawing a vial, remaining vials must remain in cryostorage at ≤ -135 °C.
- Thaw each vial at 37 °C using a water bath. Ensure water bath temperature does not exceed 40 °C.
- Thaw each vial holding the vial neck, gently agitating clockwise and counterclockwise. This can take between 10 to 15 minutes.
- Do not leave vial unattended during thawing.
- Thawing is complete when ice crystals are no longer visible in the vial.
- Remove vial from water bath immediately once thawed.
- The thawed product should appear as a translucent cell dispersion free from foreign particles.
- Infuse within 20 minutes of thaw.
- Thawed medicinal product must not be refrozen.

## Administration of Casgevy

Casgevy is for autologous use only. The patient's identity must match the patient identifiers on the Casgevy vial(s). Do not infuse Casgevy if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient.

A patient's dose may consist of multiple vials. All vials must be administered. The entire volume of each vial provided must be infused. If more than one vial is provided, administer each vial completely before proceeding to thaw and infuse the next vial.

## Attaching the vial adapter and filter

- Remove the flip-away tab of the vial cap; clean the septum with an alcohol swab.
- Remove the cap on the adapter spike.
- With the thumb and forefinger of both hands, push the adapter into the vial septum, applying equal pressure until you hear a single pop.
- Pull up on the adapter until you feel it lock.
- Attach the filter to the vial adapter.

## Withdrawing Casgevy from the vial

- Attach an empty 30 mL syringe to the filter.
- Withdraw the entire vial product volume.
- Remove the product-filled syringe from the filter and set aside.
- Draw 5 - 10 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection into the empty 10 mL syringe.
- Attach the sodium chloride solution-filled syringe to the filter.
- Inject the sodium chloride solution into the Casgevy vial and remove the empty syringe from the filter. Discard the empty syringe.
- Attach the product-filled syringe to the filter.
- Withdraw the contents of the vial into the product syringe, then remove the syringe from the filter.
- The optional product/patient identifier label can be peeled from the Lot information sheet (LIS) and affixed to the syringe.

## Administration of Casgevy through a central venous catheter

- Casgevy must be administered within 20 minutes of product thaw.
- Perform a two-person confirmation and verification of patient's identification at the bedside prior to the infusion of each vial(s).
- Casgevy is administered as an intravenous bolus (intravenous push).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The total volume of Casgevy administered within one hour must not exceed 2.6 mL/kg.
- Do not use an inline filter when infusing Casgevy.
- After administration of each vial of Casgevy, flush the primary line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.

Repeat the steps listed above for each remaining vial.

## After administration of Casgevy

- Monitor vital signs every 30 minutes from when the first vial of Casgevy is infused until 2 hours after the last vial of Casgevy is infused.
- Standard procedures for patient management after HSC transplantation should be followed after Casgevy infusion.
- Irradiate any blood products required within the first 3 months after Casgevy infusion.
- Patients must not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells at any time in the future.

## Measures to take in case of accidental exposure

In case of accidental exposure local guidelines on handling of human-derived material must be followed. Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with Casgevy must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## D. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

## · Risk management plan (RMP)

The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## · Additional risk minimisation measures

Prior to the use of Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel) in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational programme with the National Competent Authority.

The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Casgevy is marketed, all healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, use, or oversee the administration of Casgevy have access to/are provided with the following 2 educational packages aimed at highlighting the important identified and potential risks of Casgevy. These packages will be translated in the local language to ensure understanding of proposed mitigation measures by physicians and patients:

## · The Physician Educational Material consists of

- o Guide for Healthcare Professionals;
- o Summary of Product Characteristics;
- o Guide for Patients/Carers;
- o Patient Card.

## · The Patient Information Pack consists of

- o Guide for Patients/Carers;
- o Patient Card;
- o Patient Information Leaflet

## · Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements:

- o The HCP should inform patients treated with Casgevy that there is an important identified risk of delayed platelet engraftment and important potential risks of neutrophil engraftment failure and gene editing-related oncogenesis; and details on how these risks can be minimised.

When presenting Casgevy as a treatment option and before a treatment decision is made, the HCP should discuss the risk-benefit of Casgevy, including the following:

- o Delayed platelet engraftment
-  Platelet counts should be monitored and managed according to standard guidelines and medical judgement. Blood cell count determination and other

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms suggestive of bleeding arise.

-  Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of delayed platelet engraftment, what symptoms and signs to be aware which could indicate bleeding, and the need to seek medical assistance if they experience any signs or symptoms suggestive of bleeding.
- o Neutrophil engraftment failure
-  Patients should be monitored for absolute neutrophil counts and infections and should be managed according to standard guidelines and medical judgement. In the event of neutrophil engraftment failure, patients should be infused with unmodified rescue CD34 + cells.
-  Patients should be counselled regarding the fact that if they were to experience neutrophil engraftment failure after treatment with Casgevy, they would require an infusion of back-up CD34 + cells and would not obtain the benefit of Casgevy treatment and still be exposed to possible long-term risks.
- o Gene editing-related oncogenesis
-  Gene editing-related oncogenesis is a theoretical risk. After treatment with Casgevy, patients should be monitored annually (including complete blood count) according to standard guidelines and medical judgement. If blood and bone marrow samples are taken for the diagnosis of haematologic malignancy, HCPs should take additional samples for analysis by the MAH to evaluate the association of malignancy with Casgevy treatment, should a malignancy be confirmed.
-  Patients should be counselled regarding the theoretical risk of gene editing-related oncogenesis and to seek medical attention if these signs and symptoms of myelodysplasia, leukaemia, and lymphoma are present.
- o The HCP should provide the Patient Card and Guide for Patients/Carers to patients/carers.
- o There is limited information regarding long-term effects. Therefore, participation in the long-term, registry-based study evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes in patients who received Casgevy for treatment of TDT or SCD is encouraged. The HCP should remind patients about the importance to enrol in the 15-year, registry-based study of the long-term effects and how to obtain further information.
- Patient alert card shall contain the following key elements :
- o This card is to inform HCPs that the patient has received Casgevy infusion.
- o The patient should show the Patient Card to a doctor or nurse whenever they have medical appointments.
- o The patient should have blood tests as directed by the doctor.
- o The patient should seek medical advice for any signs of low platelet cell or white blood cell levels: severe headache, abnormal bruising, prolonged bleeding, or bleeding without injury (such as nosebleeds, bleeding from gums, blood in the urine, stool, or vomit, or coughing up blood), fever, chills, or infections.
- o Blood cancers are a theoretical risk. The patient should seek medical advice for any signs of fatigue, unexplained fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, frequent infections, shortness of breath, or swelling of lymph glands.
- Guide for patients/carers shall contain the following key elements :

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The guide explains the importance to fully understand the risk-benefit of Casgevy treatment and that there is limited information about the long-term effects.

Therefore, before a decision is made about starting the therapy, the doctor will discuss the following with the patient/carer:

- o How the important identified risk of delayed platelet engraftment and important potential risk of neutrophil engraftment failure can be recognised and minimised, including the need for monitoring of platelet and neutrophils regularly with regular blood tests until they have returned to a safe level.
- o Explain that there is a theoretical risk of gene editing-related oncogenesis and the need to monitor annually.
- o Explain that, in the event of neutrophil engraftment failure after treatment with Casgevy, unmodified rescue cells will be infused and the patient will not obtain benefit from Casgevy whilst still being exposed to the possible long-term risks.
- o Advise to seek medical advice for any signs of low platelets: severe headache, abnormal bruising, prolonged bleeding, or bleeding without injury (such as nosebleeds, bleeding from gums, blood in the urine, stool, or vomit, or coughing up blood).
- o Advise patient to seek medical advice for any signs of low white blood cell levels: fever, chills, or infections.
- o As blood cancers are a theoretical risk, advise to seek medical advice for any signs of blood cancers such as fatigue, unexplained fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, frequent infections, shortness of breath, or swelling of lymph glands.
- o The patient will receive a Patient Card that should be shown to any doctor or nurse at any medical appointments.
- o Inform that there is limited information regarding the long-term effects of Casgevy and the importance to participate in the registry-based study for long-term surveillance of 15 years.

## · Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

## 1. What Casgevy is and what it is used for

## What Casgevy is

Casgevy is a gene therapy product that contains the active substance exagamglogene autotemcel.

Casgevy is made specifically for you using your own blood stem cells. Blood stem cells can turn into other blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood platelets. These cells are collected from your blood, then genetically modified and given back to you as a transplant in a hospital.

## What Casgevy is used for

Casgevy is used to treat:

- People aged 12 years and older with beta-thalassemia who need regular blood transfusions (transfusion-dependent thalassemia, TDT). People with TDT do not make enough haemoglobin, a protein in the blood that carries oxygen through the body, due to a gene defect. This causes anaemia, and they need regular blood transfusions.
- People aged 12 years and older with sickle cell disease (SCD) who have frequent painful crises (called vaso-occlusive crises or VOCs). Patients with SCD have a different form of haemoglobin (sickle cell haemoglobin or HbS) from other people due to a gene defect. HbS leads to abnormal sickle-shaped red blood cells that stick together and cannot easily move through blood vessels. This can lead to the blockage of blood vessels, causing VOCs.

## How Casgevy works

Casgevy works by increasing the production of a special type of haemoglobin called Haemoglobin F ( foetal haemoglobin or HbF). Having more HbF improves the production and function of red blood cells. Because of this, people with TDT may not need blood transfusions and people with sickle cell disease may not experience VOCs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Casgevy

## You must not be given Casgevy:

- if you are allergic to exagamglogene autotemcel or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the medicines you will be given to prepare you for treatment with Casgevy (see section 3).

Tell your doctor straight away if either of these applies to you or if you are not sure. The treatment will not be given to you if you are allergic to any of these medicines.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Casgevy.

## Before treatment with Casgevy:

- You will have two other types of medicines before you are given Casgevy. For more information on these medicines, see section 3.
- o Mobilisation medicine(s) to move the blood stem cells from your bone marrow into the blood stream so they can be collected to make Casgevy. This step will take 2-6 days.
- o Conditioning medicine is given to you shortly before you are given Casgevy. This creates space in the bone marrow for new blood cells to grow following treatment with Casgevy.
- The doctor will discuss the possible impact of the conditioning medicine on fertility . See below under ' Fertility in men and women '.
- In people with SCD, it can be more difficult to move the blood stem cells from the bone marrow and therefore to collect them, compared to people with TDT. More mobilisations and collections may therefore be needed in people with SCD than people with TDT.

## After treatment with Casgevy:

- You will have fewer blood cells for a while, until Casgevy takes hold in your bone marrow. This includes
- o Low levels of platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). Low levels of platelets may cause bleeding.

Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these signs of low platelet cell levels: severe headache, abnormal bruising, prolonged bleeding, or bleeding without injury such as nosebleeds, bleeding from gums, blood in your urine, stool, or vomit, or coughing up blood .

- Low levels of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that usually prevents infections).
- o Low levels of neutrophils may make infections more likely.
- Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these signs of low white blood cell levels: fever, chills, or other signs of infections such as sore throat, cough or shortness of breath, pain or burning when urinating or urinating often, or diarrhoea.
- Your doctor will monitor blood cell levels and give you treatment as required. The doctor will tell you when your platelets and neutrophils return to safe levels.
- The doctor will monitor your blood cell levels and overall health to help researchers understand the long-term effects of Casgevy.
- In some patients, haemoglobin levels may be lower than is normally expected for their age and sex.
- After treatment with Casgevy there is a theoretical risk of blood cancers (myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma), although this has not been seen in studies with Casgevy. Your doctor will monitor you at least once a year for 15 years for any signs of blood cancers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Ingredients of Casgevy called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dextran 40 and Cas9 may cause serious allergic reactions. Your doctor or nurse will monitor you for signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction both during and after treatment with Casgevy. See also section 2 'Casgevy contains sodium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).'
- Casgevy is tested for the presence of infectious microbes, but a small risk of infection remains. Your doctor or nurse will monitor you for signs and symptoms of infections and provide treatment as needed.
- After treatment with Casgevy, you must not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells.
- Casgevy is made from your own cells and is only given to you. Information about cell-based medicinal products must be kept for 30 years at the hospital where you receive the treatment. The information they keep will include your name, name of the product and the batch number(s) of Casgevy you received.

## If Casgevy treatment cannot be completed or fails

If Casgevy cannot be given after the conditioning medicine, or if the modified blood stem cells do not take hold in the body, the doctor may decide to give you an injection into a vein that contains your rescue cells (your own original and untreated blood stem cells) that are collected and stored before treatment starts (see section 3). If you are given rescue cells, you will not have any treatment benefit and will still need treatment for either TDT or SCD.

## Children under 12 years of age

Casgevy is not to be given to children under 12. It is not yet known if Casgevy is safe and effective in these children.

## Other medicines and Casgevy

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

Do not take medicines that remove iron from your body (chelating agents such as deferoxamine, deferiprone and/or deferasirox) for at least 7 days before you are given the conditioning medicine. Your doctor will advise you if and when you can start taking these medicines after Casgevy treatment.

Do not take other medicines for sickle cell disease (such as hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide, crizanlizumab or voxelotor) for at least 8 weeks before you are given the mobilisation and conditioning medicines. Your doctor will advise you if and when you should start taking these medicines after Casgevy treatment.

Vaccines called 'live vaccines' must not be given for 6 weeks before the conditioning medicine used to prepare for Casgevy treatment, nor after treatment while your immune system (the body's defence system) is recovering. Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.

## Pregnancy

This treatment must not be given during pregnancy because of the possible effects of the conditioning medicine. The effects of Casgevy in pregnant women are not known. Talk to your doctor about pregnancy after receiving Casgevy.

If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Casgevy, talk to your doctor immediately.

If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you will be given a pregnancy test before starting mobilisation and conditioning medicines to make sure you are not pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Contraception in men and women

If you are a woman who can get pregnant, or a man capable of fathering a child, you must use an effective method of contraception from the start of mobilisation treatment and for at least 6 months after receiving Casgevy. Talk to your doctor about which methods of contraception are appropriate.

## Breast-feeding

Breast-feeding must be stopped during conditioning because of the possible effects of the conditioning medicine. It is not known whether the ingredients of Casgevy can pass into breast milk. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefit of breast-feeding for your baby versus potential risks of treatment.

## Fertility in men and women

It may not be possible for you to become pregnant or father a child after you have had the conditioning medicine. You should discuss your options with your doctor before treatment. These may include storing reproductive material (for instance, eggs, sperm) to use at a later time.

## Driving and using machines

The mobilisation medicine and conditioning medicines used before Casgevy treatment may cause dizziness and fatigue. If you feel dizzy, tired or unwell, do not drive, use machines or take part in activities that need you to be alert.

## Casgevy contains sodium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)

This medicine contains approximately 5.3-70 mg sodium (main component of table salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 0.3-4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. The total number of vials comprising a dose varies per patient.

This medicine contains approximately 50 mg DMSO per mL. See Section 2 'Warnings and precautions'.

## 3. How Casgevy is made and given

Casgevy is given only once.

Casgevy can only be given in an authorised treatment centre (specialised hospital) by doctors with experience in stem cell transplants, and in the treatment of patients with blood disorders such as TDT and SCD.

STEP 1 : Before Casgevy treatment, a doctor will give you a mobilisation medicine . This medicine moves blood stem cells from your bone marrow into the blood stream. The cells are then collected in a machine that separates the different blood cells (this is called apheresis ). The entire step may happen more than once. Each collection step takes about one week.

'Rescue cells' are also collected and stored at the hospital. These are your existing blood stem cells and are kept untreated in case there is a problem in the treatment process. See above in section 2, ' If Casgevy treatment cannot be completed or fails '.

STEP 2 : Your blood stem cells will be sent to the manufacturing site where they are used to make Casgevy . It may take up to 6 months from the time your cells are collected to manufacture and test Casgevy before it is sent back to your doctor.

STEP 3 : Shortly before your stem cell transplant, the doctor will give you a conditioning medicine in the hospital. This step takes about 2 to 6 days and will prepare you for treatment by removing cells from the bone marrow, so they can be replaced with the modified cells in Casgevy. After you are given this medicine, the number of blood cells will fall to very low levels (see section 4). You will stay in the hospital at this point until after the Casgevy infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

STEP 4 : One or more vials of Casgevy will be given as an injection into a vein through a central venous catheter. Central venous catheters are thin, flexible tubes, that are inserted by a doctor into a large vein to access your bloodstream. The risks of catheters are infections and the formation of blood clots. The doctor and nurses will monitor you for any central venous catheter complications. It may take a few hours for all of the injections to be given. After you are given Casgevy, you will stay in hospital so that your healthcare team can closely monitor your recovery. This can take approximately 2 months, but times can vary. A doctor will decide when you can go home.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Talk to your doctor or nurse about possible side effects.

Some side effects are related to the mobilisation medicine and the conditioning medicine. You should also read the package leaflets for these medicines.

The following serious side effects can happen within the first few days or weeks after treatment but can also develop much later.

- Pain in the right upper abdomen under the ribs, yellowing of eyes or skin, rapid weight gain, swelling of arms, legs and abdomen, and trouble breathing.

These may be signs of a serious liver condition called veno-occlusive disease.

- Severe headache, abnormal bruising, prolonged bleeding, or bleeding without injury such as nosebleeds, bleeding from gums, blood in your urine, stool, or vomit, or coughing up blood.

These may be signs of thrombocytopenia , low levels of platelet cells, which can reduce the ability of blood to clot and may lead to bleeding.

- Fever, chills or infections.

These may be signs of neutropenia , low levels of white bloods cells called neutrophils that fight infections.

Tell your doctor immediately if you get any of the side effects listed above.
