## Introduction

Bosentan (TRACLEER) is an oral endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist that competes with the binding of ET-1 to both ETA and ETB receptors. In Europe, bosentan (TRACLEER) is approved for the following therapeutic indications:

'Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III. Efficacy has been shown in:

- Primary (idiopathic and heritable) pulmonary arterial hypertension
- Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  secondary  to  scleroderma  without  significant  interstitial pulmonary disease
- Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger's physiology.

Some  improvements  have  also  been  shown  in  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  WHO functional class II.

TRACLEER  is  also  indicated  to  reduce  the  number  of  new  digital  ulcers  in  patients  with  systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease.'

A  dispersible  tablet  formulation  of  TRACLEER  with  good  acceptability  by  children  with  PAH  was developed  to  allow  age-  and  weight-appropriate  dosing.  This  32  mg  quadrisectable  tablet  was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2009.

In  2015,  the  EU  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  was  amended  to  include  data  generated  in paediatric studies with bosentan conducted according to the agreed EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) and with posology recommendations for children above 1 year of age.

The FUTURE 3 paediatric study in PAH subjects was conducted as part of the PIP:

- AC-052-373: Open-label, randomized, multicenter, multiple dose trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, tolerability, safety and efficacy of the paediatric formulation of bosentan two versus three times a day in children from 3 months to less than 12 years of age with PAH (FUTURE 3 core)

The 6-month core study was followed by a 12-month extension study, which was not part of the PIP:

- AC-052-374:  A  prospective,  multicenter,  open-label  extension  of  FUTURE  3  to  assess  the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the pediatric formulation of bosentan two versus three times a day in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (FUTURE 3 extension).

Cumulative safety data for 64 paediatric subjects from the start of bosentan treatment in the FUTURE 3 core study up to the end of the extension study, ie, for a period of up to 18 months was adopted by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products on 25 June 2015 under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (the 'Paediatric Regulation') (EMEA/H/C/000401 P46 081).

Beyond the 12-month treatment period in the FUTURE 3 extension study, in countries where bosentan was  not  commercially  available  and  where  'compassionate  use'  or  similar  programs  could  not  be implemented due to local regulations, bosentan study treatment was offered through an 'Exceptional Use Treatment Period' (EUTP), if continued treatment was deemed beneficial by the investigator. A total  of  10  paediatric  subjects  (hereafter  referred  to  as  participants)  in  4  countries  (Belarus,  China, Russia, and Ukraine) continued receiving bosentan during the EUTP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The purpose of this addendum to the clinical overview (D-20.371, dated 11 November 2020), is to assess the cumulative safety data for these 10 paediatric participants (0.8 to 10.9 years at FUTURE 3 core study entry), from the start of bosentan treatment in the core FUTURE 3 study up to the end of the EUTP, ie, for a median (range) duration of 246.2 (100.1 to 397.1) weeks. The present submission complies with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (the 'Paediatric Regulation').

## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

A  dispersible  32  mg  tablet  formulation  of  TRACLEER  was  developed  to  allow  age-  and  weightappropriate dosing in children. This strength was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2009.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

## 1.2.1. Introduction

The MAH provided the cumulative safety data of the 10 paediatric patients included in the study FUTUR 3 Extension Exceptional Use Treatment Period.

## 1.2.2. Clinical study

## Description

Title  of  Study: A prospective, Multicenter, Open-label Extension of FUTURE 3 to Assess the Safety, Tolerability  and  Efficacy  of  the  Pediatric  Formulation  of  Bosentan  Two  Versus  Three  Times  a  Day  in Children With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

Study Name: FUTURE 3 Study Extension Exceptional Use Treatment Period

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The objectives of the FUTURE 3 extension EUTP were:

- To  provide  participants  with  bosentan  beyond  the  initial  12-month  treatment  period  of  the FUTURE 3 extension*.
- To  monitor  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  pediatric  formulation  of  bosentan  in participants who completed the FUTURE 3 extension.

FUTURE 3 extension was a prospective, multicenter, multinational, open-label, double-arm exploratory Phase  3  extension  study,  which  enrolled  children  with  idiopathic  or  heritable  pulmonary  arterial hypertension  (PAH)  or  PAH  persisting  after  complete  repair  of  a  congenital  heart  defect  who  had completed the FUTURE 3 core study. During the FUTURE 3 extension study, participants received 32 mg dispersible tablets of bosentan, adjusted to their body weight at each visit (if required), according to the same dosing regimen as in the FUTURE 3 core study, ie, 2 mg/kg twice daily (bid) or three times

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a day (tid). Participants were treated for a period of 12 months or up to premature discontinuation of study treatment.

In countries where the 32 mg dispersible tablets of bosentan were not available either commercially or through 'compassionate use' or similar programs, and if continued treatment was deemed beneficial by the investigator, an EUTP was included at the end of the FUTURE 3 extension 12-month treatment period.  During  the  EUTP,  all  participants  continued  receiving  bosentan  until  the  latest  of  one  of  the following:

- Participant or the investigator decided to discontinue the study treatment permanently;
- Participant reached the age of 13 years (if the adult formulation of bosentan, if appropriate, was available commercially or via 'compassionate use' or similar programs);
- An alternative treatment was made available;
- Sponsor decided to stop the development of the pediatric formulation of bosentan. A 60-day posttreatment follow-up was performed at the end of EUTP.

## Study population /Sample size

The  number  of  subjects  included  in  the  EUTP  was  not  driven  by  any  statistical  consideration.  All participants who entered the EUTP received bosentan during the period.

A total number of 10 participants* were included in the safety analysis.

During the study conduct, a potential compliance issue with China's Human Genetic Resources ('HGR') Regulations was identified in early 2020. To ensure compliance with the data exporting rules under the HGR Regulation, a subset of data from Chinese participants (from 19 November 2019) was excluded from the final analysis. Nonetheless, any and all significant safety information (Death, serious adverse event [SAE] and/or Pregnancy), are included in this report.

The applicable standards of Good Clinical Practices and ethical considerations were adhered to when not  conflicting  with  China's  Human  Genetic  Resources  ('HGR')  Regulations.  Note  that  no  significant safety events  were  reported  for  any  participants  from  China  in  the  FUTURE  3  study  after  data  cutoff  date, 19 November 2019.

*exclusion of 0 Chinese participants.

## Eligibility Criteria

Participants were eligible for the EUTP if they had completed the 12-month treatment period of the FUTURE  3  extension  study,  continued  treatment  with  bosentan  was  deemed  beneficial  by  the investigator, and bosentan was not available either commercially or via 'compassionate use' or similar programs.

## Exclusion Criteria

Participants  with  known  intolerance  or  hypersensitivity  to  bosentan  or  any  of  its  excipients,  any clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormality  that  precluded  the  continuation  of  bosentan  therapy, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3× the upper limit of the normal (ULN) range, moderate to severe hepatic impairment (ie, Child-Pugh Class B or C), or were pregnant, were not eligible for the EUTP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Bosentan dispersible tablets 32 mg, oral administration, bulk batch numbers CXFC, DTHD, rework of DKHC, GTXF, FP018, MMWY, TNPZ, FP023, JP019.

During the EUTP, the median (range) duration of exposure to bosentan (n=10) was 160.1 (26.3 to 324.7) weeks, corresponding to a total exposure of 33 subject-years.

Over the FUTURE 3 core and extension studies and the EUTP, the median (range) duration of exposure to  bosentan  (n=10)  was  246.2  (100.1  to  397.1)  weeks,  corresponding  to  a  total  exposure  of  47 subject-years.

## Outcomes/endpoints

No efficacy data were collected during the EUTP.

## Safety data :

Safety was evaluated based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry), vital signs measurements, physical examination, body weight, and height/length.

## Statistical Methods

No  sample  size  determination  was  done  for  the  EUTP.  Only  those  participants  who  completed  the FUTURE 3 core (AC-052-373) and FUTURE 3 extension studies (AC-052-374) in specific countries could enter the EUTP.

All  10  participants  who  entered  and  received  bosentan  during  the  EUTP  were  included  in  the exceptional-use set.

No  statistical  hypothesis  was  specified  for  the  EUTP  (as  such  all  analyses  were  conducted  in  an exploratory manner). No efficacy evaluation was scheduled during the EUTP. The statistical evaluation of the safety and tolerability endpoints variables was performed descriptively: for all continuous safety variables,  descriptive  statistics  included  the  N,  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum  and maximum,  Q1  and  Q3.  Categorical variables were summarized  using frequency counts and percentages.

## Assessor's comment

This study only included 10 paediatric patients from FUTURE 3 extension study. The main objective of the study was to provide bosentan to patients who completed FUTURE 3 extension study in countries where bosentan was not commercially available and where 'compassionate use' or similar programs could not be implemented due to local regulations. Therefore, no efficacy evaluation was expected, and analysis of safety data was conducted in an exploratory manner only.

## Results

## STUDY POPULATION:

Of  64  participants  randomized  in  the  FUTURE  3  core  study,  58  (90.6%)  participants  entered  and received  2  mg/kg  bosentan  bid  (n=31)  or  tid  (n=27)  in  the  FUTURE  3  extension  study.  Of  the  58

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants  in  the  FUTURE  3  extension  study,  a  total  of  10  participants  entered  the  EUTP  and continued receiving 2 mg/kg bosentan bid (n=7) or tid (n=3) up to Amendment B (participants in the tid  arm  switched  to  bid  dosing).  After  implementation  of  Amendment  B  all  participants  received  2 mg/kg bosentan bid.  Of the 10 participants in the EUTP, 3 prematurely discontinued the study (for administrative reasons, death, and withdrawal of consent) and 4 participants completed the study. As of 19 November 2019 (cut-off used for participants in China), all 3 participants in China were ongoing in the EUTP.

Of the 10 participants in the EUTP, 6 (60.0%) participants were female and 7 (70.0%) were white. The median age at FUTURE 3 core study entry was 3.5 years (range 0.8 to 10.9 years) and that at EUTP entry  was  5.1  years  (range  2.2  to  12.4  years).  Of  the  10  participants,  3  each  were  from  Belarus, China, and Russia, and 1 participant from Ukraine. 4 participants each had associated PAH persisting after  complete repair of a congenital heart defect and PAH associated with congenital heart disease with  systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, and 2 participants had idiopathic PAH. At FUTURE 3 core study entry,  the  mean  time  from  initial  diagnosis  was  0.7  years  and  most  participants  were  in  WHO functional class I or II (4 participants each).

During  the  EUTP,  6  participants  received  at  least  1  concomitant  PAH-specific  medication  (ie, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors) along with the study treatment (bosentan).

No significant deviations from the protocol in terms of study design or conduct were reported during the EUTP.

## Efficacy results

No efficacy data were collected during the EUTP.

## Safety results

To  prevent  a  violation  of  the  HGR  Regulation,  from  19  November  2019  onwards  safety  data  from participants in China have only been reported in the safety database. Note that no significant safety events were reported for any participants from China in the FUTURE 3 Extension study EUTP after this data cut-off date.

During the EUTP (n=10), 8 participants (80.0%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) up to end of treatment (EOT) +7 days, corresponding to an adjusted incidence rate of 24.5 events per 100 person-years (PY) (95% confidence limits [CLs]: 12.2, 48.9). Treatment-emergent AEs reported in at least 2 participants during the EUTP and their adjusted incidence rates per 100 PY were pyrexia (9.2 events)  and  pneumonia,  pulmonary  hypertensive  crisis,  viral  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  upper respiratory tract infection (6.1 events each). The majority of TEAEs during the EUTP were of mild or moderate intensity. One participant died during the EUTP due to a pulmonary hypertensive crisis. The cause of death was considered by the investigator to be not related to study treatment. The participant received bosentan for a total of 1120 days, including 512 days over the combined FUTURE 3 core and extension studies. A total of 4 participants (40.0%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE up to EOT +7 days, corresponding to an adjusted incidence rate of 12.2 events per 100 PY (95% CLs: 4.6, 32.6). An  SAE  of  pulmonary  hypertensive  crisis  was  reported  in  2  participants  (including  the  death  case described above). Most SAEs were reported in the system organ class of Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders, with an adjusted incidence rate of 9.2 events per 100 PY. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. None of the 10 participants had AEs leading  to  premature  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  during  the  EUTP.  A  total  of  2  participants (20.0%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event of special interest (AESI) up to EOT +7

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

days,  corresponding to an adjusted incidence rate of 6.1 events per 100 PY (95% CLs: 1.5, 24.5). These were increased blood bilirubin in 1 participant and abnormal hepatic function and anemia in 1 participant. The AESI of increased blood bilirubin and anemia were considered by the investigator to be unrelated  to  study  treatment,  while  abnormal  hepatic  function  (ALT/AST  increase  &lt;3×  ULN)  was considered  to  be  study  treatment  related.  Study  treatment  was  interrupted  due  to  the  AESI  of increased blood bilirubin, while no action was taken with study treatment due to the AESI of anemia and abnormal hepatic function. All 3 AESI resolved without sequelae. Two participants had a transient decrease in hemoglobin to ≤10 g/dL. Overall, the nature and type of AEs reported during the EUTP were consistent with those reported in the core and extension studies and are in line with the known safety profile of bosentan in adults and children.

Over the FUTURE 3 core and extension studies and the EUTP (n=10), 9 participants (90.0%) had at least 1 TEAE up to EOT +7 days, corresponding to an adjusted incidence rate of 18.98 events per 100 PY (95% CLs: 9.9, 36.5). Frequently reported TEAEs and their adjusted incidence rates per 100 PY were upper respiratory tract infection (8.4 events) and nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, worsening of PAH, and pyrexia (6.3 events each). The majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity. A total of 4 participants (40.0%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE up to EOT +7 days, corresponding to an adjusted incidence rate of 8.4 events per 100 PY (95% CLs; 3.2, 22.5). The SAEs reported over the combined period were the same as those reported during the EUTP (described above), except an SAE of epistaxis (reported during the extension study and considered unrelated to study treatment) in the participant who died due to a pulmonary hypertensive crisis. A total of 2 participants (20.0%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent AESI up to EOT +7 days, corresponding to an adjusted incidence rate of 4.2 events per 100 PY (95% CLs: 1.1, 16.9). The AESI reported over the combined period were the same as those reported during the EUTP (discussed above). Over the combined period, 2 participants (20.0%) had hemoglobin values ≤10 g/dL, both reported during the EUTP. None of the 10 participants who entered EUTP had treatmentemergent marked abnormalities in liver function (ie, ALT / AST ≥3× ULN)  from  bosentan  treatment  start  in  the  FUTURE  3  core  study  up  to  EOT  +7  days  in  the  EUTP. Overall, the nature of AEs reported during the FUTURE 3 core and extension studies and the EUTP was consistent with the known safety profile of bosentan in adults and children.

STUDY LIMITATIONS: The main objective of the EUTP of the FUTURE 3 extension (AC-052-374) study was to provide participants with bosentan beyond the 12-month treatment period of the FUTURE 3 extension  study,  ie,  to  avoid  unintended  discontinuation  of  a  PAH-specific  treatment.  Providing bosentan as a study treatment required monitoring safety on an individual participant-level. No formal hypothesis was formulated, and the sample size was small, therefore these results are exploratory in nature.

## CONCLUSION(S):

Overall,  the  nature  and  type  of  AEs  reported  during  the  EUTP  were  consistent  with  those  reported previously in the FUTURE 3 core and extension studies and are in line with the known safety profile of bosentan in adults and children and no new concerns were identified. Following a detailed assessment of the totality of the data available from the trial, the sponsor has concluded that the exclusion of data from sites in China from 19 November 2019 until the database lock date (1 September 2020) has no clinically relevant impact on the conclusions regarding the safety of bosentan in this study, given the extensive long- term safety information already available.

## Assessor's comment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As mentioned above no efficacy evaluation was available, and analysis of safety data was conducted in an exploratory manner only.  Regarding the nature of the event reported during the study, the TEAEs reported  in  the  10  patients  during  the  EUTP  were  largely  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of bosentan  and  the  PAH  underlying  condition.  No  significant  new  safety  concern  emerged  from  this study.

## 1.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The main objective of the study was to provide bosentan to patients previously included in the study FUTURE  3  extension  in  countries  where  bosentan  was  not  available.  The  nature  and  type  of  AEs reported  during  the  EUTP  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  bosentan  in  adults  and children. No new safety concern was identified from EUTP safety data.

## 2. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The main objective of the study was to provide bosentan to patients from FUTURE 3 extension study in countries where bosentan was not commercially available and where 'compassionate use' or similar programs could not be implemented due to local regulations.

Exploratory safety analysis limited on the 10 patients included in this EUTP study did not raised any new safety concern in paediatric patients. No further action is required.
