1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

A total of 59 cases of convulsion were reported, of which 22 occurred concomitantly with fever while 37 cases occurred without fever. The majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric patients and some cases were observed in subjects with a history of epilepsy. These data guaranteed an update to update section 4.4 to adequately inform prescribers. |
