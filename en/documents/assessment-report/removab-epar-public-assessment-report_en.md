## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

## Malignant Ascites

Malignant ascites is a  sign  of  advanced  and  often  metastatic  malignancy.  In  general,  the  following major mechanisms for the development of malignant ascites are known:

1. Tumour  cells  seeding  along  the  peritoneal  wall  obstruct  lymphatic  drainage,  resulting  in  a decreased fluid efflux from the peritoneal cavity.
2. Tumour cells produce factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) leading to
- tumour neovascularisation
- increased permeability of the capillaries of the tumour and the peritoneum.

Nonmalignant  causes  of  ascites  in  cancer  patients  are  recognized  as  well:  These  include  cirrhosis, nephrosis, congestive heart failure and peritonitis secondary to pyogenic organisms and tuberculosis. These involve different mechanisms often unrelated to the above mentioned mechanism of malignant ascites. Symptoms  commonly  reported  by  malignant  ascites  patients  are  abdominal  bloating,  permanent feeling  of  fullness,  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  early  satiety,  abdominal  swelling,  anorexia,  dyspnea, insomnia, fatigue and respiratory distress. If  the  patient's  malignant  disease  is  sensitive  to  chemotherapy,  reduction  of  ascites  production  and relief  of  symptoms  may be achieved. However, most of the patients with ascites have already been treated with several lines of treatment, and their disease has become refractory to chemotherapy. For such  patients, Currently, the standard  treatment  method  of  treatment  of  malignant  ascites  is paracentesis  To  date,  no  drug  therapy,  specific  for  the  treatment  of  malignant  ascites,  has  been approved in the European Union. The Medicinal Product Removab contains catumaxomab, a monoclonal antibody. The antibody possesses 2 different antigen binding sites that target the human epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), human CD3 expressed on T-lymphocytes, respectively. The Fc region binds to the Fcγ-receptor-type I (CD64), -type IIa and type III (CD16), which are expressed on positive accessory cells Medicinal product no longer authorised

EpCAM is overexpressed in the majority of epithelial tumours. Binding of catumaxomab to EpCAMpositive  tumour  cells,  T  cells  and  accessory  cells  is  thought  to  bring  them  in  close  proximity  and induce  simultaneous  recruitment  and  activation  of  different  types  of  immune  effector  cells  at  the tumour cell site via a complex 'crosstalk' between T cell and accessory cell. This crosstalk includes cytokines  and  co-stimulatory  signalling  necessary  for  a  physiological  T  cell  activation  cascade  and ultimately, via multiple tumouricidal mechanisms, tumour cells could be eliminated.

The initially proposed indication for Removab was: intraperitoneal treatment of malignant ascites in patients  with  epithelial  cancers  where  no  standard  therapy  is  available  or  no  longer  feasible. Following the CHMP  scientific assessment, this indication was subsequently modified to 'intraperitoneal  treatment  of  malignant  ascites  in  patients  with  EpCAM  positive  carcinomas  where standard therapy is not available or no longer feasible', in order to reflect the clinical data that formed the basis of the assessment.

Removab must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic medicinal products. Prior to the intraperitoneal infusions, a premedication with antipyretic / antiphlogistic medicinal products is recommended. Removab dosing schedule comprises the following four intraperitoneal infusions: 1 st dose: 10 µg on day 0; 2 nd dose: 20 µg on day 3; 3 rd dose: 50 µg on day 7; 4 th dose: 150 µg on day 10. An interval of at least two days must elapse between infusions. The interval between the infusion days can be prolonged in case of relevant adverse reactions (see SPC section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Removab must be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion only. Removab must not be administered by intraperitoneal bolus or by any other route of administration. Before administration of Removab the concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  diluted  in  sodium  chloride  9 mg/ml  (0.9%)  solution  for injection. The diluted Removab solution for infusion is administered intraperitoneally via a constant infusion  pump  system.  The  SPC  section 6.6  provides  detailed  instructions  on  dilution  prior  to administration and for instructions for administration.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Removab  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  malignant  ascites  in  patients  with  EpCAM-positive carcinomas where standard therapy is not available or no longer feasible.

Removab contains  catumaxomab,  an  engineered  intact  trifunctional  bispecific  monoclonal  antibody (trAb) consisting of a mouse kappa light chain, a rat lambda light chain, a mouse IgG2a heavy chain and  a  rat  IgG2b  heavy  chain.  In  addition  to  the  mouse  and  rat  Fab  fragments  enabling  bispecific binding to human EpCAM and human CD3 receptors, respectively, the hybrid Fc region provides a third  functional  binding  site  which  preferentially  binds  the  activating  receptors  FcγRI  (CD64), FcγRIIA and FcγRIII (CD16) (see figure 1 below).

<!-- image -->

Binding of catumaxomab to EpCAM-positive tumour cells, T cells and accessory cells results in a simultaneous recruitment and activation of different types of immune effector cells at the tumour cell site.  The  tumour  cells  and  immune  effector  cells  are  brought  into  close  proximity,  and  a  complex 'crosstalk' between T cell and accessory cell can occur, which includes cytokines and co-stimulatory signalling necessary for a physiological T cell activation cascade resulting in killing of tumour cell. Since  EpCAM  is  overexpressed  in  the  vast  majority  of  all  epithelial  tumours,  catumaxomab  is expected to be effective across a variety of epithelial tumours.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Catumaxomab  is  formulated  in  a  0.1 M  sodium  citrate  buffer  solution  (pH  5.6)  containing  0.02% polysorbate  80.  Catumaxomab  is  provided  as  a  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  in  prefilled syringe. The product is presented in two different presentations, with the same formulation, containing a  10 µg  and  a  50 µg  dose  of  catumaxomab  at  100 µg/mL  in  pre-filled  1  mL  glass  syringes  with  a nominal volume of 100 µl and 500 µl, respectively.

The concentrate is diluted in sterile isotonic saline solution (0.9%) and administered to the patient by intraperitoneal infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Active Substance

Catumaxomab  is  the  active  substance  of  Removab.  Catumaxomab  is  a  trifunctional  antibody consisting of a mouse kappa light chain (220 aa), a rat lambda light chain (215 aa), a mouse IgG2a heavy chain (450 aa) and a rat IgG2b heavy chain (451 aa). Mouse IgG2a and rat IgG2b represent highly homologous IgG subclasses.

Catumaxomab has three different binding sites:

- the rat Fab fragment binding to human CD3
- the mouse Fab fragment binding to human EpCAM
- the hybrid Fc-region binding to Fcγ receptor-type I (CD64), -type IIa and -type III (CD16) positive accessory cells.
- Manufacture

The  drug  substance  is  manufactured  according  to  Good  Manufacturing  Practice  (GMP)  at  Trion Pharma GmBH facilities in Munich (DE).

Catumaxumab is  produced  by  fermentation  in  a  rat/mouse  hybrid  hybridoma  (quadroma)  cell  line. The quadroma cell line was obtained by the fusion of two parental cell lines: a hybridoma cell line which expressed anti-human EPCAM antibody and a hybridoma cell line producing anti-human CD3 antibody.

The manufacturing process of the drug substance is well defined. In-process controls and in-process parameters are based on experience gained during development of the manufacturing process and are in general considered appropriate.

A MCB was produced by cell culture of a selected single clone. The establishment, characterization and  control  of  the  Master  Cell  Bank  were  described  and  are  adequate.  A  strategy  for  providing  a continuous  supply  of  cells  by  producing  a  new  Working  Cell  Bank  on  a  regular  basis  has  been described. The genetic stability of the sequences of catumaxomab encoding cDNA of the cell banks was appropriately demonstrated. The manufacturing process starts with the culture and expansion of a single vial of WCB. The medium containing the antibodies is filtered to remove any cells and purified by two chromatographic steps: a protein  A  chromatography  and  a  cation-exchange.  The  eluate  is  diafiltered  and  nanofiltered  to exchange buffers and to adjust protein concentration. The active pharmaceutical ingredient is formulated by dilution with 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.6 to a final target concentration 100 µg/mL of catumaxomab and addition of 0.02% polysorbate 80. Materials  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  are  adequately  controlled.  Apart  from  the  WCB,  no materials of primary animal origin are used. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Validation studies presented demonstrate clearance of process related impurities and consistency of the drug substance manufacturing process.

## Manufacturing process development and validation

Process development involves the use of 4 different processes. During process development, process changes including the introduction of serum free fermentation process, changes in the nanofiltration/diafiltration membranes and chromatographic steps as consequence of the up-scale.

Pivotal studies were performed using process II. The comparability package showing comparability with the proposed  commercial  process (advanced  III)  was  updated  with  appropriate additional  data during the procedure and found to be acceptable for the proposed commercial scale.

## Characterisation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  thorough characterisation program for catumaxomab  has been performed to address the physicochemical and biological properties of the product and to evaluate the impurity and heterogeneity profiles.

## A) Physicochemical characterisation

The primary, secondary and tertiary structures of catumaxomab were analysed by various techniques.

## The complete amino acid sequence of catumaxomab was determined.

The  different  isoforms  of  catumaxomab  were  characterized  with  respect  to  origin  and  biological activity.

The isoforms isolated present equal biological activities in the activity assay and appear at the same levels in the characterisation batches of catumaxomab tested. Deamidation is expected to be the root cause of the isoform distribution in catumaxomab, however this has not been possible to conclude up to now. The applicant has demonstrated control of mismatched variants during production.

Characterisation  of  glycosylation  indicated  that  catumaxomab  is  N-glycosylated.  No  sialylated structures were detected.

The secondary and tertiary structure of catumaxomab was analysed. All the structural features are in agreement with that expected of an IgG molecule.

## A2) Biological activity

Biological  activity  of  catumaxomab  was  analysed.  A  dose  response  relation  of  both  (EpCAM  and CD3) binding specificities has been demonstrated. The Applicant has provided data showing that the activity assay is specific for catumaxomab.

## B) Impurities

## Product related impurities.

The Applicant has provided data documenting the clearance of product related impurities at different steps during the manufacturing process of catumaxomab.

## Process related impurities.

The applicant has demonstrated in the process validation the reduction of process related impurities  to an acceptable level in the drug substance. The clearance of product related impurities was consistent.

- Specification

The specifications for the drug substance have been adequately justified and are acceptable and batch results  demonstrate  consistency.  The  methods  were  appropriately  validated  and  in  compliance  with pharmacopoeial requirements when applicable.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

For  the  control  of  the  active  substance,  the  list  of  specifications  has  been  updated  during  the procedure. The proposed initial limits for the potency assay were considered too wide since the drug requires a careful escalating dosing regimen. During the procedure they have been slightly tightened but should be further evaluated after an appropriate amount of batches . The company commits to reevaluate  the  approved  limits  of  the  potency  method  after  the  manufacture  of  5,  10,  15  batches  of catumaxomab.

## · Stability

Catumaxomab is stored in flexible bags and the claimed stability is 6 months at 2-8 o C.

During the procedure, the applicant provided additional data on real time real conditions to show that catumaxomab DS is stable over the claimed period. It was recommended that the company performs an  evaporation  study  of  the  formulation  buffer  within  flexible  bags  using  conditions  actually encountered during production. The company has provided the protocol and a commitment to perform the evaluation study and to report the results at the end of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medicinal Product

Removab is intended to be marketed in two presentations of drug product, corresponding to a 10 µg and a 50 µg dose of catumaxomab, respectively. They are supplied in pre-filled 1 mL glass syringes containing a nominal value of 100 µL and 500 µL, respectively.

Catumaxomab 100 µg/mL is supplied as a concentrate for solution for infusion. The concentrate is diluted in sterile isotonic saline solution. The infusion set are standard medical items for parental use and are not part of the drug product presentation.

Removab  is  formulated  in  a  0.1  M  sodium  citrate  buffer  solution  (pH  5.6)  containing  0.02% polysorbate 80.

The container closure system consists of a siliconised glass barrel, a siliconised plunger stopper, and a closure system composed of a siliconised tip cap, a luer lock and a tamper-evident seal. The syringes are  filled  with  an  appropriate  overfill  which  is  justified  to  ensure  the  withdrawal  of  the  nominal volume.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  drug  product  formulation  is  the  same  as  the  drug  substance  formulation  and  has  been  fully described and justified. The different catumaxomab drug products used during clinical development have been described. The differences relate primarily to the primary packaging materials, the sterile filtration conditions and the fill volume for the filling process.

<!-- image -->

The  Applicant  has  provided  information  on  losses  of  catumaxomab  with  infusion  systems  and  the compatibility of catumaxomab with different tested infusion materials (catheters, perfusion tubings, perfusion  syringes,  and  infusion  valves/Y-connections).  A  consistent  dose  delivery  is  considered assured.

## · Manufacture of the Product

Catumaxomab drug product is formulated at the drug substance stage and the manufacturing process for  the  bulk  medicinal  product  thus  consists  of  only  two  main  steps:  sterile  in-line  filtration  of  the formulated drug substance solution followed by filling and stoppering of the syringes.

The manufacturing process together with the IPC has been sufficiently described. Critical steps have been  defined  and  are  adequately  controlled.  Validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  has  been provided.

## · Product Specification

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The specifications for the drug product have been adequately justified and are acceptable and batch results  demonstrate  consistency.  The  methods  were  appropriately  validated  and  in  compliance  with pharmacopoeial requirements when applicable.

## · Stability of the Product

The stability data has been provided to cover 18 months of storage for two batches and 15 months for a third batch and the results show a good stability for the product at storage conditions protected from light. A shelf life of 18 months when stored at 5 C is acceptable, provided a commitment is given to submit the 18 month data for batch 101I02 within an agreed time frame.

## · Adventitious Agents

The cell line was characterized according to the ICH Q5A requirements for microbial contamination, the presence of retroviruses, and contamination with adventitious viruses.  Results were typical for a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

murine hybridoma cell line and confirmed that the cell line is suitable. Cell line testing was confirmed by testing of PPCB.

Adventitious viruses were not detected by in-vitro and in-vivo assays and also the extensive testing of MCB and PPCB cells as well as unprocessed bulk provided no evidence of contamination with bovine viruses.  In  addition,  MCB  and  PPCB  cells  were  tested  for  the  presence  of  BPyV  (bovine  polyoma DNA) with negative result.

The  virus  validation  studies  and  the  risk  analysis  have  shown  that  the  manufacturing  process  of Catumaxomab contains four steps of removal/inactivation of enveloped viruses. Two of these steps are also effective for removal of non-enveloped viruses. The different manufacturing steps complement each other in the mode of action of removal/inactivation. The data demonstrate that the virus safety of Catumaxomab meets the pre-specified requirement.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Overall, information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important quality characteristics.

At the time of the opinion, there were some minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and  committed  to resolve them after the opinion within an agreed timeframe.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical programme was adapted to the fact that catumaxomab is a protein, and its binding properties are essentially specific for humans.

The pharmacokinetic studies did not fully comply with principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The remaining studies were conducted in accordance with GLP.

The most notable consequence of the inability to find a relevant species is that the present application does not contain repeated dose toxicology studies of catumaxomab. A number of other pharmacokinetic and safety studies are also not included, which is common for biological substances.

## Pharmacology

Catumaxomab (or TPBs01) is an intact trifunctional bispecific monoclonal antibody produced from rat/mouse hybrid-hybridoma cells. This antibody possesses three different binding sites: 1) The rat Fab fragment targets human cluster of differentiation CD3, expressed on T-lymphocytes, 2) the mouse Fab fragment  is  directed  against  the  human  epithelial  cell  adhesion  molecule  (EpCAM),  a  tumourassociated antigen that is expressed on most adenocarcinomas and 3) The hybrid Fc region provides a third functional binding site, which is able to selectively bind and activate Fc γ receptors.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

EpCAM (also known as ESA or EGP-2) is a transmembrane 40-kDa glycoprotein that is encoded by the GA733-2 gene. It mediates Ca 2+ -independent homotypic cell-cell adhesions. In human, EpCAM is expressed only in epithelium and neoplasias derived from epithelia (Balzar et al., 1999). EpCAM is strongly expressed  in carcinomas  of  various origins including colon, rectum, prostate, liver, oesophagus, lung, pancreas, breast, head and neck (Went et al., 2004). A differential attachment of sugar residues to the extracellular moiety of EpCAM was observed in healthy versus tumour tissues (Pauli  et  al.,  2003).  The  intracellular  part  is  responsible  for  the  signalling  properties  of  EpCAM including the induction of cell proliferation and the upregulation of the proto-oncogene c-Myc (Munz, 2004).

The  interaction  of  different  immune  effector  cells  at  the  tumour  site  is  postulated  to  result  in elimination of tumour cells by several killing mechanisms:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -T-cell-mediated lysis through perforin or granzyme B-driven mechanisms
- -Cytotoxicity by released cytokines, such as TNFα and IFNγ
- -Phagocytosis via activation of Fc γ R I and III positive accessory cells
- -Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity following activation of Fc γ R I, IIa and III positive accessory cells

A  targeted non-clinical testing strategy was developed to obtain relevant information from scientifically justified pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological model systems.

- -In vitro effects  of  catumaxomab  were  assessed  in  models  using  human  cells  where catumaxomab is able to exert its full pharmacological activity.
- -A surrogate  antibody  (BiLu),  which is  of  equivalent  structure  to  catumaxomab  and  has  the same principal target specificity but binds to mouse CD3 instead of human CD3, was used for pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies in mouse models.
- Primary pharmacodynamics

The  primary  pharmacology  studies  have  assessed  the  trifunctional  mechanism  of  action.  In  these studies binding, T-cell activation, and the importance of T-cells and FcγR-positive accessory cells in anti-tumour activity was demonstrated.

## In vitro

## Specificity of binding of catumaxomab to CD3 and EpCAM ()

Human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMC)  from  healthy  donors  were  incubated  with catumaxomab  and  a  commercially  available  anti-CD3  antibody.  Binding  was  analyzed  by fluorescence  activated  cell  sorter  (FACS).  EpCAM  binding  experiments  were  performed  with  an EpCAM-positive colon cancer cell line, and an EpCAM-specific antibody.

## Determination of the antibody binding site on EpCAM ()

Mutants  of  EpCAM  were  generated  and  expressed  in  a  human  cell  line  in  order  to  determine  the binding site on EpCAM.

Binding properties of catumaxomab to various human tumour cell lines. Anti-tumour activity against human tumour cells from different tissue .

Binding to lymphocytes was assessed using PBMC from healthy donors, which were incubated with various  concentrations  of  catumaxomab  or  parental  antibody  (anti-CD3).  Bound  catumaxomab  and bound parental antibody were analyzed by FACS. There was similar binding of catumaxomab (antiEpCAM x anti-CD3) and the parental anti-CD3 antibody to T-cells.

The antitumour efficacy correlated to the binding efficacy.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Replacing catumaxomab with the parental antibody which binds to EpCAM only (no CD3 binding) did not result in antitumour activity. Several other studies studied the in vitro tumouricidal effects of catumaxomab.

Binding of catumaxomab to human Fc γ receptors of monocytes, NK cells and granulocytes.

PBMC and granulocytes were isolated from blood, and binding to Fcγ receptor was investigated on monocytes  (CD14+),  T-cells  (CD4+  or  CD8+),  B-cells  (CD19+)  and  NK  cells  (CD56+).  The different  cell  types  were  identified  by  FACS.  Additional samples of cells were co-stained  with specific  antibodies  against  CD  surface  markers  plus  the  Fcγ  receptor  I  and  Fcγ  receptor  III.  A concentration-dependent binding of catumaxomab to monocytes (CD14+), T-cells (CD4+ or CD8+), NK  cells  (CD56+)  and  granulocytes  was  observed;  there  was  only  minimal  binding  to  B-cells (CD19+). When cells were pre-incubated with an anti-CD3 antibody, the binding of catumaxomab to CD4+ and CD8+ cells  was  reduced,  suggesting  that  binding  of  catumaxomab  to  T-cells  is  mainly dependent on CD3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Binding  of  catumaxomab  to  human  mononuclear  cells  was  demonstrated.  Binding  to  Fcγ-receptor positive cells was observed although the binding varied considerably between donors..

## Activation of human T-cells by catumaxomab

Granzyme B is a protease  released  by  NK-cells  and  cytotoxic  T-cells,  which  also  release  perforin. Granzyme B and perforin enter target cells via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and cause apoptosis of these cells. Catumaxomab, in contrast to the parental anti-EpCAM antibody, induced granzyme B release by PBMC from healthy donors contributing to the catumaxomab antitumour effect.

Antibody-dependent  cellular  phagocytosis observed  that  activated  peripheral  blood  monocytes, incubated  with  catumaxomab  and  calcein-loaded  EpCAM-positive  tumour  cells,  phagocytosed  the tumour cells.

Complement-dependent cytotoxicity showed that catumaxomab induced cytotoxicity towards EpCAMpositive gastric tumour cells in the presence of complete human serum, but not in the absence of serum or in the presence of heat-inactivated serum. in study HD-Catu-201206 (not GLP) EpCAM-positive colon tumour cells were lysed as a result of complement activation in the presence of normal serum and high catumaxomab  concentrations but not in the presence of therapeutic  catumaxomab concentrations.  T-lymphocytes  were  not  lysed,  apparently  due  to  the  presence  of  membrane  bound complement regulatory proteins, since neutralisation of the latter did result in T-cell lysis.

For complement activation, C3 or C4 was added to the blood sample. No activation of complement (formation of C3a or C4a) by catumaxomab was showed after incubation with PBMC alone.

In vivo The variant antibody BiLu (anti-human EpCAM &amp; anti-mouse CD3) was used to demonstrate proof of concept  in  a  syngeneic  mouse  tumour  model  expressing  human  EpCAM.  Anti-tumour  activity  of catumaxomab was observed in a human ovarian carcinoma xenograft study. The mouse-CD3-specific antibody BiLu was more effective in a mouse tumour model (Ruf  et al., 2001). · Secondary pharmacodynamics Cytokine and histamine release in vitro) Blood  samples  from  healthy  human  donors  were  incubated  with  catumaxomab  in  the  presence  or absence of EpCAM-positive human colon tumour cells .. Catumaxomab-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines was only observed in significant amounts when catumaxomab was incubated with blood cells in the presence of EpCAM-positive tumour cells. The greatest stimulatory effect of catumaxomab was seen for TNF-α and IL-6, and a smaller stimulatory effect was seen for IL-2. Only insignificant effects were observed for IL-12 and IL-1. In all cases, the stimulation was greater after incubation  for  24 h  compared  to  2 h.  In  several  cases,  the  release  of  TNF-α,  IL-2  and  IL-6  was inversely correlated to the concentration of catumaxomab. Histamine  release  was  analysed  in  a  similar  way,  using  whole  blood  incubated  with  various concentrations of catumaxomab (but no tumour cells). No significant induction of histamine release by catumaxomab was detected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A significant induction of PBMC proliferation was observed at all catumaxomab concentrations. The induction was similar to that of the positive control. A slight induction of proliferation of the tumour cell lines Jurkat (CD3+), HCT-8 and SKBR-3 (EpCAM+) was observed in the absence of PBMC. A demonstrated proliferation induction by catumaxomab has not been observed.

BiLu application was associated with a transient decrease in CD3+ cells. However, the doses used in this study were high compared to the clinical dose.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

The safety pharmacology programme was defined by the accessibility of intact monoclonal antibodies in  vivo  to  EpCAM positive  tissue.  EpCAM in  normal tissues can be reached only  at  inflamed  and injured  sites.  An  exception  is  the  vascular  system  of  the  liver,  which  may  permit  contact  of catumaxomab  with  the  EpCAM-positive  bile  duct  cells  in  cases  of  increased  permeability  if  the antibody  enters  the  circulation  following  IP  administration.  Potential  effects  on  hepatocytes  have therefore been investigated in in vitro models.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cross-reactivity

Two GLP studies have investigated  the  potential  cross-reactivity  of  catumaxomab  and  the  parental anti-EpCAM antibody with normal human tissues.

The first study found that catumaxomab bound to the epithelia of various tissues (adenoid tissue, the urogenital  system,  the  alimentary  tract  and  mamma).  Binding  of  the  antibody  was  also  found  on lymphocytes. Results suggested that the antibody was mainly membrane bound. and a nuclear binding was not observed. In the peripheral blood in the parenchyma of the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, in the cardiac muscle, in the placenta, in the skin as well as in the skeletal muscles and in the uterus (area of the cervix) no binding of antibody could be detected.

The results of the second study were similar. In this study, comparison was made to the anti-EpCAM parent  antibody.  Binding  to  epithelium,  via  the  EpCAM  binding  arm,  with  both  antibodies  was comparable,  and  was  found  for  tissues  for  which  EpCAM  expression  has  been  described  in  the literature (Balzar et al. 1999. Went et al. 2004)

## Binding and effects on freshly harvested or cultured human hepatocytes .

There was no binding to hepatocytes and no functional impairment (albumin release, UDP formation or urea production; increases in AST and LDH were seen but considered minor). Binding to bile duct cells in liver tissue was seen, since these cells are EpCAM positive.

Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with catumaxomab and the variant antibody BiLu, which is of equivalent structure but binds to mouse CD3 instead of human CD3. Since BiLu binds specifically to mouse CD3, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice is a more relevant model for the pharmacokinetics of catumaxomab in humans.

· Pharmacodynamic drug interactions Pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  were  investigated in  vitro due  to  the  lack  of  suitable  animal models. Influence of steroids on antibody activity Cytokine release after administration of therapeutic antibodies in vivo may induce side effects, which might  be  alleviated  by  the  concomitant  use  of  anti-inflammatory  drugs.  Since  catumaxomab  was shown to increase cytokine release in vitro the influence of steroids (dexamethasone, hydrocortisone) on in vitro immune stimulation by catumaxomab was investigated.  Dexamethasone dose-dependently and markedly inhibited Removab-induced cytokine release and granzyme B release. Catumaxomabinduced tumour cell killing was inhibited by dexamethasone at all tested concentrations in conditions of  a  low  catumaxomab  concentration.  Hydrocortisone  showed  weaker  inhibition  of  cytokine  and granzyme B release and had no effect on catumaxomab-induced tumour cell killing. The influence of chemotherapeutic drugs on catumaxomab activity was studied in vitro in order to investigate potential synergistic effects. Pharmacokinetics Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Methods of analysis

ELISA methods were developed for sensitive measurement of catumaxomab (ng/mL range).

## Absorption

Intravenous pharmacokinetics of catumaxomab in male mice. The animals were treated with a bolus dose.  Blood  samples  collected  were  analysed  using  ELISA.  The  elimination  was  initially  fast,  the plasma concentration decreased during the first hours, followed by a terminal slow elimination phase Similar to the study above, using BiLu instead, which differs from catumaxomab by binding to mouse CD3 no slow terminal elimination phase was seen.

In  a  different  study  i.p.  and  i.v.  administration  of  BiLu  to  mice  were compared. The bioavailability after i.p. administration was complete.

Another s tudy investigated the effects of catumaxomab on SCID-mice intraperitoneally injected with human  EpCAM-positive  tumour  cells  in  combination  with  human  PBMC  The  amount  of  binding

No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were submitted. Other pharmacokinetic studies No other pharmacokinetic studies were submitted. Toxicology · Single dose toxicity A number of common laboratory animal species,  including  the  three  monkeys  marmoset  ( Callitrix sp.),  cynomolgus ( Macaca fascicularis )  and  rhesus  ( Macaca mulatta )  were tested  histologically  for catumaxomab binding, but none showed a binding pattern similar to that of human tissues, and were consequently considered non-relevant. In the few studies performed in rats, mice and one cynomolgus monkey, no acute toxicity was seen even at very high doses of catumaxomab. A single dose toxicology study as well as a number of other preclinical studies was performed with the antibody BiLu, which is specific for mouse CD3, in contrast to catumaxomab, which is specific for human CD3. However, both BiLu and catumaxomab are specific for human EpCAM. BiLu may thus not have similar toxicological and dynamic effects in the mouse as catumaxomab has in the human leaving the safety assessment of catumaxomab largely to the clinical studies. Effects seen with BiLu may thus not be relevant for catumaxomab. · Repeat dose toxicity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  rabbits,  i.a.  and  p.v.  application  resulted  in  a  well  defined  reversible  erythema  formation. Histopathological  mild  to  marked  subcutaneous  haemorrhages  at  the  application  site  occurred  after p.v. administration. Subcutaneous application resulted in a slight reversible erythema formation in one animal. Intramuscular administration caused no erythema or edema formation.

Administration  of  150  µg  i.p.  catumaxomab  showed  an  histopathological  moderate  subchronic inflammation of skin and abdominal muscle after administration of the test item in one animal.

In Cynomolgus monkey, no catumaxomab-related intolerance reactions were observed.

Evaluation  of  the  local  tolerance  of  the  mouse-CD3-specific  analogue  BiLu  showed  no  test  itemrelated local reactions at the injection sites in any of the treated mice. No histological findings were detected that could be attributed to an intolerability of the test item.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The application has been assessed in accordance with the current guidelines on pre-clinical evaluation of anticancer medicinal products (CPMPP/SWP/997/96)  and  pre-clinical  safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals  (ICH  S6).  Although  not  fully  complying  with  GLP,  most pharmacokinetic studies were subjected to quality assurance evaluation. The absence of many nonclinical studies is considered acceptable for an antibody, given the absence of suitable animal models.

Based on the non-clinical programme submitted, the CHMP raised the following concerns:

The CHMP requested clarifications about the binding of catumaxomab to different Fc γ receptors. In addition  to  the  data  submitted  in  the  initial  dossier  the  applicant  provided  further  studies  to  clarify binding  of  catumaxomab  to  the  high  affinity  Fcγ-receptor  I  (CD64)  and  to  the  low  affinity Fcγ-receptor  IIa  (CD32a)  and  its  inhibitory  counterpart  Fcγ-receptor  IIb  (CD32b).  The  CHMP considered that the data submitted indicates that catumaxomab binds to human Fcγ receptor I, IIa and III .

The applicant was asked to provide a critical assessment with regards to safety concerns due to T- and B-cell cross talk. Although no animal models were available to permit toxicological testing of the full

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacological activity  of  the  medicinal  product,  the  applicant  stated  that  no  significant  toxicities were found after repeated i.v. infusion of escalating doses of catumaxomab in cynomolgus monkeys, and the applicant also provided data from BiLu in mice.

Following CHMP review, the applicant was asked to investigate the binding potential of catumaxomab towards the human GA733-1 gene product, a protein with high homology to EpCAM. The applicant therefore provided data indicating that the interaction of catumaxomab with GA733-1 gene product , a protein with high homology to EpCAM is very unlikely.

In addition, the CHMP raised other concerns with regards to the non-clinical pharmacokinetic data and toxicology  data  submitted.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  elaborate  on  the  initial  rapid  elimination  of catumaxomab from the plasma of i.v.-injected mice which was surprising, including an account for the distribution  of  the  injected  material.  After  the  applicant's  responses,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the distribution  of  catumaxomab  and  the  mechanism  behind  the  rapid  elimination  of  catumaxomab remains obscure. Generally, knowledge of these topics is essential for the assessment of toxicological data.  However,  due  to  the  unavailability  of  relevant  models  for  the  toxicological  testing  of catumaxomab, further data were not requested.

The single-dose toxicity studies with BiLu indicate that catumaxomab may cause liver toxicity. The applicant was therefore asked to justify the wording of the SPC regarding potential effects on the liver toxicity. As argued by the applicant, the toxicity findings obtained with the surrogate antibody BiLu were considered of limited value. Due to the lack of a relevant animal model, safety assessment of catumaxomab mainly depend on the clinical safety assessment. Therefore, an amendment of the SPC was not considered necessary. with regards to the hepatotoxicity observed with BiLu. In addition to the concerns raised by the CHMP, the following information was included in the SPC based on the data submitted: The medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to murine (rat and/or mouse) proteins (see section 4.3) No  interaction  studies  with  other  medicinal  products  or  other  forms  of  interaction  have  been performed (see section 4.5) The medicinal product should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary,  given  that  is unknown whether catumaxomab is excreted in human breast milk: 'A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue / abstain from Removab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of  therapy for the woman' (see section 4.6) Section 5.1 of the SPC was updated to include the following text on pharmacodynamic effects: Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  anti-tumour  activity  of  catumaxomab  has  been  demonstrated  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  Effective catumaxomab-mediated killing of tumour cells in vitro was observed for target cells with low and high expression of the EpCAM antigen, independent of the primary tumour type. The in vivo anti-tumour activity of catumaxomab was confirmed in an immunologically compromised mouse model of ovarian carcinoma, where tumour development was delayed by an intraperitoneal treatment with catumaxomab and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

No  ERA  is  included  in  the  dossier,  which  is  acceptable  for  a  protein,  based  on  CHMP  guidance (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The development program for the indication treatment of malignant ascites consists of one Phase I/II dose finding study (STP-REM-01), one pharmacokinetic study (IP-REM-PK-01-EU) and one pivotal Phase II/III study (IP-REM-AC-01). The clinical program is supported by 3 additional phase I and II studies  (AGO-OVAR-2.10,  IP-REM-PC-01-DE,  IP-REM-GC-01)  which  provide  additional  safety information. A total of 270 patients were treated in all completed studies.

Scientific advice concerning the clinical development of catumaxomab was sought from the EMEA in June 2004 (see discussion on Clinical Efficacy). A follow-up scientific advice regarding modifications in the clinical development plan of catumaxomab in the indication treatment of malignant ascites was received on 30 June 2006.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

## Pharmacokinetics

Only one clinical  study  with  pharmacokinetic  data  from  11  patients  is  discussed  in  the  application (study IP-REM-PK-01-EU). Very limited pharmacokinetic data are also available from dose-finding phase I/II studies. All studies were performed in patients with malignant ascites. There are no data on catumaxomab from healthy volunteers. In study IP-REM-PK-01-EU, catumaxomab concentrations in ascites fluid as well as in plasma were evaluated.

Analysis  of  free  catumaxomab  in  plasma  and  ascites  was  made  using  a  validated  ELISA  method. Analysis of late plasma samples was confounded by the presence of anti-catumaxomab antibodies, but this  could  be  partly  overcome  by  using  an  antibody-blocking  agent  in  the  analysis  method.  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antibody-blocking  agent  was  not  used  during  analysis  of  ascites  samples,  as  there  were  no  ascites sampling after day 10 (the 4 th dose) of treatment.

- Absorption

No studies were submitted.

- Distribution

Plasma and ascites data from 11 patients receiving the proposed four doses of catumaxomab but as 6h peritoneal infusions (instead of 3h, see SPC section 6.6) were submitted.

Catumaxomab was detectable in plasma in 10 of 11 patients after the 3 rd and 4 th peritoneal infusions (50 µg  and  150  µg).  The  mean  plasma  exposure  over  the  total  treatment  period  (AUC0-tlast )  was 3.7 ng*day/mL (range 0 to 13.4 ng*day/mL). The mean Cmax in plasma was 0.76 ng/ml (range 0 to 2.3 ng/ml).

In ascites, only predose (Ctrough)  concentrations of free catumaxomab were measured, and only until before the fourth infusion. Predose catumaxomab concentrations in ascites varied considerably from 0.27 to 39.9 ng/ml.

- Elimination

No studies were submitted.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No studies were submitted.

- Special populations

No studies were submitted.

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No studies were submitted.

- Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No studies were submitted.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Mechanism of action

No studies were submitted.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

For  the  investigation  of  the  pharmacodynamics  of  catumaxomab  a  large  number  of  tentative  PD biomarkers have been measured across studies. These included measurements of EpCAM +/- tumour cell  load  in  ascites  fluid,  measurement  of  leukocyte  load  in  ascites  fluid  and  surface  expression  of activation markers, measurement of tumour cell/leukocyte ratio in ascites fluid (EpCAM+/CD45+ cell ratio), systemic cytokine production, in vitro clonogenic and proliferation assays for tumour cells and leukocytes isolated from ascites fluid and determination of anti drug antibody (ADA) titers [Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA) and Human Anti-Rat Antibodies (HARA)]

Tumour load in ascites fluid was also studied in the pivotal trial IP-REM-AC-01 (data not shown).

No  secondary  pharmacology  studies  were  performed in  vivo .  Systemic  cytokine  production  was analysed in all studies. In the pharmacokinetic study (study IP-REM-PK-01-EU), a clear trend towards increasing values (although variable) shortly after infusions were detected for IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ, while values for IL-2 and IL-4 were only slightly increased and TNFα was largely unchanged.

In  the  pivotal  study  (IP-REM-AC-01),  IL6  was  measured  in  serum  before  and  after  catumaxomab infusion. In patients the IL-6 concentration in serum (catumaxomab group only) increased at 24 hours after each infusion, and returned to the baseline value before the next infusion and at Visit 6 (8 days after last infusion). The most pronounced increase occurred after the first infusion.

In another study (STP-REM-01) both IL-6 and TNF-α were measured. At baseline, 17 patients (74%) had normal serum levels of IL-6 and TNFα , while 6 patients (26%) had values above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for both cytokines. The proportion of patients with elevated IL-6 values increased from 26% to about 80% on the days after infusion and decreased to almost baseline values before the next infusion. The proportion of patients with elevated TNFα values on the infusion days was about 60%. The tendency to shift back to normal values decreased with the number of infusions.

The safety pharmacology program was limited to in vitro binding of catumaxomab to human tissues. As  some  catumaxomab  will  leak  to  the  blood  through  tumour  vasculature,  systemic  exposure  will occur.  Therefore  potential  effects  on  hepatocytes  derived  from  biopsies  were  investigated  (with parental EpCAM-antibody HO-3) without significant binding of catumaxomab. However, in a second

in vitro binding study in human liver tissue there was significant binding to bile duct cells. A selection of human tissues which have a potential to cross-react with catumaxomab is presented below.

## Immunogenicity

Across studies  the  development  of  HAMA  was  observed  within  days  or  weeks  after  the  treatment period  in  the  majority  of  treated  patients.  In  most  patients,  anti-catumaxomab  antibodies  were  not detectable in plasma until some time after the last infusion. However, in a small proportion of patients anti-catumaxomab antibodies were detectable in plasma before the 4 th infusion (data not shown).

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology aspects

It is difficult to draw conclusions regarding concentrations of free catumaxomab in ascites during the treatment period. Only Ctrough values were measured, and only until before the 4 th dose. Concentrations after  the  fourth  infusion  are  likely  much  higher.  The  detected  free  concentrations  varied  more  than 100-fold and the analysis might be confounded by the presence of anti-drug antibodies, which might decrease  the  actual  catumaxomab  free  concentration  by  binding  catumaxomab  and  increasing  its elimination.  On  the  other  hand,  anti-drug  antibodies  might  have  confounded  the  analysis  method, leading  to  falsely  high  concentrations.  However,  there  was  no  analysis  of  presence  of  anticatumaxomab antibodies in ascites. The variability in free catumaxomab concentrations in ascites fluid might be due e.g. to different amounts of tumour and immune effector cells that bind catumaxomab, to variable  amounts  of  ascites  fluid  at  sampling,  and  possibly  to  variable  anti-catumaxomab  antibody titres.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are no studies on absorption, distribution, and elimination mechanisms or studies investigating intrinsic  factors  and  special  populations.  The  variability  in  plasma  concentrations  introduced  by disease  factors  is  likely  largely  overweighing  any  variability  due  to  intrinsic  factors  such  as  age, gender or race.

There are no pharmacokinetic interaction studies, which are considered acceptable for an antibody.

Proof of principle of primary pharmacodynamics in vivo in cancer patients has not been convincingly established. One of the problems is the lack of evaluable target lesions in the clinical studies presented. Although leukocyte activation markers and cytokine release can be documented in vitro using human malignant ascites (long term clonogenic assays) and in vivo (measuring cytokines in plasma, cytokine release symptoms), sampling methods for measurement of decrease of tumour load is flawed by the mode  of  catumaxomab  administration  (repeated  lavage  and  possible  dilution)  and  by  the  fact  that catumaxomab can alter the proportion of leukocytes by stimulation of proliferation.

Despite the claimed interaction of catumaxomab exclusively with abnormal tissue, systemic exposure and interaction with EpCAM positive normal tissues is possible and constitutes another concern. Only very  little  data  is  at  hand  regarding  the  magnitude  of  systemic  exposure  following  intraperitoneal administration. Certain reported adverse events (such as hepatotoxicity, cholangitis, see clinical safety results) could result from binding of catumaxomab to relevant tissues.

The variability between subjects was high. The geometric mean plasma Cmax was approximately 0.5 ng/ml (range 0 to 2.3), and the geometric mean plasma AUC was approximately 1.7 day* ng/ml (range &lt; LLOQ  (lower  limit  of  quantification)  to  13.5).  The  geometric  mean  apparent  terminal  plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2) was approximately 2.5 days (range 0.7 to 17).

The cytokine release stimulation of catumaxomab on effector cells constitutes a safety concern. The data presented provide support to some of the manifested adverse events reported in the clinical trials (symptoms of cytokine release, see clinical safety results). Moreover, cytokines as well as EpCAMbinding to bile ducts may cause hepatotoxicity. TNFα tended to accumulate with increasing number of infusions,  which  is  the  same  pattern  as  for  liver  enzyme  elevations  in  the  pivotal  clinical  trial. Therefore,  section  4.5  of  the  SPC  was  updated  to  include  more  information  on  this  warning  (see clinical safety discussion) Catumaxomab  is  a  rodent  hybrid  monoclonal  antibody  and  the  development  of  neutralizing HAMA/HARA antibodies  is  expected.  This  was  confirmed  in  several  studies  by  identification  of neutralizing  antibodies  in  plasma,  in  some  patients  already  before  the  last  dose.  The  applicant committed to evaluate more patients in a planned phase IIIb clinical study in order to gain additional data on HAMA/HARA positive patients receiving catumaxomab treatment and toxicity. Summary of safety  concerns  and  planned  pharmacovigilance actions of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) were revised accordingly. Based  on  the  clinical  pharmacology  data  submitted,  the  CHMP  updated  section  5.2  of  the  SPC  as follows: Pharmacokinetics of catumaxomab during and after four intraperitoneal infusions of 10, 20, 50 and 150 microgram catumaxomab were investigated in 13 patients with symptomatic malignant ascites due to EpCAM positive carcinomas. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Catumaxomab was detectable in the ascites fluid and in plasma. The concentrations increased with the number  of  infusions  and  the  doses  applied  in  most  patients.  Plasma  levels  tended  to  decline  after achieving a maximum after each dose.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy claim is primarily based on data from one pivotal Phase II/III clinical study (Study IPREM-AC-01) investigating patients with malignant ascites due to epithelial cancers. This was the only controlled  study  in  which  treatment  with  catumaxomab  was  compared  to  the  current  standard treatment with paracentesis alone.

In addition, data supporting the efficacy claim are provided from the following studies:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Phase I/II, dose finding study (Study STP-REM-01) and a Phase II pharmacokinetic (PK) study (Study IP-REM-PK-01-EU) in the same indication supporting the results from the pivotal study.

## STP-REM-01

This  Phase  I/II,  multi-center,  dose-escalation  study  with  up  to  5  i.p.  infusions  of  catumaxomab established  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  in  patients  with  malignant  ascites  due  to ovarian carcinoma  and  investigated  the  safety,  tolerability  and  preliminary  efficacy  of  catumaxomab.  Each infusion lasted 6 h. Overall, 23 patients were treated.

The  actual  doses  the  patients  received  in  each  dose  groups  until  the  MTD  was  reached  were  as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Maximum tolerated dose: Two dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in Dose Group V (1 Grade 3 large bowel obstruction after a dose of 200 µg and 1 Grade 4 increase in gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT] after a dose of 50 µg). Therefore, the dose steering board decided that the MTD was reached in Dose Group V at 10-20-50- 200-200 µg of catumaxomab. Study IP-REM-PK-01\\_EU This Phase II, multi-center, open-label PK study in male and female patients with malignant ascites due to epithelial cancers requiring therapeutic ascites puncture was designed to determine the systemic exposure  during  and  after  4  i.p.  infusions  with  increasing  doses  and  to  characterize  the  PK  of catumaxomab  after  i.p.  administration  (four  6-hour  constant-rate  i.p.  infusions  of  catumaxomab  at escalating doses of 10, 20, 50, and 150 µ g) and to obtain further safety and efficacy data. A total of 13 patients received catumaxomab in this study. Study AGO-OVAR-2.10 This  Phase IIa,  multi-center,  randomized,  open-label,  2-dose-level  study  was  designed  to  select  a better  dose  level  of  catumaxomab  based  on  the  overall  response  rate  (complete  response  [CR]  or partial  response  [PR])  according  RECIST  administered  by  i.p.  infusion  to  ovarian  cancer  patients refractory to platinum-based chemotherapy. A total of 41 patients were treated with catumaxomab in this study. Escalating doses of catumaxomab (10-20-50-100 µg) were associated with higher anti-tumour activity without  compromising  the  safety  profile  when  compared  to  the  low-dose  constant  treatment  group (10-10-10-10 µg). The overall response rate in the escalation treatment group was 4.6 % (one patient with a partial response) vs. 0.0% in the low-dose constant treatment group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based on the results of the dose response studies the Applicant chose the following dosing scheme: Day 0: 10 µg, Day 3: 20 µg, Day 7: 50 µg, Day 10: 150 µg. The intervals between doses (Day 0, 3, 7 and 10) were chosen to allow for sufficient recovery of the patients from symptoms and laboratory abnormalities following each infusion, as intraperitoneal administration of catumaxomab is associated with symptoms attributed to cytokine release.

## · Main study

The main study (IP-REM-AC-01) conducted to support the claim was a randomized open-label phase II/III study.  The  treatment  arms  included  catumaxomab  as  add-on  to  two  peritoneal  ascites paracenteses (drainage to dryness) performed  before and after completion of dose escalation schedule over a period of 11 days (active arm) versus only one ascites paracentesis (drainage to dryness) in the control arm. The treatment period in the active arm could at the most be extended to 21 days, but not longer.

## METHODS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ovarian cancer patients were recruited at 53 centres (municipal and university hospitals specializing in gynaecology and/or oncology) in 11 countries in Eastern and Western Europe, as well as the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

Non-ovarian  cancer  patients  were  recruited  at  70  centres  (municipal  and  university  hospitals, specializing  in  oncology)  in  11  countries  in  Eastern  and  Western  Europe,  as  well  as  the  Russian Federation  and  Ukraine.

## Treatments

In the catumaxomab-group patients were premedicated with 1000 mg paracetamol 30 minutes before each  infusion.  After  the  ascites  fluid  was  discharged  before  each  infusion,  the  patients  in  the catumaxomab group received 4 infusions of catumaxomab via an indwelling i.p. catheter. as follows: 10 µg on Day 0, 20 µg on Day 3, 50 µg on Day 7, and 150 µg on Day 10, in a total volume of 750-800 ml.  Before  the  first  infusion  (Day  0),  and  after  the  last  infusion  (Day  10)  drainage  to  dryness  was performed in the catumaxomab-group. Dose reductions were not permitted. The infusion time was 6 hours at constant rate. Patients in the catumaxomab group were hospitalized for 24 hours on the days of infusion. The treatment period was not to exceed 21 days.

The  control  group  was  treated  by  paracentesis  only  (drainage  to  dryness).  However,  an  optional single-arm  cross-over  period  was  added  to  enable  patients  in  the  control  group  to  be  treated  with catumaxomab  after  the  end  of  their  participation  in  the  randomized  part  of  the  study.  Before  the patients were permitted to continue to the single-arm cross-over period, they were required to have had 1 (Amendment 1) or 2 (Amendment 2) protocol-conforming therapeutic ascites punctures after Day 0.

Premedication  with  antihistamines  or  corticosteroids  was  prohibited.  All  concomitant  medications were continued throughout the study at a conventional dose and schedule. Maintenance anti-hormonal treatment was permitted before and during catumaxomab treatment, if it had been initiated for at least 3 months before first infusion. Local radiation of bone metastases was permitted throughout the study.

In case of adverse events suggested rescue medication was restricted to bronchodilators (inhaled β2 sympaticomimetics, theofyllamine IV), paracetamol or metamizol IV and antihistamines. Administration of other medications to treat AEs depending on symptoms, was left to the investigators discretion. Corticosteroids were not mentioned.

## Objectives

The objective was to demonstrate the superiority of a treatment with paracentesis plus catumaxomab over a treatment with paracentesis alone.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was puncture-free survival. For its definition, an event was defined as (need for) therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever occurred first. The rationale for the use of the word 'need for' was that therapeutic puncture was performed only when it was deemed necessary as objectively as possible. For the purposes of the endpoint, time to the actual puncture was used.

For patients in the catumaxomab group, puncture-free survival was defined as the time after drainage to dryness following the last infusion (planned on Day 11, 1 day after the last infusion) until the first need for therapeutic puncture or death, whichever occurred first. For patients in the control group puncture-free  survival  was  defined  as  the  corresponding  time  after  the  therapeutic  ascites puncture on Day 0.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

T0: Time from last puncture before screening until screening puncture. T1: Time during randomized part from clock start to first therapeutic puncture for all patients who had a puncture. T2: The same time as in T1 but only for patients who had at least 1 post-study puncture. T3:  { For  catumaxomab  and  controls  without  cross-over:  Time  from  first  therapeutic puncture in the randomized part of the study to first puncture in the post-study. For cross-over: Time after first therapeutic puncture in cross-over to first therapeutic puncture at post-cross-over. T4: Time between first and second puncture at post-study. Secondary endpoints measured included: -Overall survival, defined as time from randomization until death. -Progression-free  survival,  defined  as  time  from  randomisation  to  disease  progression  or  death (whichever occurred first). -Tumour response according to RECIST for patients with measurable disease -Assessment of ascites signs and symptoms Medicinal product no longer authorised

Moreover,  secondary/additional  endpoints  included  the  following  (results  are  not  shown  in  this report): time to first/next need of therapeutic ascites puncture, time to death without therapeutic ascites puncture, time to progression, body weight and abdominal girth, volume of collected/calculated ascites fluid, total protein concentration in ascites collected during therapeutic ascites punctures, tumour cell load  in  ascites  fluid,  tumour  markers,  quality  of  life,  number  of  ascites  punctures,  anti  cancer medications.

Overall  survival  (and  time  to  progression)  was  analyzed  using  2  approaches.  These  approaches differed in the handling of the corresponding events either as events or censored observations at the time of cross-over.

Progression-free Survival was only analysed in the randomised part of the study.

Pooled analyses for the ovarian and non-ovarian cancer strata were performed for selected efficacy parameters (puncture-free survival, time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture, time to death without therapeutic ascites puncture, overall survival, and time to progression).

## Sample size

Based on the original assumptions, a total of 108 patients (catumaxomab: 72, control: 36) had to be randomized in each of the ovarian and non-ovarian cancer subgroups to achieve a power of 90% in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

detecting  at  least  a  doubling  of  puncture  free  survival  between  catumaxomab  and  control,  after rounding up to allow an appropriate block size.

According to the procedures in the protocol, when a total of 148 patients (ovarian and non-ovarian) were randomized, the proportion of patients censored for the primary variable prior to Month 7 was determined among all patients who at this time had undergone a therapeutic ascites puncture, had died, had terminated the study prematurely or had completed the study after 7 months without therapeutic ascites puncture. This was done separately within the 2 cancer groups

## Randomisation

Patients were allocated by central randomization, 2:1 ratio (catumaxomab: control) stratified by cancer entity (ovarian versus non-ovarian) and country.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label trial.

## Statistical methods

<!-- image -->

In  the  ovarian  cancer  group,  five  (5.9%)  of  the  patients  assigned  to  catumaxomab  did  not  receive treatment (4 patients withdrawal of consent, 1 patient not able to perform paracentesis). In the nonovarian  group,  eight  (9.4%)  of  the  patients  assigned  to  catumaxomab  did  not  receive  treatment  (4 patients died, 3 patients because of SAE and 1 patient not eligible).

The sample size readjustment (see sample size) resulted in a sample size adjustment of total of 126 ovarian cancer patients (catumaxomab:  84,  control: 42) and 120 non-ovarian cancer patients (catumaxomab: 80, control: 40) to be randomized.

## Recruitment

The pivotal study included the first patients in both ovarian and non-ovarian cohorts on September 6, 2004.  The  accrual  of  non-ovarian  cancer  patients  was  slower  and  therefore  the  number  of  centres

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recruiting  those  patients  was  increased.  Also,  because  of  different  completion  dates  two  separate reports were to be prepared for the two cancer categories and the sponsor instigated recruitment of gastric  cancer  patients  only  to  the  non-ovarian  cancer  group  (In  amendment  4-1,  May  2006.)  The ovarian cancer study was completed on September 29, 2006 and the non-ovarian study on November 3, 2006.

## Conduct of the study

During  the  study  five  amendments  with  90  changes  of  study  conduct,  statistics  and  accrual  were implemented.

Most major protocol violations concerned administration of fewer than 3 catumaxomab infusions (13 patients in the ovarian cancer stratum and 17 patients in the non-ovarian cancer stratum). These were dealt with in the sensitivity analyses.

## Baseline data

Statistical  tests  of  key  baseline  characteristics  indicated  that  randomization  resulted  in  balanced treatment groups as all p-values were &gt;0.05.

Most  patients  were  enrolled  after  Amendment  2.  For  the  ovarian  cancer  group,  27  patients  were included before the implementation of Amendment 2 (20 catumaxomab, 7 control) and 107 thereafter (65  catumaxomab, 37 control).  For the non-ovarian  cancer  group,  28  patients  were  enrolled  before Amendment 2 (18 catumaxomab, 10 control) and 101 thereafter (67 catumaxomab, 34 control).

A total of 465 patients were screened for EpCAM-positivity. The threshold for positivity was set at 400 EpCAM-positive cells/10 6 cells.

Concerning  baseline  disease  characteristics,  in  the  ovarian  cancer  stratum  &gt;  80%  of  the  patient population  had  FIGO-stageing  IIIc  or  IV.  Over  half  of  the  patients  had  experienced  one  previous paracentesis (56.6%) and one fifth (20.2%) had experienced two previous paracenteses at screening.

In general the gastric cancer subpopulation had a worse TNM classification than the other non-ovarian subpopulations. For gastric cancer patients 60.9% in the catumaxomab group and 78.9% in the control group  had  distant metastases. For the non-gastric non-ovarian  cancer  patients 64.5%  in  the catumaxomab group and 40.9% of the patients in the control group had distant metastases.

Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint: puncture-free survival

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In all analysis groups, puncture-free survival was significantly longer (p&lt;0.0001) in the catumaxomab group compared to the control group (Figure 9, Table 9). In the pooled analysis, the median difference between the groups was 35 days (95% CI: 25; 45). For ovarian cancer patients, the median difference between the groups was 41 days (95% CI: 32; 50) and for all non-ovarian cancer patients 23 days (95% CI: 8; 38) (Figure 4).

## Progression-free survival

No pooled analysis was carried out for this efficacy parameter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For  ovarian  cancer  patients,  the  median  progression-free  survival  was  significantly  longer  in  the catumaxomab  group  than  in  the  control  group  (p&lt;0.0001).  For  all  non-ovarian  cancer  patients,  no statistically significant difference was observed.

## Tumour response rate

No pooled analysis was carried out for this efficacy parameter.

For  ovarian  cancer  patients  and  non-ovarian  cancer  patients,  results  on  tumour  response  rates according to RECIST were inconclusive due to low number of patients with measurable disease and the short time of follow up in the control group

n (%): number and percentage of patients with a given assessment of none, N: number of patients per treatment group. Note: Data are sorted by p-values for ovarian cancer patients.

a p-value  refers  to  overall  categorization  of  signs/symptoms  by  severity  ('missing',  'none',  'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe') by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel row mean scores test.

## Ancillary analyses

Due  to  concerns  with  the  censoring  of  events  (deaths  and  progressions)  in  the  planned  2-group survival analysis, a number of sensitivity analyses were performed upon request by the CHMP (data not shown).

## Additional variables to objectify the need for therapeutic ascites puncture

As  the  need  to  perform  a  therapeutic  ascites  puncture  (based  on  ascites  signs  and  symptoms assessment and ascites volume estimated via CT) might be subjective due to the open-label design, ascites  volume  was  estimated  by  local  radiologists  from  CT  scans  and  by  central  blinded  CT  scan readers and collected ascites volumes were measured.

Based on these data the  following  analyses  were  performed:  correlation  analysis  of  ascites  volume collected at puncture and time to puncture, comparison between ascites volume estimated by the local radiologist and the volume calculated by the blinded reader, comparison of adherence to schedule for assessment of burden of ascites in the pooled population based on the presence of collected clinical and radiological data and, finally,    comparison  of  number  of  punctures  within and  outside the  visit schedule (data not shown).

## Study STP-REM-01

This  Phase  I/II,  multi-center,  dose-escalation  study  with  up  to  5  i.p.  infusions  of  catumaxomab established  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  in  patients  with  malignant  ascites  due  to  ovarian carcinoma  and  investigated  the  safety,  tolerability  and  preliminary  efficacy  of  catumaxomab.  Each infusion lasted 6 h. Overall, 23 patients were treated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ascites flow rate: The ascites flow rate showed a decrease by 52 mL/h from a median of 105 mL/h at baseline to a median of 23 mL/h on Day 1 after the fourth infusion. Necessity of peritoneal puncture: From the last infusion until the last individual visit (28 ± 4 days after start of last infusion), only 1 of 23 patients  needed  a  peritoneal  puncture.  Tumour  cell  load:  Tumour  cell  elimination  in  the  ascites occurred rapidly (Figure 7). The mean value of epithelial tumour cells was reduced from 539 per 10 6 screened cells before treatment to 39 per 10 6 at the last individual measurement, resulting in a mean reduction of 99.9%. In 6 out of 23 patients, tumour cell elimination to levels below the detection limit was observed. Tumour markers: The tumour marker CA 72-4 decreased in 3 patients (by 18%, 19%, and 49%) and increased in 10 patients (by a range of 20% to 158%) between pre-treatment and EoS. The  tumour  marker  CA 125  decreased  in  3 patients  (by  22%,  32%,  and  43%),  remained  stable  in 1 patient, and increased in 9 patients (by a range of 21% to 852%) between pre-treatment and EoS. For 10 patients values were missing at EoS.

Maximum tolerated dose: Two dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in Dose Group V (1 Grade 3 large bowel obstruction after a dose of 200 µg and 1 Grade 4 increase in gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT] after a dose of 50 µg). Therefore, the dose steering board decided that the MTD was reached in Dose Group V at 10-20-50- 200-200 µg of catumaxomab.

Study IP-REM-PK-01\\_EU This Phase II, multi-centre, open-label PK study in male and female patients with malignant ascites due to epithelial cancers requiring therapeutic ascites puncture was designed to determine the systemic exposure  during  and  after  4  i.p.  infusions  with  increasing  doses  and  to  characterize  the  PK  of catumaxomab  after  i.p.  administration  (four  6-hour  constant-rate  i.p.  infusions  of  catumaxomab  at escalating doses of 10, 20, 50, and 150 µ g) and to obtain further safety and efficacy data. A total of 13 patients received catumaxomab in this study. Need  for  peritoneal  puncture:  After  the  treatment  phase,  a  therapeutic  puncture  was  performed  in 5 patients up to EoS (1 month after the last infusion) with volumes of 200 mL, 500 mL, 1700 mL and 2000 mL (the volume of 1 patient is unknown); no therapeutic puncture was performed in 7 patients and 1 patient died without the necessity of therapeutic puncture. Abdominal ultrasound was performed at  EoS  in  9 (69%)  patients  and  revealed  ascites  in  7 patients.  In  3 of  these  patients,  a  therapeutic puncture was performed. Ascites volume: The mean drained ascites volume decreased considerably from screening (mean of 2546 mL) to Day 3 (before 1st infusion) (mean of 900 mL) and remained stable  thereafter.  Tumour  cell  load:  The  tumour  cell  load  (EpCAM+  cells)  in  the  ascites  fluid decreased already after the first infusion. Whereas a median of 9362 EpCAM+ cells/106 ascites cells was determined at screening, the median number was 49 before the second infusion and decreased further to 0 before the fourth infusion (no tumour cells were detectable in 5 [56%] patients). Additional efficacy results: There was no consistent change in the Karnofsky index between screening and EoS. Body weight decreased during the treatment period, but increased again thereafter, reaching the screening values at EoS. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Study AGO-OVAR-2.10

This  Phase IIa,  multi-centre,  randomized,  open-label,  2-dose-level  study  was  designed  to  select  a better  dose  level  of  catumaxomab  based  on  the  overall  response  rate  (complete  response  [CR]  or partial  response  [PR])  according  RECIST  administered  by  i.p.  infusion  to  ovarian  cancer  patients refractory to platinum-based chemotherapy. A total of 41 patients were treated with catumaxomab in this study.

Escalating doses of catumaxomab (10-20-50-100 µg) were associated with higher anti-tumour activity without  compromising  the  safety  profile  when  compared  to  the  low-dose  constant  treatment  group (10-10-10-10 µg). The overall response rate in the escalation treatment group was 4.6 % (one patient with a partial response) vs. 0.0% in the low-dose constant treatment group.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

Scientific advice was sought by the applicant from the CHMP. The CHMP agreed upon the open label design, paracentesis as standard of care for the control arm and the primary endpoint 'puncture-free survival'.  Means  to  objectify  the  need  for  therapeutic  puncture  was  requested  by  the  CHMP.  The cross-over  design  was  discussed  as  a  potential  problem  which  could  introduce  bias.  Therefore,  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP recommended that  patients  continue  to  cross-over  period  only  after  the  second  therapeutic puncture.  The  applicant  was  also  requested  to  support  the  claim  for  the  indication  'malignant epithelial ascites' by providing separate analyses of ovarian and non-ovarian cancer patients. Group wise analysis (ovarian and non-ovarian cancer) was also encouraged by the CHMP for the evaluation of a potential bias affects the reliability of the primary endpoint.

During  the  evaluation  of  catumaxomab,  the  CHMP  raised  a  major  objection  with  regards  to  the benefit - risk relationship of the medicinal product given that a precise estimate of PFS was hard to obtain due to frequent premature study termination, and the increase in puncture-free survival (PFS) needed to be balanced against frequent, commonly severe, adverse reactions. The CHMP Scientific Advisory  Group  for  Oncology  was  also  consulted  to  identify  if  efficacy  could  be  considered established  taking  into  consideration  the  data  submitted,  and  to  determine  a  minimum  clinically relevant level of efficacy in this indication.

Due  to  the  design  of  the  study,  the  SAG  agreed  that  significant  biases  might  affect  the  estimated efficacy endpoints, including the primary endpoint, favouring catumaxomab. For instance, patients in the control arm received just one puncture and this may well have resulted in suboptimal drainage of ascites  and  a  higher  residual  volume  leading  to  a  relatively  shorter  time  to  puncture.  In  contrast, patients  randomised  to  catumaxomab  received  4  times  a  drainage  at  baseline  and  this  may  have resulted in a lower residual volume, prolonging the time to puncture. Due to the open design of the study, important ascertainment bias could be expected. Furthermore, a number of important points still remained outstanding with the available data, such as the impact on the life-time number of punctures, the  long-time  efficacy,  or  the  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  of  the  patients  and  of  the  effect  on symptoms such as ascites ileus.

The  applicant  was  asked  to  present  median  duration  of  hospital  stay  in  relation  to  reason  for hospitalization, discussing possible impact on the \"hospitalization\" analysis of imbalanced withdrawal. From the data submitted, in the experimental group, hospitalization was to an important part due to catumaxomab  administration.  The  increased  withdrawal  rate  in  the  experimental  arm  was  largely explained by longer period of observation. In patients withdrawn from therapy more grade 3/4 events were reported and they stayed for longer time in hospital. However, the CHMP considered that the apparent  increase  in  withdrawn  patients  in  the  experimental  arm  did  not  bias  the  assessment  of hospitalization  to  an  important  degree.    At  the  request  of  the  CHMP,  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  was updated to include the median days of hospitalisation for patients in the main study: In the pivotal study IP-REM-AC-01 98.1% of patients were hospitalised for a median of 11 days.

The  SAG  disagreed  on  whether  efficacy  can  be  considered  established.  For  some,  the  impact  of potential biases hindered any conclusion on the efficacy in the claimed indication or any subpopulation, and that the benefits do not outweigh the risk. Some argued that despite the biases, the observed effect was such that a benefit in a subpopulation was considered established (although such population  is  still  undefined).  Others  argued  that  the  efficacy  had  been  established  in  the  claimed indication, and that the benefits outweigh the risks. Finally, the SAG agreed that further studies should be encouraged in order to compare catumaxomab against best available treatment  These recommendations were put forward to the CHMP. The CHMP considered  this  proposal  as  being  of  scientific  interest  but  did  not  deem  it  a  requirement  for  the granting of the marketing authorisation. To further clarify  the  benefit/risk  relationship  of  catumaxomab,  the  CHMP  identified  the following salient points that needed further discussion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The applicant was asked to present time to puncture, counting withdrawal as event. From the data submitted,  counting  withdrawal  as  events  in  the  time-to-puncture  analysis  shortened  the  apparent benefit  from  64  to  41  days.  The  CHMP  considered  this  a  conservative  estimate  of  patient  benefit, which would correspond to about 4 punctures less.

The applicant was asked to address the possible bias related to four draining procedures to dryness in the experimental arm versus one in the control arm. The data presented, collectively indicate that the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

asymmetric design with respect to drainage until dryness did not introduce a bias of importance put in relation to the estimated activity of catumaxomab. This conclusion was based on the pattern over time of  drained  volumes  compared  with  infused  volumes,  the  total  net  increase  in  drained  volume comparing  experimental  and  control  arms  put  in  relation  to  accumulation  over  time  in  control  and experimental  arms,  the  similarity  between  infused  and  drained  volume  at  last  drain,  and  weight changes.

Fully acknowledging that some subgroups are small or very small, available data do not indicate that 'histology' is  an  important  determinant  of catumaxomab activity in terms of hazard ratios for PFS should be reported per diagnosis (gastric cancer, breast cancer, etc.).

The applicant was asked to report patient outcome for the subgroup of patients with a history of at least  one  therapeutic  puncture  per  week  prior  to  enrolment.  Based  on  the  evidence  submitted,  the number  of  patients  with  frequent  punctures  prior  to  inclusion  was  small  and  the  prognostic  and predictive value with respect to time to puncture was not considered overwhelming. The CHMP noted that the absolute benefit of catumaxomab therapy appears similar in both groups of patients.

The applicant was asked to report the time to next puncture after first therapeutic puncture (control not crossing-over,  experimental  arm).    However,  due  to  cross-over,  early  deaths  and  patients  lost  to follow-up, the CHMP could not draw any meaningful conclusions with respect to time to puncture and puncture-free survival comparing experimental and control arms.

The CHMP requested that the safety of repeated courses of treatment with Removab (i.e. off-label use) be reviewed within PSURs, and the RMP be update accordingly.

- Patient exposure

The ISA (Integrated Safety Analysis) for catumaxomab contains pooled patient safety data from five completed studies investigating the i.p. administration (Overall Population), all of whom received at least  1  dose  of  catumaxomab  (N=258).  The  pivotal  phase  II/III  study  IP-REM-AC-01  accounts  for almost 2/3 of the overall population.

## Infusion rate

The  claim  for  MAA  is  catumaxomab  administration  as  a  single  treatment  cycle  with  4  infusions infused at 3 hours. However, in the single pivotal study (IP-REM-AC-01) catumaxomab doses were infused over 6 hours. Studies IP-REM-PC-01 and Study IP-REM-GC-01 are included in the dossier to support the 3 hours infusion rate.

At submission a total of 12 patients had been exposed to catumaxomab at the intended dose escalation levels at a 3 hours infusion rate (IP-REM-GC-01). These patients were first treated intra-abdominally in ascending doses, and later by intraperitoneal infusions at doses as in the pivotal trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An additional 10 patients were treated at higher doses with a 3 hours infusion rate i.p: 7 patients at MTD:  10-20-50-200  μg  and  3  patients  above  MTD:  20-50-100-400  μg  (IP-REM-PC-01-DE Addendum 2).

## · Adverse events

In  the  control  arm  (paracentesis  only),  58%  of  patients  had  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  29.3%  had TEAEs  of  grade  3  or  higher.  Dominating  TEAEs  were  abdominal  pain  (11.4%),  nausea  (10.2%), vomiting (9.1%) and malignant neoplasm progression (15.9%), symptoms all related to the underlying disease.

Adverse events in the catumaxomab treated patients are summarised in the tables below:

Hepatic and hepatobiliary disorders Hepatic and hepatobiliary disorders included TEAEs such as increase of hepatic enzymes, increase of transaminases,  hepatic  failure,  hepatitis  toxic,  hyperbilirubinaemia,  and  jaundice.  Overall,  27.1%  of patients experienced hepatic and hepatobiliary disorders without showing clinical signs or symptoms. Liver function tests displayed a transient increase (in general fully reversible). GGT and AP showed a tendency of accumulation over the 4 infusions.

## Immunogenicity  of  catumaxomab:  development  of  human  anti-mouse  and  anti-rat  antibodies (HAMA and HARA)

Across studies, the majority of patients developed HAMA/HARA. Please refer to the pharmacodynamics section  (including discussion on clinical pharmacology).

- Safety in special populations

The  proportion  of  treated  patients  ≥65  years  was    81  (31%).  The  percentage  of  patients  who discontinued treatment due to TEAEs was slightly higher in this population. Overall, the incidence in elderly and non-elderly was similar, but 10.2% of younger patients (&lt;65 years) had ileus compared to 4.9% of older patients (≥65 years). The incidence of AEs of ≥ Grade 3 in the two age-groups was also similar,  where  slightly  more  TEAEs  with  hyponatremia  (8.6%)  and  anemia  (6.2%)  occurred  in  the elderly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No other studies in special populations were conducted. Patients with massive liver metastasis or other hepatobiliary conditions, as well as renal dysfunction were excluded in the pivotal study.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No interactions were presented.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

Data are sorted by the Overall Population. · Post marketing experience No post marketing data have been submitted. · Discussion on clinical safety The  CHMP  raised  concerns  with  regards  to  the  higher  death  rate  in  the  catumaxomab-groups compared to the control group (55 vs. 13 deaths). This concern was addressed by the applicant during the procedure. The differences in death rates can be explained by the 2:1 randomization and the longer observation time in the catumaxomab arm. Furthermore, none of the death cases in the randomized part of the study was related to catumaxomab. Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that as a treatment administered for palliative intent, the high incidence and the severity of adverse reactions were major drawbacks. To further evaluate this matter, the following issues were discussed at the SAG-Oncology: Medicinal product no longer authorised

1.  The  frequent  and  commonly  severe  adverse  reactions  associated  with  catumaxomab  treatment, including need for hospitalization. The applicant was asked to provide more details about durations of grade 3/4 events and hospitalisation. Based on the evidence provided, the SAG was of the opinion that the  safety  profile  could  be  considered  as  adequately  defined.  However,  it  was  difficult  to  assess whether a safety profile is generally acceptable (without taking efficacy into account). In general, the safety profile could be considered as acceptable provided that a clear benefit is shown. In the absence of a clear benefit, the observed safety profile would be considered unacceptable.

2.  The  identification  of  measures  that  could  be  taken  to  reduce  the  severity  and  frequency  of  the adverse  events  reported  with  catumaxomab  (nausea,  abdominal  pain,  asthenia,  constipation  and pyrexia).  The  SAG  concluded  that  it  was  not  possible  to  identify  any  measures  or  concomitant medications that might be used to reduce the toxicity because there is always a potential for interaction with catumaxomab (e.g., pharmacodynamic interaction with corticosteroids).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition  to  these  issues,  the  CHMP raised other concerns with regards to the clinical safety data submitted:

3. Data on systemic exposure upon intraperitoneal administration were considered too scarce for safety evaluation.  The  applicant was  therefore requested to discuss the potential risks of  systemic bioavailability  of  catumaxomab,  including  e.g.  the  risk  for  effects  of  catumaxomab  in  EpCAMpositive normal tissue at disruption of capillary barriers (e.g. local infiltration of tumour or infectious processes). After a review of the safety database for signs compatible with toxicity in EpCAM posive norma-tissue,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  available  safety  findings  were  sufficient  to  enable  a benefit-risk assessment.

Section 4.2 of the SPC was updated to note that catumaxomab is not recommended for use in children below the ages of 18 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy.

The applicant committed to evaluate more patients in a planned phase IIIb clinical study in order to gain  additional  data  on  HAMA/HARA  positive  patients  receiving  catumaxomab  treatment  and toxicity. Summary of safety concerns and planned pharmacovigilance actions of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) were revised accordingly.

In  addition, the applicant committed to providing the results of a two-arm, randomized, open label, phase IIIb study investigating the safety of the 3hours i.p infusion of catumaxomab with and without prednisolone premedication in patients with malignant ascites due to epithelial cancers, which  began in December 2008. As a result of the clinical safety data submitted, the following sections of the SPC were amended: Section 4.4 of the SPC was updated to include the following special warnings and precautions for use: Cytokine release related symptoms As release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines is initiated by the binding of catumaxomab to immune and tumour cells, cytokine release related clinical symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting and  chills  have  been  commonly  reported  during  and  after  the  Removab  administration  (see section 4.8). Dyspnoea and hypo-/ hypertension are less commonly observed. In the clinical studies in patients with malignant ascites, 1000 mg paracetamol intravenously was routinely administered prior to Removab infusion for pain and pyrexia control. Despite this premedication, patients experienced the adverse  reactions  described  above  with  an  intensity  of  up  to  grade  3,  according  to  the  Common Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  of  the  US  National  Cancer  Institute.  Other  or additional standard pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic medicinal products is recommended. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which may also occur uncommonly due to the mechanism of action of catumaxomab, develops, in general, within 24 hours after Removab infusion, showing  symptoms  of  fever,  tachycardia,  tachypnoea  and  leucocytosis  (see  section 4.8).  Standard therapy  or  premedication,  e.g.  analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal  antiphlogistic  is  appropriate  to limit the risk. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Abdominal pain

Abdominal pain was commonly reported as an adverse reaction. This transient effect is  considered partially a consequence of study procedures such as the intraperitoneal route of administration.

## Performance status and BMI

A solid performance status expressed as Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 17 (to be assessed after drainage of ascites fluid) and Karnofsky Index &gt; 60 is required prior to Removab therapy.

## Acute infections

In  presence  of  factors  interfering  with  the  immune  system,  in  particular  acute  infections,  the administration of Removab is not recommended.

## Ascites drainage

Appropriate medical management of ascites drainage is a prerequisite for Removab treatment in order to assure stable circulatory and renal functions. This must at least include ascites drainage until stop of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

spontaneous  flow,  and,  if  appropriate,  supportive  replacement  therapy  with  crystalloids  and / or colloids. Conditions such as hypovolaemia, hypoproteinaemia, hypotension, circulatory decompensation and acute renal impairment should be resolved prior to each Removab infusion.

## Hepatic impairment or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction

Patients  with  hepatic  impairment  of  a  higher  severity  grade  than  moderate  and / or  with  more  than 70% of the liver metastasized and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk.

## Renal impairment

Patients  with  renal  impairment  of  a  higher  severity  grade  than  mild  have  not  been  investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk.

## Perfusion system

Only the following material must be used for the application of Removab:

- -50 ml polypropylene syringes
- -polyethylene perfusion tubing with an inner diameter of 1 mm and a length of 150 cm
- -polycarbonate infusion valves / Y connections

Section 4.7 of the SPC was updated to reflect the lack of studies performed on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing infusion-related symptoms should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate.

Section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to include the nature and frequency of adverse reactions analysed in  an  integrated  safety  analysis  on  the  basis  of  5 clinical  studies  consisting  of  258 patients  in  the indications malignant ascites (193 patients), peritoneal carcinomatosis (24 patients) and ovarian cancer (41 patients) with intraperitoneal application of Removab.

Approximately  90%  of  patients  experienced  adverse  reactions.  In  tabular  format,  adverse  reactions reported with catumaxomab were listed in the SPC and classified according to frequency and System Organ Class. Adverse reactions of special interest included cytokine release-related symptoms, SIRS, and abdominal pain:

## Cytokine release related symptoms:

Very commonly reported acute infusion-related reactions due to release of cytokines included fever, nausea,  vomiting  and  chills.  These  reactions  were  frequently  observed  during  and  after  Removab infusions with a severity of grade 1 and 2 and were fully reversible. Grade 3 pyrexia (5%), vomiting (3.9%), nausea (2.3%), dyspnoea (1.6%) hypotension (1.2%), hypertension (0.8%) and chills (0.8%) were reported. Grade 4 dyspnoea and hypotension were also reported in one patient each. Symptoms of pain and pyrexia can be ameliorated or avoided by pre-medication (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS):

In  0.8%  of  the  patients  symptoms  of  SIRS  were  observed  within  24 hours after  Removab  infusion, such  as  grade 3  tachycardia  and  fever  and  grade 4  dyspnoea.  These  reactions  resolved  under symptomatic treatment.

## Abdominal pain:

In 48.1% of patients abdominal pain was reported as an adverse reaction reaching grade 3 in 9.7% of patients, but it resolved under symptomatic treatment.

Section 4.9 of the SPC was amended to include that no case of overdose had been reported. Patients receiving  a  higher  than  recommended  dose  of  catumaxomab  experienced  more  severe  (grade 3) adverse reactions.

| Cytokine release related symptoms                 | Monitoring and evaluation in future Periodic Safety Update Reports            | Guidance in the SPC, Section 4.4. As release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines is initiated by the binding of catumaxomab to immune and tumour cells, cytokine release related clinical symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting and chills have been commonly reported during and after the Removab administration (see section 4.8). Dyspnoea and hypo-/ hypertension are less commonly observed. authorised                                     |
| Systemic inflammatory response syndrome           | Monitoring and evaluation in future Periodic Safety Update Reports product no | Guidance in the SPC, Section 4.4. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which may also occur uncommonly due to the mechanism of action of catumaxomab, develops, in general, within 24 hours after Removab infusion, showing symptoms of fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis (see section 4.8). Standard therapy or premedication, e.g. analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic is appropriate to limit the risk. longer |

Administration  of  catumaxomab  in  animal  models  did  not  result  in  any  signs  of  abnormal  or drug-related acute toxicity or signs of local intolerance at the injection/infusion site. However, these findings are of limited value due to the high species-specificity of catumaxomab.

Repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed.

## Efficacy

The efficacy of catumaxomab was demonstrated in a two-arm, randomized, open-label clinical trial (IP-REM-AC-01)  in  258 patients  with  symptomatic  malignant  ascites  due  to  EpCAM  positive carcinomas  of  whom  170  were  randomized  to  catumaxomab  treatment.  This  study  compared paracentesis plus catumaxomab versus paracentesis alone (control).

Catumaxomab was applied in patients where standard therapy was not available or no longer feasible and who had a Karnofsky performance status of a least 60. Catumaxomab was administered as four intraperitoneal infusions with increased doses of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms on day 0, 3, 7 and 10, respectively.

In  this  study,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  puncture-free  survival,  which  was  a  composite endpoint defined as the time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever occurred first.  In  all  analysis  groups,  puncture-free  survival  was  significantly  longer  (p&lt;0.0001)  in  the catumaxomab  group  compared  to  the  control  group.  In  the  pooled  analysis,  the  median  difference between the groups was 35 days (95% CI: 25; 45). For ovarian cancer patients, the median difference between the groups was 41 days (95% CI: 32; 50) and for all non-ovarian cancer patients 23 days (95% CI: 8; 38). After reviewing a number of sensitivity analyses, the CHMP considered that the expected  puncture-sparing  effect  for  a  patient  is  likely  to  be  of  about  4  punctures  (see  risk-benefit assessment). Safety The  nature  and  frequency  of  adverse  reactions  were  described  in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC  and  were analysed in an integrated safety analysis on the basis of 5 clinical studies consisting of 258 patients in the  indications  malignant  ascites  (193 patients),  peritoneal  carcinomatosis  (24 patients)  and  ovarian cancer (41 patients) with intraperitoneal application of Removab. Approximately  90%  of  patients  experienced  adverse  reactions.  Adverse  reactions  reported  with catumaxomab were listed in the SPC and classified according to frequency and System Organ Class. Frequency  groupings  were  defined  according  to  the  following  convention:  very  common  ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100).Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects were presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The following adverse reactions were of special interest. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Cytokine release related symptoms:

Very commonly reported acute infusion-related reactions due to release of cytokines included fever, nausea,  vomiting  and  chills.  These  reactions  were  frequently  observed  during  and  after  Removab infusions with a severity of grade 1 and 2 and were fully reversible. Grade 3 pyrexia (5%), vomiting (3.9%), nausea (2.3%), dyspnoea (1.6%) hypotension (1.2%), hypertension (0.8%) and chills (0.8%) were reported. Grade 4 dyspnoea and hypotension were also reported in one patient each. Symptoms of pain and pyrexia can be ameliorated or avoided by pre-medication (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS):

In  0.8%  of  the  patients  symptoms  of  SIRS  were  observed  within  24 hours after  Removab  infusion, such  as  grade 3  tachycardia  and  fever  and  grade 4  dyspnoea.  These  reactions  resolved  under symptomatic treatment.

## Abdominal pain:

In 48.1% of patients abdominal pain was reported as an adverse reaction reaching grade 3 in 9.7% of patients, but it resolved under symptomatic treatment.

An  Annual  Safety  Report  (ASR)  was  received  by  the  EMEA  on  16  February  2008,  covering  the reporting period of 05 January 2008 through 04 January 2009.  Based on this report, the benefit-risk ratio of catumaxomab remains favourable.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials  have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

A treatment effect has been demonstrated in terms of prolonged puncture-free survival in patients with malignant ascites due to ovarian and non-ovarian cancer. While statistically convincing, the treatment effect is difficult to reliably estimate due to premature study termination, mainly in the experimental arm. Based on a weighed review of alternative analysis, however, the median delay in paracentesis puncture  is  approximately  1  month.  Number  of  paracenteses  avoided  is  considered  a  reasonable overall measure of patient benefit. Due to the cross-over design this benefit can only be estimated, but about 4 punctures seem to be a reasonable estimate. This is considered to be a relevant reduction in number of paracenteses needed until death. The indication sought has been restricted to treatment of EPCAM positive tumours as catumaxomab is highly unlikely to be active in tumours not expressing the target antigen. There are certain risks and uncertainties associated with catumaxomab. During the discussion of the benefit/risk balance of this medicinal product, no significant increase in overall survival was noted, despite the demonstrated increased in puncture-free survival from 11 days to 46 days. Administration of catumaxomab was associated with frequent grade 3/4 events, but the vast majority of symptomatic severe events were of short duration and infusion-related. Number of days at hospital  was increased from 4 days to 18 days, but remained  similar if corrected for observation time (median 18/42 and 4/11). The increased number of withdrawn patients in the experimental arm is also mainly accounted for by increased time of observation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study design (cross-over) impacts on the possibility to properly assess efficacy and safety over time.  With  respect  to  number  of  paracenteses  avoided  it  has  been  assumed  that  the  frequency  will remain  stable  in  the  control  arm  over  time.  Adverse  events  and  hospitalizations  have  also  been assumed to remain stable. With respect to hospitalization, it is not unreasonable to assume that need for hospitalization will increase over time, in relation to punctures, as performance status deteriorates. Taking into consideration the palliative nature of this treatment in terminally-ill cancer patients, and in the absence of a significant survival advantage, the increase in puncture-free survival should always be weighed against the need for hospitalisation for the administration of catumaxomab.

Important biases in relation to clock start, puncture and time to event analyses were not been identified or have been possible to handle through sensitivity analyses.

In  conclusion,  the  benefit  as  estimated  based  on  reduced  need  for  paracenteses  is  considered  to outweigh treatment associated adverse reactions.  The prolonged time to need for puncture conferred by this medicinal product is approximately 40-60 days, and grade 3/4 adverse reactions are common but  of  short  duration.  Patients  receiving  catumaxomab  should  expect  to  remain  in  hospital  for  the duration of treatment (In the pivotal study IP-REM-AC-01 98.1% of patients were hospitalised for a median of 11 days, SPC section 5.1).

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

Therefore,  the  overall  benefit/risk  of  catumaxomab  for  the  intraperitoneal  treatment  of  malignant ascites  in  patients  with  EpCAM  positive  carcinomas  where  standard  therapy  is  not  available  or  no longer feasible, is considered to be positive.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Removab in the treatment of malignant ascites in patients  with  EpCAM  positive  carcinomas  where  standard  therapy  is  not  available  or  no  longer feasible, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
