## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for imatinib, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

A cumulative search of adverse events coded for MedDRA Preferred Terms of TMA (thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia) from spontaneous sources and clinical trials linked to imatinib use retrieved 37 cases; 8 from literature, 4 from post-marketing surveillance, 13 from spontaneous sources and 12 retrieved from clinical trials. In three cases the event appeared in temporal association with imatinib therapy, two of them after a very short time of exposure and the third one after long-term exposure to imatinib. The three subjects were reported to improve when the drug was discontinued and the laboratory work up excluded all other main causes of primary TMA. Additionally, 9 cases from post marketing sources including clinical trials and literature with no confounding factors support this association.

In summary, the reviewd evidence points towards a causal association between imatinib therapy and the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy. Therefore, the PRAC considers that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing imatinib, are warranted. The term 'thrombotic microangiopathy' should be included in section 4.8 under the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders with the frequency 'rare' and section 4.4 should be updated with information on clinical management of thrombotic microangiopathy. The Package leaflet should be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for imatinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing imatinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
