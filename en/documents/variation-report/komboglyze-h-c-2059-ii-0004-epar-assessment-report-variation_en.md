## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Saxagliptin  phosphate  is  an  orally  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors act by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. These hormones, including glucagon-like  peptide-1  and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  polypeptide,  are  released  from  the intestine in response to a meal and are part of an endogenous system involved in glucose homeostasis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Saxagliptin was approved for marketing in the EU on October 1 st  2009 and currently has therapeutic indications for second line use in combination with metformin, a PPAR-γ agonist, or a sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Komboglyze is a fixed dose combination product consisting of saxagliptin + metformin. Komboglyze was  approved  in  the  EU  on  24  November  2011.The  MAH  submitted  a  clinical  Type  II  Variation  to extend the indication of Komboglyze as follows:

Komboglyze is also indicated in combination with insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus when insulin and metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

The  clinical  program  to  support  the  use  of  Komboglyze  in  combination  therapy  with  insulin  was developed  in  accordance  with  the  2002  'Notes  for  Guidance  on  Clinical  Investigations  of  Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus' (CPMP/EWP/1080/00, May 2002).

This submission consisted of 1 pivotal Phase 3b controlled clinical study, CV181057 (Study 57), which evaluated saxagliptin as add-on therapy to insulin with or without metformin.  Study 57 included a 24week double-blind short-term (ST) period plus an additional 28-week long term (LT) extension period.

The data of study 57 was already submitted previously in support of a variation of Onglyza for the use of saxagliptin in combination  with  insulin, with  or  without  metformin  (see  Type  II  variation EMEA/H/C/001039/II/0011, CHMP  positive opinion dated 20 October 2011). The European Commission Decision was granted on 22 November 2011.

This application is therefore based to a considerable part on the data already submitted by the MAH for Onglyza (saxagliptin) as part of the extension of indication as add-on  to insulin (variation EMEA/H/C/001039/II/0011). The MAH also included in this submission the long-term data that were submitted during the evaluation of Onglyza variation II/011. For Onglyza the indication was as add-on therapy to insulin both with or without metformin. Therefore within this submission for Komboglyze, the combination with metformin is particularly emphasized.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision on the granting of a product-specific waiver for saxagliptin/metformin (P/240/2009).

## GCP

The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial conducted outside the community was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## 2.2. Clinical efficacy aspects

The clinical program to evaluate the anti-hyperglycaemic activity of saxagliptin as add on combination therapy  with  insulin  in  T2DM  is  supported  by  data  from  the  Phase  3b  study  CV181057  (study  57). Study 57 was a randomized, parallel, double-blind placebo controlled, multicenter trial that compared the anti-hyperglycaemic activity of saxagliptin 5 mg added as combination therapy with insulin or to insulin in combination with metformin in subjects with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control. The  24-week  double-blind  ST  treatment  period  provides  efficacy  and  safety  data  to  support  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

proposed indication; the 28-week LT extension for this study provides additional supportive efficacy and safety data from 402 subjects.

## 2.2.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

The main study for this application is study 057.

## Study design

Study 057 was a Phase 3b, randomized, two-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter  trial  comparing  the  antihyperglycaemic  activity  of  saxagliptin  added  as  combination therapy  with  insulin  or  to  insulin  in  combination  with  metformin  in  subjects  withT2DM  who  had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11.0%) while on a stable dose of insulin (≥ 30 units/day,  ≤  150  units/day)  or  a  stable  dose  of  insulin  (≥  30  units/day,  ≤150  units/day)  in combination with a stable dose of metformin for at least 8 weeks. The ST treatment period was 24 weeks. The 24-week double-blind ST treatment period provides efficacy and safety data to support the proposed indication; the 28-week LT extension for this study provides additional supportive efficacy and safety data from 402 subjects. Randomization was 2:1 (saxagliptin: placebo), and was stratified by metformin use at enrolment. The proportion of subjects using metformin was capped at 75% of total sample, to ensure sufficient participation of those on insulin monotherapy. The usual clinical dose of 5 mg once daily of saxagliptin was administered in this study. See Figure 1.

T2DM=type 2 diabetesmellitus

## Study population

The population of study 057 consisted of male and female subjects with T2DM, aged between 18 and 78 years (inclusive), who had inadequate glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c levels ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11.0%) and were on insulin alone [(≥ 30 units/day, ≤ 150 units/day) with ≤ 20% variation in total daily dose for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening] or in combination with metformin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint in study 057 was the change in HbA1c level from baseline until Week 24 (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24, if no Week 24 measurement was available or before rescue).

Secondary endpoints assessed at week 24 were:

-  Change from baseline in AUC from 0 to 180 minutes for postprandial glucose response to an MTT;
-  Change from baseline in the 120-minute postprandial glucose value during an MTT;
-  Change from baseline in FPG;
-  Proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response (defined asHbA1c &lt; 7%);
-  Change  from  baseline  in  mean  total  daily  insulin  dose  based  on  information  recorded  on  the subjects' daily diary.

Other  efficacy  endpoints  were  the  changes  from  baseline  to  week  24  for  the  postprandial  glucagon AUC, postprandial C-peptide AUC, fasting glucagon, and fasting C-peptide.

## Statistical analysis

With a total of 390 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive saxagliptin 5 mg (260 subjects) or placebo (130 subjects), there was 90% power to detect a difference in A1C mean change from baseline to Week 24 of 0.35% between saxagliptin and placebo, assuming a standard deviation of 1.0%. Assuming a drop out  rate  of  10%,  a  total  of  435  subjects  (290  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  arm  and  145 subjects in the placebo treatment arm) were to be randomized.

## Analysis populations

The Lead-in Subjects Data Set included data collected from all subjects who took at least 1 dose of placebo lead-in study medication.

The Randomized Subjects Data Set consisted of all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of double-blind treatment.

The  Evaluable  Subjects  Data  Set  (called  the  'Secondary  Efficacy  Data  Set'  in  the  protocol)  was  a subset of the Randomized Subjects Data Set. It consisted of subjects who did not deviate from the terms  of  the  protocol  in  ways  which  could  have  affected  the  primary  endpoint  in  a  relevant  way ('relevant  deviation'),  as  specified  in  the  pre-defined  protocol  deviation  list  prior  to  unblinding  the study. Only the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in A1C, demographics, and baseline diabetes-related characteristics were to be analysed using the Evaluable Subjects Data Set, and only if &gt;10% of the subjects in any treatment group were found to have a relevant deviation.

The Treated Subjects Data Set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug during the short-term treatment period.

## Efficacy analysis

In calculating primary and secondary endpoints in rescued subjects, endpoints (except mean total daily dose of insulin [MTDDI]) were analysed by last observation carried forward (LOCF), as follows:

-  Rescue because of increased fasting plasma glucose: For subjects rescued because of increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, measurements obtained after rescue were not considered in the analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. Rather, the last observations prior to rescue were carried forward (LOCF).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Rescue because of increased insulin use: For subjects rescued because of persistently increased use of insulin (MTDDI exceeding by &gt; 20% the subject's baseline MTDDI), the last observations prior to rescue and prior to the visit with the 20% increase in MTDDI were carried forward (LOCF).

## Primary endpoint

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24.  The  primary efficacy  analysis  was  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  of  that  endpoint  (LOCF),  with  treatment group and metformin use at enrolment as fixed effects, and baseline value as a covariate in the model. It included subjects in the Randomized Data Set who had HbA1c assessments at baseline and postbaseline (excluding any post-rescue assessments). Within the framework of the ANCOVA model, point estimates  and  95%  CIs  for  the  mean  changes  between  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  the placebo treatment group were calculated. Each comparison of the saxagliptin treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was performed using a t test at α=0.05 level. The treatment-by-baseline interaction was tested and distributional assumptions were assessed.

To  assess  the  robustness  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  the  modelling  of  the  primary  efficacy analysis was repeated in a number of sensitivity analyses.

The  statistical  testing  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  proceeded  in  a  sequential manner to control the overall type I (family-wise) error rate at the 0.05 level. The significance or nonsignificance  of  the  treatment  comparisons  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  determined  which statistical tests were performed to compare treatments for the secondary efficacy endpoints.

Overall, the design of the study was considered adequate to evaluate the value of saxagliptin when added to insulin. Primary and secondary endpoints were adequate . The inclusion criterion of metformin dose  ≥  1500  mg/day  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  previous  studies  of  saxagliptin  and  other antidiabetic  agents  and  is  acceptable.  The  mean  dose  of  &gt;1800  mg  is  acceptable. The  chosen superiority margin of 0.35% was considered rather small by CHMP but found to be acceptable in this clinical context.Results

Note: The denominator of each % is the number of randomized and treated subjects.

LT = long term; QD = once daily; SAXA = saxagliptin

Figure 2, Table 1 and Table 2. Of the 500 subjects who entered the lead-in period, 45 did not enter the double-blind treatment period, including 2 subjects who were randomized but not treated. The most common reason for subjects discontinuing during the lead-in period was that the subjects did not meet study criteria (30 subjects, 6.0%). Of the 455 subjects who were randomized and treated with doubleblind therapy, 402 (88%) subjects completed 24-weeks of treatment.  A total of 304 subjects were randomized  to  saxagliptin  and  151  were  randomized  to  placebo.  Discontinuations  during  the  shortterm treatment period were similar in both treatment groups (11.8% and 11.3%, respectively). The most common reason for discontinuation from the short-term treatment period in the saxagliptin group was subject withdrew consent (13 subjects, or 4.3%). The most common reasons for discontinuation from the placebo group were subject withdrew consent (5 subjects, or 3.3%) and lost to follow-up (5 subjects, or 3.3%). Lack of efficacy led to discontinuation in 5 subjects (3, or 1.0%, in the saxagliptin group and 2, or 1.3%, in the placebo group). Discontinuations during the LT-treatment period were also similar (8.2 versus 6.7% in the saxagliptin resp. placebo group).

(a) Subjects who took at least one dose of lead-in medication

(b) Randomized subjects who took at least one dose of double-blind study medication

(c) Randomized subjects, excluding subjects with relevant deviations resulting in complete data exclusion

(d) Evaluable subjects, who have a baseline A1C assessment and at least 1 post-randomization A1C assessment

(e) Subjects who received at least 1 dose of double-blind study medication

Percentages are based on the number of randomized subjects in each treatment group.

## Demographics and baseline characteristics

Demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The 2 treatment groups were  generally  well  balanced  for  demographic  and  baseline  diabetes  characteristics.  Of  the  455 randomized and treated subjects, 41.3% were men and 78.0% were white; the mean age was 57.2 years (range 18 to 77 years). Most (84.6%) subjects were diagnosed with T2DM ≥5 years before the start  of  the  study  with  a  mean  duration  of  diabetes  of  12.0  years.  The  mean  baseline  HbA1c  was 8.66% (range, 7.3% to 11.4%).

Demographic characteristics were also examined for the 314 subjects taking metformin and the 141 subjects  not  taking  metformin.  Among  subjects  taking  metformin  41.7%  were  male,  76.4%  were white, and the mean age was 56.7 years (range 18 to 77 years). Among subjects not taking metformin 40.4% were male, 81.6% were white,  and  the  mean  age  was  58.4  years  (range  29  to  77  years). Overall, baseline diabetes characteristics were generally similar between those taking metformin and those not taking concomitant metformin.

There were no differences between treatment groups in percentages of patients who completed the study  and  percentage  of  withdrawals.  In  addition,  there  were  no  relevant  differences  between treatment  groups  in  demographics  and  baseline  disease  characteristics.  Most  patients  were  White (78%), 20% were from North America, 20% from Latin America, 40% from Europe, 11% from Asia. Baseline disease characteristics were typical for T2DM patients. Sixty-eight per cent (68%) of patients were metformin users.

According to the inclusion criteria, baseline HbA1C was supposed to be ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11.0% and the MTDDI ≥ 30 units/day, ≤150 units/day. However, according to Table 4, patients had baseline HbA1C values ranging from 7.3- 11.4%, and in the saxagliptin group the minimum insulin dose was 19 units.

During the extension of indication procedure with Onglyza (variation II/011), the MAH was requested by the CHMP to explain the differences observed, and stated that here could be slight differences in HbA1c  between  screening  or  Day  -5  and  baseline,  resulting  in  a  baseline  value  just  outside  the required range, and that all randomised subjects but 1 had baseline mean total daily dose of insulin (MTDD1)  values  within  the  specified  range  of  &gt;=30  to  &lt;=  150  units/day.  These  answers  were considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## Primary efficacy endpoint

The primary and secondary efficacy  endpoints  in  study  057  are  summarized  by  treatment group  in Table 5. Overall, study 057 showed that saxagliptin added on to insulin (or to insulin combined with metformin)  improves  glycaemic  control  in  subjects  with  T2DM.  There  was  a  statistically  significant reduction in adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 in the saxagliptin treatment group compared with placebo (p&lt;0.0001). The adjusted mean change from baseline was -0.73% (95% CI [-0.83, -0.62]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.32% (95% CI [-0.46, -0.17]) for placebo. The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.41% (95% CI [-0.59, -0.24]).

Changes over time are shown in Figure 3. For saxagliptin, a reduction from baseline was observed at Weeks 4 and 8 and became progressively greater to Week 12; this reduction was maintained through Week 24. For placebo, smaller reductions were observed from Weeks 4 to 12 and values stabilized after that point through Week 24.

Similar  results  were  obtained  when  examining  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  results  at  Week  24 regardless  of  rescue.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  HbA1c  (regardless  of  rescue) was  - 0.76%  (95%  CI  [-0.87,  -0.66])  for  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  -0.40%  (95%  CI  [0.54, -0.25]) for placebo. The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.37% (95% CI [-0.54, -0.19]).

When examining HbA1c data obtained prior to a 10% change in insulin dose, there was a reduction in adjusted  mean  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group compared  with  placebo.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.71%  (95%  CI  [0.81, - 0.61]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.25% (95% CI [-0.40, -0.11]) for placebo. The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.46% (95% CI [-0.63, -0.29]). These results were consistent with those obtained for the main analysis.

Change from baseline in HbA1c in subgroups based on metformin use (ST treatment period)

Results  for  changes  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  (LOCF)  were  similar  in  subjects  with  and without metformin use at baseline (see Table 6). Among subjects with metformin use at baseline, the adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.79%  (95%  CI  [-0.91,  -0.67])  for  the  saxagliptin treatment group and -0.38% (95% CI [-0.55, -0.21]) for placebo. The difference in the adjusted mean

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

change from baseline versus placebo was -0.41% (95% CI [-0.62, -0.20]). Among subjects with no metformin  use  at  baseline,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.67%  (95%  CI  [0.84, - 0.49]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.25% (95% CI [-0.51, 0.00]) for placebo. The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.41% (95% CI [-0.72, 0.10]). Changes over time are shown in Figure 4.

Results for secondary endpoints were in line with those of the primary endpoint.

At  Week  24,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  change  from  baseline  in  postprandial glucose  AUC  during  an  MTT  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  compared  with  placebo  (p=0.0011) (Table  5).  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  -3829.8 (95%  CI  [-6122.4,  -1537.1]).  There  was  also  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  120-minute postprandial  glucose  concentration  when  examining  results  for  change  from  baseline  to  Week  24 (p=0.0016)(Table 5). The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was 23.0 mg/dL (-1.3 mmol/L) (95% CI [-37.2, -8.7 mg/dL; -2.1, -0.5 mmol/L]).

Saxagliptin was associated with a numerically greater decrease in adjusted mean change from baseline in  FPG  compared with placebo (-4.02 mg/dL, -0.2 mmol/L), but this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.3958; 95% CI [-13.32, 5.28 mg/dL; -0.7, 0.3 mmol/L]) (Table 5). When examining data obtained prior to a 10% change in insulin dose in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the reduction in adjusted mean change in FPG from baseline to Week 24 was greater in the saxagliptin treatment group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared with the placebo group. The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -12.94 mg/dL (-0.7 mmol/L) (95% CI[-22.27, -3.61 mg/dL; -1.2, -0.2 mmol/L]).

A greater proportion of subjects treated with saxagliptin achieved a therapeutic glycaemic response (defined  as  HbA1c  &lt;  7.0%)  adjusted  for  baseline  HbA1c  relative  to  placebo  (17.3%  versus  6.7%) (Table  5).  The  difference  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  &lt;  7%versus  placebo  was 10.6% (95% CI [4.7, 16.5]). The absence of statistical significance on the prior secondary endpoint (FPG) precluded formal assessment of this secondary endpoint for statistical significance. However, the 95%  CI  for  the  difference  for  the  proportions  in  the  2  treatment  groups  did  not  include  0.The difference in the proportions of subjects achieving HbA1c &lt; 7% was higher in the saxagliptin group than the placebo group regardless of whether subjects were receiving metformin (saxagliptin: 19.4%; placebo: 7.8%) or were not receiving metformin (saxagliptin: 12.8%; placebo: 4.3%).

Mean total daily insulin dose increased from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in both treatment groups. The adjusted mean increase from baseline in MTDDI was lower in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units; 95% CI [0.3, 3.0]) than the placebo group (5.0 units; 95% CI [3.1, 6.9]) at Week 24 (Table 5). The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in the total daily dose of insulin versus placebo was -3.3 units  (95%  CI  [-5.6,  -1.1]).  The  absence  of  statistical  significance  on  the  prior  secondary  endpoint (FPG) precluded formal assessment of this secondary endpoint for statistical significance. However, the 95% CI for the difference in the insulin dose in the 2 treatment groups did not include 0.

## Other efficacy endpoints

The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting C-peptide at Week 24 (saxagliptin versus placebo) was 0.05 ng/mL (95% CI [-0.18, 0.29]).

The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in postprandial C-peptide AUC at Week 24 (saxagliptin versus placebo) was 5.1 ng*min/mL (95% CI [-50.1, 60.4]).

The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting glucagon at Week 24 (saxagliptin versus placebo) was -4.53 pg/mL (95% CI [-10.01, 0.95]).

The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  postprandial  glucagon  AUC  at  Week  24 (saxagliptin versus placebo) was -1640.2 pg*min/mL (95% CI [-2649.1, -631.2]).

The proportion  of  subjects  who  discontinued  for  lack  of  glycaemic  control  or  who  were  rescued  for meeting pre-specified glycaemic criteria during the short-term treatment period was numerically lower in the saxagliptin group at every time point. At Week 24, 22.7% of the saxagliptin treated patients and 31.8% of the placebo treated patients had discontinued (difference-9.1%; 95% CI [-18.7, 0.7]).

## Physical measurements

Overall, there were numerical increases in mean body weight (LOCF) across both treatment groups. Baseline mean body weight was 87.71 kg for saxagliptin treated subjects and 86.21 kg for placebo treated subjects. At Week24, the adjusted mean change in body weight (LOCF) was 0.39 kg (95% CI [0.10, 0.69]) for the saxagliptin group and 0.18 kg (95% CI [-0.23, 0.59]) for the placebo group. The difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  0.22  kg  (95%  CI[-0.27, 0.70]).

Mean BMI values also increased (LOCF) across both treatment groups. Baseline mean BMI was 32.58 kg/m 2  for saxagliptin treated subjects and 31.76 kg/m 2  for placebo treated subjects. At Week 24, the adjusted mean change in BMI (LOCF) was 0.16 kg/m2 (95% CI [0.05, 0.27]) for the saxagliptin group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and0.05 kg/m 2   (95% CI  [-0.11,  0.20])  for  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean change from baseline versus placebo was 0.11 kg/m 2  (95% CI [-0.07, 0.30]).

Overall, both primary and secondary parameters indicate that the addition of saxagliptin to patients treated with insulin was effective. The results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use at baseline. However, the effect was modest. For HbA1c, the adjusted mean difference from placebo was -0.41%. This was also expressed in the proportion of  patients  achieving  therapeutic  glycaemic response (HbA1c &lt; 7%): 17.3 vs 6.7% for the saxagliptin and insulin group, respectively.

Even  though  the  treatment  effect  was  modest,  the  study  demonstrated  that  saxagliptin  +  insulin produced a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo + insulin after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, with a treatment difference of 0.41%.

The  placebo  group  had  a  reduction  in  HbA1C  of  0.32%,  likely  attributable  to  dietary  and  exercise factors, some of which may have extended beyond randomisation.

Despite  the  addition  of  saxagliptin,  mean  total  insulin  dose  increased  from  baseline  to  week  24. However, the mean increase in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units) was lower than in the placebo group (5.0 units).

A small increase in body weight was seen in both groups (0.39 kg versus 0.18 kg in the saxagliptin versus placebo group, respectively).

Efficacy results from the long term extension period of study 057 are listed in a subsequent section.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No strong interactions (p &lt; 0.1) of treatment by subgroup were noted for subgroup analyses of change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 (LOCF) by metformin use, baseline HbA1c, duration of diabetes, race, gender, age, BMI, or geographic region (see Table 6).

For  some subgroups (duration of diabetes  ≤1.5 year and race  'other') the  effect in the saxagliptin group was smaller than in the placebo group. However, in these subgroups the number of patients was small and the 95% CIs were large.

With respect to the geographic region, the difference from control was -0.29% in  Europe, versus 0.64% in Asia, -0.49% in North America and -0.63% in Latin America. There is a large difference in response to placebo, with no effect in Asia, and the largest effect (-0.52%) in Latin America. This was raised  as  a  concern  by  the  CHMP  as  part  of  variation  II/011  for  Onglyza.  In  response,  the  MAH submitted further details on the number of patients recruited from the EU and the number of patients outside  the  EU.  The  efficacy  results  of  these  both  groups  are  compared.  Although  the  placebocorrected  mean  reductions  were  numerically  smaller  for  EU  subjects  than  in  the  overall  population (also in the individual geographic regions as presented in the ST CSR) and the 95% CI of the placebocorrected reduction was wide, there was no evidence of a treatment-by-region interaction in this new analysis (p=0.262). A difference in placebo-corrected response between Asian and European patients or Asian and White patients had previously also been observed with another DPP-4 inhibitor.

## Long term efficacy (ST+LT treatment period)

During the LT treatment period of study 57, all subjects who had not yet been rescued were moved to the flexible insulin regimen, while continuing the same study medication. The efficacy analyses in the ST+LT  treatment  period  of  study 57  were  generated  based  on  randomised  subjects  regardless  of insulin dose. In reporting the ST findings, the efficacy analyses included only results prior to rescue, which  could  have  led  to  minor  differences  between  Week 24  results  in  the  ST  versus  the  ST+LT treatment periods.

The  effect  of  saxagliptin  treatment  on  HbA1c  was  analyzed  using  the  repeated  measures  analysis (mixed  model),  LOCF,  and  observed  values  methodologies.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.37% (95% CI [-0.54, -0.20]) at Week 24 and -0.37% (95%  CI  [-0.55,  -0.19])  at  Week  52.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  52 was -0.75% (95% CI [-0.85, -0.64]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.38% (95% CI [-0.53, -0.23]) for the placebo group.

The results from the LOCF analysis were similar to those from the repeated measures analysis.

The results from subgroup analyses by metformin use in the ST+LT period were similar to those seen  at  Week 24,  i.e.  treatment  with  saxagliptin  5 mg  in  combination  with  insulin  and  metformin resulted in HbA1c reductions from baseline at Week 52 (repeated measures analysis) that were similar to treatment with saxagliptin plus insulin without metformin.

Figure 5 presents the mean reductions from baseline HbA1c (repeated measures analysis) during the ST+LT treatment period in the subgroup with metformin use.

<!-- image -->

At Week 52, the percentages of subjects who had achieved a therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA1c &lt;7%) were 21.3% for the saxagliptin treatment group and 8.7% for the placebo group (difference: 12.6%).  The  difference  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  &lt;7%  was  higher  in  the saxagliptin  group  than  the  placebo  group  regardless  of  whether  subjects  were  receiving  metformin (saxagliptin: 23.8%; placebo: 8.7%) or were not receiving metformin (saxagliptin:  16.0%; placebo: 8.7%).

The effect of saxagliptin treatment on MTDDI (mean total daily insulin dose) was analyzed using the repeated measures analysis (mixed model) and LOCF methodologies.  Both methodologies indicated increases  from  baseline  in  MTDDI  were  seen  in  both  treatment  groups  through  Week 52,  with numerically smaller increases in the saxagliptin group.

For subgroups according to metformin use, increases were seen in MTDDI. However, the magnitude was not similar  between  subgroups  with  metformin  and  without  metformin  use  at  baseline.  Among subjects with metformin use at baseline, the increase in the saxagliptin group was 5.2 units and in the placebo group 7.58 units (difference in change from baseline saxagliptin versus placebo:  -2.38 units (95%  CI  [-5.06,  0.30])).  Among  subjects  with  no  metformin  use  at  baseline,  the  increase  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

saxagliptin  group  was  6.78  units  and  in  the  placebo  group  4.71  units  (difference  in  change  from baseline saxagliptin versus placebo: +2.06 units (95% CI [-1.94, 6.06])).

The effect of saxagliptin treatment on body weight was analyzed using the repeated measures analysis (mixed model) and LOCF methodologies.  The results from the LOCF analyses for both endpoints were similar to those from the repeated measures analysis in that numerical increases from baseline in body weight were seen in both treatment groups through Week 52.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients  treated  with  insulin  resulted  in  a  modest,  but  statistically significant  decrease  of  HbA1c.  The  maximum  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  reached  at  week  12  and  was maintained trough week 24. The mean placebo corrected decrease was -0.41%. Secondary endpoints were in line with this result.

Results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use at baseline.

In both groups a relative large percentage of patients discontinued because of lack of glycaemic control (22.7% vs 32.8% in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively).

There  were  differences  in  effect  according  to  geographic  region.  These  differences  were  due  to  a difference  in  placebo  response,  with  no  effect  of  placebo  in  Asian  patients  and  the  largest  effect  in Latin  America  patients.  In  European  patients  the  placebo-corrected  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  very modest: -0.29%. However, a difference in placebo-corrected response between Asian and European patients or Asian and White patients has also been observed with another DPP-4 inhibitor. In study 057, there was no significant difference in placebo-corrected HbA1c between White patients and Asian patients, perhaps because of the inclusion of Latin American patients who had both a large response on placebo and on saxagliptin.

The placebo group  already  had  a  reduction  in  HbA1c  of  0.32%,  questioning  whether  subjects  were truly diet/exercise failures or not. The possible main reasons are a 'study effect', i.e. patients being more aware of their lifestyle and glucose control, and increase in insulin dose. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated  that  saxagliptin  plus  insulin  produced  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  HbA1c compared to placebo plus insulin after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, with a treatment difference of 0.41% compared to the reduction with placebo alone.

Long-term data are  consistent  with  a  sustained  treatment  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  HbA1c,  up  to  52 weeks of treatment.

## 2.3. Clinical safety aspects

## 2.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

## Patient exposure

In  study  057,  a  total  of  455  subjects  (saxagliptin:  304;  placebo:  151)  received  double-blind  study medication during the 52-week ST+LT period. The mean duration of exposure to study medication was 46.5 weeks in the saxagliptin group and 46.7 in the placebo group. A total of 402 (88.4%) of these 455 subjects completed 24 weeks of treatment and entered the 28-week LT treatment period and 371 (81.5%) completed the 52-week ST+LT treatment period.

## 2.3.2. Results

## Adverse events

Saxagliptin  added  to  insulin  therapy  was  well  tolerated  with  a  safety  profile  comparable  to  that  of placebo. The incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation was similar between the 2 treatment  groups  (Table  7).  The  proportion  of  subjects  who  experienced  at  least  1  AE  during  the ST+LT  treatment  period  in  the  saxagliptin-treated  subjects  was  66.4%  and  71.5%  in  the  placebotreated subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 7 presents AEs (excluding events of hypoglycaemia) that occurred in ≥ 2% of subjects. In the saxagliptin  group  the  4  most  common  events  were  urinary  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis,  upper respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo group  the 4  most  common  events were influenza, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and nasopharyngitis.

The incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation was similar between the 2 treatment groups. The safety profile of saxagliptin was comparable to that of placebo. There were no unexpected adverse events.

Several related AEs occurring in ≤2 subjects were not included in the SmPC as justified by the MAH and agreed by CHMP.

With respect to the adverse events listed in Table 8, some of the adverse events were reported with higher frequencies in the saxagliptin group relative to the placebo group, most of which are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC, but not all of them (in particular the events \"bronchitis\" and \"arthralgia\"). During this procedure, the MAH clarified the methodology applied for inclusion of AEs in the SmPC,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

using  pooled  data  and  a  cut  off  difference  used  for  inclusion  of  AEs  in  section  4.8  and  this  was considered to be acceptable by the CHMP.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

One death, as a result of myocardial infarction, was reported during the 24-week ST period in a patient taking  saxagliptin.  The  investigator  judged  the  event  of  myocardial  infarction  to  be  very  severe  in intensity and considered the event not to be related to the study medication. The patient had a history of cardiovascular disease.

Another death occurred during the LT period in a patient taking saxagliptin but not metformin. The investigator reported an SAE of intestinal gangrene that was very severe / grade IV in intensity and judged by investigator as not being related to study medication.

Other serious adverse events (SAEs) during the ST+LT treatment period of Study 57 were reported for a similar proportion of subjects in the saxagliptin (25/304 subjects, 8.2%) and placebo (13/151 subjects, 8.6%) groups. Sixteen subjects in the saxagliptin group and also taking metformin had SAEs (7.7% of saxagliptin subjects taking metformin); 10 subjects in the placebo group and also taking metformin had SAEs (9.5% of placebo subjects taking metformin).

## Adverse events leading to discontinuation

Twelve subjects (9 [3.0%] in the saxagliptin group and 3 [2.0%] in the placebo group) discontinued study medication due to AEs during the ST+LT treatment period. Six subjects in the saxagliptin group and  also  taking  metformin  had  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (2.9%  of  saxagliptin  subjects  taking metformin); 2 subjects in the placebo group and also taking metformin had SAEs (1.9% of placebo subjects taking metformin).

Most AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported to be of mild or moderate intensity. Severe or very severe AEs led to discontinuation in 4 subjects in the saxagliptin group and 1 subject in the placebo group.

## Adverse events of special interest

AEs of hypoglycaemia were recorded and analysed separately from other AEs. Confirmed hypoglycaemia was defined by a fingerstick glucose value ≤50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) with associated hypoglycaemia symptoms. The overall frequency of confirmed hypoglycaemic events with associated symptoms during  the  ST+LT  treatment  period  was  7.6%  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  6.6%  in  the placebo  group.  During  the  ST+LT  treatment  period,  23  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  (15/209 [7.2%]  subjects  taking  metformin  and  8/95  [8.4%]  not  taking  metformin)  and  10  subjects  in  the placebo  group  (5/105  [4.8%]  subjects  taking  metformin  and  5/46  [10.9%]  subjects  not  taking metformin) had confirmed events of hypoglycaemia. Most of these confirmed hypoglycaemic events with associated symptoms were mild or moderate in intensity. Five severe confirmed hypoglycaemic events were reported: 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group with 4 severe events and 3 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo group with 3 severe events.  There were no reports of very severe confirmed hypoglycaemic events with associated symptoms.

A total of 56 (18.4%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 30 (19.9%) subjects in the placebo group experienced any hypoglycaemic AE during the ST treatment period and prior to rescue. Overall, during the ST+LT treatment period, a total of 69 (22.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 40 (26.5%) subjects  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  a  hypoglycaemic  AE.  These  included  hypoglycaemia  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

19.4%  and  24.5%  of  subjects,  and  blood  glucose  decreased  in  4.3%  and  7.3%  of  subjects, respectively. Most hypoglycaemic events were of mild or moderate intensity.

The  proportion  of  subjects  who  had  AEs  included  in  the  SOC Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue Disorders was  similar  in  the  saxagliptin  (4.9%)  and  placebo  (5.3%)  groups.  The  most  common  of these AEs were allergic dermatitis, skin ulcer, and urticaria each in 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group  and  dermatitis  and  rash  each  in  2  (1.3%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.Skin-related  AEs matching the predefined PTs were reported for 3 (1.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group (all taking metformin) and 1 (0.7%, taking metformin) subject in the placebo group.  All of these AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, none were SAEs, and none led to discontinuation.

A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  had  AEs  prior  to  rescue  in  the  SOC Infections  and  Infestations (saxagliptin: 35.5%; placebo: 41.1%). These AEs most common AEs in this SOC included urinary tract infection,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis  and  influenza;  the  incidence  of  these events was balanced across the treatment groups.

One  (0.3%)  subject  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  no  subject  in  the  placebo  group  had  an  AE  of Lymphopenia .

One (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo group had an AE of thrombocytopenia prior to rescue. For the subject in the saxagliptin group, the investigator reported a non-serious AE of thrombocytopenia for a platelet count of 39 x103 c/μL (39 x109 c/L). The study medication was interrupted due to the thrombocytopenia, the platelet count returned to normal at the next measurement, the event of thrombocytopenia resolved, and the study medication was restarted. The  investigator  judged  the  event  to  be  moderate  in  intensity  and  possibly  related  to  the  study medication.

One (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group and no subject in the placebo group had an AE of pedal oedema . This AE was mild in intensity, and considered by the investigator not to be related to study drug treatment, and was still continuing as of last contact with the subject.

Six subjects (4 [1.3%] in the saxagliptin group and 2 [1.3%] in the placebo group had cardiovascular AEs that were confirmed by an adjudication committee: in the saxagliptin group there were two SAEs of acute myocardial infarction, one intestinal gangrene, and one case of acute coronary syndrome. In the placebo group there was a SAE of thalamic infarction and a SAE of transient ischaemic attack.

SAEs in 3 other saxagliptin subjects (myocardial ischemia and cardiac failure, cardiac failure in, and hypertension and angina were not confirmed by the adjudication committee.

None of these AEs were considered by the investigator  to be related to study medication.

Three  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  1  (0.7%)  subject  in  the  placebo  group  had hypersensitivity AEs . Two of these hypersensitivity AEs occurred during the short-term study period, both in the saxagliptin group (reported term of allergy symptoms, and urticaria). In the LT period there were two cases of urticarial, one in the saxagliptin group and one in the placebo group.

No subject in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo group had an AE matching the pre-specified preferred terms for pancreatitis .

Six subjects, 3 (1.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 3 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo group had fracture AEs. These included foot fracture in the 2(0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group, ankle fracture in 1 (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group, and 1 (0.7%) subject each with hand fracture, humerus fracture, and lower limb fracture in the placebo group. Ankle fracture in the saxagliptin group was an SAE, but none of these fractures were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug treatment and all resolved within 32 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders , there was no apparent difference between treatment groups, saxagliptin  group  57  (18.8%)  subjects  and  placebo  group  25  (16.6%)  subjects.  Gastrointestinalrelated AEs by PT reported by ≥2% of subjects in either treatment group during the ST period were constipation (3.9% versus 3.3% in the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively), diarrhoea (4.6% versus 4.6%, respectively), abdominal pain (2.6% versus 1.3%, respectively), gastritis (2.6% versus 1.3%, respectively), and nausea (1.6% versus 3.3%, respectively).

Overall, analysis of adverse events of special interest did not reveal unexpected adverse events.

There  was  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  between  the  saxagliptin  group  and  the placebo group.

## Laboratory findings

There  were  no  marked  abnormalities  reported  for  decreased  or  increased  platelets.  For  saxagliptintreated  subjects,  marked  abnormalities  were  reported  in  2  (0.7%)  subjects  each  for  decreased hemoglobin  and  decreased  hematocrit,  and  for  1  (0.3%)  subject  for  decreased  neutrophils.  For placebo-treated  subjects,  marked  abnormalities  were  reported  in  2  (1.3%)  subjects  for  decreased hematocrit and 1 (0.7%) subject for decreased leukocytes.

Marked abnormalities of decreased lymphocytes were noted for 3 (1.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group  and  2  (1.3%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  Two  additional  placebo-treated  subjects  had baseline (Day -1) lymphocyte counts that were considered to be marked laboratory abnormalities. Of these  marked  laboratory  abnormalities,  1  in  the  saxagliptin  group  was  reported  as  an  AE  of lymphopenia.

Increased eosinophils were noted for 9 (3.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 7 (4.7%) subjects in the placebo group.

Alkaline phosphatase levels elevated &gt;1.5 × ULN were noted for 10 (3.3%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 5 (3.3%) subjects in the placebo group. Additionally, there were 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo with alkaline phosphatase levels &gt;3 × baseline and &gt;ULN. Markedly abnormal elevated ALT (&gt;3 × ULN) was reported for 5 (1.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 3 (2.0%) in the placebo group. Of these, 3 saxagliptin-treated subjects and 1 placebo-treated subject had marked elevations of  ALT during the ST treatment period. One (0.7%) subject in the placebo group had markedly abnormal elevated total bilirubin (&gt;1.5 × ULN). However, no subject had ALT &gt;3 × ULN and a total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN or ALT &gt;3 × ULN and a total bilirubin

&gt;2 mg/dL (34.2 μmol/L) (see CV181057 ST+LT CSR Table 8.7.2).

Marked abnormalities of elevated AST (&gt; 3 x ULN) were noted for 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and no subject in the placebo group.

Six (2.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 2 (1.4%) subjects in the placebo group had marked abnormalities of elevated CK &gt;5 × ULN. In most cases these elevations represented a single high value and CK levels had returned to within normal limits (or were much lower) by the last recorded value.

Sixteen subjects (8 [2.7%] in the saxagliptin group and 8 [5.4%] in the placebo group) had marked abnormalities of elevated potassium (≥1.2 × baseline and ≥6.0 mEq/L [6.0 mmol/L]). In most cases, these elevations represented a single high value and potassium levels had returned to within normal limits by the last recorded value.

Decreased potassium levels were reported as marked abnormalities (&lt;0.8 × baseline and ≤3.2 mEq/L [3.2 mmol/L]) for 3 (1.0%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) in the placebo group. In all

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4 subjects, these decreases represented just 1 or 2 low values and potassium levels had returned to within normal limits by the last recorded value.

The most frequent urinary marked abnormality was urinary WBCs (measured quantitatively),which was present  in  35/115  (30.4%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  10/53  (18.9%)  subjects  in  the placebo  group.  Marked  abnormalities  of  haematuria  (measured  via  dipstick)  were  seen  in14/297 (4.7%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  2/146  (1.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  Few subjects  had  marked  abnormalities  of  urinary  protein  (8/297  [2.7%]  saxagliptin  subjects  and3/146 [2.1%] placebo subject) or urinary RBCs (8/53 [15.1%]saxagliptin subjects and 1/31 [3.2%] placebo subject. Based on further clarification provided by the MAH, the urine microscopy numerical differences in Study CV181057 represents probably a chance variation and this was agreed by CHMP.

## Vital signs

Of the 227 subjects who had normal ECG tracings at baseline, 15/153 (9.8%) who received saxagliptin and 11/74 (14.9%) who received placebo had abnormal tracings at Week 52. A varying spectrum of ECG abnormalities was noted over all treatment groups.

No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressures or heart rate in either treatment group during the double blind treatment period.

In  the  Short-term  study  report,  the  MAH  presented  the  ECG  findings  for  all  patients  who  had  an abnormal ECG during lead-in or short term treatment period. The MAH had then been requested to present the data for patients who turned form normal ECG at baseline to abnormal at week 24and none of the abnormal ECG tracings was found to be of clinical relevance.

## 2.3.3. Discussion

In general saxagliptin was well tolerated. There were no unexpected or new adverse events.

The proportion of subjects who experienced at least 1 AE during the ST+LT treatment period in the saxagliptin-treated subjects was 66.4% and 71.5% in the placebo-treated subjects.

In  the  saxagliptin  group  the  4  most  common  events  were  urinary  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis, upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo  group  the  4  most  common events were influenza, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and nasopharyngitis.

One death, as a result of myocardial infarction, was reported during the 24-week ST period in a patient taking  saxagliptin.  Another  death,  due  to  intestinal  gangrene,  occurred  during  the  LT  period  in  a patient  taking  saxagliptin  but  not  metformin.  Both  deaths  were  considered  not  related  to  study medication. Cardiovascular events will be monitored closely and the data presented in Periodic Safety Update Reports.

Several related AEs occurring in ≤2 subjects, were not included in the SmPC. However, the MAH had given a thorough rationale for why these AEs had not been included and that was accepted by CHMP.

Patients on saxagliptin had no more hypoglycaemia than placebo treated patients.

With respect to vital signs, the MAH had been requested during the procedure to present the data for patients who turned from normal ECG at baseline to abnormal at week 24. None of the abnormal ECG tracings was found to be of clinical relevance and therefore this was satisfactory for the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4. Risk management plan

The MAH provided the following justification for not submitting an update of the current RMP as part of this type II variation: The Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Fixed Dose Combination EU Risk Management Plan version 2 (dated 21 September 2011) was updated to include long-term exposure data from study CV181057 as well as data on identified and potential risks. Thus, version 2 of the EU RMP appropriately summarizes  important  identified  and  potential  risks  for  the  saxagliptin  and  metformin  fixed  dose combination in the context of the approved indications as well as the change in indication proposed with this type II variation (use in combination with insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus). The Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Fixed Dose Combination EU Risk Management Plan version 2 (dated 21 September 2011) was provided in the context of the recent MAA submission; reference is therefore made to the documents provided in eCTD sequence 0005 (dated 19 October 2011).

This justification was considered acceptable by CHMP.

## 2.5. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:

## SmPC:

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Komboglyze  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  adult patients  aged  18 years  and  older  with  type 2 diabetes  mellitus  inadequately  controlled  on  their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already being treated with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin as separate tablets.

Komboglyze  is  also  indicated  in  combination  with  insulin  (i.e.,  triple  combination  therapy)  as  an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus when insulin and metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

. . .

## For patients switching from separate tablets of saxagliptin and metformin

Patients  switching  from  separate  tablets  of  saxagliptin  and  metformin  should  receive  the  doses  of saxagliptin and metformin already being taken.

For  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  dual  combination  therapy  of  insulin  and  metformin,  or,  for patients controlled on triple combination therapy of insulin, and metformin plus saxagliptin as separate tablets.

The dose of Komboglyze should provide saxagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When Komboglyze is used in combination with insulin, a lower dose of insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## General

Komboglyze  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  type 1 diabetes  mellitus  or  for  the  treatment  of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Komboglyze is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

. . .

Use with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia

Insulin is known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Komboglyze.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

. . .

Hypoglycaemia

. . .

When  used  as  add-on  to  insulin  (with  or  without  metformin),  the  overall  incidence  of  reported hypoglycaemia was 18.4% for Onglyza 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

. . .

Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with insulin (with or without metformin)

A  total  of  455 patients  with  type 2 diabetes  participated  in  a  24-week  randomised,  double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with a stable dose  of  insulin  (baseline  mean:  54.2 Units)  in  patients  with  inadequate  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c ≥ 7.5%  and  ≤ 11%)  on  insulin  alone  (n=141)  or  on  insulin  in  combination  with  a  stable  dose  of metformin (n=314). Saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin with or without metformin provided significant improvements  after  24 weeks  in  HbA1c  and  PPG  compared  with  placebo  add-on  to  insulin  with  or without  metformin.  Similar  HbA1c  reductions  versus  placebo  were  achieved  for  patients  receiving saxagliptin  5 mg  add-on  to  insulin  regardless  of  metformin  use  (-0.4%  for  both  subgroups). Improvements  from  baseline  HbA1c  were  sustained  in  the  saxagliptin  add-on  to  insulin  group compared to the placebo add-on to insulin group with or without metformin at Week 52. The HbA1c change for the saxagliptin group (n=244) compared to placebo (n=124) was -0.4% at Week 52.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition minor editorial corrections have been made throughout the Product Information (attachment 1).

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  insulin  or  insulin  plus  metformin  was investigated in one clinical study (057). This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 455 patients, insufficiently controlled by insulin or insulin plus metformin. After screening and lead-in, patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive saxagliptin 5 mg qd or placebo for 24 weeks. After this short term period, patients entered a long-term phase of 28 weeks.

The  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients  treated  with  insulin  or  insulin  plus  metformin  resulted  in  a statistically significant decrease of HbA1c. The maximum was reached at week 12 and was maintained through week 24. The mean placebo corrected decrease was -0.41%. Secondary endpoints were in line with this result. Results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use at baseline.

Mean  total  insulin  dose  increased  from  baseline  to  week  24  in  both  groups.  However,  the  mean increase was lower in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units) than in the placebo group (5.0 units).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Placebo-corrected mean reductions from baseline HbA1c were -0.20% [95% CI -0.62% to 0.21%] for EU subjects and -0.46% [95% CI -0.65% to -0.26%] for non-EU subjects. Analysis of data did not reveal a treatment-by-region interaction. There was no difference in effect between Whites and Asian people. Mean difference from control was -0.44% and -0.46% respectively.

Long-term data are  consistent  with  a  sustained  treatment  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  HbA1c,  up  to  52 weeks of treatment.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

In  both  groups  a  relatively  large  percentage  of  patients  discontinued  because  of  lack  of  glycaemic control (22.7% vs 32.8 in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively).

There  was  a  relatively  large  reduction  in  HbA1c  of  0.32%  in  the  placebo  group.  The  possible  main reasons are a 'study effect', i.e. patients being more aware of their lifestyle and glucose control, and increase in insulin dose. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated that saxagliptin plus insulin produced a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo plus insulin after 24 weeks of doubleblind treatment, with a treatment difference of 0.41%.

Considering the large number of sites and the small number of subjects enrolled at most sites, a centre effect  could  not  be  excluded.  However,  an  analysis  of  centre  effects  was  not  considered  to  provide additional meaningful information due to the large number of sites and the small number of subjects enrolled at most sites and the MAH's approach was considered acceptable by CHMP.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In general saxagliptin (in insulin-treated patients with or without metformin) was well tolerated. There were no unexpected or new adverse events.

The proportion of subjects who experienced at least 1 AE during the ST+LT treatment period in the saxagliptin-treated subjects was 66.4% and 71.5% in the placebo-treated subjects.

In  the  saxagliptin  group  the  4  most  common  events  were  urinary  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis, upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo  group  the  4  most  common events were influenza, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and nasopharyngitis.

Patients on saxagliptin had no more hypoglycaemia than placebo treated patients.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

During the short-term treatment period, there was one death due to myocardial infarction and two other cardiovascular-related SAEs  in  the saxagliptin group,  all considered  unrelated  to study medication. Patients had already a cardiovascular history and/or hypercholesterolemia.

Another death, due to intestinal gangrene, occurred during the long-term treatment period. This event was also not considered related to study drug.

There were 3 (1.0%) subjects who reported skin or neuropathic ulcers in the saxagliptin treatment group.  These  ulcers  were  mild  in  intensity,  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation,  and  resolved  during saxagliptin therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The  addition  of  saxagliptin  (in  insulin-treated  patients  with  or  without  metformin)  resulted  in  a decrease in HbA1c for the whole population. However, in both groups a relative large percentage of patients  discontinued  because  of  lack  of  glycaemic  control  (22.7%  vs  32.8  in  the  saxagliptin  and placebo group, respectively). However, in this heavily treated population with advanced diabetes, the total effect was considered sufficient and clinically relevant by CHMP.

Saxagliptin (in insulin-treated patients with or without metformin) was in general well tolerated, with no unexpected findings, and no more side effects than the placebo treated patients. Although three cardiac adverse events were serious, there was no established relation with saxagliptin. Cardiovascular adverse events will be closely monitored and reported in PSURs. There were no abnormal ECG tracings of clinical importance.

## Benefit-risk balance

The effect of adding saxagliptin (in insulin-treated patients with or without metformin) on HbA1c was modest, however considered still clinically relevant for the patient group involved. Treatment was not associated  with  an  increase  in  events  of  hypoglycaemia,  and  there  was  slightly  less  of  a  need  to increase  the  daily  insulin  dose  over  time  in  the  saxagliptin  group.  Saxagliptin  was  well  tolerated. Cardiovascular adverse events will be closely monitored and reported in PSURs.

## Conclusions

The  benefit  risk  balance  for  Komboglyze  in  the  combined  use  with  insulin  is  considered  positive  by CHMP.

## 4. Recommendations
