| II/0075 | Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics in order to reflect change in the existing warning on immunogenicity and immunomodulation and add new clinical information on infantile onset patients (IOPD) immune tolerance induction based on data on use of immune tolerance induction in infantile onset Pompe disease patients from two exploratory Phase 4 studies (AGLU03707 / MSC12817 and companion study AGLU03807/ MSC12892) and the Duke Center of Excellence Observational Study (01562). The updated RMP version 9.1 has also been submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 28/11/2019 | 10/11/2020 | SmPC | Based on the review of the submitted data, new clinical SmPC information (section 5.1) related to the Duke Center Observational Study (01562) was added. Furthermore, considerations on specific populations were added to the existing SmPC warning related to immune system changes. The Committee considered that the study results of AGLU03807 (very low number of patients) and AGLU03707 (not relevant to the existing warning) should not be included in the SmPC. |

| ADRs 'nephrotic syndrome', 'proteinuria', 'stridor' and 'vasoconstriction', and section 4.4 of the SmPC to amend the existing warning related to 'nephrotic syndrome'. The Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the RMP version number in annex II to reflect the latest version agreed with CHMP (version 6), to make editorial changes to the annexes and to update the contact details in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | II, Labelling and PL   | cases of nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria (from the International Birth Date, 29 March 2006 to March 2011), and stridor and vasoconstriction (from 29 March 2006 to 28 June 2011). Reports of immune-mediated reactions in patients treated with Myozyme remain \"uncommon\" (<1/100; ≥1/1000). Cases suggestive of immune-mediated reactions included reports of nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, haematuria, skin lesion, skin necrosis, arthralgia, myalgia, arthropathy, lymphadenopathy, serum sickness, and type III immune complex mediated reaction. Proteinuria was observed in 5 patients, 3 of whom developed nephrotic syndrome associated with high antibody titres (≥ 102,400). Among the patients with nephritic syndrome, 1 was male and 2 were female; 1 was an infant and 2 were adults. Renal biopsy in these 3 patients stained positive with rhGAA antibody consistent with immune complex deposition, thus confirming the previously recognized potential risk of immune-mediated reactions to be an identified risk. As further support identifying nephrotic syndrome as a risk of treatment with alglucosidase alfa, all 3 patients improved following treatment interruption. From the International Birth Date of 29 March 2006 through 28 June 2011, cumulatively 3 patients experienced stridor in addition to other IARs that occurred during infusion. The events resolved in all cases upon infusion interruption, administration of corticosteroids and or administration of epinephrine.   |

No significant adverse findings on embryofoetal development were observed in a mouse and a rabbit embryofoetal study and no significant adverse findings were observed in a mouse fertility and early embryonic development study. In the rabbit embryofoetal development study, following administration of Myozyme (10-40 mg/kg/day) with coadministration of diphenhydramine, a treatment-related increase in the incidence of abortions and early delivery was observed. This effect was partly attributable to maternal toxicity, as a significant decrease in feed consumption and body weight   |

| II/0001   | This variation relates to an update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) as a consequence of reports of serious cases of anaphylaxia. Corresponding sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) have been updated accordingly. In addition, minor changes were included in the list of local representatives.

| None of these events was due to an inappropriate infusion  rate or dose.  During the clinical trials, 4 female patients experienced  serious oedema-IARs while receiving  20 mg/kg Myozyme. Three of the 4 patients had late-onset  Pompe disease with a mean age at time of IAR occurrence  of 33.3 years (age range 29 to 39 years). The remaining  patient was a 25-month-old with infantile-onset Pompe  disease. Events of oedema by MedDRA preferred term  included periorbital oedema, swollen tongue, face oedema,  and oedema peripheral (1 patient each). The time of onset  was either during the infusion (2 cases) or 1.5 and 2 h  following completion of the injection (2 cases). All patients  continued to receive Myozyme, either at lower doses and/or  with premedication, with either no reaction or reduced  intensity reactions.  There had also been 1 case of oedema-IAR with Pharming rhGAA 10 mg/kg in a late-onset Pompe disease patient.  In addition, previous to the granting of the MA, there were 4 cases of serious anaphylactic/anaphylactoid-IARs with bronchospasm, decreased oxygen saturation and/or hypotension. All 4 patients were females with infantile- onset Pompe disease receiving Myozyme at a dose of 20 mg/kg QOW. At time of IAR occurrence, mean age of patients was 13 months (age range 5 to 25 months). All patients continued to receive Myozyme, except one.  Myozyme is contra-indicated in patients with a  hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) to the active   |
