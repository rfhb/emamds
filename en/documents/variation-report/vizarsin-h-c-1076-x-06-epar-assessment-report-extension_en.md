## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

ersible tablets (ODT) aceutical form for Vizarsin, which is currently licensed as film coated tablets. This application for an extension of marketing authorisation is to introduce orodisp as new pharm m-coated tablets. Vizarsin film-coated tablets contain sildenafil as sildenafil citrate as active substance. For the orodispersible tables sildenafil free base is used as active substance instead of the salt sildenafil ess bitter than the latter. The indication for Vizarsin is the same as the reference medicinal product. Vizarsin is a generic medicinal product. The reference medicinal product is Viagra fil citrate, because it is l

The new ODT formulation can be taken with or without liquid. It may be used as an alternative to film coated tablets.

Vizarsin ordispersible tablets are packaged in OPA/Al/PVC/Al perforated unit dose blisters.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

Sildenafil occurs as white to almost white powder. Sildenafil base does not contain any chiral centre and therefore it does not exhibit isomerism. The active substance does not exhibit polymorphism.

Adequate In-Process Controls are applied during the manufacture of the active substance. The and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents, have specifications been presented and are satisfactory.

## Specification

The specifications of sildenafil free base include appearance, solubility, identification of sildenafil (IR), ulphated ash, heavy metals, related substances, assay of sildenafil, and residual solvent. water, s e specifications and Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within th consistent from batch to batch.

Since sildenafil free base is less bitter than sildenafil citrate, the development was can be expected with a formulation containing sildenafil free base compared to a formulation with sildenafil citrate. In addition stress stability studies were performed showing that stability of tablets prepared with sildenafil base was adequate and comparable to stability of the reference medicinal product. Sildenafil citrate has extensive bitter taste, the first trials thus aimed at succes Despite different approaches implemented, bitter taste of sildenafil citrate could not be mas continued with sildenafil base. Dissolution studies showed that similar in-vivo performance

The selection of excipients was the most critical step to achieve suitable characteristics of the finished product in the form of orodispersible tablets, especially fast and spontaneous disintegration in the mouth, pleasant taste and mouth feel. The chosen excipients are well known for the manufacture of solid dosage forms.

The excipients used in the formulation are hydroxypropylcellulose (binder), mannitol (diluent), aspartame (sweetening agent), neohesperidin-dihydrochalcone (sweetening agent), spearmint oil

## Stability of the product

Stability studies have been performed on three batches per strength packaged in the proposed packaging material under normal (25°C/60%RH), intermediate (30°C/65%RH) and accelerated conditions (40°C/75%RH). Results have been reported for up to 12 months in normal and for six months accelerated conditions and remained within the proposed specifications.

In addition stability results on one batch of bulk 25 mg tablets packed in PE bag / alutriplex bag stored at temperature 20-25°C and relative humidity 25-65%RH for six months were presented. The lowest tablet strength was chosen for this study because it was considered as the most critical since the

According to the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, it may be sufficient to establish bioequivalence at only one or two strengths depending on product characteristics as well as the pharmacokinetics of the active substance (linearity).

The applicant applied for a biowaiver for the 25 mg and the 50 mg ODT formulations. A single bioequivalence study was done with sildenafil 100 mg orodispersible tablets. The use of the highest strength is generally recommended in case of linear kinetics also considering analytical and safety/tolerability aspects. For sildenafil the drug input is deemed to be linear over the therapeutic range.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the 50 mg and 25 mg strengths it was demonstrated that:

- by the same process;  the pharmaceutical products are manufactured
- ortional;  the quantitative composition in the table core is prop
-  the qualitative compositions of the different strengths is the same;
- son of dissolution profiles was performed in three dissolution media 0.1M HCl, pH 4.5 acetate n quality control dissolution medium 0.01M HCl.  the dissolution profiles were found to be very similar in various media tested.The compari buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer.

Furthermore, the CHMP considered that the in-study validation shows acceptable calibration standards (zero) and QC values. It was noted that incurred sample analysis demonstrated that the analysis was robust. According to the CHMP the pre-study validation of the analytical method value was excluded from calculations. The LLOQ is lower than 5% of the minimum

The pharmacokinetic analyses based on the linear trapezoidal rule are appropriate. The statistical analysis performed is parametric, except for Tmax, in accordance with the Guideline on the investigation on bioequivalence. The employed software was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The CHMP considered that based on the statistical analysis, test and reference product are bioequivalent. The 90% confidence intervals calculated for AUC0-t and Cmax of sildenafil were inside the acceptance range of 80.00 - 125.00.
