## I.        SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

PegIntron  (peginterferon  alfa-2b)  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV. PegIntron is best used in combination with ribavirin. Approximately 33%  of  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  (HIV)  infected  patients  are  co-infected  with  hepatitis  C (HCV) in Europe. This represents a serious public health issue that needs special attention, insofar as Hepatitis C infection in HCV-HIV coinfected individuals seems to have a more aggressive course. The Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  of  peginterferon  alfa-2b  is  now  submitting  a  variation  to introduce information in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC of Rebetol (ribavirin) and pegylated  interferon  alfa-2b  based  on  the  clinical  experience  gained  in  the  HIV-HCV  co-infected patients.

Two phase III randomised open label studies, not sponsored by the MAH, are submitted in support of this variation: -P01017 or RIBAVIC study independently conducted in France by the Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA (ANRS) - study period: February  2000 to October  2003, -P02080 a smaller investigator initiated study conducted in Spain- study period: April 2001 to February 2004. Both  studies  aimed  at  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  standard  interferon  alfa-2b  to  the pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin combination in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. 1.2.     Clinical Efficacy The main differences in studies P01017 and P02080 are outlined below followed by a description of the studies: Design Title RIBAVIC  P01017: A  Randomised  Controlled  Trial  of  pegylated  interferon  alfa-2b  plus  ribavirin versus standard interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin for initial treatment of Hepatitis C in HIV infected patients. P02080/ Laguno: Effectiveness of the safety and efficacy of the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients  infected  with  the  Human  immunodeficiency  virus  comparing  two  types  of  interferon  and ribavirin. The dose of ribavirin: -P01017 study: 800 mg regardless of the genotype. The choice of the dose was adapted for safety concerns, particularly the possibility of an interaction with antiretroviral treatment and because HIV positive are usually lighter than HIV negative patients. -P02080 study : weight adjusted dose 800 to 1200 mg as for monoinfected patients.

Baseline characteristics The population enrolled was similar in both studies. Mainly males of approximately 40 years of age with  a  long  past  of  HIV  infection  (around  10  years)  well  controlled  under  antiretroviral  therapy  as reflected by the immuno-virologic parameters [CD4 + around 450 (P01017) to 550/mm 3 (P02080) and HIV-RNA level around 2 (P02080) to 3.5 log/copies/ml (P01017)]. Patients were mostly of genotype 1 and 2/3. The Antiretroviral Therapy at baseline is summarised in the table below (Table 3): 3TC = lamivudine; ABC = Abacavir; AZT = zidovudine; DDI = didanosine; D4T = stavudine; EFV = efavirenz; HAART = Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; IDV = indinavir; NEL = nelfinavir; NEV = nevirapine; NNRTI = Non-Nucleoside analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; NRTI = Nucleoside analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; RTV = ritonavir; SQL = saquinavir. Source Data: P01017 CSR Section 10.3 and P02080 CSR Section 10.1. More than 80% of patients were treated with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAARTs). This illustrates  the  representativeness  of  the  population  enrolled  in  2000-2001  in  these  studies.  Of importance as regards the overlapping toxicity, stavudine (lactic acidosis) and zidovudine (anaemia) accounted  for  the  most  frequently  combined  Nucleoside  analogue  Reverse  Transcriptase  Inhibitors (NRTIs) together with lamivudine.

## Activity Scores- Metavir A

More  patients  improved  (28%)  than  worsened  (10%)  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b/Rebetol  arm (p=0.0002).  In  the  IntronA/Rebetol  arm,  no  difference  was  noted  (improvement  17%,  worsening 17%).

## Univariate logistic regression of SVR data  - Study P02080

As expected, response rates in Stratum 1 (Genotype 2 or 3 with baseline low viral load) were higher than in Stratum 2 (Genotype 1 or 4 regardless of viral load and genotype 2 or 3 with high viral load) at all measured time points after Week 4.

-  TW12 against  FU24

Of the peginterferon alfa-2b /ribavirin-treated subjects that had a virologic response at Week 12, 21/28 (75%) had SVR at FU24. In the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin arm, 8/15 (53%) subjects with a virologic response  at  treatment  Week  12  went  on  to  have  SVR  at  FU24.  The  negative  predictive  value  at treatment Week  12  was  very  strong  as has been previously reported. Of  the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin-treated subjects that were nonresponders at Week 12, 22/24 (92%) did not reach SVR at  FU24.  In  the  interferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin  arm,  27/28  (96%)  subjects  that  were  nonresponders  at treatment Week 12 did not reach SVR at FU24.

Relapse rate (only provided for study P02080) Twenty-two subjects  (42.3%)  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin  treatment  arm  had  undetectable HCV RNA at both End of Treatment (EOT)  and Follow up week 24 (FU24) compared with 9 subjects (20.9%)  in  the  IntronA/ribavirin  treatment  arm.  Relapse  rates,  defined  as  the  probability  of  having detectable HCV-RNA at FU24 given that a subject had undetectable HCV RNA at EOT, were 6/28 (21.4%)  in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm  and  0/9 (0%)  in the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm. Only subjects with available data were included in the calculation of relapse rates. Predictive Values of an Early Virologic Response Study P01017 The combination of detectable serum HCV-RNA  and a viral load decline of less than 2 log10 IU x 103/l from baseline predicted 91% of failures to achieve a sustained virologic response in the peginterferon group and 96% in the standard interferon group (P=0.15, Fisher's exact test). The corresponding rates at Week 12 were 99% and 100%, respectively (P=0.43). Undetectable HCV-RNA at Week 4 predicted 83% of sustained virologic responses in the peginterferon alfa-2b group and 80% in  the  standard interferon group (P=1.00). The corresponding rates at Week 12 were 70% and 73% (P=0.84). Study P02080 An early  virological  response  was  defined  as  undetectable  serum  HCV  RNA  at  treatment  Week  4 (TW4) or treatment Week 12 (TW12). Subjects with missing data were excluded from the analysis. - TW4 against  FU24 As  observed  in  other  studies,  early  virologic  response  (EVR)  to  peginterferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin  at Treatment  Week  4,  has  a  strong  positive  predictive  value  for  SVR.  Of  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b /ribavirin-treated subjects that had a virologic response at Week 4, 12/13 (92%) had SVR at FU24. In the interferon alfa-2b /ribavirin arm, 3/6 (50%) subjects with a virologic response at treatment Week 4 had  SVR  at  FU24.  The  negative  predictive  value  at  treatment  Week  4  was  also  calculated.  Of  the peginterferon alfa-2b /ribavirin-treated subjects that were nonresponders at Week 4, 28/39 (72%) did not  reach  SVR  at  FU24.  In  the  interferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin  arm,  31/37  (84%)  subjects  that  were nonresponders at treatment Week 4 did not reach SVR at FU24. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Study P02080 - Analysis by Baseline Factors

## HCV Genotype:

Subgroup  analysis  of  the  virology  data  demonstrates  a  difference  between  treatment  groups  in  the proportion of subjects  with  Genotype 1 reaching SVR; 39.3% in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm versus 11% in the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin arm. For subjects with genotypes 2/3, the rates of SVR between the 2 treatment groups were similar; 53% in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin arm versus 47% in the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin arm. Few subjects were infected with Genotype 4 (n=4, peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin; n=9, interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin) and of those 13 subjects, only 1 had a SVR

In the RIBAVIC study the results observed in the pegylated arm were quite low as compared to the results achieved in the Laguno  and  Pegasys  study as well as in the tested hypothesis. These results are mainly driven by the poor response observed in genotype 1 and 4 (17%), that is less than what is observed in the Laguno study (38%). In the APRICOT study with Pegasys, SVR in genotype 1 was 29%.

Baseline HCV Viral Load: A higher percentage of subjects with low Baseline levels of HCV RNA (&lt;800,000 IU/ml) reached SVR in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment group (59%) compared with the interferon alfa-2b /ribavirin treatment arm (31%). As expected, the number of subjects with high baseline levels of HCV RNA  ( ≥ 800,000  IU/ml)  who  obtained  SVR  was  lower  overall;  however,  subjects  treated  with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin had  a  higher response  rate than those who  were  treated  with Intron A/ribavirin (29%, peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin; 15%, interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin). Liver Fibrosis Score: The extent of liver fibrosis also affected response rate; more subjects with low fibrosis grades (0 to 2) achieved SVR in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm (49%) compared with the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment arm (21%). Response rates in subjects with advanced fibrosis (grades 3 to 4) were slightly higher in subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin versus interferon alfa-2b /ribavirin (33%, peginterferon alfa-2b /ribavirin; 23%, interferon alfa-2b /ribavirin). HIV Variables : Forty-eight  percent  of  subjects  with  high  CD4 + cell  count  (&gt;560  x  106  cells/mm 3 )  and  in  the peginterferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin  group  achieved  SVR  compared  with  20%  in  the  interferon  alfa-2b /ribavirin  treatment  group.  The  benefit  of  peginterferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin  versus  interferon  alfa-2b /ribavirin  can  also  be  observed  in  subjects  with  lower  CD4 + counts  at  baseline  (40%,  peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin;  22%,  interferon  alfa-2b  /ribavirin).  As  expected,  response  rates  based  on  baseline HIV viral load ( ≤ 200 copies/ml versus &gt;200 copies/ml) trended in the same direction as baseline CD4 + counts. Those subjects with low baseline HIV viral load did slightly better than those with higher viral loads and those treated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin had better response rates than those treated with interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin. Age and Gender: All  subjects  were  between  30  and  59  years  old  (median  =  40  years  old).  Response  rates  were consistently  higher  for  peginterferon  alfa-2b/ribavirin  versus  IntronA/ribavirin,  regardless  of  age. There were more male subjects in the study and the response rate in that subgroup was lower than in female subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin  treatment  arm;  however,  regardless  of  gender, peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin-treated subjects had higher SVR than did interferon alfa-2b/ribavirintreated subjects. Discussion on Clinical Efficacy Sustained virologic response rates Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall, given that the population enrolled in the RIBAVIC and Laguno studies were very similar it is difficult  to  draw  a  formal  explanation as to the differences in  SVR that are only  observed in  the pegylated-interferon  alfa-2b  arm.  It  can  be  questioned  however  whether  the  lower  than  expected

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy with peginterferon alfa-2b in the RIBAVIC study might not reflect some over-compensation in dose reduction in order to manage the high rate of haematological adverse events observed.

The CHMP requested a comparison between the RIBAVIC and Laguno studies with regards to dose reduction and discontinuation due to haematological adverse reactions in order to be able to conclude whether a difference in the treatment discontinuation due to anaemia and neutropenia could explain the difference in the response rate in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm between both studies. In this field the  CHMP also requested the MAH to provide an analysis of the use of growth factors to manage haematological adverse events (AEs) in each of the studies.

The modelling approach used by the MAH included a smoothed plot of SVR rates by ribavirin dose expressed as mg/kg, and logistic regression analysis. This approach was considered as acceptable by the CHMP. Based on the modelling provided, a trend towards a well-balanced gain in efficacy versus loss  in  safety  (anaemia)  was  observed  (e.g.  as  compared  to  the  group  receiving  &lt;10.6mg/kg  RBV, patients  receiving  &gt;13.3mg/kg  RBV  showed  increase  in  SVR  rate:  +16%  and  increase  in  anaemia occurrence:  +20%).  Therefore,  a  favourable  benefit-risk  ratio  of  the  weight-base  ribavirin  dose  in co-infected patients is expected. Furthermore, from an efficacy point of view the recommendation of a weight-based  ribavirin  is  considered  as  a  conservative  measure  in  this  particularly  difficult-to-treat population.    This  approach  is  also  in  line  with  the  current  European  Consensus  conference  on HIV/HCV co-infection. Overall, the MAH's proposal to recommend a weight-based dose of ribavirin for co-infected patients, as for monoinfected, is supported by the CHMP.

The use of Erythropoietin (EPO) was not allowed in the Spanish study and was minimal in the ANRS study. The use of other growth factors than EPO in the ANRS study pertained to approximately 13% of patients with neutropenia (15% in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm and 10% in the IntronA arm). The CHMP decided that no conclusion could be drawn based on such limited data. The  proportion  of  patients  with  dose  reduction  of  ribavirin  (in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  arm)  for anaemia and the proportion of patients with dose reduction of peginterferon alfa-2b for neutropenia were  both  higher  in  the  Laguno  study  compared  to  the  RIBAVIC  study.  Moreover,  the  number  of discontinuations due to anaemia or neutropenia in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm was similar in both studies.  In view of the large difference in the SVR rate observed in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm in the  RIBAVIC  study  as  compared  to  the  Laguno  study,  which  is  surprisingly  not  observed  for  the IntronA arm, the only reason that could explain this difference would have been a difference in the incidence of neutropenia (which is expected to only impact the peginterferon alfa-2b arm). However, the  incidence  of  neutropenia  reported  in    the  Laguno  study    was  higher,  which  argues  against  this hypothesis.  The MAH suggests that a  higher ribavirin dose and closer patient management in the Laguno study explain the difference in the SVR rate observed in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm in the RIBAVIC study, however these factors would have been expected to impact both  peginterferon alfa2b/RBV and standard Interferon/RBV arms and so cannot explain the difference. Overall, the mechanism behind the lower SVR rate reported in the peginterferon alfa-2b/RBV arm in the RIBAVIC study as compared to the Laguno Study remains unclear. Weight based ribavirin dose The CHMP  noted that the MAH makes a recommendation using the treatment duration of the pivotal RIBAVIC  study  and  the  ribavirin  dose  close  to  the  Laguno  study  (in  line  with  the  recommended weight  based  dose  in  monoinfected  patients).  Nevertheless,  these  recommendations  are  reasonable insofar as 48 weeks treatment duration may be required to achieve HCV viral clearance. Whilst the CHMP agreed to the 48 week treatment duration, the committee noted that current discussions within the scientific community tend to favour 24 weeks treatment duration of HIV/HCV co-infected patients with genotype 2/3 as for monoinfected patients, provided that they achieve undetectability at week 4. Therefore the CHMP agreed that this issue will be further discussed by the MAH in the frame of a follow up measure. In order to ensure a positive benefit/risk ratio of the partially tested recommendation with regards to the ribavirin dose the MAH was requested to propose a modelisation to appreciate whether the gain in efficacy is not outweighed by the deterioration of the safety profile (anaemia).

## Histological response

The CHMP noted that only 51% of biopsies were obtained from patients enrolled in the P01017 study. Although it is acknowledged that to some extent obtaining 51% of the biopsies might well have been challenging,  it  remains  that  the  lack  of  histological  data  for  approximately  half  of  the  population enrolled is unfortunate for a reliable interpretation of the histological data. The MAH was requested to further  address  this  issue  in  order  to  specify  to  what  extent  the  population  with  biopsies  is representative  of  the  overall  population.  Based  on  a  comparison  of  demographic  and  clinical characteristics of subjects who did and did not undergo biopsy (Carrat et al 1 ), it was found that overall, subjects differed only with respect to the mean fibrosis score. Categorical analysis of the METAVIR fibrosis  score,  although  not  significant,  showed  that  the  mean  difference  was  mainly  due  to  a difference  in  the  proportions  of  scores  F2  and  F3.  More  subjects  who  underwent  biopsy  scored  F3 (29%) and fewer scored F2 (36%) compared to subjects who did not undergo biopsy (F3 17%; F2 42%). It is noteworthy that the frequency of cirrhosis (F4) was similar between the groups.

Overall, there were more haematological adverse events in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm compared to the    IntronA  arm  (neutropenia  26%  versus  14%,  thrombocytopenia  11%  versus  5%,    anaemia  10% versus 6%) and more injection site reactions in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm (23% versus 2% in the IntronA arm).  By contrast a higher proportion of patients experienced psychiatric adverse events in the IntronA arm compared to the peginterferon alfa-2b arm (e.g. depression 28% in the IntronA group versus 23% in the peginterferon alfa-2b group, insomnia 21% versus 14%) and a higher incidence of CD4 + lymphocytes decreased was also observed in the IntronA group.

In order to evaluate the bias that may have resulted from this imbalance, ANRS carried out a subgroup analysis of histological follow up data according to the fibrosis score (F2 or F3)  (Carrat et al 2 ). The analysis showed more severe progression of fibrosis in nonresponders with F3 than in those with F2. This result was expected, as progression of liver disease accelerates with time, and longer follow up would no doubt have led to similar conclusion in F2 subjects. However, the patterns of improvement in activity in responders were similar. The CHMP concluded that extrapolation of the histological response observed in the 51% of patients with available biopsy to the overall population is acceptable. Predictive Values of an Early Virologic Response The  CHMP  consider  that  information  on  positive  and  negative  predictive  value  is  important. Therefore,  inclusion  of  data  on  the  predictability  of  response  and  non-response  in  HCV/HIV  coinfected patients in the SPC is supported. Although not denying the interest of the predictability based on early response at Week 4, the predictability based on the early virological response at Week 12 should indeed be preferred for inclusion in the SPC at this time since more robust data are available as regards the predictive value of week 12 data (also derived from monoinfected patients). 1.3.    Safety Results Study P01017 Patient  exposure The clinical safety in patients in study P01017 was assessed on a total of 234 patients who remained on study at week 48 ;   118 (60.8%)  in the peginterferon alfa-2b and Rebetol arm;   116 (61.4%) in the IntronA and Rebetol arm. Adverse events Medicinal product no longer authorised

While it is well-known  that peginterferon alfa-2b is associated with more injection site reaction than standard interferon, the differences observed in terms of haematological abnormalities are somewhat surprising,  all  the  more  that  the  distribution  of  baseline  antiretroviral  therapy  treatment  was  similar between both treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compared to existing safety data in HCV monoinfected patients, the rate of adverse events reported in co-infected  patients  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  group  in  this  study  were  overall  similar  to  those reported  in  HCV  monoinfected  patients  treated  with  peginterferon/ribavirin  therapy.  However,  as rather  expected  a  higher  rate  of  haematological  adverse  events  (especially  thrombocytopenia)  was observed in the co-infected population receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment as compared to data in HCV monoinfected patients (thrombocytopenia &lt; 5% as noted in the peginterferon alfa-2b SPC).

Severity of adverse events 132 (68%) patients treated in the peginterferon alfa-2b/Rebetol arm had at least one Grade 3 or 4 event versus  113 (60%) in the IntronA/Rebetol arm (P=0.11 Fisher's exact test). 68 (35%) patients had at least one reported SAEs [from Day 0 (D0) to W72)] in the peginterferon alfa2b/Rebetol arm versus 68 (36%) in the IntronA/Rebetol arm (P=0.92 Fisher's exact test). No  significant  differences  were  observed  between  both  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  severity  of adverse events. However the rate of Grade 2 and Grade 3 adverse events in the System Organ Class (SOC)  Blood  and  lymphatic  disorders  was  twice  and  three  times  as  elevated  in  the  peginterferon alfa-2b  arm  as  in  the  IntronA  arm  respectively,  while  the  proportion  of  Grade  1  haematological adverse events was similar in both treatment groups. Death Overall, there were ten deaths in the RIBAVIC study [7 were presented in the clinical study report (CSR), 2 were not recorded in the CSR since they were registered from cohort follow-up of included patients]: 6 occurred in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm, 3 in the IntronA arm, and one for which it is unknown  whether  the  subject  was treated with peginterferon alfa-2b /ribavirin or interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin. The causes of death were: In the  peginterferon alfa-2b arm: -1 anoxia after inhalation of propyle nitrite -1 neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastasis -1 cirrhosis with hepatorenal syndrome, this case was related to anti-hepatitis C treatment -1 vulvar cancer with metastasis (HCV RNA negative, excluded) -1 oedemato-ascitic decompensation and hepatic encephalopathy -1 hepatic decompensation In the IntronA arm: -1 oedemato-ascitic decompensation of C virus cirrhosis, hepatocellular insufficiency and hepatic encephalopathy -1 hepatocellular carcinoma with bone metastasis -1 hepatic decompensation The last fatal case (unknown whether the patient received peginterferon alfa-2b or IntronA) was also due to hepatic decompensation in a patient with history of cirrhosis and oesophageal varicoses veins.

Overall  there  were  seven  subjects  with  cirrhosis  at  baseline  that  died  during  the  study.    Six  of  the deaths were due to hepatic decompensation. Of the 7 deaths of subjects with cirrhosis one   was a subject who died after randomisation but prior to first dose and another was treated for 4 weeks but was found to be HCV negative (ineligible subject).

HIV-HCV co-infected patients with cirrhosis at baseline were identified as being at higher risk  for developing  hepatic  decompensation.  Treatment  with  didanosine  and  elevated  bilirubin  were  also identified as a risk factor for severe liver disorders. These data reinforce the need of a strong warning for  close monitoring of all co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral and anti-hepatitis therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  detect  any  event  suggesting  a  hepatic  decompensation  in  order  to  immediately  discontinue  the treatment in this case.

## Adverse events leading to discontinuation

Overall,  33  of  194  patients  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  arm  (17%)  and  29  of  189  patients  in  the IntronA arm (15%) discontinued  treatment due to adverse events. The main adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were depression (5 patients), drug intolerance (4), treatment non compliance (4),  anaemia  (3)  and  asthenia  (3)  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  treatment  group  and  depression (7  patients)  and  drug  intolerance  (5)  in  the  IntronA  treatment  group.  Of  note,  two  patients  stopped peginterferon  alfa-2b  and  Rebetol  treatment  due  to  mitochondrial  cytopathy  and  3  patients  due  to lactic acidosis or blood lactic increased versus none and 1 patient in the IntronA group respectively.

4% and 1% of patients in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm developed Grade 3 and Grade 4 decreases in platelets respectively versus 1% and 0% of patients in the IntronA arm. Again, dose modification for thrombocytopenia  occurred  more  often  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  group  (5%)  compared  to  the IntronA-treated patients (1%). Moreover, one additional patient permanently discontinued treatment in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm due to severe thrombocytopenia.

Adverse events leading to dose reduction Table  8  below  presents  the  percentage  of  patients  having  experienced  dose  modification  in  each treatment group: Table 8 Dose modification The  proportion  of  patients  with  dose  modification  (interferon  and  ribavirin  or  ribavirin  alone)  was twice as important   in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm as in the IntronA arm. The differences were all statistically significant. These differences were mainly supported by higher percentages of haematologic adverse events leading to dose reduction in the peginterferon alfa-2b group (i.e anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) as detailed below. Laboratory findings Haemoglobin 2% of patients in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm experienced Hb&lt;8g/dl versus 0 in the IntronA arm. The percentage of patients with dose modification and discontinuation for anaemia was higher in the peginterferon  alfa-2b  group  (10%  and  1.5%  respectively)  compared  to  the  IntronA  group  (4%  and 1 % respectively) Neutrophils 15% and 4% of patients in the peginterferon alfa-2b group had a Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia compared  to  9%  and  2%  respectively  in  the  IntronA  group.  7%  of  peginterferon  alfa-2b  -treated patients  experienced  dose  modification  for  neutropenia  versus  3%  of  IntronA-treated  patients. Moreover, one additional patient permanently discontinued treatment in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm due to severe neutropenia. Platelets Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall the peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin arm was significantly associated with a higher rate of Grade  3/4  haematological  abnormalities  compared  to  IntronA  arm.  When  comparing  with  data  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monoinfected patients,  it  is  worth  noting  that  anaemia,  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  occurred more frequently in HCV-HIV co-infected patients.

## HIV disease-related laboratory findings

## CD4 + lymphocytes

13% of patients in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm (n=25) compared to 24% of patients in the IntronA arm (n=45) experienced a CD4 + lymphocyte decrease of &lt;200/mm 3 during  treatment.    It  should  be noted  that  safety  data  in  patients  with  CD4 + cell  count&lt;200/mm 3 remains  very  limited  since  these patients  had  not  the  possibility  to  be  included  in  the  study  (16  patients  had  protocol  violation  with CD4 + cell count &lt; 200/mm 3 ).

According  to  univariate  analysis,  spontaneous  hepatic  decompensation  was  significantly  associated with higher duration of HIV infection,  lower CD4 + cells, higher liver fibrosis score assessed by the METAVIR  scoring  system,  higher  total  bilirubin,  phosphatase  Alkalin  and  gamma  glutamyl transferase  levels,  lower  platelets,  leucocytes,  albumin  and  prothrombin  time,  higher  duration  of antiretroviral  treatment,  didanosine  treatment  and  higher  duration  of  didanosine  treatment.  In  the multivariate analysis, didanosine (OR, 8.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 102.3, p &lt;0.02), cirrhosis (METAVIR score of F4) (OR, 8.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 104.2, p &lt;0.02) and elevated bilirubin (above the normal) (OR, 7.9; 95%  CI,  1.08  to 93.3, p &lt;0.03) remained  significantly associated with spontaneous  hepatic decompensation.

CD4 + cell count decreased while on therapy and returned to baseline value after the end of treatment similarly in both treatment groups. In this study, there was no dose modification or permanent study drug discontinuation due to lymphopenia CD4 + . HIV viral load No significant change in viral load in either treatment group was observed in this study. Important clinical adverse events Mitochondrial toxicity (symptomatic hyperlactatemia and pancreatitis) Symptomatic mitochondrial toxicity was diagnosed during the study period in 11 patients (symptomatic hyperlactatemia and pancreatitis in 6 and 5 patients, respectively). Nine of the eleven patients  were  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b/Rebetol  arm.    The  regimes  included  didanosine   in  every case, stavudine in 8 cases and lamivudine in 3 cases, abacavir  in 1 case, protease inhibitor in 3 cases and Non-Nucleoside analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) in 5 cases. Antiretroviral treatment was stopped in seven cases. Anti-HCV treatment was discontinued in 8 patients. All but two of the patients had a full recovery (one patient with neuropathy had stable disease and one patient died 15 months later from liver failure despite a sustained HCV virological response). According to univariate analysis, the intake of didanosine is the only factor significantly associated with  an  increased  risk  of  symptomatic  mitochondrial  toxicity.  Multivariate  analysis  showed  that didanosine, with or without stavudine, was associated with symptomatic mitochondrial toxicity (OR 46, 95% CI 7.4 to infinity; p &lt;0.001) compared to regimens with neither didanosine nor stavudine. Spontaneous  hepatic decompensation  (defined as onset of ascites, jaundice (serum bilirubin &gt;51 µmol/l), hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding from oesophageal varices) Nine patients presented spontaneous hepatic decompensation. Two  of  them  were related to hepatocellular  carcinoma  and  staphylococcus  septicaemia  and  were  therefore  excluded.  On  the remaining seven cases (i.e 3 in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm and 4 in the IntronA arm), 5 also had cirrhosis.  All  the  patients  were  receiving  antiretroviral  treatment  at  the  onset  of  decompensation (didanosine in 5 cases, stavudine in 4 cases, lamivudine in 2 cases, abacavir in one case, nelfinavir in 4 cases,  efavirenz  in  one  case  and  ritonavir/saquinavir  in  one  case).  Five  patients  died  as  a  result  of hepatic decompensation (all 3 patients in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm and 2 patients in the IntronA arm). There was also a sixth fatal case as a result of hepatic decompensation but the treatment received by the patient (peginterferon alfa-2b or IntronA) was not specified.

## Study  P02080

## Patient  exposure

The extent of exposure was not provided in the study report since subject data regarding start and stop dates  of  study  drugs  were  not  included  in  the  database  provided  to  the  MAH.  However  data  on  95 subjects contributed to the assessment of the safety in this study.

Adverse events There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  study  P02080  than  in  the  previously  discussed RIBAVIC study. One explanation proposed by the MAH is that a bias due to small sample size in study P02080 cannot be ruled out. Moreover, this may be explained by the design of the study i.e a single-center  study  with  close  monitoring  and  more  robust  adverse  event  reporting.  However,  the safety  profile  of  peginterferon  alfa-2b  plus  ribavirin  therapy  in  HIV-HCV  co-infected  patients  is overall similar between the two studies in terms of adverse events reported. In line with the results of RIBAVIC study, in the Laguno study there were more flu-like symptoms in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm compared to the IntronA arm (46% versus 32% in the IntronA arm) and more haematological abnormalities (anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm compared to the IntronA arm (29% versus 19% in the IntronA arm). However, few patients with blood disorders required dose discontinuation or modification. Psychiatric disorders, in particular depression, were reported more frequently in the IntronA arm (19% versus 22% for the IntronA arm).  Irritability was also more frequently reported in the IntronA arm (14% versus 18% for the IntronA arm). Again, the proportion of patients with blood disorders was significantly higher in co-infected patients compared to a population of monoinfected patients. Severity of adverse events 65% of subjects in both treatment arms experienced a severe or serious adverse event as defined in the Case  report  Form.  The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  event  was  depression  (20%)  and  the frequency was comparable between the two groups (19% for peginterferon alfa-2b arm and 21% for IntronA arm). Concerning blood disorders, there were marked differences in the percentage of patients with mild to moderate blood disorders that were more frequently reported in the peginterferon alfa-2b arm. These data are in line with the results of RIBAVIC study. Death No deaths were reported during this study Adverse event leading to dose discontinuation There were 14 patients who experienced serious adverse events leading to dose discontinuation (9/52 (17%) in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  group  and  5/43  (12%)  in  the  IntronA  group).  In  both  treatment arms, the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation was flu-like symptoms. Adverse event leading to dose modification Medicinal product no longer authorised

There were 48 patients (51%) who experienced adverse events leading to dose modification (25/52 (48%) in the peginterferon alfa-2b group and 23/43 (53%) in the IntronA group). The most common adverse event resulting in study drug modification was depression in 8 (15%) and 9 patients (21%) in the peginterferon alfa-2b and IntronA group respectively. There were a higher proportion of patients who had leukopenia resulting in dose modification in the peginterferon alfa-2b group (13%) versus 7% in the IntronA group. However, the rate of study drug dose modification for anaemia was greater in the IntronA arm (16% versus 8% in the peginterferon alfa-2b group). The number of patients who had dose modification for thrombocytopenia was similar between both treatment groups (4-5%).

## Laboratory findings

Absolute  mean  CD4 + cell  counts  decreased  in  both  study  arms  during  treatment  and  the  nadir  was reached  at  week  36.  After  the  completion  of  HCV  therapy,  the  absolute  mean  CD4 + cell  counts increased to levels above baseline.

## Important clinical adverse events

Mitochondrial toxicity One  patient  in  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  arm  and  3  patients  in  the  IntronA  arm  experienced hyperlactatemia during the course of  the study. The peginterferon alfa-2b -treated patients received also didanosine and stavudine. In the IntronA arm, one patient was treated with didanosine, one was treated with stavudine and the last patient received both didanosine and stavudine. Hepatic decompensation No case of hepatic decompensation was discussed in the CSR of study P02080. Discussion on clinical Safety Overall, the safety profile of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in HIV-HCV coinfected  patients  is  comparable  to  the  one  observed  in  HCV  monoinfected  patients.  However haematological abnormalities (anaemia, neutropenia and especially  thrombocytopenia) appear more frequently reported in the co-infected population than in monoinfected patients and at a higher rate in peginterferon alfa-2b -treated patients than in IntronA  treated patients. However these adverse events were  generally  not  associated  with  clinical  symptoms,  can  be  adequately  managed  by  dose modification and  overall do not require permanent drug discontinuation. A specific paragraph on this issue has been included in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC's of Rebetol and peginterferon alfa-2b. Concerning HIV-related disease characteristics, no significant change in viral load in either treatment group was observed.  CD4 + cell count decreased while on therapy and returned to baseline values after the end of treatment similarly in both treatment groups. There was no dose modification or permanent study drug discontinuation due to lymphopenia CD4 + .  The limited safety data in patients with CD4 + cell count&lt;200/mm 3 is of concern. This issue is the subject of a warning in section 4.4 of the SPCs of Rebetol and peginterferon alfa-2b. Mitochondrial toxicities One  of  the  main  safety  concerns  of  the  co-administration  of  antiretroviral    treatment  and  HCV therapies  is  the  risk  of  overlapping  mitochondrial  toxicities  of  both  nucleosidic  agents.  The  data derived from these studies confirm that the co-administration of didanosine and ribavirin is associated with a higher risk of mitochondrial toxicity and thus that this combination should not be recommended in clinical practice. The current Rebetol SPC adequately mentions the risk of mitochondrial toxicity in case  of  co-administration  of  didanosine  or  stavudine  with  ribavirin.  The  MAH  should  continue  to closely monitor mitochondrial toxicity in co-infected patients receiving both anti-HIV and anti-HCV therapies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Bani-Sadr et al. found  that  concomitant  treatment  of  zidovudine  with  anti-HCV  therapy  was associated with an adjusted 3.3-fold higher risk of anaemia (OR=3.27, p=0.0008). This is in line with the  APRICOT  trial,  where  50%  of  zidovudine  treated  patients  had  moderate  to  severe  anaemia, compared  to  20%  in  other  patients  (Torriani et  al ).  Consequently,  Bani-Sadr et  al. recommend discontinuing zidovudine prior to HCV therapy in order to avoid anaemia and permit the use of higher ribavirin doses. In the SPC of Rebetol there is currently a mention that 'patients treated with Rebetol and  interferon/peginterferon  alfa-2b  combination  therapy  and  zidovudine  are  at  increased  risk  of developing anaemia'. However, as the data provided by Bani-Sadr et al. lead to the conclusion that zidovudine  discontinuation  could  help  to  avoid  anaemia  associated  with  anti-HCV  therapy,  it  is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mandatory to discuss the need for adopting a stronger warning. The MAH will therefore discuss this issue as part of a forthcoming FUM.

In line with clinical guidelines for HIV/HCV co-infection, the MAH suggests zidovudine should  be excluded  prior  to  HCV  treatment  to  solve  the    problem  of  anaemia.  However  in  one  publication (Réndon et al. ) dealing with this issue (anaemia by weight based ribavirin dosage in HIV co-infected patients)  it  was  found  that  patients  treated  with  concomitant  zidovudine  had  a  significantly  higher ribavirin plasma-concentration at week 4. This finding is potentially important from a clinical point of view.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  discuss  this  finding,  as  this  could  imply  that  concomitant zidovudine  (with  a  possibly  lower  dose  of  ribavirin  in  case  of  anaemia)  is  not  a  problem  from  an efficacy point of view.

Overall the MAH used two independently conducted studies to support this type II variation.

Finally some published data by Rodriguez-Torres M. et  al. lead to question the clinical relevance of the in  vitro inhibition  of  the  zidovudine  and  stavudine  phosphorylation  by  ribavirin.  The MAH  has committed to further discuss this issue. Hepatic decompensation The risk of hepatic decompensation in co-infected patients with cirrhosis treated with anti-HIV and anti-HCV  therapies  is  already  known.  Overall,  there  were  six  deaths  reported  due  to  hepatic decompensation in the RIBAVIC study and during its follow-up period. Of note, a total of six deaths (n=859) was reported in the study supporting the extension of indication of Pegasys in co-infected patients  (study  NR15961).  The  SPC's  of  Rebetol/peginterferon  alfa-2b  already  mention  the  risk  of hepatic decompensation when anti-HCV treatment is added to antiretroviral treatment in co-infected patient as follows: 'Co-infected patient with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increase risk  of  hepatic  decompensation  and  death.  Adding  treatment  with  alfa  interferon  alone  or  in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset'. Factors other than cirrhosis that  have found to be associated with hepatic decompensation are elevated bilirubin and didanosine treatment.  These  have  also  been  included  in  the  SPC.  Furthermore,  recommendations  for  the management  of  co-infected  patients  receiving  both  antiretroviral  and  anti-hepatitis  treatment  have been  included  in  the  SPC.  Prescribers  are  advised  that  the  Child-Pugh  score  should  be  monitored during treatment and patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the antiretroviral treatment reassessed. The MAH has identified cirrhosis and didanosine intake as independent risk factors of spontaneous hepatic decompensation in co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral drugs and HCV therapy. This reinforces the importance of the existing warning against the co-administration of didanosine and ribavirin  that  appears  all  the  more  warranted  in  HIV-HCV  co-infected  patients  with  history  of cirrhosis. Finally, the CHMP consider that initiation of treatment with interferon alfa-2b in co-infected patients with cirrhosis with Child-Pugh &gt; 6 is contraindicated. 1.4.   Risk management The CHMP agreed that an EU - Risk management plan would not be required for the extension of indication in the HIV/HCV co-infected target population. 1.5.   Overall discussion and benefit risk assessment Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -One  pivotal  multicenter  study  conducted  by  the  ANRS  in  a  large  sample  size  (RIBAVIC /P01017)
- -One smaller investigator initiated performed in a single centre in Spain (Laguno/ P02080).

Whereas  both  studies  are  very  similar  as  regards  the  population  enrolled  (in  terms  of  immunovirologic  parameters,  HIV  and  HCV  history,  distribution  of  HCV  genotype)  they  differ  on  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ribavirin dose and on the treatment duration; whereas the ribavirin dose in the P02080 was in line with that  recommended  in  monoinfected  patients,  a  800  mg  non  weight  based  dose  was  selected  in  the P01017 study. Moreover, whereas 24 weeks treatment duration is now recommended in monoinfected genotype 2/3 the RIBAVIC study tested 48 weeks treatment duration regardless of genotype or viral load.    As  a  significant  limitation  of  these  studies,  their  results  could  not  be  extrapolated  to  HIV co-infected  patients  with  low  CD4 + (&lt;200/mm 3 )  and  high  viral  load.  Such  a  difficult-to-treat population is nevertheless critical in clinical practice. The MAH has proposed a warning for the SPC on the limited data available in HIV-HCV co-infected patients with CD4 + &lt;200/mm 3 .

The MAH makes a recommendation using on one hand the treatment duration of the pivotal RIBAVIC study and on the other the ribavirin dose similar  to the Laguno study (in line with the recommended weight based dose in monoinfected patients). The CHMP agreed that 48 weeks treatment duration was reasonable  and  may  be  required  to  achieve  HCV  viral  clearance.  However  the  MAH  will  further discuss the possibility of recommending 24 weeks treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients with genotype 2/3 provided that they achieve undetectability at week 4. This reflects current discussions in the scientific community that favour 24 weeks duration in genotype 2/3 patients. The CHMP had concerns regarding the partially tested recommendation regarding the weight based ribavirin dose. A modelling provided by the MAH showed a trend towards a well balanced gain in efficacy  versus  loss  in  safety.  Furthermore  from  an  efficacy  point  of  view  the  recommendation  of weight  based  ribavirin  is  considered  a  conservative  measure  in  this  difficult  to  treat  population. Therefore a favourable benefit risk balance is expected in this population. In the RIBAVIC study the results observed in genotype 1 and 4 in the pegylated arm were quite low (17%), as compared to the results achieved in the Laguno study (38%) and the tested hypothesis. This should also be seen in light of the APRICOT study with Pegasys (SVR in genotype 1 in APRICOT was 29%). The difference in SVR rate was surprisingly not observed for the IntronA arm. The only reason that could explain this difference would have been a difference in the incidence of neutropenia (which  is  expected  to  only  impact  the  peginterferon  alfa-2b  arm).  However,  the  incidence  of neutropenia as reported in the Laguno study was higher than in the RIBAVIC study, which argues against  this  hypothesis.  Other  factors  that  could  explain  the  difference  in  the  SVR  rate  observed included a  higher ribavirin dose and closer patient management in the Laguno study, however these factors would have been expected to impact both peginterferon alfa-2b/RBV and standard Interferon/RBV  and so cannot explain the difference observed. As the use of Erythropoietin was not allowed in the Spanish study and was minimal in the ANRS study, no conclusion on the impact of the use of EPO on the results could be made. Overall this issue remains unclear. The main safety concerns of the co-administration of antiretroviral and HCV therapies are the risk of overlapping  mitochondrial  toxicities  of  both  nucleosidic  agents.  The  MAH  has  been  requested  to closely  monitor  mitochondrial  toxicity  in  co-infected  patients  receiving  both  antiretroviral  and  antiHCV therapy. The SPC of Rebetol adequately mentions the risk of mitochondrial toxicity in case of co-administration  of  didanosine  or  stavudine.  However,  the  MAH  has  been  requested  to  further discuss  the  need  to  reinforce  the  warning  pertaining  to  the  higher  risk  of  anaemia  in  case  of  coadministration  of  zidovudine  and  ribavirin  in  the  frame  of  a  follow  up  measure  in  view  of  the publication by  Bani-Sadr et al. who found that concomitant treatment of zidovudine with anti-HCV therapy was associated with an adjusted 3.3-fold higher risk of anaemia. Although  the  MAH  suggests  excluding  zidovudine  prior  to  HCV  treatment  in  order  to  solve  the problem of anaemia, Réndon et al. found that patients with concomitant zidovudine had a significantly higher ribavirin plasma-concentration at week 4. This could imply that concomitant zidovudine (with a possibly lower dose of ribavirin in case of anaemia) is not a problem from an efficacy point of view. The MAH has committed to review this issue.

The  second  main  safety  concern  of  the  co-administration  of  antiretroviral  treatment  and  HCV therapies is the potential risk of hepatic decompensation. Overall, there were six deaths reported due to hepatic  decompensation  in  the  RIBAVIC  study  and  during  its  follow-up  period.  The  SPC  of Rebetol/peginterferon  alfa-2b  already  mentions  the  risk  of  hepatic  decompensation  when  anti-HCV treatment is added to antiretroviral treatment in co-infected patient. However the data submitted show that factors other than cirrhosis are associated with a hepatic decompensation. These include elevated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bilirubin and concomitant didanosine. This has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC along with a warning to prescribers to closely monitor patients Child-Pugh score and to discontinue treatment for HCV in patients progressing to hepatic decompensation

Overall the CHMP considered that the benefit risk balance for PegIntron in the treatment of HCV in patients  co-infected  with  HIV  is  positive.  The  modelling  provided  by  the  MAH  to  substantiate  the benefit  risk  balance  of  the  partially  tested  recommendation  of  higher  ribavirin  dose  for  coinfected patients provides reassurance of a favourable benefit/risk balance of the weight-based dose of ribavirin in the coinfected patient. Furthermore this recommendation is considered a conservative measure on an efficacy point of view, in this particularly difficult-to-treat population. With regards to the agreed 48 weeks treatment duration it is recognised that  there are current discussions within the scientific community that tend to favour  24 weeks of treatment for genotype 2/3 patients, provided that they achieve undectability at week 4.  This will be further discussed by the MAH in the frame of a follow up measure. The main safety concerns of the co-administration of antiretroviral treatment and HCV therapies  is  the  risk  of  overlapping  mitochondrial  toxicities  of  both  nucleosidic  agents  and    the potential  risk  of  hepatic  decompensation  when  antiretroviral  treatment  and  HCV  therapies  are  coadministered. This is reflected in the SPC. This extension of indication will lead to further discussion on the co-administration of NRTIs and ribavirin.
