## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common infectious cause of chronic liver disease in Europe, and is globally second only to Hepatitis B virus. Worldwide, approximately 3% of the population is estimated to be infected, corresponding to around 200 million people at risk of developing serious liver related morbidity. In Europe, where the vast majority of CHC cases are reported among patients with past blood transfusion (before 1991) or with a history of intravenous drug use, the prevalence varies by geographic region, from about 0.5% in the Northern countries to 2% and higher in the Mediterranean countries and in Eastern Europe. HCV of genotype (GT) 1 is the predominant genotype globally as well as in most European regions. In Europe and in the US, approximately 30% of HIV-infected patients are co-infected with HCV, ranging up to 50% in some regions. Around 60-80% of those infected with HCV become chronic carriers. Studies in patients who acquired CHC by blood transfusion prior to the availability of HCV-screening indicate that, after 20 years of infection, around 20-30%  will have progressed to cirrhosis, 5-10% will have end stage liver disease and 4-8% will have died of liver-related causes. In patients with cirrhosis, the 5-year risk of hepatic decompensation is approximately 15-20% and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma 10%. The general aim of therapy is to achieve sustained viral response (SVR), presently defined as the absence of detectable virus 24 weeks after the planned end of therapy. This ends the progression of HCV-related hepatic injury. Despite SVR however, the risk of cirrhosis-related complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma, still remains in patients that have developed significant liver injury due to the infection. Over approximately 15 years, HCV therapy has evolved from the use of a standard (non-pegylated) interferon alone, via combination therapy with a standard interferon + ribavirin, to the combination of a pegylated interferon and ribavirin. For GT 1 virus, SVR rates in treatment naive patients with GT1 virus with 48 weeks of standard interferon therapy were approximately 10 percent, whereas with combination therapy of an unpegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks, SVR rates were about 30-35%. With  pegIFN 2a or 2b and ribavirin bi-therapy for 48 weeks, the standard of care prior to the approval of the first directly acting antivirals, response rates in GT1 or 4 have been approximately 4050% in the pivotal trials. Lower SVR rates, however, are seen in some sub-populations such as those with HCV/HIV co-infection. In contrast, around 70-85% of treatment naive patients infected with HCV GT 2 and 3 achieve SVR after a 6-month treatment course with pegIFN and ribavirin. Telaprevir has primarily been developed for use with PegIFN and ribavirin in patients with GT1, though preliminary studies in other genotypes have been performed. Type of application and aspects on development The applicant was granted accelerated procedure by the CHMP 2010-11-18. No specific concern was raised to initiate a GCP inspection; however, a routine GCP inspection was conducted in June 2011. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In summary, the inspection findings indicate that the study is conducted in accordance with international regulations and that the results presented in the clinical study report is correctly presented.

## 2.2.1. Introduction

INCIVO is presented as film-coated tablets containing 375 mg of telaprevir as the active substance. The tablets are yellow, caplet shaped, of approximately 20 mm in length and marked with 'T375' on one side.

Telaprevir can be manufactured according to two commercial processes: Process 1 or Process 2, from the same starting materials. Both processes are relatively complex, convergent route. The manufacturing process was changed at a late stage of development to minimise levels of a potentially genotoxic reagent. Batch analysis data showed that the changed process produces cleaner substance and that the changes have no further impact on the quality control of the telaprevir.

Excipients used in the preparation of INCIVO are well known excipients, commonly used in solid oral dosage preparations, such as hypromellose acetate succinate, anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous colloidal silica, sodium lauryl sulphate, croscarmellose sodium and sodium stearyl fumarate (present in the tablet core) and polyvinyl alcohol, macrogol, talc, titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide yellow (E172) (present in the tablet film-coat). The tablets are packed in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles fitted with polypropylene (PP) child resistant closure and induction seal liner. A desiccant is added to each bottle. 2.2.2. Active substance Telaprevir (INN) is chemically designated as (1 S ,3a R ,6a S )-2-[(2 S )-2-[[(2 S )-2-cyclohexyl-2-[(2pyrazinylcarbonyl)amino]acetyl]amino]-3,3-dimethylbutanoyl]-N-[(1 S )-1[(cyclopropylamino)(oxo)acetyl]butyl]octahydrocyclopenta[c]pyrrole-1-carboxamide (Chemical name), and has the following structure: Telaprevir is white to slightly yellow solid. The substance is more soluble in organic than in aqueous solvents. It is slightly soluble in ethanol, freely soluble in dichloromethane and practically insoluble in water. The partition coefficient is found to be pH independent and it is consistent with the low aqueous solubility of the substance, hence the hydrophobic nature of telaprevir. The substance is not hygroscopic. Telaprevir possesses six chiral centres and is optically active. Telaprevir primarily exists in a single stable, non-solvated crystalline form (Form A). Solvates and polymorphic forms of telaprevir also exist. Sufficient evidence was provided to demonstrate that the Form A is obtained by the utilised manufacturing process.

In general, sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, materials, critical steps and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process development have been provided. The

synthesis and process parameters have been well characterised and described. The classification of key starting materials was justified by the fact that these compounds constitute important structural fragments, are isolated and well-characterised, have well-defined impurity profiles and are stable.

During the evaluation, one of the proposed starting materials was redefined to an earlier compound in the synthesis. The initially proposed compound was too complex to be accepted as a starting material in the synthesis of the active substance. After the re-classification, supportive information to control the quality of the starting materials was provided and considered suitable.  The applicant also demonstrated that the stereoisomeric purity of the active substance could be appropriately controlled. In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommended to finalise and provide additional validation reports for analytical methods used to control the starting materials.

Tests for residual solvents are not included in the specification for the active substance. Although various organic solvents are used during the manufacturing process, their presence in telaprevir raises no safety concerns with regard to the finished product. Residual solvents are controlled with a head space GC-FID method during the manufacturing process of film-coated tablets. Therefore the presence of residual solvents was considered a non critical quality attribute for the active substance.

Confirmation of the chemical structure of telaprevir was provided by elemental analysis (confirmation of the determined elementary composition by evaluation of C, H and N content), spectroscopic methods as UV, IR, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR as well as by mass spectral (MS) analysis. The IR, NMR and MS spectrum assignations were consistent with the declared chemical structure. Also, the potential for polymorphism has been investigated to identify polymorphic forms of telaprevir. Screening was conducted using more than 70 solvents and a broad range of crystallization methods. No other new crystalline forms of telaprevir were derived directly from the screening experiments. The substance was characterised by termogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Results affirmed that Form A is the thermodynamically stable crystalline form. Moreover, it is the only solid form observed in the manufacture of the active substance. Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin (raw material, manufacturing process and degradation products) and potential carry-over into the final drug substance. It has been demonstrated in a satisfactory manner that the stereochemical purity of the active substance is assured by the combination of the controlled chemistry and QC testing of the starting materials. The possibility of genotoxic impurities was also considered during the development. Impurities with a potential structural alert have been identified and are controlled by appropriate specification limits. Specification The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (FT-IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), residual reagent, heavy metals and residue on ignition. A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Complete method validation data was provided for the non compendial ( in-house ) analytical methods. Appropriate HPLC method (reversedphase HPLC method with UV detection) is used for assay, chromatographic purity and identification. The method was appropriately validated.

Particle size was not considered a critical quality attribute of the active substance as telaprevir is dissolved during the manufacturing process of film-coated tablets. Therefore no test on particle size determination was included in the specification.

In general specification limits and analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance.

Batch analysis results for telaprevir have been presented. All batches were manufactured by the proposed commercial manufacturer according to the proposed processes. All batches showed the same impurity profile. It can be concluded that the batch analysis results indicate that the processes are reproducible and under control. Stability Stability studies were performed according to ICH requirements. Stability studies on telaprevir were conducted on 3 primary stability batches that were manufactured according to both processes: Process 1 and Process 2. Twenty four months long term (25°C/60% RH) and intermediate (30°C/75% RH) stability data and 6 months accelerated (40°C/ 75% RH) stability data were presented. The active substance batches used in the stability studies were packaged in the proposed packaging system. Forced degradation studies were also performed in order to further characterise the active substance. A stress stability study in solution allowed the main degradation pathway to be determined. The effect of acid, base, oxidative agents and light was also tested. Furthermore, this study was also initiated to confirm the stability-indicating properties of the HPLC purity method. The stress in solution study showed that telaprevir was not stable in alkaline, acidic or oxidative solutions. In the aqueous solution, the active substance was stable with a slight increase of some degradation products, though still within the specification limits. Very limited light degradation in the solid drug substance was observed. In general the proposed degradation pathways were analysed and well presented in the dossier. All major degradation compounds were separated and no relevant degradation compounds were found to co-elute with the active substance. This proved that the HPLC purity method is stability-indicating. Stability results generated for telaprevir, manufactured in accordance to Process 1 and Process 2, demonstrated that there were no observed differences between two manufacturing processes. Based on the available stability data, telaprevir showed to be a stable when packaged in the proposed container closure system. 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product Pharmaceutical development The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a solid, oral dosage form that would deliver the required dose of the active substance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Telaprevir has very low aqueous solubility, irrespective of the pH, and hence poor bioavailability. The development of the product focused on the improvement of the bioavailability by converting the crystalline substance to a stabilized, amorphous form using appropriate excipients. Spray drying was chosen as the processing step to produce amorphous telaprevir. The spray-dried dispersion (SDD) was introduced to stabilise the amorphous form of the active substance with the help of hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS). The excipients were selected to assure rapid disintegration and

dissolution, and acceptable manufacturability. Mixture stability studies were conducted to investigate the compatibilities of telaprevir with excipients and solvents. The studies concluded that core tablet excipients are compatible with telaprevir formulated as an amorphous dispersion when water content is appropriately controlled.

Various formulations were considered and studied during development phase. Bridging studies have been performed between the tablets used throughout the development program. The addition of the film coat showed not significant difference on dissolution and in-vivo performance of the drug product. The applicant has described the optimisation and development of the product clearly and in sufficient details.

The manufacturing process development has been well documented. The development program consisted of in process characterisation studies to support the robustness of the process. Choice of the process was considered justified and the critical process parameters and process equipment were generally satisfactorily identified. It has been shown that the manufacturing process was robust. It can be concluded that the formulation development of the product was satisfactorily described. The key critical parameters were identified and successfully evaluated . The formulation choice and optimisation were considered acceptable. Adventitious agents None of the excipients used in the product are of animal origin. Magnesium stearate, used in the formulation, is of vegetal origin. Manufacture of the product The manufacturing process is sufficiently described as well as a process flow diagram provided. The film-coated tablets are manufactured from a SDD of the active substance. The SDD is manufactured using a solvent based spray-drying followed by secondary drying to remove residual solvents. The SDD is blended with the tabletting excipients and the final blend is compressed into tablets which are then film-coated. The spray drying mixture preparation was considered to be a critical step of the manufacturing process. Although spray-drying mixture preparation was characterized, the CHMP recommended the applicant to perform a study demonstrating suitable physical characterization and stability during the proposed holding time for the final spray-drying mixture, using 2 commercial scale batches. Furthermore, the CHMP recommended re-evaluation of the holding time of the SDD using 2 additional commercial scale batches. The SDD technology, has been used in the past years for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, and could be considered a standard manufacturing process. Batch results of full scale commercial batches of the telaprevir SDD intermediate showed the capability of the process with results well within proposed specifications. Validation of the telaprevir SDD intermediate and film-coated tablets, as part of general GMP, will be performed prior to launch of the product. The process validation protocol of the manufacturing process of the SDD and the film-coated tablet was provided. This was considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Product specification

Separate specifications were presented for the finished product and for the SDD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SDD specification includes tests for appearance, identity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), crystallinity (XRD), particle size (laser diffraction), bulk density and water content (Karl Fisher).

The drug product specifications include tests for appearance, identity (IR and HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (mass variation), dissolution, water content (Karl Fisher), assay (HPLC) and microbiological purity.

## In-use stability

The proposed specifications were justified based on the batch and stability results and are generally adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted. A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods. The Applicant has submitted batch analyses data. Batch analysis results demonstrated compliance with the proposed specifications and confirmed consistency and uniformity of the product. The results were consistent from batch to batch and proved that the product can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed specifications. Stability of the product Three primary batches of the film-coated tablets were placed on stability under ICH conditions, and results were available up to 24 months. In addition, supportive stability data was presented, including: data on 3 clinical batches of 375 mg core tablets, stability data used to define a chemical stability mathematical model, and stability data on a lot of film-coated tablets manufactured with SDD at the end of shelf-life. Furthermore, 3 primary and 3 full scale batches of the SDD intermediate have been included in the stability testing program. One end-to-end stability study was performed for a batch of the SDD stored for 12 months. This batch was used in the manufacturing of one batch of film-coated tablets that was placed on stability for 24 months. The second end-to-end stability study has been initiated and is pending. Two commercial scale batches of the SDD were stored for 7 months and then used to manufacture a full-scale commercial batch of film-coated tablets. The applicant has demonstrated, on development-scale batches, that finished product (coated or uncoated) manufactured with stressed SDD maintains its physicochemical properties. In view of the data provided the CHMP recommended to conduct additional end-to-end stability studies over 24 months under ICH conditions, using 2 pilot scale batches of telaprevir 375 mg film-coated tablets produced with the SDD stored for 12 months at the intended storage condition. The overall stability data showed that INCIVO was stable under all tested conditions. The results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. With regard to the ongoing stability program, the CHMP recommended to further investigate the possible carry-over of an impurity in order to verify that the agreed specification limit was appropriate, and if necessary to introduce relevant amendments to the dossier. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The in-use stability study was also conducted on one batch of the product. The bottles were regularly opened and tablets were removed during one week at long-term and intermediate storage conditions. The data thus generated allowed the conclusion that the drug product has an acceptable stability profile after multiple openings of the bottle during one week.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To conduct additional end-to-end stability studies over 24 months under ICH conditions, using 2 pilot scale batches of telaprevir 375 mg film-coated tablets produced with spray dried dispersion (SDD) stored for 12 months at the intended storage condition.

 To further investigate the possible carry-over of a related substance, in order to verify that the agreed specification limit is appropriate, and if necessary to introduce relevant amendments to the dossier. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction The non-clinical testing of telaprevir consisted of a standard programme of pharmacology and toxicology studies. Scientific advice, both from national agencies as well as from central authorities, relating to non-clinical aspects has been provided during the course of drug development. Several formulations were used during the non clinical development of telaprevir. Indeed, telaprevir drug substance (free base) has a very low solubility in water (&lt; 0.01 mg/mL). In the perspective of its development for oral administration, amorphous SDDs of telaprevir with stabilizing polymers were developed to maintain the compound in amorphous form and ensure adequate bioavailability. Early in the nonclinical program, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) SDD formulations were employed; however, issues of physical stability resulted in the evolution to an optimized hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) SDD formulation which exhibited greater physical stability, and when coadministered with vitamin E dα -tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) improved solubility and bioavailability. Multiple animal studies were carried out to optimize the oral formulation of Telaprevir used in nonclinical studies. The optimized HMPCAS SDD formulation (49.5% Telaprevir, 49.5% HPMCAS, 1% SLS) suspended in an aqueous vehicle (1% HPMCAS, 10% Vitamin E-TPGS, 0.01% Simethicone) was used for oral administration in Pivotal Nonclinical Studies, including toxicity studies supporting clinical development. All pivotal toxicity studies, including the safety pharmacology studies were performed in accordance with GLP principles. EMA scientific advice was sought on the non clinical aspects, including carcinogenicity studies and the issue of combination toxicity studies. 2.3.2.

Telaprevir is a potent slow-binding inhibitor of the active site of the HCVNS3/4A protease with a maximal potency (Ki*) of 7-10 nM. The R -diastereomer or epimer of telaprevir, VRT-127394, is nearly 30-fold less potent than telaprevir.

The IC50 of telaprevir in HCV replicon cells was determined to be 0.35 µM (wild type subtype 1b replicon), which when compared to the CC50 of 83 µM in the same assay, resulted in an in vitro selectivity index (CC50/IC50) of 234. An infectious virus HCV replication assay was used to determine that telaprevir is able to inhibit viral replication using genotype 1a virus from human serum (IC50= 0.28 µM=0.19 ug/mL).

In addition to possible effects on other proteases mentioned above, the selectivity of telaprevir was also investigated in a panel of radio-ligand binding assays (~60 targets including GPCRs, ion channels and transporters). Screening performed at 10µM did not reveal any significant effects (no inhibition or stimulation larger than 50% was detected). The largest effect seen was a 43% stimulation of the androgen receptor. Telaprevir was also investigated in a HIV-1 protease assay and was estimated to have an IC50 &gt; 10 µM, which was also supported by results from an assay measuring the effect on replication of HIV-1 in MT4-LTR-EGFP cells, in which telaprevir had an IC50 of 15.3 µM. However, it should be noted that this was similar to the and CC50 value, 16 μ M, in MT4 cells. When the HBV antiviral activity of telaprevir was investigated in vitro in HBV transfected HepG2 cells the IC50 was again estimated to be higher than 10 µM.

Telaprevir inhibits genotype 2 HCV NS3 serine protease with similar potency to genotype 1a or 1b HCV proteases while its activity against genotype 3 and 4 HCV proteases is reduced. Phenotypic studies (enzymatic and replicon-based) were performed to characterize substitutions identified in the HCV NS3 protease domain that were observed after treatment failure in clinical studies of telaprevir. A lower-level of resistance to telaprevir (3- to 25-fold increase in IC 50 from wild-type) was conferred by single substitutions at V36A/M, T54A/S, R155K/T, and A156S. A higher-level of resistance to telaprevir (&gt;25-fold increase in IC50 from wild-type) was conferred by A156T/V and the double substitution variant V36M+R155K. The in vitro replication capacity of all telaprevir-resistant variants was lower than that of wild-type in the replicon system. While there is cross resistance with other NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir-resistant variants remained fully sensitive to interferonα , ribavirin, and representative HCV nucleoside and nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors. The effect of telaprevir and interferonα was additive or moderately synergistic in reduction of HCV RNA in replicon cells in vitro, and there was no significant increase in cytotoxicity by the combined treatment. Data obtained also indicate an additive effect of telaprevir and ribavirin. Telaprevir was shown to be selective for HCV NS3 protease as compared to four human serine proteases, and induced a less than 10% inhibition at 10 μ M in assays for kallikrein, thrombin, Factor Xa, and plasmin. The in vivo effect of telaprevir was studied in SCID mice infected with replication defective adenovirus expressing wild type HCV protease-SEAP constructs. Data from in vitro studies supporting a protease dependent release of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was presented. In vivo telaprevir was shown to inhibit HCV protease-dependent SEAP secretion from the liver with an ED50 of &lt;0.3 mg/kg. The concentration of telaprevir was found to be 6 to 16-fold higher in the liver compared to the concentration in plasma. The SmPC adequately reflects the available information.

## Safety pharmacology programme

Safety pharmacology studies were performed to investigate the effects of telaprevir on cardiovascular, central nervous and respiratory system. These studies were performed with telaprevir drug substance and/or SDD formulations, which are the formulations used in the pivotal nonclinical toxicity studies and in the clinical studies.

<!-- image -->

Central Nervous System Neurological effects of telaprevir were investigated in rat after oral administration at doses of 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg. Neither VRT-108720 nor VX-950 produced any behavioural (Irwin Test) or physiological changes when compared to vehicle treated animals in two separate studies. VRT-108720 (mixture of telaprevir (S-diastereomer) and VRT-127394 (R-diastereomer)) and VX-950 did not show any statistically significant effect on spontaneous locomotor activity. Cardiovascular system The possible effects of telaprevir on the cardiovascular system were addressed both in vitro and in vivo. In whole cell patch clamping studies using hERG transfected HEK293 cells, VRT 111950 (research grade telaprevir) gave a dose dependent inhibition of hERG (at 37 û C) but did not reach a 50% inhibition at 100µM (the highest concentration tested). VRT-108720 gave a dose dependent inhibition of hERG (at 37 û C) with an IC25 estimated to 12.2 µM and IC50 101 µM. Telaprevir in the form of VX950 was also investigated, but at room temperature, and was found to give a concentration-dependent and significant inhibition of tail current at 30 and 80 μ M (estimated IC25 was 55µM). However, a 50% inhibition was not achieved. In addition, exposure of dog Purkinje fibres to VX-950 (up to 50 µM) or VRT-108720 (up to 100 µM) did not cause any significant prolongation of the action potential. However, it should be noted that the solubility of telaprevir in water is less than 15 nM. The actual concentrations achieved in these in vitro experiments are not known, but are likely to be much less than what is stated as the concentrations used. Telaprevir given orally (25, 75, and 250 mg/kg), using a spray-dried dispersion/mixture containing 49.5% VX-950, 49.5% HPMC-AS and 1% SLS, to conscious beagle dogs fed approximately 2 h prior to dosing to maximize exposure (see Pharmacokinetics below) did not elicit any noticeable changes in cardiovascular parameters (analysed by telemetry). At the highest dose Cmax for VX-950 was determined to be 17.6 µg/mL and AUC 243 µg·h/mL, and for VX-127394 the Cmax was determined to be 8.96 µg/mL and AUC 155 µg·h/mL. The ratio between VX-950 and VX-127394 was thus 66:34 and 61:39 for Cmax and AUC, respectively. Respiratory system Telaprevir at doses up to 1000 mg/kg, either as VRT-108720 or as a spray-dried mixture containing 49.5% VX-950, 49.5% povidone USP K30, methylene chloride (149 ppm), and 1% SLS in 1% (w/v) HPMC was also shown not to elicit any noticeable changes in respiratory parameters in rat relative to placebo treated controls. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of Telaprevir and its epimer VRT-127394 were investigated in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs after single intravenous and single or repeated oral administration. The solubility of crystalline telaprevir is low and oral bioavailability was optimized via the use of amorphous SDD formulations and stabilizing polymers, to increase physical stability of the formulations. The analytical method used was validated for quantitation of both telaprevir and VRT-127394

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

simultaneously and methods were validated for plasma (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, human) and liver homogenate (rat and dog). Oral PK parameters for VRT-127394 were similar to those observed for telaprevir. The relative percent systemic exposure of VRT-127394 compared to the combined telaprevir and VRT-127394 total exposure ranged from 4% to 23% in mice, 17% to 34% in rats, from 17% to 31% in dogs, and from approximately 29% after a single 750 mg telaprevir dose to 37% after multiple telaprevir doses in humans. Telaprevir was rapidly absorbed and exhibited a moderate (20 mL/min; dog), to moderately high (50 mL/min; rat and dog) and high (120 mL/min; rabbit) clearance, a relatively short half-life (0.8 to 1.5 h), and a moderate volume of distribution at steady state (1.3 in dog to 2.7 in rat, L/kg). Dose-proportional, less than dose-proportional as well as larger than dose proportional increases in systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) were seen, but generally the exposure to telaprevir did not increase with increasing dose at the highest dose levels used. Systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC) to VRT-127394 were also variable depending on dose level.

A clear food effect was detected in dogs with a 1.5- to 4.0-fold increase in exposures under fed as compared to fasted conditions. Under fasted conditions, systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC0-∞ ) increased in a less than dose-proportional manner with increases in dose ranging from 25 to 250 mg/kg, resulting in an apparent oral bioavailability of 43% to 67% at the highest dose. Telaprevir (14C-labelled) was moderately bound to plasma proteins in the concentration range 0.1-20 μ M; mouse (63%-71%), rat (82%-86%), dog (62%-67%) and in human plasma (59%-76%). Concentration-dependent decrease in binding was evident in mouse and human plasma but not in rat or dog plasma. Protein binding to human serum albumin (HSA) and α 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) was low to moderate and was dependent upon telaprevir concentration and protein concentration. Data indicated that both proteins may be involved in binding of telaprevir. Highest exposure was seen in the liver, intestine and pancreas after administration of 14C-telaprevir to rats (small intestine&gt;liver&gt;large intestine&gt;pancreas&gt;stomach&gt;kidneys). Distribution to the brain, fat, lymphatic tissues, muscle, and testes was considered to be low. After 168 h post-dose elimination of radioactivity was almost complete in all organs with the exception of brown fat where measurable amounts remained after 168 hours. No binding to melanin was indicated when distribution in SpragueDawley and Long Evans rats was compared. Prolonged half life (&gt;70 h) of radioactivity both after intravenous and oral administration, as compared to telaprevir and VRT127394, was detected. The radioactivity was shown to elute in the void volume at later time points and is thus likely to represent small and polar metabolites (although not identified). Steady-state liver exposures to telaprevir and VRT-127394 were also evaluated in repeat dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs. The liver to orbital plasma AUC0-8h ratio of telaprevir ranged from 14 to 65 and the corresponding ratio for VRT-127394 ranged from 35 to 129 in the 28-day and 13week toxicity studies in rats, while in the 6-month toxicity study, this ratio ranged from 3.7 to 9.4 for telaprevir and from 4.8 to 18 for VRT-127394. In dogs the liver to jugular plasma AUC1-8h or AUC2-8h ratio for telaprevir ranged from 1.6 to 6.3 and for VRT-127394 from 2.4 to 8.2 in the 28-day and 13week toxicity studies, and from 0.56 to 1.4 for telaprevir and from 0.4 to 0.9 for VRT-127394 on terminal sacrifice days 183 and 274 in the 9-month study. Placenta transfer of telaprevir and fetal exposure to telaprevir and VRT-127394 established in mouse and rat. Fetal plasma and whole fetus exposures to telaprevir represented 6.8% and 21% of the maternal plasma exposure in mouse and 4.7% and 7.6% in the rat. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Telaprevir undergoes extensive metabolism via epimerisation, oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis and multiple metabolites were observed. CYP3A was identified as the major isoform responsible for telaprevir metabolism across all species investigated (rat, dog and human). In addition non-CYPmediated metabolism (amide hydrolysis) was observed. The major metabolites of telaprevir identified in vitro from preparations from all species evaluated were VRT-127394 (epimer of telaprevir) and M1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl-glycine or pyrazinoic acid moieties). Steady state metabolite profiling identified VRT-127394, pyrazinoic acid (PZA) and M3 isomer as the predominant metabolites in plasma from rats, dogs, and humans. Minor qualitative sex differences were observed in the metabolism of 14C-telaprevir in vitro in incubations with microsomal and S9 fractions from all species.

Dose-dependent increases in CYP3A1/2 and CYP2E1 activities were observed in liver of rats (both sexes) after 13 weeks of treatment, whereas CYP2B activity was inhibited in female rats only. (After 28 days of treatment with telaprevir no changes in CYP activity was seen, except for a decreased CYP3A activity in female rats.) In both male and female dogs significant dose-dependent declines in liver microsomal CYP3A12 and CYP2E1 activities were observed concomitant with a decline in total CYP content.

## Clinical signs

When administered orally 14C-telaprevir was mainly excreted via feces as unchanged compound. Biliary clearance was likely the major route of elimination of absorbed compound, whereas renal clearance was limited. Telaprevir was excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Toxicology Single dose studies Single-dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Telaprevir was administered once orally by gavage as an aqueous suspension of PVP SDD formulation (PVP suspension 2) up to the maximum feasible dose established at 50 mg/g. Findings from these studies suggest that the acute oral toxicity of Telaprevir is low. Repeat-dose studies The repeat-dose toxicity program for Telaprevir is extensive. Several different formulations have been used during development . In studies VX-950-001 and VX-950-TX-002 a PVP suspension was used which resulted in a skewed PK due to stability issues. Therefore, the applicant performed new toxicity studies with an optimized clinically relevant HPMCAS formulation (VX-950-TX-016, FXU0003, VX-950TX-020, VX-950-TX-014, VX-950-TX-017 and VX-950-TX-021). In this section only pivotal studies using the relevant formulation are presented. The repeat-dose toxicity program presented by the applicant holds eight relevant studies conducted under GLP with the clinically relevant formulation. Four studies have been conducted in rat over eight weeks to nine months, with doses ranging from 1 to 1000 mg/kg/day. Toxicokinetic data generated during these studies do not give rise to any exposure margins to humans in terms of AUClast. On the contrary, rats dosed 1000 mg/kg/day for three months do only reach 53% and 29% of the clinical exposure in females and males, respectively. The remaining studies were conducted in dogs over eight weeks to one year, with doses ranging from 15 to 500 mg/kg/day. In some of these studies the toxicokinetic data show small exposure margins to humans in terms of AUClast (2.7/3.5 times the human exposure in male and female dogs, respectively, after 28 days of dosing with 300 mg/kg/day). Both rat and dog is considered as relevant species to use in toxicity testing. The toxicity findings from the presented studies are; Medicinal product no longer authorised

In rats excessive or increased salivation and red material around the mouth was observed in the three month study in the ≥ 300 and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day groups. In dogs abnormal stool was generally observed. In dogs administered ≥ 150 mg/kg/day most animals showed general signs of toxicity including thinness, decreased activity, inappetence and vomiting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Haematology/Coagulation

Data from both species show Telaprevir toxicity on the haematological/coagulation system. These findings include lowering of erythrocytic parameters (rat), higher levels of activated partial thromboplastin times (rat), increase in lymphocyte/monocyte numbers (rat, dog), anaemia (dog) and lower eosinophil counts (dog). In the long term studies all haematological parameters were normalized after recovery. The potential mechanisms of the anemia/erythrocytic effects noted in nonclinical and clinical studies were addressed by an in vitro study on human erythrocytes which showed that Telaprevir have no effects on red blood cells osmotic fragility at 80 µM. The Applicant has not investigated other causes of haematological toxicity, particularly an impact on progenitor cells.

Serum chemistry AST and/or ALT elevations was observed in most studies on both species (ALT up to 7.8-fold increase and AST up to 6.2-fold increase in rats dosed 300 mg/kg/day). In addition, both species show increase in cholesterol, (+22.2% in rat dosed 300 mg/kg/day and &gt;65% in dogs dosed 100 mg/kg/day), decrease in albumin (&gt;25% in dog dosed ≥ 150mg/kg/day). In rat all chemical parameters, but the increase in ALT, was normalised after recovery. Organ/Body weights In rat increased spleen weights (up to +28.6% in males dosed ≥ 300 mg/kg/day), increased thyroid/parathyroid weights (up to +33.7% in males dosed 1000 mg/kg/day), increased liver weights (+32.8% to +42.9% in females dosed 1000 mg/kg/day), decreased testicular weights (up to 32.1% in males dosed ≥ 300 mg/kg/day). In dogs a non-statistical significant-dose dependent increase in liver weight was noted. In the one year dog study epididymides, heart, lung, and pituitary gland weights relative to brain weight were significantly increased for males administered 100 mg/kg/day compared to placebo controls. In general administration of Telaprevir induced a decreased mean body weight. Histopathology In rat and dog the histopathological findings in the liver was similar and not all of these findings was fully resolved after recovery.  In rat males microscopic findings in the testis was also generally observed. These findings include bilateral degeneration of the germinal epithelium, bilaterally exfoliated germ cells, bilateral, hypospermia, and/or bilateral aspermia. Findings in the testis were not observed in dogs and were fully resolved after recovery. Effects on the vascular system in dogs were consistent with those observed in Beagle Pain Syndrome (Idiopathic Canine Polyarteritis), and in more severe cases animals presented with clinical signs of poor or ill health consistent with this syndrome. Microscopic findings were generally minimal to mild in nature and were observed in multiple tissues, particularly the coronary artery, a known target tissue for vasculitis in Beagle dogs. Many other microscopic findings noted in dogs were considered secondary effects to diffuse vasculitis noted in these animals. Drug induced vasculitis in Beagle dogs has been observed previously with marketed products including endothelin antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, with no correlate in humans. These effects are considered species-specific, and no signs of vasculitis were observed in biopsies taken from subjects presenting with rash in clinical studies with telaprevir.

Some of the toxic signals observed in the non-clinical program have also been observed in the clinical trials. These include increased cholesterol and haematological effects. The clinical data do not show an increase in ALT/AST related treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. The findings of testicular toxicity in rats prompted the measurement of reproductive hormone levels in the clinic. Levels of serum inhibin B, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were assessed in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

male subjects during the telaprevir dosing period. In each study, inhibin B, FSH, and LH levels, as well as changes from baseline, were similar between the telaprevir and placebo treatment groups. There was no indication of any effect of telaprevir on human testes in these studies, nor have there been any reports in any telaprevir clinical study suggestive of testicular toxicity.

The issue of combination toxicity studies was addressed during a CHMP scientific advice in which the CHMP agreed with the applicant in that no such studies werenecessary. In accordance with this advice the applicant has presented an acceptable justification for the waiving of preclinical combination toxicity studies.

The presented data show that Telaprevir readily cross the placenta in both rat and mouse giving high foetal: maternal exposure (19-50%). The data also show that telaprevir has no teratogenic potential in rat or mouse. Peri- and post-natal developmental evaluations suggest that telaprevir has no effects on natural delivery in rats but may have adverse effects on the growth of offspring as evidenced by body weight effects pre- and post-weaning (up to an 11% decrease); however, no effects on development, behaviour, and Caesarean-sectioning or litter parameters were noted in the offspring. The dosing of the animals does not result in any margins to human exposure. This issue has been raised in conjunction to the repeat-dose toxicity section.

Genotoxicity Telaprevir was concluded to be negative for mutagenic and clastogenic potential when evaluated in the definitive ICH S2B battery of GLP-compliant genotoxicity studies. The R-diastereomer of telaprevir, VRT-127394, was also found to be negative for mutagenic potential when evaluated in a GLP-compliant bacterial reverse mutation study. Positive genotoxic signals were detected during early development using experimental batches. This issue was addressed in advice given by the CHMP. The CHMP concluded that no further testing was necessary and that the applicant should ensure that the clinically relevant material is adequately tested. The data presented are deemed as sufficient in this regard. Carcinogenicity studies Since the duration of treatment is limited to 12 weeks and no concern for carcinogenicity have been observed during toxicity testing, carcinogenicity studies for Telaprevir were deemed unnecessary. This is further supported by the extant guideline (CPMP/ICH/140/95) and given CHMP scientific advice. However, if the duration of treatment were to be increased, the need for carcinogenicity studies would need to be re-evaluated. Fertility, early embryonic development, embryo-foetal development and pre/postnatal development. Telaprevir had no effects on mating performance and fertility in male and female rats; however, slight increases in pre-implantation loss (first cohabitation) and/or an increase in non-viable conspectuses (first and second cohabitation) were noted at the paternal high dose of 300 mg/kg/day. Satellite males administered this dose and incorporated in the design to characterize the nature, timing and severity of the effects of telaprevir on the male reproductive organs, presented with macroscopic testicular findings consistent with those observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats which correlated to effects in sperm evaluation endpoints and to reversible treatment-related microscopic findings in these organs.

## Local tolerance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Available data demonstrate that telaprevir is a non-irritant from both the dermal and ocular perspectives. Telaprevir does not absorb UV irradiation or visible light between 290 and 700 nm and does not show any obvious distribution to skin and eye or binding to melanin. Telepravir is therefore considered not to have any significant phototoxic potential.

## Antigenicity

On the basis of a positive result for skin sensitizing potential associated with the regulatory starting material VRT-126032 recognized strong structural similarity of this material to the M11 metebolite VRT-841125) of telaprevir, and incidence of rash observed clinically, it was postulated that antigenicity associated with M11 may play a role in the etiology of rash observed in clinical studies evaluating telaprevir VRT-841125 was initially found to be negative for skin sensitizing potential in an LLNA and was later demonstrated positive for skin sensitizing potential in a follow-on Guinea pig maximization test. Given that M11 is not a predominant circulating metabolite in humans and the nature of the rash observed in clinical studies with telaprevir, it is unlikely that the observed potential for skin sensitivity relates to the etiology of the observed rash, but these results show that a telaprevir metabolite can act as an antigen in a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Studies on impurities, degradation products and the M5 metabolite The applicant has performed a series of studies to address potential genotoxicity and repeat-dose toxicity associated with organic process impurities related to telaprevir drug. In vivo data show that Telaprevir spiked with several impurities and degradants do not result in additional toxicity when compared to Telaprevir alone. The data indicate that the two process impurities TEMPO and VRT836871 have genotoxic properties. For this reason the applicant has added two washing steps in the manufacturing process of telaprevir to reduce the level of VRT-836871 impurity below the threshold for toxicological concern and implemented manufacturing controls to bring the level of TEMPO and TEMPOH as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). Batch data presented in the quality AR show that the contamination for TEMPO/TEMPOH is 0.2-0.4 ppm and for VRT-836871 the LT is 0.2 ppm. Other studies Data from the effect study on human erythrocytes show that telaprevir has no appreciable effects on red blood cell osmotic fragility at the concentration evaluated. Results from an exploratory secondary pharmacodynamic screening study evaluating binding affinity of research grade telaprevir (VRT111950) for a range of receptors and ion channels showed an apparent species-specific binding displacement for the rat testosterone receptor. Investigational studies were performed to confirm rat testosterone binding with telaprevir and VRT-127394 and to determine the potential for effects mediated by a similar mechanism to occur in dog and human. Consistent with the potential association with the observed rat testicular toxicity, effects previously noted with the rat testosterone receptor were confirmed, whereas no appreciable binding was reported for either the dog or human androgen receptor binding assays. The relevance of this finding could potentially account for the testis toxicity observed in rat, but not in dog. 2.3.4. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Medicinal product no longer authorised

The worst-case PECSURFACE WATER of telaprevir at the point of discharge of sewage effluent to surface water (11.25 μ g.L -1 ) assumes that the parent substance is not metabolised and is excreted from the body unchanged. PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water, microorganisms and ground calculated using this worst-case value confirmed that telaprevir does not present a potential risk to the aquatic environment. The PEC/PNEC ratio for telaprevir for the larval stages of Chironomus riparius tested at concentrations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

up to its limit of aqueous solubility confirmed the absence of risk and in a fish bioconcentration test where the highest steady-state BCF was 2x, telaprevir showed very little tendency to concentrate in the tissues of the rainbow trout. Assessments based on estimated worst case levels of telaprevir therefore confirmed that based on the studies conducted it does not present a risk in the environment.

2.3.5. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Pharmacology Telaprevir has been shown to be a specific, reversible, tight and slow binding inhibitor of the HCV NS3·4A serine protease with a similar sub-micromolar IC50 for HCV genotype 1a and 1b. However, it should be noted that due to the plasma concentrations reached clinically the specificity of telaprevir seen in vitro might not be relevant for the human situation. All telaprevir resistant variants analysed remained fully sensitive to IFNα and ribavirin and the NS5B nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors tested and were also found to have a decreased replication capacity as compared to the wild type. The effect of telaprevir and interferonα , and telaprevir and ribavirin, was found to be at least additive in replicon cells in vitro. No safety pharmacology issues were identified. However, the exposure levels achieved in these studies are uncertain and only a ~2.5 time exposure margin was reached in the telemetry study in dogs where actual measurements were performed. In addition, due to the low aqueous solubility of telaprevir (&lt;15 nM) the concentrations reached in the studies performed in vitro on hERG transfected cells and Purkinje fibres are likely to have been lower than the stated concentrations used. It should thus be pointed out that no definite conclusions can be made based on the lack of non-clinical findings in the safety pharmacology studies performed with telaprevir. However, since higher exposures are not likely to be possible to obtain, neither in vivo nor in vitro, the lack of identified exposure margins can only be further addressed clinically. It may also be noted that clinical investigations include studies regarding possible cardiovascular effects, which continue to be evaluated, and have so far not indicated any other safety pharmacology issues. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of telaprevir and its epimer VRT-127394 were investigated in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. A rapid clearance of telaprevir was detected in rabbit and sufficient systemic exposure was not reached in this species (mouse was therefore selected as the second species for embryo-fetal development evaluations). Metabolic investigations revealed an extensive metabolism and formation of numerous metabolites via epimerisation, oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis. No human specific metabolite of telaprevir has been identified and all three major human plasma metabolites were present in the species used in non-clinical studies. Some uncertainty remains due to both qualitative and quantitative differences but these differences of minor metabolites between species and between in vitro and in vivo are not considered to have any significant impact on the evaluation of the general safety of telaprevir or on the assessment of genotoxicity.

The solubility of crystalline telaprevir is low and a large number of studies were carried out to optimize the oral formulation of telaprevir to be used in non-clinical studies and later also to optimize and monitor the bioavailability of tablet formulations used for clinical studies. An optimized amorphous sprayed dried dispersion formulation was used for oral administration in pivotal nonclinical studies and

CHMP assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a clear food effect was detected in dogs with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in exposures under fed as compared to fasted conditions. It was not possible to reach any exposure margins in the safety studies performed and a maximum exposure of approximately 2 times that seen in the clinic could only be achieved. As judged from the efforts made by the applicant to optimize the oral formulations used it may be concluded that higher exposures are not likely possible to obtain in animal studies and thus that this potential issue most likely cannot be resolved. A rapid clearance of telaprevir was detected in rabbit and the applicant concludes that a sufficient systemic exposure was not reached in this species. These results also support the selection of mouse for the embryo-fetal development evaluations, which is endorsed. However, the possibility to use repeated intra venous administration to achieve higher exposure was not evaluated.

## 2.4.1. Introduction

Telaprevir was found to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Toxicology Telaprevir has toxic effects mainly to the liver and on the hematological system. Most of the toxic signals are resolved after recovery. The signal of testis toxicity, observed in rat, was addressed in the clinic as well as in dedicated non-clinical studies. The studies presented by the applicant are deemed as sufficient in terms of species and length. However, the dosing of the animals does not generate exposure margins to humans (no margin to human exposure in the rat studies and only a two times human exposure is reached in the long-term dog study). The exposure levels are also influenced by feeding status of the animals. Exposure levels has been maximised by the use of a SDD and a twice daily dosing regimen. Maximum feasible doses have been used in the pivotal studies and the influence by the feeding status of the animals as well as the possible influence of gastro-intestinal toxicity observed on exposure levels have also been addressed in an acceptable manner. The ratio animal AUC/human AUC for the rat at the highest dose in the 6-month study is well below unity and the ratio for the pregnant mouse and the dog in the 9-month study is ~2. Overall, reasonable efforts seem to have been made to increase exposure in non-clinical studies and it should be noted that in spite of the relatively low exposures obtained, target organs (liver and the hematological system) were identified. However, some uncertainty remains and the full toxicological profile of telaprevir may not have been possible to identify. Telaprevir is to be used in combination with interferon alpha and ribavirin. Both peginterferon and ribavirin are potent drugs accompanied with known specific toxicity. Overall, the toxicity program/data presented by the applicant is deemed as sufficient for assessment of Telaprevir related toxicity. 2.3.6. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects The non-clinical program adequately supports the marketing authorisation application for INCIVO. The toxicity profile of INCIVO is sufficiently characterised by the non-clinical data submitted. The statements in section 5.3 of the SmPC pertaining to non clinical data are appropriate. 2.4.

Clinical Pharmacology studies in healthy subjects were performed to understand the doseproportionality (Studies 001, 017), food-effect (Studies 002, C121), bioavailability from different formulations (Studies 003, 004, 010), absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion (ADME Study 005), effect of hepatic impairment (Studies 006, 012), and the effect of renal impairment (Study C132).

CHMP assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Several studies were conducted to examine the DDI potential of telaprevir as a substrate, and as an inhibitor, of CYP3A and P-gp, using both model drugs and drugs that are commonly prescribed to subjects with HCV. Because HCV co-infection is relatively common in subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), studies were conducted to examine the potential DDIs between telaprevir and commonly used HIV medications that might interact with telaprevir (i.e., ritonavirboosted HIV protease inhibitors, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and efavirenz). Data were collected from 4 Phase 2 studies (104, 104EU, 106, C208) and 3 Phase 3 studies (108, 111, C216) to assess the effects of subject demographic characteristics and other covariates on telaprevir PK and to characterize the exposure-response (efficacy and safety) relationships. The effect of telaprevir on the QT interval has also been studied (Studies 008, C136).

Telaprevir is converted to an inactive (considering antiviral effect) diastereoisomer VRT-127394 which is present in plasma (about half the exposure of telaprevir (1:3 of total exposure). To minimize conversion ex vivo, formic acid is added to plasma and plasma samples are kept on ice. Both forms have been measured by LC-MS-MS in studies performed until 2009. Standard statistical methods have been used. Non-compartmental data analysis for intense sampling scheme and population analysis utilizing nonlinear mixed effects modeling for sparse sampling data was applied. Early clinical studies used an aqueous suspension of an amorphous spray-dried dispersion of Telaprevir. Subsequently 250-mg and 375-mg tablets were developed. The registration studies used an uncoated 375-mg tablet. The commercial tablet contains a non-functional film-coating. The uncoated and film-coated 375-mg tablets were shown to have similar relative bioavailability in fed subjects. No relevant differences in bioavailability are expected. Absorption Information regarding absorption characterization of telaprevir was obtained from in vitro investigations and also from the mass-balance study (Study 005), and other formal clinical PK studies. In vitro studies performed with human Caco-2 cells suggested a high intestinal permeability of telaprevir. The observed permeability index is slightly lower than that observed with highly permeable drugs such pindolol. In presence of P-gp inhibitors, the permeability index is sharply enhanced (approximately 10 folds) demonstrating that telaprevir is a substrate of P-gp. Therefore, telaprevir absorption may be affected by other substrates or inhibitors/inducers of P-gp. Although in vitro studies did not demonstrate that telaprevir is an inhibitor of P-gp, a subsequent clinical study showed a DDI with digoxin, suggesting that telaprevir may inhibit/saturate P-gp in the gut. After oral administration of 14C-telaprevir (with a different formulation than the spray-dried dispersion used in the pivotal studies), the median total recovery of administered dose was 91% (range: 86.9%; 93.9%). The median percent of the administered dose recovered in the feces was 82%, while approximately 9% of the administered dose was recovered in expired air and 1% in urine. The contribution of unchanged 14C -telaprevir and VRT-127394 towards total radioactivity recovered in feces was 31.8% and 18.7%, respectively. From this study it is not possible to distinguish nonabsorbed drug from biliary excreted but in a worst case about 50% of the dose is not absorbed. Further, in this particular study the systemic exposure was unexpectedly low; hence absorbtion data for telaprevir in this study should be interpreted with caution. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In healthy volunteers as well as in patients treated with the 375 mg tablets, detectable plasma levels were observed approximately 1 hour after administration. The rate of absorption of telaprevir appears to be relatively slow; the peak plasma concentrations are reached in a median tmax of 4-5 hours after administration, likely caused by the limited solubility of telaprevir.

## Bioavailability

Telaprievir is practically insoluble in aqueous media. Therefore, that drug has not been given as an intravenous infusion to humans. Consequently, there is no estimate of absolute bioavailability in humans.

## Influence of food

Telaprevir is predominantly eliminated in the faeces with minimal renal excretion. Following administration of a single oral dose of 750 mg 14C-telaprevir in healthy subjects, the median recovery of the administered radioactive dose was approximately 82% in faeces, 9% in exhaled air, and 1% in urine. Apparent clearance (CL/F) of telaprevir was estimated from population PK analyses of Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies to be 32.4 L/hr, with inter-individual variability estimated to be 27.2%.

The effect of food on the PK of Telaprevir was assessed in numerous studies. Among these studies, study C121 is most relevant, as the influence of different type of foods on the BA of the 375 mg tablet were tested using an appropriate design. This was an open-label, randomized, 5-way crossover study in 30 healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 55 years of age. Complete PK profiles up to 24 hours post-dose were assessed after single-dose administration of 750-mg telaprevir with a standard breakfast, under fasted conditions, with a high-fat breakfast, a low-calorie/high protein breakfast, and a low-calorie/low-fat breakfast. Twenty-eight subjects completed the study. Compared to a standard breakfast (approximately 533 kcal, 189 kcal fat), telaprevir exposure (expressed as Cmax, AUCtlast, and AUC ∞ ) decreased by 73% to 83% when telaprevir was administered under fasting conditions; 25% to 26% when telaprevir was administered after a lowcalorie, high-protein breakfast (approximately 260 kcal, 81 kcal fat); and 38% to 39% when telaprevir was administered after a low-calorie, low-fat breakfast (approximately 249 kcal, 32 kcal fat). Increasing the meal to 928 kcal and increasing the fat content above that of a standard meal (to approximately 504 kcal fat) had no effect on Cmax and resulted in a 19% to 20% increase in AUC. Telaprevir will be recommended for dosing at 750 mg q8h with food. In the Phase 2 and 3 studies, subjects were advised to consume a meal or snack within 30 minutes prior to intake of telaprevir, which was to be taken with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of water. The nutrient content of meals and snacks was to be consistent with a regular diet (not a low-fat meal). Efficacy and safety data were obtained from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies with these dosing recommendations. Distribution The mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution V/F of telaprevir in healthy subjects is approximately 377 (177) L suggesting a large volume of distribution with penetration of telaprevir into tissues beyond the systemic circulation. V/F (point estimate [bootstrap 95% CI]) of telaprevir was estimated from population PK analyses of Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies to be 252 (204,273) L, with inter-individual variability on V/F estimated to be 72.2% Telaprevir is moderately (59-76%) bound to plasma proteins, both albumin and alpha acid glycoprotein, with a mild concentration-dependency. Individual whole blood to plasma ratio at each measurable time point in the mass-balance study ranged between 0.58 and 1.42 suggesting that telaprevir can distribute into red blood cells. Elimination Medicinal product no longer authorised

Telaprevir is extensively metabolized in the liver via hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction. Telaprevir is metabolised by CYP3A4. Other enzymes may be involved. A prolonged half-life of radioactivity was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed in the mass-balance study; the structure responsible for the prolonged half-life has not been identified. The exposure of telaprevir and metabolites in the mass balance study was low, preventing adequate determination of the metabolites in plasma. Telaprevir and its diastereomer contributed to a small part of the total radioactivity in plasma. After repeated oral administration of telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFN/ RBV in subjects with Hepatitis C, the main metabolites of telaprevir in plasma were VRT-127394 (R-diastereomer of telaprevir, 30-fold less active), pyrazinoic acid (not active from an antiviral perspective, but this is also an active metabolite of the antimycobacterial drug pyrazinamide - see further safety assessment) and VRT-0922061 (M3 isomer metabolite, reduction at the α -ketoamide bond of telaprevir, not active).

12).

Severe renal impairment (CrCL &lt;30 mL/min) in non-CHC subjects was associated with modest increases in telaprevir exposure: 10% increased Cmax and 21% increased AUC ∞ after single-dose administration. As such no dose adjustment is necessary for telaprevir in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. However, RBV is either contraindicated (Rebetol) or reserved for use only when essential (Copegus) in subjects with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min. Telaprevir has not been studied in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or on hemodialysis. It is not known whether telaprevir is dialyzable by peritoneal or hemodialysis; however, based on a plasma protein binding of 59% to76%, dialysis may increase the clearance of telaprevir.

Dose proportionality and time dependency In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, telaprevir AUC increased more than dose proportionately for doses ranging from 375 mg to 1875 mg. However, in a multiple-dose study, telaprevir 1875 mg q8h only resulted in a 40% higher AUC compared to 750 mg q8h. The reason for the discrepancy between single and multiple doses is unknown. When telaprevir was dosed as 750 mg q8h, steady-state was reached by 3 to 7 days with an accumulation ratio (ratio of the AUC at steady-state to the AUC after the first dose) of approximately 2.2. After a single dose, the mean half-life was approximately 4 hours. At steady-state, the effective half-life was approximately 9 to 11 hours. Pharmacokinetics in the target population A comparison of telaprevir exposure and the elimination half-life in healthy subjects and patients showed similar results after single- or multiple-dose administration of telaprevir monotherapy. During co-administration with Peg-IFN, telaprevir exposure was approximately 30% higher compared to telaprevir monotherapy, while RBV co-administration had no effect on telaprevir exposure. Telaprevir did not affect the exposure of Peg-IFN or RBV. Similar telaprevir exposures were observed in combination with either PegIntron/Rebetol or Pegasys/Copegus. Following multiple doses of telaprevir (750 mg q8h) in combination of Peg IFN and RBV in treatmentnaïve subjects with genotype 1 CHC, mean (SD) Cmax was 3510 (1280) ng/mL, Cmin was 2030 (930) ng/mL, and AUC8h was 22300 (8650) ng.h/mL In a substudy in study 108 (N=41) with intense sampling. Special populations Impaired renal function Study C132 was a Phase 1, open-label study in both healthy (non-CHC) subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment (defined as CrCL &lt;30 mL/min). A single-dose (750-mg) PK of telaprevir in subjects with severe renal impairment (n = 12) was compared to that in healthy control subjects (n = Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Impaired hepatic function

The pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses (750 mg q8h for 6 days) of telaprevir was investigated in 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment defined as Child-Pugh A (without HCV infection) and 10 healthy subjects (VX06-950-006). Subjects with mild hepatic impairment had reduced Cmax (10%) and AUC (15%) after multiple doses administration.

Another study (012) was planned to further investigate the effect of hepatic impairment in subjects with moderate (Child Pugh B, score 7-9) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment (without HCV infection) in comparison with the PK data from the healthy subjects in previous study. Ten subjects (Child-Pugh B) received a single 750 mg dose of telaprevir on Day 1 and multiple doses (750 mg q8h) on Day 2 to Day 5 with a final dose of 750 mg in the morning of Day 6. The study was discontinued and no subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C , score &gt;10) were enrolled. Exposure was approximately 46% lower in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B, score 7-9) compared to healthy subjects. Of note, Peg-IFN is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. In addition, RBV is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). Telaprevir is not recommended for subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Demographic characteristics A pooled population PK analysis conducted on the Phase 2 and 3 studies (104, 104EU, 106, C208, 108, 111, and C216) indicated that subject's age (up to 70 years of age), sex, race (estimated as Caucasian or other) and fibrosis category had no clinically relevant impact on the clearance and, therefore, on average steady state exposure of telaprevir. Subject's weight had an effect on the clearance of telaprevir but is considered to have no clinically relevant impact on the safety or efficacy of a telaprevir-containing regimen. The applicant provided additional analyses treating blacks as a separate group, which had no clinically relevant impact on the clearance and, therefore, on average steady state exposure of telaprevir. No PK investigations were performed in paediatric population. Telaprevir is not indicated in patients under 18 as no clinical efficacy/safety data are available . Interactions Drug-drug interactions Telaprevir is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro. VRT-127394 also inhibited CYP3A in vitro with lower Ki values than telaprevir. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir was both concentration and time dependent suggesting time or metabolism dependent inhibition. No or weak inhibition by telaprevir and VRT-127394 (diastereomer) of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 isozymes was observed in vitro. In vitro induction study results (CYP2C, CYP3A, or CYP1A) are inconclusive due to inhibition and no mRNA levels were assessed. Some of the interaction studies suggest that induction may occur in vivo. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Because telaprevir is both a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A there is a potential for drug-drug interactions between telaprevir and substrates, inducers, and inhibitors of CYP3A.

Rifampicin reduces plasma concentrations of telaprevir by approximately 92%, concomitant administration of rifampin and telaprevir is contraindicated. In addition, herbal preparations containing St John's wort, as well as enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are contraindicated during treatment with telaprevir.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A (ketoconazole or ritonavir) and telaprevir resulted in approximately 60% to 100% increased exposure to telaprevir in single-dose studies. Administration of ketoconazole after repeated doses of telaprevir appeared to affect exposure less and the inhibitory effect on telaprevir CL/F was very limited at steady state. These results suggest that co-administration of a potent CYP3A inhibitor may have limited impact on the exposure to telaprevir, possibly due to the fact that telaprevir itself is already an inhibitor of CYP3A or, alternatively, because there are other important elimination pathways. Metabolism by other enzymes will be further investigated.

Increased exposure to midazolam (IV 240% and 796% oral), alprazolam (35%), amlodipine (179%), atorvastatin (688%), cyclosporine (364%), tacrolimus (about 70-fold) on co-administration with telaprevir is likely attributable to CYP3A inhibition and P-gp inhibition. Tenofovir exposure was increased by 30%.

When telaprevir was co-administered with HIV protease inhibitors, exposure to telaprevir was reduced. This was most pronounced for lopinavir/rtv (54%) and darunavir/rtv (35%). Atazanavir exhibited the least effect (20% reduction). Co-administration with efavirenz decreased telaprevir exposure with 26%, with a somewhat larger effect on Cmin (47%). An increased dose of telaprevir (1125 mg q8h) in combination with efavirenz resulted in 18% lower AUC and 25% lower Cmin as compared to 750 mg q8h telaprevir alone. Telaprevir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A in vivo (8-fold increase of orally administered midazolam) and therefore contraindicated when combined with active substances that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or lifethreatening events. Co-administration may increase their plasma concentration and may lead to serious and/or life threatening adverse reactions such as cardiac arrhythmia (i.e., amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, terfenadine) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia ( i.e., dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), or myopathy, including rhabdomylosis ( i.e., lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin), or prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression ( i.e., orally administered midazolam and triazolam), or hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia ( i.e., alfuzosin and sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension). As a safety precaution, because of the potential for pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interactions that may increase the risk of QT interval prolongation telaprevir must not be administered concurrently with Class Ia or III anti-arrhythmics. Other Class I anti-arrhythmics should only be coadministered with caution and ECG monitoring. Telaprevir must also not be administered with other drugs that may induce QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes, and which are metabolized by CYP3A, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies its use. Outcomes of a clinical drug-drug interaction study with digoxin, which showed increased digoxin plasma concentrations (AUC increased by 85%) upon co-administration with telaprevir but no or very limited effect on renal clearance of digoxin, indicate that telaprevir may inhibit or saturate P-gp at relatively high local concentrations in the gut, while significant systemic P-gp inhibition by telaprevir is unlikely. Interaction studies with commonly administered drugs were performed. Reduced ethinyl estradiol exposure (AUC) (28%) and slightly reduced norgestrel levels (11%) were observed. Also, reduced zolpidem (47%), methadone (about 30%), escitalopram (35%), fosamprenavir (47%), darunavir (40%) and efavirenz (7%) exposure was found. The mechanism suggested by the applicant is enzyme induction or displacement of protein binding. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Due to the expected magnitude (studied or predicted) of DDIs with telaprevir, and the subsequent potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy, recommendations concerning co-administration

of a number of drugs are included in section 4.5 in the SmPC. Furthermore the applicant will further characterise the interaction profile of telaprevir post authoristion as reflected in the RMP.

The exposure obtained in the thorough QT study (C136) was similar to exposure observed in the Phase 3 studies (no exposure margin) and no data on supratherapeutic exposure is available.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

It appears that the range of exposures reached is on the steep part of the exposure response curve (utility curves), indicating that any decrease in exposure may be associated with lower virological efficacy, and particularly so in prior non-responders. The applicant was requested to define what increase and decrease in exposure is considered acceptable from a safety and efficacy perspective. Since no supra therapeutic exposure has been observed an upper limit cannot be defined. The applicant provided additional PKPD analyses which clearly indicate that the exposure margins for telaprevir in poor interferon responders is absent and any decrease in exposure may lead to decreased efficacy; It is noted that the effect of carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital on telaprevir exposure has not been studied. Based on known effects of carbamazepine and phenytoin on midazolam exposure, these agents are contraindicated and additional general warning has been included for mild and moderate inducers in section 4.5.

In vitro metabolism of telaprevir in recombinant Supersomes of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 were studied. Some disappearance was observed for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 but the largest disappearance occurred with CYP3A4. Data on CYP2C8 is lacking and will be further studied. In vitro interaction data and protein binding data is described above. Metabolism by non-CYP enzymes will be further studied. 2.4.2. Pharmacodynamics For mechanism of action, primary and secondary pharmacology see nonclinical section. PKPD PK/PD data has been provided by the applicant from the phase 2b studies. Due to a high correlation between Cmin, Cmax and AUC no single parameter was identified as most predictive. With increasing Cmin within the range of exposures seen at the recommended dose (approximately 1500-3500 ng/mL), an increased rate of RVR (a surrogate for SVR) was seen. In treatment-experienced patients (driven by prior non-responders) increasing Cmin is also associated with a decreased risk of virological breakthrough. Thus it appears that the selected dose yields exposures that are on the steep part of the exposure response curve, at least in patients with relatively low interferon response. Anemia is an exposure dependent side effect of telaprevir, whereas within the exposure range reached, no clear relation of exposure and severe rash emerged. PD interactions with, e.g., methadone are further addressed the clinical safety section. Concerning genetic differences in PD response (IL28B), see the Clinical efficacy section. 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology An ambitious clinical pharmacology program has been performed with telaprevir. No issues of major concern have been identified. A number of other concerns have been identified. Some issues will need to be addressed post authorisation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The effect of food on absorption of telaprevir is extensive. Further information on risk of reduced efficacy if taken without food was requested to be included in section 4.2.

Given the presented data on mass balance and metabolism the applicant was requested to further discuss the main elimination pathways of telaprevir and discuss whether there are any human specific metabolites or pharmacologically active metabolites that have not been identified. Due to the position of the labelling it is possible that it is included in endogenous structures (not identified) giving raise to the observed prolonged half-life of the radioactivity in plasma. Metabolism by CYP2C8 and other enzymes than CYP450 will be further explored.

The reasons for the lack of dose proportionality at multiple doses are unclear. Based on single dose data the accumulation at repeated dosing is larger than expected indicating autoinhibition. Multiple dose data with higher doses show a less than proportional increase. Given that higher doses may be warranted for co-administration with inducers, the applicant was requested to further discuss the mechanism and discuss whether solubility may be an issue. The discrepancy between single and multiple doses remains unclear but solubility issues is a possible explanation as concentration in the gut widely exceeds the solubility of the drug (also at single doses). In study -101 it appears that the C trough levels were first increasing but later decreased to a new steady state level, indicating autoinduction. A similar pattern was observed when telaprevir was administered with Peg-IFN in study -103, though possibly with a lower tendency of decreased levels over time. The applicant was requested to further discuss whether the interaction pattern observed when telaprevir is administered as single agents in the interaction studies, would likely be similar when telaprevir is given in combination with Peg-IFN and ribavirin.  The applicant argued that the interaction pattern is likely to be similar also when peginterferon and ribavirin are co-administered with telaprevir, despite the increased exposure to telaprevir. Also, the applicant stated that peginterferon has not been shown to have any significant effects on CYP metabolism (its impact on telaprevir exposure might be mediated by p-gp inhibition). Though the effects on peginterferon on CYP activity is not fully clarified, it is agreed that any such effects are not expected to be large. Although the effect on the gestagen component when co-administered with telaprevir was limited, a conservative approach with respect to hormonal contraceptives is taken given the co-administration with ribavirin. Further in vitro studies exploring interaction potential with UGTs will be provided. An interaction study with raltegravir has been performed but no study report has been submitted. Preliminary data suggests no clinically relevant interaction, but a final assessment of the data will be done at submission. A study with buprenorphin/naloxone has been performed. Preliminary data suggests that no dose adjustments will be required; however a final assessment will be done when the data are submitted. For sensitive substrates for CYP3A inhibition such as midazolam, inhibition is clearly dominating at repeated dosing with telaprevir. Regarding substrates for other elimination pathways, decreased exposure has been observed, possibly explained by CYP induction for some substrates, and possible protein binding displacement for others. The mechanisms will be further investigated by the applicant, particularly regarding the reduced exposure to HIV protease inhibitors. In vitro data on other transport proteins than P-gp is lacking. It will be further investigated whether telaprevir is a substrate and or inhibitor of transport proteins. Inhibitory potential should also be investigated for VRT-127394.

The mechanism for reduced exposure in hepatic impairment will be further investigated to evaluate the possible use of telaprevir as novel agent in regime without Peg-IFN in this group of patients.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Overall the clinical pharmacology aspects of telaprevir have been sufficiently characterised and meet the requirements to support the application.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

Initial studies of telaprevir in subjects with chronic hepatitis C were designed to assess viral kinetics and antiviral responses with telaprevir alone or in combination with Peg-IFN, with or without RBV. The duration of telaprevir treatment in these studies was short (2 to 4 weeks), and the study designs did not include SVR as an endpoint. These studies include the -101, -103 and -102, covering dose-ranging monotherapy, a comparison of short term monotherapy and the combination of telaprevir with peginterferon alfa-2a, and a 4 week study of telaprevir in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin. Eight studies were conducted to evaluate efficacy (SVR) of treatment with a telaprevir-based regimen in subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C: 5 studies in treatment-naïve subjects (never received treatment for chronic hepatitis C) and 3 studies in treatment-failure subjects (did not have SVR after Peg-IFN/RBV treatment for chronic hepatitis C). A listing of these studies is provided in table 3 below. A total of 3594 subjects with genotype 1 HCV (2362 treatment-naïve and 1232 treatment failure subjects) were treated in these 8 completed efficacy studies in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical development program, and 2830 of these subjects received at least 1 dose of telaprevir.

In addition to the studies listed in Table 3, a 3-year follow-up study is ongoing in subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C treated with telaprevir from selected Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (Study 112).

Furthermore, there were 2 Phase 2 viral kinetic studies conducted in subjects with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, and genotype 4, respectively. A Phase 2 study in subjects co-infected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus is ongoing. As the studies on other genotypes than 1, and in patients with HIV co-infection, are not relevant to the present labelling claims of the applicant, they are not further discussed in this assessment.

Notes

Statistical analyses were pre-specified according to statistical analysis plan.

Prior relapser: Subject had an undetectable HCV RNA level (by branched-chain deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA], reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RTPCR], or transcription-mediated amplification [TMA]-based assay) at the end (6 weeks or less after the last dose of medication) of a prior course of at least 42 weeks of Peg-IFN/RBV therapy but did not achieve SVR

Prior non-responders- Subject never had an undetectable HCV RNA level (by bDNA, RT-PCR, or TMA-based assay) during or at the end of a prior course of at least 12 weeks of Peg- IFN/RBV therapy (null-responder and partial responder). Null responders: subjects with &lt;2-log drop in HCV RNA at Week 12 of prior therapy (null-responders) Partial responders: subjects with ≥ 2-log drop in HCV RNA at Week 12 of prior therapy but who never achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels while on treatment. Analysis description Secondary analysis:: SVR24planned rates were similar between the T12/PR48 and T12(DS)/PR48 groups for prior relapsers and prior non-responders. The difference in SVR24planned rates (T12/PR48 versus T12(DS)/PR48) with 95% CI as estimated in the logistic regression model was -4.3% (-12.6%, 3.9%)  for prior relapsers and -0.4% (-13.6%, 12.9%) for prior non-responders 2.5.1. Dose response studies The phase 1-2a programme Study -101: the dose ranging monotherapy study The first clinical study of the program was a dose-ranging monotherapy study in which three dosing regimens of telaprevir were compared: 450 mg q8h, 750 mg q8h and 1250 mg q12h.  The 750 mg x 3 dose exhibited superior efficacy over 14 days. PK data showed that this dose was associated with the highest Ctroughs. Thus, the dose 750 mg x 3 was chosen for the further study. Of some interest, there was little difference in the efficacy of the three different doses during the first phase decay (day 1-3). This could indicate that all the doses reach Emax against wild-type virus, and that the primary difference between doses lies in their effect on pre-existing low-level resistant variants.

## Study -104: A phase 2b study of telaprevir 750 mg x 3 in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin, aiming at SVR

Study -103 : Telaprevir 750 mg x 3 as monotherapy or in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a This study established that telaprevir and peginterferon act in an additive/synergistic manner. In all subjects who received telaprevir (either with Peg-IFN or alone), HCV RNA levels showed a rapid decline between the first and fourth days of dosing with telaprevir. A second, sustained phase of viral decline occurred in 4 of 8 subjects in the telaprevir group and in all 8 subjects in the telaprevir + Peg-IFN group. In the telaprevir + Peg-IFN group at Day 15, HCV RNA levels were below the LLOQ in 6 subjects, and 4 subjects had undetectable HCV RNA levels. In the telaprevir group at Day 15, HCV RNA levels were undetectable in 1 subject. Study -102 Telaprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin over 4 weeks This study demonstrated that all 12 subjects in an uncontrolled study treated with telaprevir 750 mg x 3 + peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin had undetectable HCV-RNA at week 4. It thus formed the empirical support for the triple drug combination studied in phase 2b. The other regimens studies in phase 2b included telaprevir and peginterferon without ribavirin, and telaprevir at two different dose regimens in combination with pegintereferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.

This was a multicenter 48-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of treatmentnaïve male and female adult subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection.

SVR rates were as follows: Table 7. Number and Proportion of Subjects With Undetectable HCV RNA at Antiviral Follow-up Weeks 12 and 24, FA Set Important finding of this study include:  SVR rates were 61-67% for the telaprevir containing arms, significantly superior to the efficacy in the standard of care arm (41.3%), which was similar to what is expected.  The RVR (undetectable HCV-RNA at week 4 of treatment) rate in the telaprevir-containing arms was almost 80%, which has subsequently been found characteristic of a potent NS3/4A inhibitor.  Relapse rates were very low in patients with RVR that remained undetectable throughout treatment. The relapse rate with only 12 weeks of total therapy, however, seemed higher than with 24 or 48 weeks of therapy.  There was a trend to a higher clinical efficacy against HCV genotype 1b compared to 1a.  Rash and anemia are important side effects of telaprevir.



Of note, neither the -104 or the -104EU studies contained any arm with a longer duration of telaprevir dosing than 12 weeks. This was studied in the -106 trial (see below), with no apparent evidence for a virological advantage of extending telaprevir therapy beyond 12 weeks.

SVR rates were as follows: Table 9. Number and Percentage of Subjects With Undetectable HCV RNA at Week 12 and Week 24 of Antiviral Follow-up, FA Set The main findings of this study include:  Twelve weeks of triple therapy followed by twelve more weeks of peginterferon and ribavirin, was significantly superior to a standard 48 week regimen of peginterferon + ribavirin (SVR rates 69% versus 46%)  The response rate for 12 weeks of triple therapy without a further tail with peginterferon + ribavirin was 60% (p non-significant versus placebo). The relapse rate even in the subgroup of early responders to therapy was similar to the standard of care, 48 week arm (approximately 30%).  RVR rates were 70-80% with telaprevir based triple therapy.  Ribavirin needs to be retained in the regimen not only to prevent relapse but also to prevent viral breakthrough and augment virological efficacy. Relapse rates in the absence of ribavirin were almost 50%. Rash and anemia are important side effects of telaprevir. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study -C208: Telaprevir administered every 12 or every 8 hours in combination with either Peg-IFN-alfa-2a (Pegasys) and ribavirin (Copegus) or Peg-IFN-alfa-2b (PegIntron) and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ribavirin (Rebetol)

Treatment-naïve subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection were randomized to receive 1 of 2 different dose regimens of telaprevir in combination with standard therapy (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a [Pegasys] and RBV [Copegus] or Peg-IFN-alfa-2b [PegIntron] and RBV [Rebetol] at the standard doses).

-  The proportion of patients assigned to shorter therapy based on a strong early response was higher in the peginterferon alfa-2a than the -alfa-2b study (74% versus 62%). Also, data in this small study are compatible with a higher rate of viral breakthrough with peginterferon alfa2b, compared to -2a.

Table 10. Treatment Overview All subjects received 12 weeks of telaprevir in combination with the standard therapy (i.e., Peg-IFN and RBV). At Week 12, telaprevir dosing ended and subjects continued on standard therapy only. The duration of treatment was 24 weeks for patients with undetectable HCV-RNA at weeks 4 through 20. If the week 4 criterion was not met but undetectability was reached before week 20, total treatment duration was 48 weeks. The main purpose of the present trial was to evaluate the short and long-term effects of different dose regimens (750 mg q8h and 1125 mg q12h) of telaprevir when co-administered with standard therapy. Another purpose was to explore the efficacy of the association of telaprevir and each of the 2 licensed Peg-IFNs (i.e., Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and Peg-IFN-alfa-2b) with RBV. This was a pilot trial, however, and it was underpowered to draw formal non-inferiority conclusions concerning either the q12h telaprevir regimen or co-treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b rather than -2a. The main findings of this study include:  The point estimate for SVR was approximately 80% in each of the treatment arms, regardless of whether telaprevir was dosed twice of thrice daily, and which of the peginteferons were used.  A response guided algorithm of 24 or 48 weeks of total therapy depending on early response therapy was compatible with high response rates.

This study was randomized, stratified, partially placebo-controlled, partially double-blind. Patients had genotype 1 HCV infection, and had been treated with Peg-IFN (either peginterferon alfa-2a or peginterferon alfa-2b) and RBV, but did not achieve SVR. The treatment population included subjects with prior nonresponse (never had undetectable HCV RNA during prior treatment), prior relapse (had undetectable HCV RNA during prior treatment, but did not have SVR) or prior viral breakthrough (had undetectable HCV RNA during prior treatment, but then had detectable HCV RNA before the end of treatment). The applicant lacked sufficient information about prior treatment to classify nonresponders as 'partial' or 'null' responders (&gt;2log 10 decline at week 12 but never undetectable, or &lt;2log10 decline at week 12). Exclusion criteria included patients with decompensated liver disease or HIV/HBV co-infection. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Table 11. Treatment Groups Importantly, this is the only study in which a longer duration than 12 weeks of telaprevir treatment was investigated. Also, whereas the ribavirin-sparing arm in the 104EU study was only 12 weeks total, considered too short for maximal efficacy in most settings, it was 24 weeks in the present study. Table 12.

CHMP assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main findings of this study were:

-  Telaprevir triple therapy regimens yielded clinically and statistically significant increases in response rates for both prior non-responders and relapsers. The performance of the control arm in each subgroup was roughly as expected.
-  Efficacy was higher in subtype 1b than 1a, with &gt;60% versus 46-48% SVR rates.

 A regimen of 24 weeks of telaprevir and peginterferon without ribavirin had insufficient virological efficacy and very high relapse rates.  Viral breakthrough rates between treatment week 12 and 24 were similar regardless of whether telaprevir was stopped according to protocol at week 12 or 24, thus not indicating any significant advantage of extending telaprevir therapy beyond 12 weeks. 24 weeks of telaprevir therapy was associated with a higher AE burden and more discontinuations than was 12 weeks. This, together with modelling data, informed the decision not to study longer duration of telaprevir than 12 weeks in the phase III trials.  The predictive value of an eRVR for SVR was higher in patients with prior relapse than in patients with prior non-response. The predictivity of eRVR for SVR in relapsers was roughly similar (25/28 vs 21/23) regardless of whether the total duration of therapy was 24 or 48 weeks. As expected, the likelihood of SVR in case of no eRVR was higher in the 48 weeks total duration arm.  Patients without eRVR had lower response rates in the 24 week arm than in the 48 week arm. Relapse rates were higher for prior non-responders in the 24 weeks than in the 48 weeks triple therapy arm, both in patients reaching an eRVR and in those who did not. Study-107: A rollover protocol of telaprevir in Combination with peginterferon Alfa-2a and ribavirin in subjects enrolled in the control groups of studies-106, -104 and -104EU who did not reach SVR All subjects received telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFN/RBV for 12 weeks. This was followed by treatment with Peg-IFN/RBV for an additional 12 (T12/PR24) or 36 weeks (T12/PR48). The main findings in this study were:  SVR rates in prior null responders (mostly with a 48 weeks total treatment duration) was 37%, with a considerably higher point estimate in patients treated for 48 weeks rather than 24 weeks  SVR rates among partial responders was 55% and in prior relapsers 97%  24/25 prior relapsers treated for 24 weeks achieved SVR. All 24 prior relapsers with eRVR that were treated for 24 weeks experienced SVR (no relapse). 2.5.2. Main studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study -108: A Phase 3 Study of 2 Dose Regimens of Telaprevir in Combination With Peginterferon Alfa-2a (Pegasys) and Ribavirin (Copegus) in Treatment-Naïve Subjects with Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. The study compared 8 or 12 weeks of planned telaprevir therapy, followed by a peginterferon ribavirin tail for a total of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on whether eRVR was reached. This was the first study aiming at SVR in which a shorter duration of telaprevir than 12 weeks was tested. The comparator arm received pegIFN alfa-2a and ribavirin as in previous placebo-controlled studies.

To evaluate the safety of telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (based on adverse events, physical examination findings, and clinical laboratory, vital sign,  ECG assessments and Total Fatigue Score from the FSS).

Stopping rules included that for telaprevir treated patients with HCV-RNA &gt;1000 copies/mL at week 4, telaprevir was stopped. If HCV-RNA was &gt;1000 copies at week 12, the patient's response was deemed virological failure. Stopping rules for the control arm were according to label for peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (Copegus). Objectives and endpoints Primary objective: To demonstrate the efficacy of telaprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. The primary endpoint was SVRplanned - that is, SVR 24 weeks after the planned end of therapy (after 24 or 48 weeks). Secondary objective: Medicinal product no longer authorised

All plasma HCV RNA levels were assessed using the Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay (Version 2.0, lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] of 25 IU/mL).

## Sample size

Assuming a 50% response rate in the control group, a 64% response rate in a telaprevir group, a 2sided continuity corrected Chi-squared test, with an overall significance level of 5% (adjusted for multiple comparisons), a sample size of 350 subjects in each treatment group provides a power of 92% to demonstrate a statistically significant treatment difference.

Randomisation The study was randomised. Subject were stratified to optimize balance among the treatment groups with regard to genotype 1 subtype and baseline viral load (HCV RNA &lt;800000 IU/mL or ≥ 800000 IU/mL). Blinding (masking) This was a double-blind study in which the sponsor, investigator, study personnel, and study participants were to be blinded with respect to telaprevir treatment. Results Study subject disposition Table 14. Treatment and Study Completion Status and Reasons for Discontinuation, Full Analysis Set On treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were higher in the telaprevir arms compared to the control, whereas discontinuation due to virologic failure (stopping rules) was substantially more common in the placebo arm. Loss to follow up or withdrawal of consent during the entire study was between 6.3% and 10.7% in the different arms, with the highest number in the T8/PR arm. Though the mean duration of follow up after end of therapy was longer in the telaprevir arms, the loss to follow up was roughly similar between arms. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Estimated treatment adherence to telaprevir was very good and similar between arms. The lower ribavirin adherence in the telaprevir treatment groups would be due to the additive effects on anemia seen when telaprevir and ribavirin is combined (see section on clinical safety).

There were three modes of assessing SVR rates described in the protocol. The primary endpoint was SVRplanned - that is, SVR 24 weeks after the planned end of therapy (after 24 or 48 weeks)

While the actual number of cirrhotics included is low, the percentage is roughly similar to that in the IDEAL study. As expected given that the study was largely conducted in North America, the proportion of patients with subtype 1a is higher than 1b. Mean VL is roughly similar to the IDEAL study. Baseline disease characteristics are well balanced between groups, though there is a trend to more advanced fibrosis in the T8PR arm. Numbers analysed All efficacy analyses were conducted using the FA Set, which consisted of the 1088 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

Fifty seven and 58% of patients in the T8/PR and T12PR groups reached eRVR and were thus eligible for 24 weeks of therapy. Point estimates for SVR rates were higher in the T12PR group compared to the T8PR group regardless of whether eRVR (and shorter total duration of therapy) was reached or not.

Both telaprevir arms were significantly superior to placebo on the primary endpoint. The response in the T12/PR arm was numerically superior to that in the T8/PR arm. The placebo arm performed at the level of efficacy that would be expected. The difference in SVR24planned for T8/PR group versus T12/PR group was -6.0% (95% CI [-12.5%, 0.6%]).

-  Almost 60% of patients in the twelve week telaprevir arm achieved an eRVR and were thus assigned 24 weeks of therapy. The relapse rate in such patients was 7% in the 12-week telaprevir arm.

As with standard of care, SVR rates in patients treated with telaprevir were lower in patients with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis. Also, in patients with baseline viral load &lt; 800,000 copies, SVR rates were higher in all treatment arms. The advantage of adding telaprevir was consistent over sex, age, BMI, race, region, baseline viral load, liver disease status and the presence or absence of diabetes. In summary, the main findings of the pivotal -108 study in treatment naive patients were:  Both the 12-weeks and the 8 weeks telaprevir arm, with a subsequent peginterferon/ribavirin tail for a total of 24 or 48 weeks duration depending on eRVR, were superior to 48 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin with placebo.  A higher on-treatment virological failure rate after telaprevir treatment completion was found in the 8 week telaprevir arm. As the viral genotype of these excess failures were wild-type or low-level resistant variants which might have been cleared by further telaprevir treatment, these data indicate a virological edge of twelve rather than eight weeks of telaprevir therapy. Since the excess number of serious adverse events with 12 rather than 8 weeks of telaprevir therapy were marginal, these data support the dosing of telaprevir for 12 weeks.

The study was designed to evaluate the SVR rates in subjects who achieved an eRVR (undetectable HCV RNA levels at Week 4 and Week 12 on treatment) with telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFNalfa-2a and RBV. Methods Participants Main Inclusion criteria: Male and female subjects between 18 to 70 years of age (inclusive) with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection who had not been previously treated for HCV were eligible for the study. Main exclusion criteria: Subjects with decompensated liver disease and HIV or HBV co-infection were excluded from the study. Treatment Telaprevir was administered orally in the fed state at a dose of 750 mg every 8 hours (q8h). Peg-IFNalfa-2a was administered by subcutaneous injection once per week at a dose of 180 μ g.  RBV was administered orally twice daily at a dose of 1000 mg/day for subjects weighing &lt;75 kg and 1200 mg/day for subjects weighing ≥ 75 kg. The treatment regimens were 24 or 48 weeks in duration, with telaprevir administered in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV for the first 12 weeks (i.e., T12/PR24 arm or T12/PR48 arms, respectively).

Subjects who achieved an eRVR and completed the Week 20 visit were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to stop all study treatment at Week 24 or to continue treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV to Week 48 (T12/PR48/eRVR+ group). Subjects who did not achieve an eRVR were assigned a total treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV for 48 weeks (T12/PR48/eRVR- group). Subjects who prematurely discontinued treatment before Week 20 were not randomized or assigned to a treatment regimen. These subjects were included in the group designated 'Other'. Objectives and endpoints Primary objective To  estimate  the  difference  in  SVR  rates  between  T12/PR24  and  T12/PR48  treatment  regimens  in subjects who achieve eRVR. The primary efficacy variable was the SVR24planned rate, defined as undetectable HCV RNA levels at the end of treatment (EOT) visit and at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment without any confirmed detectable HCV RNA levels in between those visits. Secondary objective To evaluate the safety of telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (based on adverse events, physical examination findings, and clinical laboratory, vital sign,  ECG assessments and Total Fatigue Score from the FSS). All plasma HCV RNA levels were assessed using the Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay (Version 2.0, lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] of 25 IU/mL). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Sample size

The sample size was estimated based on a 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference between stopping treatment at week 24 and continuing treatment to week 48, assuming an expected SVR rate of 90% in each group, based on randomization at Week 20. With SVR rates of 90% in the T12/PR24 and T12/PR48 arms and at least 157 randomized subjects in each arm, a 2-sided 95%

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

confidence interval on the observed treatment difference in SVR rates between stopping treatment at week 24 and continuing treatment to week 48 will have at least 80% power to exclude a 10.5% difference.

Based on data from Phase 2 clinical studies, it was assumed that the combined proportion of subjects who were likely to discontinue treatment prior to randomization and the proportion of subjects that were unlikely to achieve eRVR would be about 33% of the total number of subjects enrolled. Therefore, the target enrollment was to be 470-500 subjects.

Randomisation The study was randomised. Subjects were stratified to optimize balance among the treatment groups with regard to genotype 1 subtype and baseline viral load (HCV RNA &lt;800000 IU/mL or ≥ 800000 IU/mL). Blinding (Masking) This was a double-blind study in which the sponsor, investigator, study personnel, and study participants were to be blinded with respect to telaprevir treatment. Numbers analysed Efficacy analyses were conducted using the FA set, which consisted of the 540 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In addition, the PPA set was used to provide supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable.

Discontinuations during follow-up were roughly similar in both of the randomised groups. The majority of the 'other' category, that is, patients not reaching week 20 randomisation/assignment discontinued due to adverse events 62/540 patients dosed (11%), a figure which is comparable to the -108 study. 12/540 (2.2%) subjects discontinued prior to week 20 due to virological failure. The total proportion of treatment discontinuations was considerably larger among patients randomised to 48, compared to 24 weeks of therapy after reaching an eRVR. Given that this was a non-inferiority study, it is acknowledged that this could theoretically have compromised the conclusions of the trial. However, given the SVR rate of 92% seen in eRVR patients randomised to 24 weeks of therapy (see below), it is considered that this likely did not affect assay sensitivity, but could rather be seen to indicate the value of a shortened treatment duration in terms of tolerability.

A higher proportion and absolute number of treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis were treated with telaprevir in this study compared to the -108. Subtype 1a is more dominant than in the -108, reflecting the mainly US population. Baseline viral load is roughly similar to the -108. Primary outcomes (SVR) Table 29.

SVR(planned) and SVR at week 72 was defined as in the -108 study (see above). The non-inferiority of 24 weeks duration for treatment naïve patients with eRVR was demonstrated (preset NI margin 10.5%), with a higher point estimate for response in the shorter duration arm. The absolute response

Across demographic categories, results were consistent. This includes the small black group were patients with eRVR had similar SVR rates regardless of 24 or 48 weeks of treatment duration. Of note, however, the total sample size with black race and eRVR was a mere 17+17 patients.

While results were consistent regardless of baseline HCV-RNA, patients with cirrhosis and eRVR that were randomised to 48 rather than 24 weeks of total therapy had a 91.7% versus a 66.7% SVR rate. On this basis, the applicant suggested that labelling for treatment naïve patients with cirrhotics should be 48 weeks regardless of eRVR status. While the basis for this conservative approach is recognised, it is noted that it is based on subgroup analysis of a sample of 18+12 individuals, which really precludes any certain inference. The CHMP also notes that no similar trend is seen in patients categorised as bridging fibrosis, which would have supported the differential effect in cirrhotics being a real finding. All in all, it remains unknown whether 24 weeks of therapy is sufficient in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis and eRVR. Thus, the recommendation of  48 weeks of therapy represents a conservative interpretation of study outcome in this subgroup with the most urgent need for successful therapy. In summary the main findings of this study were:  Among treatment-naive patients that reached eRVR, SVR rates were 92% in patients randomised to a total of 24 weeks of therapy, following 12 weeks of telaprevir, compared to 87.5% in patients randomised to 48 weeks of therapy (difference 4.5%, 95% CI -2. - 11%). Non-inferiority was set at -10.5%. Therefore the non-inferiority of the response guided algorithm (24 or 48 weeks depending on whether eRVR is reached) was demonstrated in this population.  The primary outcome was consistent through the subgroups of age, gender, race, viral subtype and baseline viral load.  Among patients with cirrhosis who achieved an eRVR, however, SVR rates were 12/18 (66.7%) with 24 weeks and 11/12 (91.7%) with 48 weeks of therapy. The difference is -25% and the 95% confidence interval, according to the CHMP's statistics, i -52% - +2%. There was no similar trend among patients with bridging fibrosis.

-  As expected, there was a higher burden of AEs, SAEs, and related treatment discontinuations in the longer duration treatment group (T12/PR48/eRVR+) compared to the shorter duration treatment group (T12/PR24/eRVR+).

-  This study supports the use of response guided therapy in treatment naive patients. The study is inconclusive as to whether this also applies in the case that there is cirrhosis.

## Objectives and endpoints

The primary objective was to demonstrate the superior efficacy of telaprevir in combination with PegIFN alfa-2a and RBV compared to standard treatment in subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection who failed prior treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV.

The main efficacy variable was SVR, defined as having undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study drug SVR24planned.

The study was randomised. Subject were stratified based on screening HCV RNA value (&lt;800000 IU/mL or ≥ 800000 IU/mL) and on type of prior response (prior relapser or prior non-responder). Furthermore, for the stratum of prior non-responders, an additional stratification was for prior nullresponders or prior partial responders, defined as follows: (1) subjects with &lt;2-log drop in HCV RNA at Week 12 of prior therapy (null-responders) or (2) subjects with ≥ 2-log drop in HCV RNA at Week 12 of prior therapy but who never achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels while on treatment (partial responders). Enrolment was limited such that neither of these strata would represent more than 55% of the non-responder subpopulation.

The main Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of delayed start of telaprevir on the efficacy and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFN alfa-2a and RBV; All plasma HCV RNA levels were assessed using the Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay (Version 2.0, lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] of 25 IU/mL). Sample size Relapsers Assuming a 55% response rate in the groups receiving Treatment A or B, a 29% response rate in the group receiving Treatment C, a 2-sided continuity corrected Chi-squared test, with an overall significance level of 5% (adjusted for multiple comparisons of A and B versus C), and a 2:2:1 randomization, a sample size of 140 subjects each in the groups receiving Treatment A or Treatment B and 70 subjects in the group receiving Treatment C provided a power of approximately 90% to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. Non-responders Assuming a 30% response rate in the groups receiving Treatment A or B, a 8% response rate in the group receiving Treatment C, a 2-sided continuity corrected Chi-squared test, with an overall significance level of 5% (adjusted for multiple comparisons of A and B versus C), and a 2:2:1 randomization, a sample size of 120 subjects each in the groups receiving Treatment A or Treatment B and 60 subjects in the group receiving Treatment C provided a power of approximately 90% to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. If deemed appropriate in pooling of the two telaprevir arms in the population of null-responders, a total of 120 telaprevir-treated subjects would be compared with 30 control subjects which resulted in at least 80% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference by assuming an SVR rate of 4% and 29% (25% difference) in control and combined telaprevir arms, respectively. Overall, 350 subjects who relapsed during prior treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV and 300 subjects who were non-responding to prior treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV needed to be recruited, leading to a total of 650 subjects.

Gender distribution shows about 70% males. About 90% of patients were Caucasian with low representation of blacks. Mean viral load was somewhat higher than in the naïve studies. Notably, almost a quarter of the patients had cirrhosis and another quarter bridging fibrosis. Viral subtypes were relatively evenly divided. Approximately half the patients were prior relapsers and half nonresponders, with a balanced distribution between treatment arms.

89% of patients had baseline HCV RNA levels &gt; 800,000 IU/ml; 22% had bridging fibrosis; 26% had cirrhosis; 54% had HCV genotype 1a; and 46% had HCV genotype 1b.

Numbers analysed The efficacy analysis was carried out on the FA set which consisted of 662 subjects. Primary endpoint (SVR) Table 38. SVR24planned Rates and Statistical Comparison (Logistic Regression) for SVR24planned - Overall Population, FA Set As the treatment duration was similar in all treatment groups, the planned assessment was at study week 72 (24 weeks after the end of therapy) for all patients. For the overall population, with subgroups that had very heterogeneous response rates (see below), superiority was demonstrated over placebo for each of the telaprevir arms. The point estimate for the difference between arms favoured the delayed start arm by 3%, with confidence limits -13 - +7% in the logistic regression model.

The superiority of telaprevir over placebo was apparent in all categories. The likelihood of SVR was 20% higher in partial responders with subtype 1b compared to 1a. In prior partial responders with cirrhosis, the SVR rates are considerably lower than in patients with less advanced liver injury.

Telaprevir was clearly superior to placebo in all categories above. Prior relapsers had very high SVR rates regardless of viral subtype. Also, 84% of prior relapsers with cirrhosis reached SVR.

Again superiority over placebo was apparent in all categories. In null responders, the difference in response depending on subtype is more pronounced than among relapsers, as would be expected. The number of patients with low baseline HCV-RNA is too small to make any inferences. The SVR point estimate for null responders with cirrhosis is 14% in the pooled telaprevir arms. Table 45.

There was a consistent superiority of telaprevir over placebo across subgroups, excepting the black population of partial responders, the size of which is simply too small. In prior partial responders, as opposed to relapsers, there appears to be an impact of BMI, with higher values associated with decreasing response. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 50. Cumulative Viral Breakthrough Rate at EOT by Genotype (NS3 Method) - Null-Responder Population, FA Set Virological breakthrough is rare in prior relapsers, who have a sufficient background interferon response. In null responders breakthrough rates are between 34-55% and more frequent in subtype 1a. In genotype 1a 30/136 (22%) of patients in the immediate start arm had experienced a virological breakthrough, and 30/149 (20%) of patients in the delayed start arm. Also, at week 16, 28/121 (23%) of prior non-responders in the immediate start and 23/123 (19%) of prior non-responders in the delayed start arm had been recorded as experiencing a virological breakthrough.

Comparing the virological outcomes of the immediate and delayed start, there were 6 more patients with on-treatment virological failure in the immediate start arm. All of these met a virologic stopping rule. Of note, these prescribed that patients with &gt;100 IU/mL at week 4, 6 or 8 after starting telaprevir , in either treatment arm, should discontinue telaprevir (see above). These stopping rules inherently create a bias in favour of the delayed start arm, as its patients would have four extra weeks of lead in treatment at each futility point, compared to patients in the immediate start arm.

-  The likelihood of on-treatment virological failure depends on prior virological response, indicating the importance of peginterferon activity also when a DAA is added. The rate of patients classified as on-treatment virological failure was approximately 1% in prior relapsers and about 40% among pooled prior non-responders.

Table 55. Relapse Week 72 Rate - Prior Null-responder Population, FA Set Relapse rates in prior relapsers were on the same levels as seen in a treatment naïve population, whereas relapse rates in prior non-responders were in the range of 20-25%. In summary, the main findings of this study include:  The superiority of both immediate and delayed start telaprevir based regimens over placebo was demonstrated, with point estimates for SVR in the full treatment population of 64% (telaprevir immediate start), 66% (telaprevir, delayed start) and 17% (peginterferon+ribavirin+placebo).  Statistically significant superiority was demonstrated for each telaprevir regimen over placebo in the three subcategories of prior response patterns, relapsers, partial responders (at least 2 log 10 decline at week 12 of prior therapy with peginterferon+ribavirin) and null responders less than 2 log 10 decline at week 12 of prior therapy.  In prior relapsers, SVR rates in the telaprevir (immediate and delayed start) arms and in the control arm were 83%, 88% and 23.5% respectively.  In prior partial responders, SVR rates in the telaprevir arms (immediate and delayed start) and in the control arm were 60%, 54% and 15% respectively.  In prior null responders, SVR rates in the telaprevir (immediate and delayed start) arms and in the control arm were 30%, 33% and 5% respectively.

-  The benefit of telaprevir appear consistent over subgroups where n is large enough for direct conclusions, such as age, gender, viral subtype, baseline viral load, degree of fibrosis in the overall population. It is noted, though, that some relevant subgroups, such as prior null responders with cirrhosis, are very small. Also, the full black population in this study had n=30.

 Though formal 'non-inferiority' according to pre-specified criteria was not met for immediate start versus delayed start, the study did not produce any clear indication of an advantage of the delayed start. Also, the stopping criteria created a bias in favour of the delayed start arm.  Both on treatment virological response and prior virological response appear to be determinants of the probability of SVR.  Though there is a likely advantage of telaprevir over placebo in all relevant subgroups, absolute SVR rates remain low in some population categories, despite the addition of telaprevir. These include, e.g. prior null responders with subtype 1a (27%) and prior null responders with cirrhosis (14%). IL28B genotype and telaprevir response In a seminal study by Ge et al 1 Nature Genetics 2009 describing the relation of IL28B genotype and outcome in the treatment of HCV genotype 1, a total of 1137 treatment-naïve subjects treated with Peg-IFN/RBV in the IDEAL trial were studied, of which 392 had the IL28B CC genotype, 559 the IL28B CT genotype, and 186 the IL28B TT genotype. Corresponding SVR rates were ~80% for the CC genotype, ~39% for the CT genotype, and ~25% for the TT genotype. The differences in response observed between subjects of Caucasian and African descent can also be in part explained by a difference in IL28B CC genotype frequency between these two races (39% of Caucasians, and 16% of African American). There are data available on IL28B genotype from the pivotal studies -108 in treatment naive patients and the -216 in treatment experienced patients as presented hereafter. IL28B as a predictor of response in treatment naive patients In a retrospective study with de-identified data, IL28B genotype was determined for patients in the pivotal -108 trial in treatment naive patients. This sample included only patients from the US study sites. SVR rates in the pharmacogenomics subsample were comparable with outcomes in the whole study population, as shown below (table 56) Table 56.

SVR rates in the telaprevir arms were higher regardless of IL28B genotype in treatment naive patients. Also from a theoretical point of view, an incremental effect on SVR for each genotype is likely. Furthermore, the proportion of CC patients eligible for shortened treatment duration is likely to be considerable. As a general comment, with the addition of more antiviral potency, SVR rates will increase. When SVR rates are reaching the maximum, given treatment discontinuations due to side effects, adding further antiviral potency will still allow for a decrease in treatment duration. IL28B as a predictor of response in treatment experienced patients Of the 662 subjects enrolled in the pivotal study in treatment experienced patients (-216), 527 (79.6%) consented to genetic data collection and analysis. Overall, 17.6% of subjects in this study had the IL28B CC genotype, 61.5% had the IL28B CT genotype, and 20.9% had the IL28B TT genotype. By prior response, the frequency of the IL28B CC, CT, and TT genotypes was as follows:  26.8%, 56.3%, and 16.9%, respectively, for the prior relapser population,  13.1%, 67.7%, and 19.2%, respectively, for the prior partial responder population,  6.0%, 65.9%, and 28.1%, respectively, for the prior null-responder population. As would be expected, among patients with prior treatment failure, CC genotype is more common with a history of prior relapse than with a history of prior non-response. In the context of interpreting the impact of IL28B genotype in patients with prior treatment failure, it should be noted that any person with CC genotype failing therapy with peginterferon+ribavirin is displaying a phenotype that is not characteristic of the genotype. All in all the impact of IL28 genotype on retreatment outcomes is considerably less investigated than in naïve patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Regardless of IL28B genotype and prior treatment response, the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon+ribavirin was more efficacious, in a treatment experienced population. As CC genotype was most common among relapsers and least common among null responders, it is not surprising that they had the highest response rate in the overall population. In conclusion, overall, regardless of IL28B genotype, the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon+ribavirin resulted in higher SVR rates, in treatment naive- as well as experienced patients. In the light of the full body of evidence on telaprevir efficacy, the data support the positive risk benefit over all IL28B genotypes. Analysis performed across trials A cross study comparison was carried out to substantiate the treatment of prior relapsers with response guided therapy, since RGT has not been formally studied in this patient group. While no prior relapsers in the phase III programme were treated with 24 weeks total therapy after experiencing an eRVR, a total of 67 prior relapsers were randomised to treatment arms with 24 weeks of therapy in the phase II programme. Table 59, below, demonstrates the demographics of these patients, in comparison to the patients treated in the -216 study (prior relapsers), and those treated in the -111 study, investigating the merits of response guided therapy in treatment naive patients.

The following considerations need to be taken into account when evaluating the likelihood that prior relapsers with an eRVR could be treated for 24 rather than 48 weeks total, without decreasing the likelihood of SVR:  In Study 111, the SVR rate in treatment-naïve subjects with undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 4 and 12 was 92.0% in the T12/PR24 group and 87.5% in the T24/PR48 group.  In Study 106, the SVR rate was 69.0% in subjects with prior relapse in the T12/PR24 group. Among subjects with prior relapse in this treatment group who had undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 4 and 12, the SVR rate was 89.3%.  In Study 107, the SVR rate was 96.0% in subjects with prior relapse in the T12/PR24 group. Among subjects with prior relapse in this treatment group who had undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 4 and 12, the SVR rate was 100%.  In Study 108, the SVR rate was 74.7% in treatment-naïve subjects in the T12/PR group.Among subjects in this treatment group that had undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 4 and 12, and were assigned to a Peg-IFN/RBV treatment duration of 24 weeks, the SVR rate was 89.2%.  In Study C216, the SVR rate was 83.4% in subjects with prior relapse in the T12/PR48 group. Among subjects with prior relapse in this treatment group who had undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 4 and 12, the SVR rate was 95.8%.  Relapse rates were low and similar to those seen in treatment naïves, in subjects with prior relapse that received T12/PR24 regimens in the -106 and -107 studies, and  had undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 4 and 12 (table 60).

Low level resistant variants at baseline were detectable by population sequencing in approximately 3.5% of treated (DAA-naive) patients. Telaprevir appears to have reduced but clinically relevant activity in such patients, with mutants showing up to a 7.4-fold change in IC50. Preliminary data indicate that some such resistant variants may reduce, though in most cases not abrogate, the efficacy of telaprevir. The concern is most relevant for prior null responders, where 0/5 patients with resistant mutant variants at baseline reached SVR.

The demographic data in the required cross-study comparison do not preclude the conjecture that prior relapsers with eRVR might be treated for 24 weeks without loss of SVR. Also, available data do indicate that a shortened treatment duration in relapsers with eRVR is likely to yield similar high SVR rates as does 48 weeks of therapy. These data are further supported by a pharmacometric analysis conducted by the FDA and submitted to CHMP by the applicant, indicating that would-be relapsers, if treated with pegIFN and ribavirin only, had a considerable representation among patients achieving eRVR and receiving 24 weeks of therapy within the -108 and -111 studies with very high SVR rates. All in all, available data are considered sufficiently compelling for the CHMP to support the labelling of the RGT algorithm also for prior relapsers. Clinical virology The main findings in the clinical virology studies of telaprevir include:  Due to the low fidelity of the HCV RNA polymerase, there is a great intra-patient diversity of viral quasispecies, including the pre-existence of drug-resistant variants, which exist at low levels due to decreased fitness. These are selected for by telaprevir therapy.  There is cross resistance within the NS3/4A inhibitor class, but not to the drugs tested from other classes (e.g., NS5B inhibitors) or to interferon/ribavirin.  Viral variants selected for by telaprevir were categorised by the applicant as low level ( &lt;25fold) and high level (&gt;25 fold) resistant variants.  Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Resistant variants demonstrate reduced fitness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  In patients with genotype 1a, on-treatment virological failure during the telaprevir treatment phase was associated with the selection of high level resistant variants - predominantly double mutants with amino acid substitutions V36M+R155K.
-  In patients with genotype 1b, on-treatment virological failure during the telaprevir treatment phase was associated with the selection of high level resistant variants with A156T/V substitutions.

 On treatment virological failure during the peginterferon/ribavirin tail in genotype 1a is, in about half the cases, associated with the dominance of high level resistant V36M+R155K double mutants, and in the other cases, mostly by the dominance of low level resistant single V36M or R155 mutants. In genotype 1b it is associated with either wild-type virus, or the low level resistant T54A/S and V 36 A/M single mutant variants.  Relapse was associated with higher level resistant variants or with lower level single mutant resistant variants at position 36 or 155 in subtype 1a, and with the lower level resistant variants at position 36 or 54 in genotype 1b. Also, a considerable portion of patients appeared to relapse with wild-type. It is notable, however, that relapse is usually assessed quite some time after the discontinuation of therapy, and the true relapsing viral population may in some cases have reverted to a more fit genotype at the time of sampling. The evolution of resistant variants after treatment discontinuation In an interim analysis of the ongoing long term follow up -112 study,  median in 89% (50/56) of subjects with resistance mutations, these were no longer detected by population sequencing, after a median follow-up of 25 months. In a subsequent clonal sequence substudy 20/20 of these samples were similar in composition to that seen at baseline, indicating a full reversibility of the selected viral population. Also, data from the follow up of the phase III trials indicated reversion to wild-type by population sequencing, with median times to reversion for the relevant single and double mutants of 15-56 weeks. In summary, available data are indicative of a full reversion to the pretreatment population after discontinuation of therapy, at least in some patients and possibly in most patients. A conclusive assessment of the consequences of selected resistance during failed telaprevir therapy, however, would require adequately designed studies of retreatment. Virologic stopping rules The following stopping rules are recommended by the applicant to avoid unnecessary exposure to drugs in patients who are not likely to achieve SVR and to curtail potential evolution of telaprevirresistant HCV variants that could occur with continued telaprevir treatment:  Patients with &gt;1000 IU/mL HCV RNA at Week 4 of telaprevir, Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV treatment should discontinue all drugs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

-  Patients with &gt;1000 IU/mL HCV RNA at Week 12 of telaprevir, Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV treatment should discontinue all drugs.
-  In prior null-responders, consideration should be given to conduct an additional HCV RNA test between Weeks 4 and 12. If the HCV RNA is &gt;1000 IU/mL, telaprevir, Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV treatment should be discontinued.

CHMP assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  In patients receiving a total of 48 weeks of treatment, Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV should be discontinued if HCV RNA is detectable at Week 24 or Week 36.

The stopping rules utilized during drug development varied between clinical trials. It should be noted that the very use of stopping rules within trials preclude a fully informed post hoc identification of optimal stopping rules, as patients in trials not meeting predefined criteria will have discontinued by default. Consequently, full information on the operative characteristics of the stopping rules is lacking. The abovementioned rules represent a simplification of the various rules used in the phase III program. This particular set of rules was not used in any of the trials, but has been agreed on with the FDA and proposed by the applicant to the CHMP.

The interim analysis available at the primary assessment included data for 123 subjects in Cohort A. the median duration of follow-up between the SVR time point in the previous study and the last time point available in Study 112 (as of the IA) was 22.13 months (range: 5.1 to 35.2 months).No subjects had late relapse during the observational period in Study 112, which is ongoing. These data demonstrate that late relapse in subjects treated with a telaprevir-based regimen is rare (&lt;1%).

As a background, none of the 25 subjects with HCV RNA &gt;1000 IU/mL at Week 4 who discontinued telaprevir in the T12/PR groups of Studies 108, 111, and C216, achieved an SVR with continued PegIFN/RBV treatment. Therefore discontinuation of the whole regimen is recommended in this situation. In studies 108 and 111, 4/16 (25%) subjects with HCV RNA levels between 100 and 1000 IU/mL at Week 4 were able to achieve an SVR with continued telaprevir treatment. Thus the higher level of HCV-RNA is chosen for stopping. As approximately 10% of prior null responders had virological breakthrough detected at week 6 or 8, the suggestion for more intense monitoring in this group is warranted. In subjects with HCV RNA between 100 and 1000 IU/ml at Week 12, 2/8 (25%) achieved an SVR. On the contrary, none of the 11 subjects with HCV RNA &gt;1000 IU/mL at Week 12 who were still on telaprevir/Peg-IFN/RBV treatment in the T12/PR groups of Studies 108, 111 and C216 achieved an SVR with continued Peg-IFN/RBV treatment. Therefore the recommendation is to stop the whole regimen if HCV-RNA at week 12 is &gt;1000 IU/mL. Supportive studies The long term durability of SVR with telaprevir based therapy The durability of SVR was investigated during Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of treatment naïve and treatment-failure subjects who received a telaprevir-based regimen. The durability of SVR was also evaluated in an interim analysis of a 3-year follow-up study (112) in subjects who had been treated with telaprevir in Phase 2 studies. The subjects in whom durability of SVR was evaluated included subjects who completed treatment as well as subjects who discontinued treatment, and subjects from all telaprevir treatment regimens in the studies, including regimens without RBV and regimens with Peg-IFN/RBV durations of 12, 24, or 48 weeks. Study 112; cohort A Cohort A of the long-term follow up study 112 consists of subjects who received at least 1 dose of telaprevir-based treatment and achieved an SVR in the previous telaprevir study. Approximately 150 subjects who achieve an SVR following telaprevir-based treatment in the previous clinical studies are expected to enroll in Cohort A. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall of the 852 subjects who received a telaprevir-based regimen, had SVR, and had at least 1 post-SVR follow-up assessment, 8 subjects had late relapse during the follow-up period in their original

study, all within 6 months after SVR. All other subjects with SVR, who have been followed for up to 3 years after the end of treatment, continued to have undetectable HCV RNA. Thus, available data support the long term durability of SVR.

## Clinical studies in special populations

Studies are ongoing in patients with non-genotype 1 virus and in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. No SVR outcomes were available during the assessment.

Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of the clinical studies The telaprevir clinical development program aiming at an indication  for all treatment naïve- and experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and compensated liver disease, that do not have HIV or HBV co-infection, comprises a total of 3 short term studies, 5 phase II studies targeting SVR, and three pivotal trials. The program has been quite extensive, investigating numerous possibilities in terms of combinations and durations of the treatment component. Still, the complexity of the clinical issues are well illustrated by the fact that several questions still remain concerning the optimal duration of therapy in subsets of patients. The studies reported appear to have been well conducted. The standard-of-care arms have performed as expected, and the loss to follow up has been reasonably low. Furthermore, there are interim data from a long term follow up study of the durability of SVR, as well as the evolution of resistant variants selected in patients treated with telaprevir but failing to reach SVR. Available long term follow up data indicate the durability of SVR obtained with telaprevir. Also, data indicate that the resistant viral population selected when failing a telaprevir-based regimen in most cases is likely to revert to wild-type with time. Retreatment studies, however, are not available The efficacy of telaprevir in treatment naive patients In the pivotal -108 study in treatment naive patients, the SVR rate in the 12 week telaprevir arm was 74.7%, a 30.9% increase compared to the placebo+peginterferon alfa-2a+ribavirin arm, which was highly statistically significant. Apart from the SVR advantage, 58% of patients reached an eRVR, making them eligible for 24 rather than 48 weeks of total therapy. The -111 study in treatment naive patients demonstrated that this strategy of shortened therapy for early responders is non-inferior to a full 48 weeks total duration of therapy, with a point estimate for response guided therapy which was higher than for standard-duration therapy. This greatly increased efficacy and shortened treatment duration represents a very substantial improvement in therapy for HCV genotype 1. The advantage of telaprevir was apparent across demographic and baseline disease categories, including men and women, high and low BMI, patients of black race, patients with high viral load, degree of liver injury. Regarding IL28B genotype, the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon+ribavirin resulted in higher SVR rates regardless of genotype and treatment experience. In the light of the full body of evidence on telaprevir efficacy, this retrospective analysis  supports the positive risk benefit over all IL28B genotypes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the -111 study, the response guided algorithm of study -106, for patients with eRVR, was compared with a 48 weeks total duration. Equivalent efficacy was apparent over all the aforementioned categories with the exception of patients with cirrhosis, for whom the point estimate favoured a longer treatment duration also in patients with eRVR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Comments on the labelling for treatment naive patients

The label sought for treatment naïve patients is telaprevir 750 mg thrice daily in combination with a peginterferon and ribavirin, including twelve weeks of triple therapy, followed by 12 or 36 additional weeks of peginterferon and ribavirin, depending on whether an eRVR is reached or not. The exception to this rule pertains to patients with cirrhosis, for whom 48 weeks duration is prescribed regardless of early viral response.

The placebo controlled phase III -216 study was conducted in treatment-experienced patients, including prior relapsers, partial responders and null responders. All patients in the experimental arms received 12 weeks of telaprevir therapy, with or without a delayed start (1 month lead in). The planned treatment duration for all patients was 48 weeks. SVR rates in all three prior response subcategories were statistically significantly superior to placebo, with a total difference in SVR rates of + 47% with the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin. The advantage of adding telaprevir was also apparent regardless of viral subtype, baseline viral load or degree of liver injury. There is no subgroup contradicting the general conclusion, though the proportion of blacks in each of the prior response subgroups is too small to allow a direct inference. Also in treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis, the advantage of adding telaprevir was clear, with an impressive 84% response

The suggested duration of 12 weeks telaprevir therapy is adequately motivated. Findings from the 108 study imply that a shorter duration of telaprevir, though yielding high SVR rates, may not be optimal in a significant proportion of patients. Inversely, 24 weeks of telaprevir therapy was tested in the phase II -106 study in treatment experienced patients. As the rate of on-treatment virological failure did not differ between the arms with 12 and 24 weeks of telaprevir therapy, the applicant concluded that 12 weeks of therapy would suffice. Also, the side effects profile was supportive of a shorter duration. The CHMP concurs with the argument of the applicant, though it is recognised (a) that resistance data indicate that a longer telaprevir treatment duration might have been virologically motivated in prior non-responders and (b) that relapse rates for 12 versus 24 weeks of telaprevir therapy in the -106 study could not be directly compared, as the duration of P/R therapy differed between arms. The recommended shortening of the total treatment duration to 24 weeks in case of eRVR is supported by the -111 study. The exception is the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis. In the -111 study 12/18 (66.7%) patients with cirrhosis and RVR that were assigned to 24 weeks of therapy experienced SVR, versus 11/12 (91.7%) who were assigned to 48 weeks. This difference is not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Also, the finding in this subgroup is not supported by any similar trend in patients with bridging fibrosis. Thus, while the difference may be a chance finding, there is prudence in the consideration of the applicant not to make an inference which, if wrong, might cause a loss of SVR in this population with more advanced liver injury. Regarding the need for a total duration of therapy longer than 24 weeks in patients not reaching eRVR, the outcomes of the phase 2 -106 study in treatment-experienced, in which the likelihood of SVR in patients that did not reach eRVR was greater if randomised to the 48 week rather than the 24 week triple therapy arm, are notable - and this regardless of prior relapse or non-response. Data from this study, along with that from the pivotal -216 study in treatment experienced patients, also show that the predictive value of eRVR for SVR is a function of prior response, with the highest predictive value in relapsers and the lowest in null responders. Furthermore, relapse rates in the -106 study support the notion of a longer total duration of therapy in the absence of an eRVR.

rate among cirrhotics with prior relapse. In cirrhotics with prior null response, however, response rates were 7/50 (14%) compared to 1/10 (10%) for placebo. While this outcome in a very small sample is compatible with a likely real increased effect with telaprevir addition, it indicates that some patients will still have a low, in some cases very low, absolute probability of cure despite the addition of telaprevir.

The labelling for treatment experienced patients For treatment experienced patients, the indication sought is immediate start telaprevir 750 mg thrice daily, in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin, with twelve weeks of triple therapy followed by 36 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin therapy, regardless of early viral response. The exception to this is in prior relapsers without cirrhosis, where 12 weeks of subsequent peginterferon alfa-2a+ribavirin therapy would suffice in case an eRVR is reached. Regarding the comparison of a delayed start regimen (4 weeks lead in) and the immediate start, the formal design chosen by the applicant was one of non-inferiority, with delayed start treated as the 'reference' and a non-inferiority margin of 10%. The CHMP has not found any elaboration of the particular rationale for this margin. As it were, in the full population, the point estimate for SVR favours a delayed start by 66.3% vs 64.3%. In a prespecified logistic regression model, the difference was modified to 3%, with a 95% CI of -13 - +7, thus failing non-inferiority criteria. The statistical power of the study, however, in relation to the non-inferiority target, is unclear to the CHMP. The applicant argues that no virological benefit of a delayed start has been demonstrated, noting that there is no clear pattern of relative advantage between subgroups and that the rates of on-treatment virological failure as well as relapse are similar regardless of immediate or delayed start. No differences were noted in the on-treatment virologic failure or relapse rate, or type of emerging viral variants between the T12/PR48 and T12(DS)/PR48 arms. Therefore the applicant concludes that triple therapy can be started immediately. The CHMP concurs with the applicant's analysis. There is no demonstrated virological benefit with a delayed start. However, it is recognised that the total efficacy and safety of a delayed start is similar to an immediate start, and also that clinicians might be interested in the information obtained in the lead in period. The decision to treat prior null responders with telaprevir based triple therapy will need to be made by clinicians on a case to case basis, until the consequences of selection for drug resistant variants have been sufficiently investigated. In some cases deferring treatment until the availability of more potent drug combinations (e.g., quad therapy) may be the preferred choice. Despite no indication of a virological advantage, the use of a lead in to determine whether to go on with a full course of therapy may by some be considered of value in null responders. Therefore information should be available in the SmPC on the likelihood of response depending on prior response category and lead in response. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The treatment of prior relapsers with response guided therapy, as requested for labelling, has not been formally studied. The demographic data in the required cross-study comparison do not preclude the conjecture that this would be adequate. Furthermore, available data indicate that a shortened treatment duration in relapsers with eRVR is likely to yield similar high SVR rates as does 48 weeks of therapy. These data are further supported by a pharmacometric analysis conducted by the FDA, that was submitted to CHMP by the applicant,, indicating that would-be relapsers if treated with pegIFN and ribavirin only had a considerable representation among patients achieving eRVR and receiving 24 weeks of therapy within the -108 and -111 studies, with resultant very high total SVR rates. Data are considered sufficiently compelling for the CHMP to support the applicant's labelling claim.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other labelling considerations

## Reporting of efficacy outcomes in the SmPC

During the time of the CHMP assessment of the application dossier, the US FDA performed its own analysis of the study outcome data using a snapshot analysis with a visit window that enabled the imputation of SVR12 for SVR24, and that equated a detectable HCV-RNA below the limit of quantitation of the assay (25 IU/ml) with undetectable during the follow up, for the definition of SVR. The applicant submitted this analysis to the CHMP. Given the temporal pattern of relapse, and the likelihood of a detectable but unquantifiable HCV-RNA at week 12 or later being false positive, this mode of analysis is considered justified. This leads to slightly different point estimates for outcomes, but does not affect any formal conclusions. In order to avoid the confusion of having different datasets in the product information in the EU and US, the applicant has requested that data according to the FDA analysis be reported in the SmPC section 5.1. This is considered acceptable.

In the -208 study in treatment naïve subjects SVR rates were similar and above 80% regardless of which peginterferon was used. These are the highest SVR rates in the whole phase II/III program, implying a relatively easy-to-treat population. However, with the response guided algorithm determining treatment duration, 74% of patients treated in combination with pegIFN alfa-2a were assigned to 24 weeks rather than 48 weeks of therapy, versus 62% of patients treated with pegIFNalfa-2b. Furthermore, though the numbers are very small, the rate of on-treatment viral breakthrough was 2.5-fold higher in patients treated with pegIFN-alfa-2b. In summary, the -208 study does not provide direct support for the equivalence of the two peginterferons in the setting of co-treatment with telaprevir. Furthermore, there are no comparative data at all in treatment experienced patients, where differences in peginterferon response may be more critical to treatment outcome. For instance, the conclusion that a lead-in period is of no virological value might not be generalizable to the other peginterferon. Overall, the CHMP takes the view that the risk-benefit of telaprevir is positive in combination with either peginterferon, but that the uncertainties surrounding the relative efficacy and

The two peginterferons The applicant is requesting a labelling for use in combination with either peginterferon, despite the fact that the only relevant study in which peginterferon alfa-2b has been used is the underpowered -C208 study. Whilst recognizing the practical advantage of a non-specific label regarding peginterferon use, there are the following efficacy concerns: Firstly, while it is recognized that SVR rates are roughly similar for peginterferon alfa-2a and -2b, as demonstrated by the very large IDEAL study, this trial demonstrated important viral kinetics differences between the two peginterferons, as evidenced, e.g., by a more than 10% higher end-oftreatment response rate with peginterferon alfa-2a. Also, both the pharmacokinetics and early viral response kinetics differ between the peginterferons. Due to a relatively short half-life, the serum concentration of peginterferon2b is very low at the end of the dosing interval, and particularly so at the end of the first dosing intervals, when a co-administered DAA would act in virtual monotherapy. It is notable that those developing DAAs in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b have opted for the use of a lead in period, whereas those using peginterferon alfa-2a have generally not. Presently it is unknown whether these differences between the peginterferons impact the efficacy of combination therapy with a DAA. For instance, it is not known whether there is a differential need for a lead-in period. Furthermore, with response guided therapy, the proportion of patients eligible for a shortened treatment duration may differ depending on which peginterferon is used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the proper regimens to use with peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with telaprevir must be adequately reflected in the SmPC.

## Important patient groups not sufficiently studied

All the applicant's labelling claims relate to patients with HCV genotype 1 virus and compensated liver disease. Treatment in patients with decompensated liver disease has not been studied, as peginterferon and ribavirin are contraindicated in this population, and also the optimal telaprevir dose has not been established. A pharmacokinetic study in patients with decompensated liver disease indicated substantially lower exposure to telaprevir in such patients. The mechanism for this finding is unknown. HIV/HCV coinfected patients are an important subgroup of HCV patients that have more rapid disease progression and lower response to peginterferon/ribavirin therapy. Improved therapies for this group are urgently needed. A pilot study is underway in this population and several relevant drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Also, pilot studies have been performed in patients with other genotypes than 1. Telaprevir has not yet been studied in pediatric populations. Furthermore, there are some subgroups, as stated above, including not only patients with cirrhosis, but also black patients, known to respond less well to interferon based therapy, of which numbers have been low in the pivotal trials of telaprevir. Conclusions on clinical efficacy In conclusion, substantially increased SVR rates have been demonstrated when treating HCV genotype 1 infection in patients with compensated liver disease, with telaprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin. Available data indicate that SVR obtained is durable. In most cases of treatment failure, drug resistant variants have been selected. Follow-up data indicate a gradual reversion back to wild-type after treatment discontinuation in most patients. The consequences of the selection of resistance for future treatment attempts remain unknown. The addition of telaprevir to regimens with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin represents a major advance in the treatment of the dominant HCV genotype, including many patients in whom present standard therapy is unlikely to be efficacious. Clinical safety Patient exposure The applicant has presented a number of pooled safety datasets (see figure below). In this assessment report, the main focus is on the pooled placebo-controlled phase II/III studies, which includes the 104, 104EU, the -106 and the three pivotal phase III trials.

The incidence of SAEs, AEs of at least Grade 3, and AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was higher in the T12/PR group than in the Pbo/PR group. A summary table of incidence of AEs during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase is given in table 61.

In the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 2-3 studies, 2012 subjects received at least one dose of telaprevir, including:  1346 subjects who received a regimen of 750 mg telaprevir q8h for 12 weeks in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV (T12/PR group) and  1823 subjects who received a regimen of telaprevir for 8, 12, or 24 weeks in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV (Any T/PR group). Placebo in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV was received by 764 subjects (pooled control group, Pbo/PR group). The total exposure to telaprevir/placebo in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 2-3 studies was 326.32 patient years in the T12/PR group and 190.38 patient years in the Pbo/PR group. Thus, the size of the safety database is sufficient according to ICH guidance. The pooled safety database comprises 225 treated patients with cirrhosis. The number of patients with significant renal impairment is minimal. Adverse events Telaprevir/Placebo Treatment Phase Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Telaprevir/PlaceboTreatmentPhase

Virtually all patients reported AEs, also in the control arm, as expected with peginterferon and ribavirin. There were no deaths while on telaprevir treatment. The frequency of serious adverse effects and adverse effects of at least grade 3 was clearly higher with telaprevir than with placebo, as was adverse effects leading to discontinuation of telaprevir/placebo or the whole regimen. The side effect profile in the placebo group was characteristic of peginterferon+ribavirin, and similar effects were seen when telaprevir was added. Side effects that are more frequent when telaprevir is added include rash, pruritus, anemia, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, dysgeusia and haemorrhoids. It is notable that hemorroids is just one of a number of terms used to describe anorectal adverse events associated with telaprevir therapy. Serious adverse events and deaths In the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 2-3 studies, 5 of the 2012 subjects in the telaprevir groups and 4 of the 764 subjects in the placebo group died. Of these 9 deaths, none occurred during treatment with telaprevir/placebo. One of the 5 deaths that occurred in the telaprevir groups was considered possibly related to telaprevir by the investigator. This death was caused by lung neoplasm malignant that Subject 216-0803 from Study C216 developed 96 days after discontinuing telaprevir. The subject died 138 days after the last dose of telaprevir. During the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase, individual SAE preferred terms were reported in less than 0.5% of the subjects in the T12/PR group, except for serious anemia (1.6%) and rash (0.7%). Serious anemia occurred less frequently in the Pbo/PR group than in the T12/PR group and serious rash was not observed in the Pbo/PR group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Rash and Serious Cutaneous Adverse reactions The most important toxicity associated with telaprevir is rash. Telaprevir-based regimen rash are generally pruritic and have an eczematous appearance. Over 50% of patients treated with telaprevir developed rash, compared to 33% in the placebo group. The median time to any rash event was about a month. The median time to a grade 3 event was 7 weeks. Rash as a serious adverse event occurred exclusively in the telaprevir group. All in all, rash led to the permanent discontinuation of telaprevir in 6-7% of treated patients. A number of severe cutaneous adverse reactions occurred during the telaprevir development program, including three at least possible cases of Stevens Johnson syndrome and three at least possible cases of the DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms). There were no deaths due to skin reactions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Anemia

Telaprevir adds approximately 10 g/L to the anemia induced by peginterferon and ribavirin, rapidly reversible upon discontinuation. RBV dose reductions due to anemia occurred in 21.6% of the subjects in the T12/PR group and in 9.4% of the subjects in the Pbo/PR group during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase. Blood transfusions were received by 2.5% of the subjects in the T12/PR group and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.7% of the subjects in the Pbo/PR group during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase, and ESAs were used by 1.0% and 0.8% of the subjects, respectively.

Decreased hemoglobin is an exposure dependent side effect of telaprevir, and the effect rapidly reverses after telaprevir discontinuation.

## Serum creatinine, potassium and uric acid

Retinopathy In the placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies, retinopathy was reported in 11 (0.8%) subjects of the T12/PR group and in 1 (0.1%) subject in the Pbo/PR group during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase. It remains unclear whether this difference in reported rates of retinopathy is a chance finding or not. Laboratory findings Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia Grade 4 lymphopenia occurred in 4.5% of telaprevir treated patients, compared to 0.9% with placebo. There was a higher frequency of oral candidiasis in patients treated with telaprevir. There does not appear to have been any difference between groups for other infection-related adverse effect entities, including opportunistic infections that have been associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity. There was an additive effect of telaprevir on the decrease in platelets seen during peginterferon therapy. As expected the risk of thrombocytopenia was higher with increasing degrees of hepatic fibrosis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Telaprevir use was associated with an on-treatment increase in serum creatinine of 5-10 umol/L, which was readily reversible on discontinuation. It is unclear whether this is an effect on the glomerular filtration rate or on creatinine disposition. The identification of older age and hypertension as risk factors for this side effect may indicate the former. This effect appears reversible on discontinuation of telaprevir.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Telaprevir also causes a mild on-treatment decrease in potassium. Hypokalemia of Grade 2 or higher during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase was observed in 1.6% of subjects in the T12/PR group and 0.3% of subjects in Pbo/PR group. The tendency to lower potassium needs to be viewed, however, in relation to the mild QT-prolonging effects of telaprevir (see below), as hypokalemia is a factor increasing the risk for arrhythmia in the presence of QT prolongation.

During the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase, hyperuricemia of Grade 2 or higher was observed in 23.6% of subjects in the T12/PR group and in 3.2% of subjects in the Pbo/PR group. Gout was reported as an AE in 3 (0.2%) subjects in the T12/PR group and no subjects in the Pbo/PR group during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase. One of the (inactive) metabolites of telaprevir is pyrazinoic acid, which is also an active metabolite of the antimycobacterial agent pyrazinamide. This is a known inhibitor of uric acid secretion. Endocrine side effects Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels above normal limits during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase were observed in 8.1% of subjects in the T12/PR group and in 5.8% of subjects in the Pbo/PR group. Further analysis shows that the frequency of TSH increases in the overall treatment was similar for the telaprevir and placebo containing arms. Hypothyroidism is well described in association with Peg-IFN/RBV treatment. Hypothyroidism was reported as an AE during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase in 1.5% of subjects in the T12/PR group and 0.1% of subjects in the Pbo/PR group. The AE 'blood TSH increased' was reported in 0.4% and 0.3% of subjects in these groups, respectively. The reported frequency of hypothyroidism in the placebo group (0.1%) was surprisingly low. As a comparison, in the IDEAL study, the reported rate of hypothyroidism with pegIFN+ribavirin over 48 weeks was 5%, which is similar to the rate of TSH above normal limits in the placebo group. Thus differential reporting practices may be the reason for this discrepancy. The increased incidence of hypothyroidism observed in the T12/PR group compared to the Pbo/PR group during the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase related, in the majority of cases, to a history of hypothyroidism and requirements for adjustment of TRT, and to a lesser extent new onset hypothyroidism. QT-prolongation For a telaprevir 1875 mg q8h regimen, which yields a similar telaprevir exposure as does 750 q8h in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (which for unknown reasons increases telaprevir exposure by 30-40%), the upper limit of the 90% CIs for the time-matched placebo-corrected change from reference in QTcF crossed the 10-ms threshold at 3 h, 5 h, and 24 h (maximum mean time-matched placebo-corrected change from reference in QTcF interval: 8.0 ms 90% CI: 5.10;10.90). There are no data on the effect on the QT interval of supratherapeutic exposures to telaprevir. Of note, syncope was reported somewhat more often in patients treated with telaprevir, but there were no deaths and no clear recorded relation of the event to ECG abnormality.There appears to have no events in the clinical trials reported indicative of torsade des pointes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is noted that very few patients in the telaprevir development program were co-treated with methadone, a known QT-prolongator extensively used in the target population. It is recognized that a DDI study with telaprevir and methadone has been performed, in which ECG was monitored and no alarming findings reported. Still, due to the risk of a pharmacodynamics interaction, ECG should be monitored during co-treatment with telaprevir and methadone.

## Safety in special populations

## Safety in subjects with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis

Subjects with hepatic cirrhosis were enrolled in 3 of the 5 pooled placebo-controlled Phase 2-3 studies (Studies 106, 108, and C216). This pooled dataset contained more subjects with cirrhosis at baseline in the T12/PR group than in the Pbo/PR group (179 [13.3%] subjects versus 64 [8.4%] subjects), which is due to the pre-specified randomization scheme for Study C216.

| longer   |
|----------|

In the T12/PR group, both SAEs and AEs of at least Grade 3 were reported more frequently in subjects with cirrhosis than in subjects in the other fibrosis categories as shown in table 63 below. No new important safety signal was derived from this subgroup analysis. Table 63. Placebo-Controlled Phase 2-3 Studies: Summary of Adverse Events by Fibrosis Category Telaprevir/Placebo Treatment Phase Safety in HCV-HIV co-infected subjects The safety profile of telaprevir in HCV/HIV co-infected patients is currently being studied in a Phase 2a study (Study 110); This is a multicenter, two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with chronic HCV-1/HIV-1 co-infection who were treatment-naïve for HCV and not receiving highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Part A) or receiving HAART (Part B). Data will be submitted from this study when available. Safety in patients with hepatic impairment or with renal impairment Hepatic impairment: Two multiple-dose Phase I studies (006 and 012) were conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of telaprevir in subjects with either mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). The safety data from these studies were generally consistent with those of other Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects who did not have such comorbidities. There were no AEs of unusual frequency or severity in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to in healthy subjects. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Renal impairment:

One Phase I study (C132) assessed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of telaprevir in subjects with severe renal impairment (calculated CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min). The safety data from this study were consistent with those of Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects who did not have

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

such comorbidities; there were no or otherwise clinically relevant findings that have not already been described.

## Pregnancy and lactation

In the Phase 2-3 telaprevir study program:

 3 pregnancies were reported after maternal exposure to telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV. These pregnancies were all reported during follow-up (163 to 243 days after the last dose of telaprevir). Of these subjects, 1 had a normal outcome, 1 subject opted for elective abortion, and 1 subject refused to provide follow-up information.  3 pregnancies were reported after paternal exposure to telaprevir in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV. Two of these pregnancies of partner were reported after the last intake of telaprevir (15 and 17 days) but during Peg-IFN/RBV. One partner pregnancy was reported during followup (193 days after the last dose of telaprevir). Two subject's partners opted for an elective abortion. The outcome was unknown due to the subject being lost to follow-up for the third subject. It is not known whether telaprevir is excreted in human milk. No data on lactation and effects to a newborn child are available from the clinical studies. Because of its teratogenic potential, the use of ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy, and adequate contraception required during therapy. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions Because telaprevir is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A, a substrate of P-gp, telaprevir can affect the PK of co-administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates and/or transported by P-gp. Telaprevir PK may also be affected by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and/or P-gp. The high potential for drug interactions with telaprevir warrant some clear recommendations to prescribers in the SmPC/PIL. Notably, as a safety precaution, because of the potential for pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interactions that may increase the risk of QT interval prolongation, telaprevir must not be administered concurrently with any Class Ia or III antiarrhythmics, except for intravenous lidocaine. . Telaprevir must also not be administered with other drugs that may induce QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes, and which are metabolized by CYP3A, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies its use. The SmPC adequately reflects the available information. Discontinuation due to AES The proportion of patients discontinuing all study drugs due to adverse effects were around 11% in the telaprevir groups and around 7% in the placebo group. The proportion of patients discontinuing telaprevir/placebo was around 15% in the telaprevir treatment arms and 4% in the placebo arms. Approximately 5% of treated patients discontinued telaprevir due to rash/pruritus related issues and 2.5-3% due to anemia. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical safety

The pooled placebo-controlled phase II/III studies with telaprevir, forming the core of the safety database, include 1823 subjects that received a telaprevir regimen of 8, 12 or 24 weeks. Approximately 10% of telaprevir treated patients discontinued their entire treatment regimen due to

CHMP assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adverse effects, compared to 7% in the placebo group. Approximately 15% discontinued telaprevir due to AE, while 4% discontinued placebo. Median time on telaprevir was 12.1 weeks. Thirty-six percent of the patients were female, 11% were non-white, 1.5% were &gt;65 years of age, 13.3% had cirrhosis. Virtually no patients had CrCL &lt;50 ml/min. There were no deaths during telaprevir treatment. The incidence of serious adverse events on telaprevir treatment was 6.6%, compared to 2.9% in the placebo group.

Rash including SCAR is the most important side effect of telaprevir, and the most important adverse effect cause of discontinuation. In the phase III studies, the applicant implemented a 'rash management plan', which is the basis of the recommendation for rash management in the product information. The cutaneous safety of telaprevir will need to be followed post-marketing. Risk minimisation measures have been put in place as reflected in the RMP that include a Physician Education programme. The other clinically major side effect is an additive effect on anemia which, if needed, is usually managed by ribavirin dose reduction. Also, there is an additive effect on peginterferon platetet decrease and lymphopenia, but not on neutrophil counts. The applicant will further describe the lymphopenia in terms of cellular subsets affected in ongoing trials, including those in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. The risk of immune related disorders should be followed post-marketing. When treating with telaprevir there was a transient and reversible rise in serum creatinine. It is unclear whether the increase in creatinine represents a decreased glomerular filtration or an otherwise altered creatinine disposition, though the identification of older age and hypertension as risk factors may indicate the former Studies on the effect of telaprevir on creatinine transport will be conducted. Also, telaprevir treatment is associated with a modest decrease in s-potassium. The mechanism is not clear. Since telaprevir has a QT-prolongating potential, it is reassuring that more than grade 2 hypokalemia was rare, and that there were no clinical events clearly linked to ECG abnormalities. This isse is addressed in the product information. Increased TSH levels were more common when treating with telaprevir than with placebo. Also, 'hypothyroidism' was reported at a considerably higher frequency in telaprevir-treated patients - and at a comparably low rate in patients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. As the frequency of TSH increases overall with telaprevir or placebo in the regimen is similar, it may be that TSH increases occur earlier with telaprevir therapy. Furthermore, most cases pertain to patients with a history of thyroid disease and/or thyroid replacement therapy. Thus it may be that telaprevir affects the disposition of T3 and T4. This is reflected in the product information. Variants of retinal AE preferred terms occurred substantially more frequently during treatment with placebo. This may be a chance finding, but retinal adverse events need to be monitored postmarketing. Conclusions on clinical safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

The addition of telaprevir leads to an increase in adverse events and treatment discontinuations, primarily due to rash or an additive effect to the anemia of ribavirin and peginterferon. A number of cases of severe skin reactions occurred during the development program. On the whole, the applicant has addressed the risks in an acceptable way in the proposed SmPC and the risk management plan, and there are no major safety concerns that have not been addressed by the applicant.

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

The primary endpoint in the pivotal trials is sustained viral response (SVR), defined as undetectable virus 24 weeks after the end of therapy. This is virtually equivalent of cure of hepatitis C, as evidenced by data indicating that less than 1% of patients will relapse after this time-point. Achieving SVR effectively stops the progression of the liver injury caused by hepatitis C virus. SVR is a universally accepted endpoint in trials aiming at the cure of HCV infection.

## Risks

Beneficial effects In the pivotal -108 study in treatment naive patients, the SVR rate in the 12 week telaprevir arm was 74.7%, a 30.9% increase compared to the placebo+peginterferon alfa-2a+ribavirin arm. Shortened treatment duration compared to the present standard of care was possible for nearly 60% of treatment naive patients. The advantage of telaprevir was apparent across demographic and baseline disease categories. In the pivotal -216 study in treatment experienced patients SVR rates in all three prior response subcategories were statistically significantly superior to placebo, with a total difference in SVR rates of + 47% with the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin. The advantage of adding telaprevir was also apparent regardless of viral subtype, baseline viral load or degree of liver injury. Also, in treatment naive and -experienced patients increased efficacy was evident across IL28B genotypes. Available long term follow up data indicate the durability of SVR obtained with telaprevir. The addition of telaprevir to regimens with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin represents a major advance in the treatment of the genotype 1, the quantitatively dominant HCV genotype. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects The optimal duration of therapy in treatment naive patients with cirrhosis is unclear. Also, the suggested treatment algorithm for relapsers is to some extent based on inference, though, taking the totality of data into account, the evidence is considered sufficient for its approval. Moreover, it is recognised that treatment durations might be further individualised, entailing the possibility of, e g., still shorter duration in very early responders. The efficacy of telaprevir in several important subgroups of patients, such as HIV co-infected patients and paediatric patients have not been studied. The possibility of using telaprevir in novel treatment regimens (e.g., regimens without peginterferon) in patients with decompensated liver disease is unclear, as there is considerable uncertainty about the appropriate dose to use. Clarifying the reasons for the low exposure to telaprevir found in non-HCV infected patients with moderate liver impairment (Child Pugh B) is of importance to clarify the potiential for use of telaprevir in this population. Finally, the impact on SVR of baseline resistant variants in telaprevir-naive patients, which can be detected by population sequencing, has not yet been fully clarified due to low frequency of such predominant baseline variants. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The main risks identified during the telaprevir development program include severe rash and serious cutaneous adverse reactions, and the selection of drug resistant variants in patients failing to reach SVR. Other risks include a moderate propensity to QT prolongation (supratherapeutic telaprevir

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure data are lacking). This may be a concern mainly when telaprevir is co-prescribed with other QT-prolongators, the most important in the target population being methadone.

## Unfavourable effects

The major known risk associated with telaprevir therapy is severe rash, including serious cutaneous reactions. Approximately 5% of patients experience a grade 3 rash during treatment, and there were three at least possible cases of Stevens Johnson syndrome during the telaprevir development program. The frequency of severe cutaneous events (DRESS, Stephens Johnson Syndrome) is less than 0.5%.

Approximately 70% of HCV infections in the Western world are genotype 1. After about 20 years of infection, around 20-30% of patients with HCV will have progressed to cirrhosis, 5-10% will have end stage liver disease and 4-8% will have died of liver-related causes. In patients with cirrhosis, the 5year risk of hepatic decompensation is approximately 15-20% and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma 10%. HCV is the most common cause of liver transplantation in Europe. In this light, the public health gain with telaprevir therapy is likely considerable, and this benefit also applies to many of the individuals that will be cured by telaprevir. While the occurrence of severe cutaneous reactions is

Increased on treatment rates of anemia, lymphopenia and retinopathy were also seen. Also, in most cases treatment failure is associated with the selection of a telaprevir resistant viral population, likely cross resistant to other drugs in the class (though not to antivirals of other classes). Follow-up data indicate a gradual reversion back to the baseline population after treatment discontinuation in most patients. The consequences of the selection of resistance for future treatment attempts, however, remain unclear. The applicant has instituted adequate virological stopping rules to prevent unnecessary exposure to failing telaprevir regimens. Also, the applicant has agreed to present data in the SmPC on the relation between lead-in response in the DS arm of the pivotal -216 study in the respective categories of prior non-responders, and the likelihood of SVR. Such data may in some cases be helpful for the clinician to make an informed decision on whether to treat with telaprevir or to wait for future treatment options, in patients that may have a relatively low likelihood of SVR even with the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin. With some minor additions by the CHMP, the applicant has instituted appropriate warnings in the SmPC concerning the proclivity to QT-prolongation, including the risk of enhanced effects due to drug interactions. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects While telaprevir related cutaneous adverse events and their management have been carefully characterised in the development program, there remains some uncertainty on how this will impact telaprevir treatment in a 'real life' setting outside clinical trials.  There was an excess reporting of retinopathy events during telaprevir treatment. It is unclear whether there is causality or if this is a chance finding. Importantly, as stated above, the consequences of selected resistant variants in patients failing therapy, as regards the efficacy of future therapies including NS3/4A inhibitors, are still not fully elucidated. As ribavirin is a teratogen, adequate anti-conceptive measures are necessary during therapy. Telaprevir causes a moderate decrease in ethinylestradiol and minor decrease in norethindrone exposure. It is unknown whether the magnitude of the decrease is sufficient to impair the efficacy of combination oral contraceptives and therefore appropriate warnings and recommendations have been included in the SmPC. Finally, it is unknown whether there are any human-specific metabolites not present in non-clinical toxicity studies.

recognised and is an important concern in the management of patients treated with telaprevir, these were reversible and there were no fatal cases in the development program. As previously stated, the putative negative effects of selection of resistant variants is not full characterised, but may be more limited than thought prior to the emerging results of the telaprevir long-term follow up study.

## Benefit-risk balance

<!-- image -->

Reaching SVR effectively ends the progression of HCV-related hepatic injury. In this light, the greatly increased SVR rates seen with telaprevir therapy must be weighed against a higher risk of side effects, the main one being rash, including serious cutaneous reactions, and the risk of incurring drug resistance, which theoretically could compromise future treatment attempts, in case of failure. Rash events are in most cases mild to moderate, and also the severe cases generally remit after discontinuation of telaprevir. It is recognised that a handful of severe cutaneous adverse reactions were seen during the program, though no deaths. This remains an important risk associated with telaprevir therapy. However, a number of measures are foreseen to mitigate the risk as reflected in the Risk management plan; these include close monitoring of dermatological safety profile of telaprevir and a physician educational programme aimed at advising physicians on the management of rash and severe cutaneous reactions. In addition appropriate warnings are instituted in the SmPC. Overall the risk of severe rash/serious cutaneous reactions does not outweigh the benefit of greatly increased SVR rates. Regarding the risk associated with selection of resistance, this only pertains to patients that fail telaprevir-based therapy. Such patients would not have reached SVR with the present standard of care. Available data indicate that in most cases there is a reversion to wild-type after discontinuation. Even if there in fact would be consequences for retreatment due to resistant variants selected during telaprevir therapy, this does not outweigh the benefit of the increased SVR rates with telaprevir.
