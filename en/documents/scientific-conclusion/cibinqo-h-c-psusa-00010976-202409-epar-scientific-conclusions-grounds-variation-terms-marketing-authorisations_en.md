## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for abrocitinib, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on neutropenia, two cases reported with positive dechallenge and rechallenge as well as two additional reports with positive dechallenge together with clinical trial data and data from non-clinical trials where effect on neutrophil count was observed in rats, and potential class effect, the PRAC concluded that the product information of abrocitinib should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for abrocitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing abrocitinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
