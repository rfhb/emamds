## 1. Introduction

On 25 January 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Ilaris, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

In the EU, Ilaris (canakinumab) was first granted marketing authorization on 23 October 2009 (European Commission Decision). Since then, Ilaris is indicated for:

1. the treatment of the following autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older:
2. -Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) including:
- Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),
- Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) / chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA),
- Severe forms of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) / familial cold urticaria (FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin rash.
6. -Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)
7. -Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD)
8. -Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), in combination with colchicine, if appropriate.
2. The treatment of active Still's disease including adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and older who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and systemic corticosteroids. Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate;
3. The symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent GA attacks (at least 3 attacks in the previous 12 months) in whom NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.

Ilaris is registered as a powder to be dissolved in a solvent prior administration, i.e., the 150 mg powder for solution for injection and the 150 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection. The ready to use 150 mg/mL solution for injection presentation was also approved in the EU. Ilaris is administered via subcutaneous injection.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The MAH supplied one of the following open-label canakinumab commercial packages or clinical batches labelled according to legislation in France related to clinical trial product:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -ACZ885 150 mg: Active canakinumab in individual 6 mL glass vials, each containing 150 mg canakinumab lyophilisate in vial or;
- -ACZ885 150 mg/1 mL: 1 mL of solution for injection in a 2 mL vial (type I glass) with a stopper (laminated chlorobutyl rubber) and flip-off cap (aluminium).

The maximal total single dose of canakinumab allowed was 300 mg, which was administered as 2 subcutaneous 150 mg injections q4w. The batch and formulation numbers of the test drug are presented in Table 9-1.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- CACZ885GFR01: A French open-label extension study of canakinumab in patients who participated in international phase III studies CACZ885G2301E1 or CACZ885G2306 in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and CACZ885N2301 in Hereditary Periodic Fevers (TRAPS, HIDS, or crFMF)

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Clinical study number and title

CACZ885GFR01: A French open-label extension study of canakinumab in patients who participated in international phase III studies CACZ885G2301E1 or CACZ885G2306 in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and CACZ885N2301 in Hereditary Periodic Fevers (TRAPS, HIDS, or crFMF)

## Description

Study CACZ885GFR01 (last patient last visit on 31 August 2018) is an open-label extension study of canakinumab, in patients who participated in international phase III studies CACZ885G2301E1 or CACZ885G2306 in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and CACZ885N2301 in hereditary periodic fevers (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome [TRAPS], hyperimmunoglobulinemia syndrome [HIDS], or colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever [crFMF]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The objective of this protocol was to collect additional safety data (serious and non-serious adverse events (AEs)) and to provide continuous Ilaris® (canakinumab) treatment to patients in France who completed CACZ885G2301E1, CACZ885N2301 or CACZ885G2306 studies.

## Study design

This was an open-label (single treatment arm) extension study for patients in France who completed the one of the following international studies:

- CACZ885G2301E1
- CACZ885N2301
- CACZ885G2306

The last visit of CACZ885G2301E1, CACZ885N2301 or CACZ885G2306 studies was the first visit of this extension study. Patients enrolled from study CACZ885G2301E1 continued treatment with the same dosage regimen used at the end of CACZ885G2301E1. Patients enrolled from study CACZ885N2301 continued the maintenance dose as determined at the end of the open-label period/epoch 4 (i.e. the lowest clinically efficacious dose to maintain clinical efficacy in individual patients with a good tolerability). Patients enrolled from study CACZ885G2306 continued on their dosing regimen considered to constitute the lowest clinically efficacious dose to maintain clinical efficacy in individual patients.

Patients were treated with canakinumab until the date of canakinumab reimbursement in France for the respective new indications was achieved. Visits were scheduled at canakinumab dose administrations, approximately every 4, 6, 8 or 12 weeks according to the investigators judgment. The safety of canakinumab was evaluated (AEs and serious adverse events [SAEs]). Patients were followed-up according to summary of product characteristics (SmPC) with possible adaptation based on investigators judgment related to specific patient medical consideration.

## Study population /Sample size

It was planned to enroll up to 41 patients in this extension study. However, only 31 patients were enrolled and analyzed in this study.

The study included patients who completed the international CACZ885N2301, CACZ885G2301E1 or CACZ885G2306 studies without any significant safety issue according to investigator's opinion. Patients who completed the international CACZ885G2306 study and who successfully discontinued canakinumab as per protocol were allowed to participate in CACZ885GFR01 study upon a subsequent disease relapse without regard to time since CACZ885G2306 completion, if the investigator stated that there was an indication to resume canakinumab. Patients who completed the international CACZ885G2306 study and participated in Part I only could have their canakinumab dose (4 mg/kg every 4 weeks [q4w]) reduced or dose interval prolonged in study CACZ885GFR01 at the discretion of the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Canakinumab was administered at varying dose regimens based on investigator's clinical judgement to patients in France who completed CACZ885G2301E1, CACZ885N2301 or CACZ885G2306 studies until canakinumab is commercially available and reimbursed for the concerned indications.

Patient's dose upon study entry and dose change was based on the study from which the patient enrolled.

## CACZ885G2301E1 (SJIA):

Patients received the same dose as their last dose administered in the study CACZ885G2301E1: canakinumab 4 mg/kg (or 300 mg maximum) or 2 mg/kg (150 mg maximum) q4w. Similar to study CACZ885G2301E1, a canakinumab dose could be reduced from 4 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg q4w and then interrupted after a prolonged remission according to the investigators judgment.

## CACZ885N2301 (Periodic Fever syndromes indications: TRAPS, HIDS or crFMF):

Patients continue the same dose regimen as received at the end of the study, which was one of the following:

- Canakinumab 150 mg (or 2 mg/kg for patients weighing ≤ 40 kg) q4w
- Canakinumab 150 mg (or 2 mg/kg for patients weighing ≤ 40 kg) every 8 weeks (q8w)
- Canakinumab 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg for patients weighing ≤ 40 kg) q4w
- Canakinumab 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg for patients weighing ≤ 40 kg) q8w

In case of re-flare (according to investigators judgment), patients were allowed to increase the dose as per the following:

- If patients received canakinumab 150 mg q8w, the dose of canakinumab was increased to 150 mg q4w.
- If patients received canakinumab 150 mg q4w, the dose of canakinumab was increased to 300 mg q4w.
- If patients received canakinumab 300 mg q8w, the dose of canakinumab was increased to 300 mg q4w.

## CACZ885G2306 (SJIA):

Patients received the same dose as their last dose administered at the end of the study and could be one of the following regimens:

- Canakinumab 4 mg/kg q4w
- Canakinumab 2 mg/kg q4w
- Canakinumab 1 mg/kg q4w
- Canakinumab 4 mg/kg q8w
- Canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 12 weeks (q12w)

The patients who withdrew canakinumab per protocol could resume canakinumab after a systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) relapse (flare) at a starting dose of 4 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) q4w.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

No efficacy endpoints were defined.

Safety assessments consisted of collecting all AEs, SAEs, severity and relationship to study drug (canakinumab). Safety assessments included the routine collection of hematology, blood chemistry and urine analysis at baseline which were carried forward from the previous study CACZ885G2301E1, CACZ885N2301 or CACZ885G2306.

## Statistical Methods

Data were summarized with respect to demographic, baseline characteristics, safety observations and measurements. Categorical data was summarized by absolute frequencies and percentages. Summaries of continuous data was summarized by mean, median, lower and upper quartile (for most variables), minimum and maximum, and the number of missing data points (for most variables) and the number of non-missing data points.

Safety set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-treatment safety assessment in the study. Safety measurements included extent of exposure and AEs. All safety endpoints were summarized for the safety set. Adverse events starting on or after the time of the first dose of canakinumab in this study but not later than 7 days (30 days in the case of a SAE) after the date of last dose of canakinumab taken or those AE present at baseline with increased severity were classified as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and were included in all summaries. Adverse events which started and ended prior to baseline and AEs which started prior to baseline but whose severity did not change post-baseline was not included as TEAE. In addition, all TEAEs were listed.

The by-patient listing included, system organ class (SOC)/preferred term (PT)/verbatim term, start date, end date, the severity of an AE, seriousness ,whether or not an AE was related to canakinumab, and whether or not it was a SAE, action taken with canakinumab, outcome, duration, discontinue from study. Duration was calculated as TEAE end date - start date +1 and for ongoing last visit date - start date +1.

Treatment-emergent adverse events were presented in two parts:

- Adverse events (including infections)
- Infectious AEs, categorized as AEs of special interest)

All the deaths in the clinical database were listed with the last dose date/visit, date of death and investigator reported principal cause. Deaths occurring after the first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the date of last treatment were summarized with numbers and percentages for safety set.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed/Baseline data

In total, 31 patients (100%) (24 patients with SJIA and 7 patients with periodic fever syndromes [HIDS/MKD and FMF]) were enrolled in this study, of which 23 patients (74.2%) (16 patients with SJIA and 7 patients with periodic fever syndromes [HIDS/MKD and FMF]) completed the study and the remaining 8 patients (25.8%) prematurely discontinued from the study. The most common reason for discontinuation was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect based on investigator judgement (4 patients, 12.9%), followed by patient's condition no longer requires study drug (2 patients, 6.5%), AE (1 patient, 3.2%), and inclusion (entry) in the CACZ8852306 study (1 patient, 3.2%). The study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

comprised of 17 female (54.8%) and 14 male patients (45.2%). The mean (SD) age of the patients was 9.7 (4.07) years. The majority of the patients were ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age (14 patients, 45.2%) followed by ≥ 12 to &lt; 20 years (11 patients, 35.5%), ≥ 4 to &lt; 6 years (4 patients, 12.9%), ≥ 2 to &lt; 4 years (1 patient, 3.2%), and ≥ 20 years (1 patient, 3.2%). The race of the patients were Caucasian (29 patients, 93.5%) followed by other (2 patients, 6.5%).

Patients entered the study with generally well controlled disease as evidenced by the overall baseline median CRP of 5.8 mg/L and a median number of active joints and with limitation of motion for SJIA patients of 0.0 and 0.5 respectively. Approximately 38.7% of all patients were using oral steroid at baseline, and 12.9% of patients were receiving methotrexate treatment at baseline.

## Safety results

## Patient exposure:

The median duration of exposure overall was 497 days (range 1 to 1338 days). All 31 patients received at least one dose of canakinumab. Most of the patients received 9 to 12 doses (7 patients, 22.6%) followed by 13 to 16 doses and &gt; 24 doses (6 patients, 19.4% each), 21 to 24 doses (5 patients, 16.1%), 5 to 8 doses (4 patients, 12.9%), 1 to 4 doses (2 patients, 6.5%), and 17 to 20 doses (1 patient, 3.2%), irrespective of the specific dose. The duration of exposure for majority of the patients was 1 to 2 years (16 patients, 51.6%) followed by 3 to 4 years (8 patients, 25.8%) and &lt; 1 year (7 patients, 22.6%). Many patients received multiple dose regimens during the trial due to allowance of canakinumab dose regimen changes based on investigator clinical judgment. Twenty-two patients received canakinumab at 4 mg/kg, 13 and 2 patients received canakinumab at a reduced dose of 2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg respectively during the study. Six patients received canakinumab at 2 mg/kg q8w and 1 patient received canakinumab at 4 mg/kg q12w during the study. Additionally, 12 patients received canakinumab at a dose not specified in the protocol and 11 patients (35.5%) had their canakinumab dose interrupted, usually due to remission, at some point in the study.

At baseline, 21 patients (67.7%) received a 4 mg/kg dose, 9 patients (29.0%) received 2 mg/kg dose, and 1 patient (3.2%) received 1 mg/kg dose. At the end of study, majority (18/31, 58%) of the patients were receiving the same dose which was administered at baseline. At the end of study, the dose had been reduced to 2 mg/kg for 2 patients (6.5%), to 1 mg/kg for 1 patient, and to a nonprotocol defined 'other dose' for 3 patients (9.7%). Additionally, 7 patients (22.6%) were not receiving canakinumab at the end of study.

Overall, all 12 patients (38.7%) who entered the study with concomitant corticosteroids ended the study using the CS with no change in the dose. Similarly, all 4 patients (12.9%) who entered the study using MTX ended the study using MTX at the same dose.

## Treatment-emergent adverse event:

Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 29 (93.5%) patients and were predominantly an infection (80.6%), mainly nasopharyngitis (35.5%), arthralgia (29.0%), gastroenteritis, and pyrexia (22.6% each). The infections and infestations and the gastrointestinal disorders SOCs were among the most frequent SOCs reported for AE whatever the indication.

Majority of the TEAEs were of mild to moderate severity. Severe TEAEs accounted for 16.1% of all TEAEs and included arthritis reported by 2/31 (6.5%) patients and histiocytosis haematophagic,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

abdominal pain, Epstein-Barr virus infection, lung disorder, and pneumothorax reported by 1/31 (3.2%) patient each.

Of the 9/31 (29%) patients with a TEAE suspected to be related to the study drug by the investigator, most represented an infection, none of which were considered severe or serious. Six were reported in patients with SJIA and 3 in patients with periodic fever syndromes (HIDS/MKD and FMF). Seven patients (22.6%) reported 13 SAEs including 2 infectious ones; all of which were considered as not related to the study drug by the investigator and none of them led to discontinuation from the study.

No patient died during the study.

One patient discontinued from the study due to a non-serous TEAE juvenile idiopathic arthritis (worsening of juvenile idiopathic arthritis) assessed as non-serious and non-related to canakinumab. The safety profile was comparable among patients with SJIA and with a periodic fever (HIDS/MKD and FMF).

## 2.3.3. MAH´s Discussion on clinical aspects

Overall, the safety profile, irrespective of dose regimen administered, was consistent with the safety profile from previous studies and comparable among patients with SJIA and with a periodic fever (HIDS/MKD and FMF). The most frequent AEs represented a flare of the underlying disease (e.g. arthralgia) and a non-serious infection such as nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pyrexia. Seven patients reported SAEs in the study and all resolved and none led to study discontinuation. No patient died during the study and only 1/31 patients discontinued from the study in response to non serious TEAE juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

In summary, the observed canakinumab safety profile for patients with SJIA and with periodic fever syndromes (HIDS/MKD and FMF) was consistent with the previous studies with no new signals identified.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of the finalized open label extension study GFR01 in patients with SJIA, HIDS/MKD, and FMF who had participated in international phase III studies CACZ885N2301, CACZ885G2301E1 or CACZ885G2306 until canakinumab was reimbursed for these indications in France provided supportive safety data of 31 patients. Efficacy data was not evaluated in this study.

Infections were the most frequently reported events during the study followed by gastrointestinal disorders. Infections and infestations are already described in the SmPC of Canakinumab.

SAEs were mostly associated with disease activity and infections. The most frequently reported infections were nasopharyngitis and gastroenteritis

The safety data from the presented analysis showed no new safety findings compared to the known safety profile of canakinumab.

No changes to the SmPC were proposed. This is acceptable.
