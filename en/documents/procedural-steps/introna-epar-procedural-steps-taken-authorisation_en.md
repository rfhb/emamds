## BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 1. Submission of the dossier

The  applicant  SP  Europe,  73,  rue  de  Stalle,  B-1180  Bruxelles submitted  on  8  March  1999  an application  for  Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Agency  for  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal Products (EMEA) for Alfatronol, through the centralised procedure.

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CPMP were:

Rapporteur:

Dr. E. Abadie

Co-Rapporteur:

Pharm. G. De Greef

- During its meeting on 18-20 May 1999, the CPMP agreed on the consolidated list of questions to be sent to the company. The final consolidated list of questions was sent to the company on 20 May 1999.

Licensing status: The interferon alfa-2b from SP Europe has been already approved in Europe via the ex-concertation procedure with the tradename IntronA. The Summary of Product Characteristics of IntronA has been subsequently  harmonised  through  a  referral  under  Article  11  of  Council  directive  75/319/EEC (submission by the Company on 14 December 1995, CPMP opinion issued on 18 December 1996 and Decision of European Commission on 26 June 1997), during which procedure the whole dossier was assessed by CPMP. Alfatronol is a new trade name for IntronA, the interferon alfa-2b from SP Europe. The qualitative and quantitative  composition of the medicinal product of IntronA and the centrally approved Alfatronol are strictly identical. IntronA is approved in Europe for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C, hairy cell leukaemia, chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia,  multiple  myeloma,  follicular  non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma,  carcinoid tumours, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma and malignant melanoma. Further to the approval of the centralised application of Alfatronol, the main changes of the labelling (compared to the article 11 labelling) are the following: · Inclusion  of  the  possible  association  of  interferon  alfa-2b  and  cytosine  arabinoside  for  the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia; · Deletion of the AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma indication; · Inclusion of the concomitant administration of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b for the first line treatment of chronic hepatitis C. After  the  granting  of  the  marketing  Authorisation  of  Alfatronol  by  the  European  Commission,  SP Europe committed to withdraw the nationally authorised IntronA, and to transfer this trade name to the centrally authorised product. 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product · The procedure started on 26 March 1999. · The Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP members on 14 April 1999. · The  Co-Rapporteur's  first assessment report was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  members  on 14 April 1999. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- During  it's  meeting  on  22-24  June  1999,  the  CPMP  agreed  that  a  GMP  inspection  of  the manufacturing site was not necessary.
- The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 9 August 1999.
- The Rapporteur and the Co-Rapporteur circulated the joint response assessment report on the company's responses to the list of questions to all CPMP members on 27 September 1999.

- The CPMP, during their meeting on 19-21 October 1999, considered the responses provided by the  company  and  discussed  the  recommendations  presented  by  the  Rapporteur.  Amendments were discussed to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet texts.
- The  applicant  provided  a  letter  of  undertaking  on  the  follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  as requested by the CPMP, dated 21 October 1999.
- During the meeting on 21 October 1999 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a Marketing Authorisation for IntronA.
