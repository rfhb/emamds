## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for estradiol / nomegestrol acetate, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data from clinical trials on drug-drug interaction between ethinylestradiol and Direct acting antiviral agents used in hepatitis C treatments, which lead to significant liver's enzyme elevation, especially the newly added contra-indication between ethinylestradiol and sofosburvir/velpatasvir/ voxilaprevir adopted during the PSUSA procedure for chlormadinone/ethinylestradiol  and extended to all ethinylestradiol-containing products by a CMDh decision , considering also the previous recommendations that extrapolated drug-drug-interactions between ethinylestradiol and anti-hepatitis C virus combinations (Viekirax (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin) and Maviret (Glecaprevir/ pibrentasvir)) to estradiol-containing products , , and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that an interaction between estradiol/nomegestrol and sofosburvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir leading to hepatic function disorders is at least a reasonable possibility. Product information updates are proposed to reflect this interaction with Vosevi (4.4 and 4.5). In addition, the existing mention of DDI between Viekirax and nomegestrol/estradiol, should be corrected, as during Viekirax's development the studied regimen was ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin and not ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir.

The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nomegestrol/estradiol should be amended accordingly. This recommendation should also apply to all estradiol-containing products especially core SPC for HRT.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for estradiol / nomegestrol acetate the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing estradiol / nomegestrol acetate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product informatio

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
