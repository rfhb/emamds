## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for infusion.

Clear solution free of particles.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Maapliv is indicated for the treatment of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) presenting with an acute decompensation episode in patients from birth who are not eligible for an oral and enteral branchedchain amino acids free (BCAA- free) formulation.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with Maapliv should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of MSUD disease.

There is a limited experience in patients with severe or critical elevation in leucine levels and therefore caution is required in these patients. In these patients the intravenous BCAA-free formula may be insufficient to adequately lower leucine levels and they may require other treatments such as haemodialysis or haemofiltration.

## Posology

The dose of Maapliv should be individualised based on the patient's ability to adequately metabolise amino acids, age, body weight and nutritional/fluid requirements, as well as additional energy given orally/enterally to the patient .

A sufficient calorie intake must be concomitantly provided with the amino acid administration. It may consist of concomitant infusions of glucose and lipid solution; it must be at least equal to the calorie intake adjusted to the patient's age.

Careful supplementation with isoleucine and valine should also be consistently added; if no solution for infusion is available with these 2 amino acids they can be administered by oral or enteral route.

In all cases, the infusion should be determined by a physician experienced in MSUD and intravenous therapy.

A continuous infusion is recommended.

The treatment with Maapliv may be maintained until the resolution of the decompensation episode (leucine plasma level below 381 µmol/L).

## Adult population

The recommended daily dose range in adults is provided in Table 1.

Table 1: Guidance on the dose for administration in adults

| Amino acid dose per 24 hours   | Volume per 24 hours   | Volume per hour   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 to 2 g/kg                    | 19 to 39 mL/kg        | 0.8 to 1.6 mL/kg  |

## Paediatric population

The recommended daily dose range in the paediatric population is described in Table 2.

Table 2: Guidance on the doses for administration in paediatric patients

| Patient's age                                         | Amino acid dose per 24 hours   | Volume per 24 hours   | Volume per hour   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Newborn infants, infants and toddlers up to 23 months | 2 to 3 g/kg                    | 39 to 58 mL/kg        | 1.6 to 2.4 mL/kg  |
| Child, adolescent                                     | 1 to 2 g/kg                    | 19 to 39 mL/kg        | 0.8 to 1.6 mL/kg  |

Dose adjustment of Maapliv is dependent on the patient's age and body weight. Leucine levels determine the overall treatment approach and total nutritional regimen, for example if the patient needs to undergo haemodialysis/haemofiltration for severe or persistently elevated leucine levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During acute decompensation consider adjusting the dose daily as needed based on leucine levels. Once stabilized consider adjusting every 2-3 days as needed.

## Method of administration

Continuous central or peripheral intravenous infusion.

Considering osmolarity, peripheral route is possible but must be limited to a few days to limit the risk of thrombophlebitis at the infusion site.

Maapliv is a hypertonic solution that should be administered at slow infusion rate (see tables 1 and 2).

Keep the bottle protected from light during administration.

For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

In severe/critical acute decompensation episodes treatment with intravenous BCAA-free amino acid formulation may be insufficient and other treatments, for example haemodialysis or haemofiltration may need to be considered/implemented.

Outcome measures beyond leucine levels were not systematically reported in the Maapliv clinical study programme, thus the impact of treatment with intravenous BCCA-free formula on symptom improvement or other aspects of clinical status is currently unknown.

There is limited information on the repeated administration of the intravenous BCAA- free formula.

It is essential to provide adequate calories concurrently if parenterally administered amino acids are to be retained by the body and utilized for protein synthesis.

Severe water and electrolyte disorders, severe fluid overload states, and severe metabolic disorders should be corrected before starting the infusion.

Clinical and laboratory monitoring is required, especially at the beginning of the intravenous infusion. Monitoring should include assessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, serum osmolarity, acid-base balance, blood glucose, blood ammonia, serum proteins and hepatic and renal functions.

Maapliv is a hypertonic solution that should be administered at slow infusion rate (see section 4.2).

## Precautions for infusion therapy or parenteral nutrition

General precautions for infusion therapy or parenteral nutrition apply to this medicinal product (e.g. acute pulmonary oedema, hyperhydration, acute phase of circulatory shock).

The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states, or pulmonary oedema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the solutions.

## Cardiovacular impairment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Caution shall be exercised in patients with severe heart failure by maintaining an appropriate balance between the volumes of fluids excreted and fluids introduced.

## Renal impairment

The administration of amino acids in the presence of impaired renal function may increase an already elevated blood urea nitrogen. Patients with azotaemia from any cause should not be infused with amino acids without regard to total nitrogen intake. Fluid and electrolyte status should be closely monitored for water and/or electrolyte retention and managed appropriately. Caution should be taken in order to balance the total volumes introduced and the total volumes excreted.

## Hepatic impairment

The administration of amino acid solutions to a patient with severe hepatic insufficiency may result in plasma amino acid imbalances, hyperammonaemia, stupor and coma. Amino acid solutions should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease or liver insufficiency. Liver function parameters should be closely monitored in these patients, and they should be monitored for possible symptoms of hyperammonaemia. Should symptoms of hyperammonaemia develop, amino acid administration should be discontinued and the patient's clinical status re-evaluated.

## Anaphylactic reactions

Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with amino acid solutions administered as a component of parenteral nutrition (see section 4.8). The infusion must be stopped immediately if any signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction develop.

## Thromboembolism

Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. If signs of pulmonary distress occur, the infusion should be stopped and medical evaluation initiated.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed to date. Amino acid solutions may precipitate acute folate deficiency and folic acid should be given daily.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no clinical data from the use of Maapliv in pregnant women. No animal reproductive studies have been performed with Maapliv (see section 5.3).

Maapliv is not recommended during pregnancy unless the clinical conditon of the woman clearly requires this treatment and only after a careful risk-benefit consideration.

## Breast-feeding

Amino acids/metabolites are excreted in human milk. At therapeutic doses of Maapliv no effects on the breastfed neonate/infant are expected. However, Maapliv should be used during breast-feeding only after a careful risk-benefit consideration.

There is insufficient information on the excretion of Maapliv components/metabolites in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No adequate data are available. At therapeutic doses, no effects are anticipated.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Maapliv has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit / risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

As with other amino acid solutions, overdose may induce the following adverse reactions:

- -Symptoms of fluid retention: Overdose or high rate of infusion may lead to fluid overload / retention, electrolytic disturbances, and acute pulmonary oedema.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Symptoms of amino acid overdose: Overdose or high rate of infusion may lead to adverse reactions such as shivering, vomiting, headache, nausea, hyperammonaemia and increased renal amino acid losses.

If there are signs of overdose the infusion should be stopped immediately and may be resumed with a reduced dose or slower infusion rate.

There is no specific antidote for overdose. Emergency procedures should include appropriate corrective measures.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Blood substitutes and perfusion solutions. Solutions for parenteral use, ATC code: B05BA01

Maapliv is a branched chain amino acid-free amino acid solution intended to provide 7 essential and 9 non-essential amino acids as physiological substrates for protein synthesis.

In patients with MSUD decompensation, BCAA-free solution in combination with carbohydrate and lipid supplementation prevents or reverses protein catabolism and promotes anabolism, reducing the corresponding alpha-keto acid levels.

The Maapliv clinical study programme is based on 4 retrospective studies involving patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) who received intravenous branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)free solution for acute decompensation episodes.

## Study 1. Servais et al. 2013

Study design : Retrospective comparison study. Population : 4 adult MSUD patients (17 decompensation episodes treated with parenteral amino-acid mixture vs 18 previous episodes treated by enteral feeding). Treatment : Parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) vs enteral feeding (group E). Primary objective : Evaluate efficacy of parenteral amino-acid mixture in reducing leucine concentration. Results : Mean leucine concentration at presentation: 1 196.9 μmol/L (group P) vs 1 212.2 μmol/L (group E). Mean leucine decrease in first 3 days was significantly higher in group P (p = 0.0026). Mean hospitalization duration: 4 days (group P) vs 4.5 days (group E) (p = NS). No side effects reported in group P. One patient in group E required dialysis, while no patients in group P deteriorated.

## Study 2. de Lonlay et al. 2021

Study design : Retrospective observational study. Population : 54 MSUD patients (126 decompensation episodes) from 5 centers in France and Germany (2010-2016). Treatment : Enteral/oral vs intravenous BCAA-free formula. Primary objective : Describe episodes and outcomes for patients receiving enteral/oral or intravenous BCAA-free formula. Results : Mean hospitalization duration: 6.6 days (oral/enteral) vs 5.4 days (IV). Mean leucine level decrease: 548.5 μmol/L (69.3%) in oral/enteral group vs 657.2 μmol/L (71.3%) in intravenous group. In the adult subgroup, mean time to episode resolution was 15.8 days (oral/enteral) vs 7.7 days (intravenous ) (p = 0.008) and mean hospitalization duration was 6 days (oral/enteral) vs 4.6 days (intravenous ) (p = NS). Seven serious adverse events reported in two patients; only nausea and vomiting were treatment-related.

Study 3. Sánchez-Pintos et al. 2022

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study design : Paediatric case series. Population : 5 MSUD paediatric patients (5 decompensation episodes + 1 prophylactic use for surgery). Treatment : intravenous BCAA-free solution. Primary objective : Evaluate management of decompensation episodes with the intravenous BCAA-free solution. Results : Leucine levels at admission: 699-3 296 μmol/L. Leucine normalization was achieved in all cases. Duration of administration: 3-20 days. No related adverse events observed.

## Study 4. Alili et al. 2022

Study design : Observational prospective study. Population : 24 MSUD patients (16 males, 8 females; 126 decompensation episodes: 39 in children, 87 in adults). Treatment : intravenous BCAA-free solution. Primary objective : Evaluate effectiveness and safety of intravenous BCAA-free solution in managing metabolic decompensations. Results : At presentation, mean leucine plasma concentration was ≥ 381 µmol/L in 113/126 (89.7%) episodes. Leucine normalization (to below 381 µmol/L): 82% (18/22) of episodes in children, 84% (67/80) of episodes in adults. Mean time to leucine normalization: 3.0 days (significantly shorter than predicted time with traditional methods, p &lt; 0.001). Mean hospitalization duration: 7.1 days (children) vs 5.2 days (adult s) (p = 0.012). No treatment -related adverse events reported. Dose: children treated with 0.8 to 2.0 g/kg/day for 4.8 days; adults treated with 0.5 to 2.6 g/kg/day for 3.8 days.

Outcome measures other than leucine levels were not systematically reported in the above clinical studies, thus the impact of treatment with Maapliv on symptom improvement or other aspects of clinical status is unknown. The overwhelming majority of patients treated in the Maapliv clinical development programme had a classical form of MSUD. There is no experience with other subtypes of MSUD.

The available data are insufficient to claim a better efficacy as comparing to oral and enteral BCAA-free formulations. The comparative studies between intravenous and oral/enteral BCAA-free formulations have not demonstrated statistically significant differences in efficacy.

This medicinal product has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'.

This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.

The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Maapliv is administered intravenously. The systemic bioavailability of the free amino acids in the solution is therefore 100% .

## Distribution

Initial distribution of most amino acids takes place via the central vascular compartment and extravascular water. Amino acids are transported into cells where their incorporation into proteins, conversion to other amino acids, degradation for fuel or deamination occurs.

## Biotransformation

The amino acid solution provides a source of 7 essential and 9 non-essential amino acids for metabolic processes involved in protein synthesis. Amino acids in excess to immediate requirements are either metabolized in alternative pathways, catabolized and / or excreted in sweat and urine.

## Elimination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Amino acids are excreted in the renal tubules and an active transport mechanism is responsible for resorbing amino acids from the glomerular filtrate (primarily in the proximal tubules) and returning them to the circulation. There is an upper limit to the capacity of this active transport system, beyond which excess amino acids are excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No preclinical data are available for Maapliv.

Amino acids and electrolytes are fundamental and widespread elements in mammalian metabolism and therefore conventional studies with Maapliv have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or effects on fertility.

2. What you need to know before you use Maapliv
3. How to use Maapliv
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Maapliv
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Maapliv is and what it is used for

Maapliv contains amino acids, which belong to a group of medicines called amino acids for parenteral use. It contains the following amino acids:

L-alanine, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-cysteine hydrochloride monodhydrate, L-glutamic acid, Glycine, L-histidine, L-lysine monohydrate, L-tethionine, L-phenylalanine, L-proline, L-serine, Taurine, L-threonine, L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine.

Maapliv is used to treat maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) in patients from birth. It is used when patients have a sudden worsening of MSUD and cannot take a special diet free of certain amino acids. MSUD is a rare genetic disorder where the body can't break down certain amino acids found in protein. This leads to a buildup of harmful substances in the blood and urine, which can cause serious health problems.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Maapliv

## Do not use Maapliv

- -if you are allergic to one of the amino acids or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Inform your doctor if you have:

- heart failure
- reduced kidney function
- reduced liver function
- predisposition to tromboembolism

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before you start treatment your doctor will monitor you and do tests, especially at the beginning of the infusion (drip). These include:

- checking fluid and electrolyte levels;
- serum osmolarity (measure of water and dissolved substances, such as glucose, urea nitrogen and sodium, in the blood);
- acid-base balance (having the right amounts of acids and bases in the blood and other body fluids);
- blood glucose;
- blood ammonia (a normal waste product in your body);
- blood proteins;
- liver and kidney function.

If you have severe water and electrolyte imbalances, too much fluid in the body or a severe metabolic disorder, these will be corrected before you are given the infusion.

Sudden, severe anaphylactic reactions can occur with amino acid solutions, such as Maapliv, that are used for intravenous nutrition. If you develop any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction during treatment tell your doctor or nurse immediately. These include:

- hives
- rash
- itching
- dizziness
- wheezing
- difficulty breathing
- swelling of the tongue

Patients receiving intravenous nutrition can develop blockages in the blood vessels of the lungs. If you develop any signs or symptoms of a blockage during treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately.

These include:

- shortness of breath
- difficulty breathing
- cough
- chest discomfort
- fast heart rate
- bluish colour around the mouth, lips or fingernails due to low blood oxygen levels.

In patients with severe or critical acute decompensations, with very high levels of leucine in the blood, Maapliv intravenous might need to be administered in concomitance with haemodyalisis or haemofiltration.

The clinical studies focused primarily on leucine levels. The impact on symptom improvement or other aspects of clinical status is unknown.

There is limited information on the repeated administration of the intravenous BCAA- free formula.

## Other medicines and Maapliv

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Amino acid solutions may precipitate acute folate deficiency and folic acid should be given daily.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.

There are no adequate data concerning the use of Maapliv in pregnant or breast-feeding women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are pregnant, you will receive this medicine only if your doctor considers it absolutely necessary for your recovery. Maapliv should only be given to pregnant women after careful consideration.

At therapeutic doses of Maapliv no effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Nevertheless, Maapliv should only be given to breast-feeding women after careful consideration.

## Driving and using machines

Maapliv does not affect your ability to drive or use machines.

## 3. How to use Maapliv

Maapliv will be given as an infusion (drip) into a vein.

The dose of Maapliv will be adjusted according to your ability to process amino acids, age, weight and nutritional needs.

The recommended dose is between 39 and 58 mL/kg/24h for newborn, infant up to 2 years old and between 19 to 39 mL/kg/24h for children, adolescents and adults.

Keep the bottle protected from light during administration.

## If you use more Maapliv than you should

It is very unlikely that you will receive more of this medicine in your infusion than you should, as a doctor or nurse will monitor your treatment.

The effects of an overdose may include symptoms of fluid overload/retention, electrolytic disturbances and acute pulmunary oedema; symptoms of amino acid overdose with shivering, vomiting, headache, nausea, hyperammonaemia (too much ammonia in your blood) and increased loss of amino acids in the kidneys.

In case of overdose, infusion should be stopped immediately and may be resumed with a reduced dose or slower infusion rate.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The frequency of these adverse reactions is 'uncommon' (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).

## Serious side effects

- Allergic (anaphylactic, anaphylactoid) reactions. Hypersensitivity. Symptoms may include fever or chills, shivering, excessive sweating, skin rashes, oedema of the face or the eyelids, breathing difficulties, abnormally high heart rate, abnormally low or high blood pressure. If such signs of an allergic reaction occur, the infusion should be stopped immediately.
- Metabolic/nutritional disorders with consequential hyperammonaemia. If hyeperammonaemia occurs, infusion should be stopped immediately with specific treatment to be initiated by the treating physician.
- Renal and urinary disorders with consequential azotaemia.
- Formation of blood clots that block blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary thromboembolism) or veins (venous thromboembolism). This can cause chest pain, breathlessness and fainting. If such signs occur, the infusion should be stopped, and medical evaluation initiated.

## Other side effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Abnormal blood test for liver function impairment. Blood bilirubin and hepatic enzymes might be increased; and cholecystitis and cholelithiasis might occur.
- Inflammation of the gall bladder, gallstones and problems with bile flow.
- Vein inflammation at infusion site, venous irritation, pain, warmth, swelling and vein duct induration, might occur

If you notice any changes in the way you feel during or after the treatment, tell your healthcare professional or another member of your medical team immediately.

## Reporting of side effects

If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.
