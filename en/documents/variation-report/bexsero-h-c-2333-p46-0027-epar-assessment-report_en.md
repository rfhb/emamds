## 1. Introduction

On 7 December 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Bexsero, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the study  'A Phase 3b, Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of Novartis 1 Meningococcal group B Vaccine When  Administered Concomitantly  with  Novartis 1   MenACWY  Conjugate  Vaccine  to  Healthy  Infants'  (protocol  number V72\\_56) is a stand-alone study.

1  Now GSK Biologicals

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

GSK Biologicals' rMenB, liquid formulation, was supplied in a prefilled syringe (0.5 mL volume) administered by intramuscular injection (IM); each dose contained 50 μg of each of the following N meningitidis purified antigens (961c, 936-741, 287-953), 25 μg of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) from N meningitidis strain NZ98/254, adsorbed in 1.5 mg of aluminum hydroxide; needed no reconstitution. The lot numbers were IA 151301, IC 113001A, ID 139201.

GSK Biologicals' MenACWY comprised meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y oligosaccharides that were each conjugated to the protein carrier CRM197, a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin. The drug product presentation consisted of one vial containing the lyophilized MenA conjugate component and one vial of syringe containing the liquid MenCWY conjugate component. The vaccine ready for IM was obtained by reconstitution of the lyophilized MenA with the liquid MenCWY component to administer the final quantity / dose of 0.5 mL of the reconstituted vaccine, which contained 10 μg MenA, 5 μg MenC, 5 μg MenW, 5 μg Men Y. The lot numbers were: M13020, M13070, M15038.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- 'A Phase 3b, Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of  Novartis1  Meningococcal  group  B  Vaccine  When  Administered  Concomitantly  with  Novartis MenACWY Conjugate Vaccine to Healthy Infants' (protocol number V72\\_56)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

A  Phase  3b,  Open-Label,  Randomized,  Multicenter  Study  to  Assess  the Safety  and  Immunogenicity  of  Novartis  Meningococcal  group  B  Vaccine When  Administered  Concomitantly  with  Novartis1  MenACWY  Conjugate Vaccine to Healthy Infants

## Description

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary objective:

To  assess  immunological  noninferiority  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  and  MenACWY  when  concomitantly administered compared to either alone in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age, as measured by the ratio of hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) against each of the serogroup B indicator strains (for rMenB+OMV NZ) and serogroups A, C, W- 135 and Y (for MenACWY) at one month after the 4th vaccination.

Noninferiority was to be concluded if, at one month following the 4th vaccination, the lower limits of the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the between-group ratios of GMTs (rMenB+OMV NZ + MenACWY versus rMenB+OMV NZ, and rMenB+OMV NZ + MenACWY versus MenACWY) were &gt;0.5 for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.

## Secondary Objectives:

To assess the immune response of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY

- at 1 month after the 4th vaccination
- at 1 month after the 3rd vaccination
- at 6 months after the 3rd vaccination

when concomitantly administered compared to either alone in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age.

## Safety Objective

To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  and  MenACWY  when  concomitantly administered, compared to either alone, in infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age.

## Exploratory Objective

The exploratory objective was to explore the immune response of the study vaccinations administered in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age against Neisseria Spp ., of interest, at one month after the 3rd and 4th vaccinations; however, the exploratory objective was not assessed in this study.

## Study design

This was a phase 3b, multicenter, open label, randomized trial that aimed to enroll approximately 750 healthy infants, aged 3 months at enrollment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population /Sample size

Subjects were to be randomized to one of the 3 vaccine groups in a 1:1:1 ratio with approximately 250 subjects per arm for an overall target enrollment of approximately 750 infants, 3 months of age at the enrollment. Assuming an approximate drop-out or not evaluable sample rate of 20%, a total sample size of 600 evaluable subjects was expected to be included in immunogenicity analyses (200 evaluable subjects per vaccine group).

A sample size of 200 evaluable subjects per arm was to provide at least 86.9% overall power to demonstrate noninferiority of rMenB given together with MenACWY versus rMenB given alone and versus MenACWY given alone, at 1 month after the 4 th  vaccination, as measured by the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of between-group ratio of human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) GMTs (rMenB+ACWY versus rMenB alone, and rMenB+ACWY versus MenACWY alone) being greater than 0.5 (noninferiority margin) for all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, and 4 serogroup B indicator strains, ie, noninferiority must be simultaneously demonstrated for all 8 serogroups/strains.

A total of 750 subjects were enrolled: 252 subjects in rMenB+ACWY group, 250 in rMenB group, and 248 in MenACWY group out of which 249 (99%) in rMenB+ACWY group, 249 (&gt;99%) in rMenB group, and 246 (99%) in MenACWY group received the study vaccination.

The number of subjects planned and actually enrolled are shown in Table 2-2.

## Treatments

Subjects were to be randomized to one of the three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive:

- Vaccine  Group  rMenB+ACWY:  rMenB3+OMV  NZ  vaccine  given  concomitantly  with  MenACWY (referred to as Group A in protocol),
- Vaccine Group rMenB: rMenB vaccine alone (referred to as Group B in protocol),
- Vaccine Group MenACWY: MenACWY vaccine alone (referred to as Group C in protocol).

at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age.

The  study  comprised  6  clinical  visits  (performed  at  study  day  1,  61,  121,  151,  301,  and  331),  8 reminder calls (performed 2 and 4 days after each vaccination visit) and 2 safety calls (performed at day 201 and at day 251).

Subjects  were  to  be  observed  for  at  least  30  minutes  after  each  vaccination  for  any  immediate reactions. Blood (approximately 5 mL) were to be drawn from all subjects before 1st vaccination (day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 1), one month after the 3rd vaccination (day 151), before the 4 th  vaccination (day 301) and 1 month after (day 331) the 4th vaccination for immunogenicity evaluation.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints:

The hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroup B indicator strains (for rMenB) and serogroups A, C, W135  and  Y  (for  MenACWY)  at  1  month  after  the  4 th vaccination,  and  corresponding  between-group ratios  of  GMTs  for  rMenB+ACWY  vs.  rMenB  (serogroup  B  indicator  strains),  and  rMenB+ACWY  vs. MenACWY (serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y).

## Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints:

The immune response to rMenB at day 1, day 51, day 301, and day 331 when administered alone and concomitantly with MenACWY (rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB) was assessed by:

- hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroup B indicator strains;
- the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥5 and subjects with hSBA ≥8 against each of the serogroup B indicator strains.

The immune response to MenACWY at day 1, day 51, day 301, and day 331 when administered alone and concomitantly with rMenB (rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY) was assessed by:

- hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y;
-   the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥4 and subjects with hSBA ≥8 against each of the serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.

Additionally, the following were also to be assessed for each of the serogroup B strains and each of the serogroups A, C, W and Y:

-   within-subject geometric mean ratios (GMRs) will be calculated for GMTs at one month after 4th vaccination (day 331) vs. pre 4th vaccination (day 301),
-   the percentage of subjects with 4-fold increases in hSBA titers at one month after 4 th vaccination (day 331) vs. pre 4th vaccination (day 301).

## Safety Endpoints:

-   The frequencies and percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs during the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after day 1, 61, 121, and 301 for all vaccine groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-   The  frequencies  and  percentages  of  subjects  with  any  other  (unsolicited)  AEs,  AEs  leading  to withdrawal and medically attended AEs during the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) at day 1, 61, 121, and 301 for all vaccine groups.
-   The frequencies and percentages of subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and medically attended AEs throughout the study period.

## Exploratory Endpoints:

No exploratory endpoints were assessed in this study.

## Statistical Methods

To evaluate the immune response to vaccination with rMenB, the hSBA GMTs at 1 month after the 4th vaccination (day 331) were compared between vaccine groups rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB. Noninferiority of vaccine group rMenB+ACWY to rMenB was determined if, at 1 month following the 4th vaccination (day 331), the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the between-group ratios of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB) was &gt;0.5 (noninferiority margin) for each of the 4 serogroup MenB indicator strains.

Similarly,  the  immune  response  to  vaccination  with  MenACWY  was  evaluated  by  determining  if rMenB+ACWY was noninferior to vaccine group MenACWY if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY), at 1 month after the 4th vaccination (day 331) was &gt;0.5 for each of the N meningitides serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.

Noninferiority was only to be concluded if all these 8 inferiority hypotheses were rejected, ie, the 8 hypotheses were co-primary.

Summary tables are provided for adjusted GMTs of each vaccine group and between group ratios of each  vaccine  group  comparison.  The  2-sided  95%  CIs  for  each  between  group  ratio  of  GMTs  were constructed using the common estimate of error from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with vaccine group and center as factors in the model.

The primary immunogenicity analyses were based on the per-protocol set; the secondary immunogenicity analyses on the full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analyses on the safety set.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Among 750 enrolled subjects in the study, 744 subjects received a study vaccination. Across vaccine groups, 63%-65% of enrolled subjects were included in the PPS dataset for primary and secondary objectives analysis. Overall, 79%-86% of enrolled subjects were included in the different FAS datasets, which were defined based on the different study visits (Table 11.1-1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

All demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across the vaccine groups. The mean age of the subjects enrolled into the study was 104±10.72 days in rMenB+ACWY group, 101.4±10.57 days in  rMenB  group,  and  102.7±10.9  days  in  MenACWY  group.  Most  of  the  subjects  (92%-93%)  were categorized under the race category of 'Other'. More than 99% subjects met study entry criteria (Table 11.2-1).

## Efficacy results

## Immunogenicity results:

- A total of 750 subjects were enrolled into the study: 252 subjects in rMenB+ACWY group, 250 in rMenB group, and 248 in MenACWY group out of which 249 (99%) in rMenB+ACWY group, 249 (&gt;99%) in rMenB group, and 246 (99%) in MenACWY group received the study vaccination.
- Across vaccine groups, 63%-65% of enrolled subjects were included in the PPS analysis for primary and secondary objectives. Overall, 79%-86% of enrolled subjects were included in the different FAS populations, which were defined based on the different study visits (Table 11.1-1).
- The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  met  as  the  immune  responses  to  rMenB  and  MenACWY when concomitantly  administered  (rMenB+ACWY)  were  noninferior  to  either  rMenB  or  MenACWY administered alone. At one month after the 4 th vaccination (day 331), the lower limits of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the between-group ratios of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB, and rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY) were &gt;0.5 for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y (Table 2-3).

## Rapporteurs assessment comment:

Study results demonstrate non inferiority of combined rMenB+MenACWY vaccine to either rMenB or MenACWY administered alone. This is shown by lower limits of the 2-sided 95% CIs of &gt; 0.5 for the between  ratios  of  GMTs  (rMenB+ACWY  vs.  rMenB,  and  rMenB+ACWY  vs.  MenACWY)  after  the  4 th vaccination for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.

## Immune responses following administration of rMenB vaccine:

- At  1  month  post  3rd  rMenB  vaccination  (day  151),  in  vaccine  groups  rMenB+ACWY  and  rMenB, 96%-100% of subjects achieved hSBA ≥5 against serogroup B strains H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254 and 68%-70% subjects achieved hSBA ≥5 against strain M10713. At 1 month post 4 th  vaccination (day 331), the percentages in both vaccine groups were 97%-100% for strains H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254 and 87% in each vaccine group for strain M10713 (Table 11.4.1-2).

*6 months after 3\" vaccination is referred as pre 4 vaccination

- At 1 month after the 4 th rMenB vaccination, the percentages of subjects with 4-fold increase in titers over pre 4th vaccination ranged from 92%-95% in both vaccine groups against strains H44/76 and 5/99; whereas for strain NZ98/254 the percentages were 81% and 79% and for strain M10713 the percentages were 58% and 60%, in rMenB+ACWY and rMenB vaccine groups, respectively.
- The  immune  responses  following  administration  of  rMenB  vaccine  were  similar  between  the rMenB+ACWY and rMenB groups at each of the timepoints assessed post 3 rd  and 4 th  vaccination (Table 11.4.1-2; Table 11.4.1-3).

## Immune responses following administration of MenACWY vaccine:

- At  1  month  post  3 rd MenACWY  vaccination  (day  151)  as  well  as  at  1  month  post  4 th   MenACWY vaccination  (day  331),  96%-100%  of  subjects  in  vaccine  groups  rMenB+ACWY  and  MenACWY achieved hSBA ≥ 8 across serogroups A, C, W, and Y (Table 11.4.1-4).

- At 1 month after the 4th MenACWY vaccination, the percentages of subjects with at least 4-fold increase in titers ranged from 71%-90% in both vaccine groups against all serogroups, A, C, W, and Y.  The  percentages  were  similar  in  both  vaccine  groups  except  for  serogroup  A  in  which  the

percentages  were  higher  in  rMenB+ACWY  vs  MenACWY  at  pre-  and  post  4th  vaccination  (Table 14.2.1.4).

- The immune responses following administration of MenACWY vaccine were higher or similar in the rMenB+ACWY  group  compared  with  those  in  the  MenACWY  group  at  each  of  the  timepoints assessed post 3rd and 4th vaccination (Table 11.4.1-4; Table 11.4.1-5, Table 14.2.1.4).

## Rapporteurs assessment comment:

Of  note,  immunogenicity  against  especially  serogroup  A  and  to  a  limited  extent  against  W  and  C appears to be more pronounced with the combined vaccine as compared to MenACWY given alone, as reflected in GMT ratios obtained after the 3 rd and 4 th vaccination, at pre 4 th /post 4 th vaccination and subjects  reaching  a  4fold  increase  from  pre  4 th to  post  4 th vaccination  with  the  combined  vaccine compared to  MenACWY  alone  (tables  2.3,  11.4.1-5,  14.2.1.4).  This  observation  may  speak  for  the production of cross-reactive Ab induced by MenB component in the vaccine combination.

## Safety results

- Across  vaccination  groups,  any  solicited  AEs  were  reported  in  62%-87%  subjects  after  the  1st vaccination,  57%-81%  subjects  after  the  2nd  vaccination,  56%-79%  subjects  after  the  3rd vaccination,  and  54%-84%  subjects  after  the  4th  vaccination.  The  percentages  of  subjects  with

solicited local and systemic AEs were higher in the rMenB+ACWY and rMenB groups than those in MenACWY group (Table 2-4).

- Across vaccination groups, the solicited local AEs were reported in 41%-79% subjects after the 1st vaccination,  41%-71%  subjects  after  the  2nd  vaccination,  37%-72%  subjects  after  the  3 rd vaccination, and 39%-75% subjects after the 4 th  vaccination (Table 2-4). Tenderness was the most common solicited  local  AE  reported  after  each  vaccination  with  the  incidence  being  higher  after rMenB vaccination compared with that after the MenACWY vaccination (Table 12.2.3-1, 12.2.3-4, below). Most of the reported solicited local AEs after either dose of vaccine were mild to moderate in intensity with onset from 6 hours to day 3 after vaccination.

- No  increase  in  local  and  solicited  AEs  was  observed  after  the  concomitant  administration  of MenACWY and rMenB vaccines compared with administration of each vaccine alone and there was no increase in reactogenicity with the subsequent doses (Table 2-4).

- A total of 74%-79% subjects across vaccine groups experienced any unsolicited AEs with 11%-41% subjects  experiencing  AEs  those  were  at  least  possibly  related  to  the  study  vaccine.  The  most commonly affected system organ class (SOC) was 'infections and infestations' (64%-71%, across vaccine groups) while the most common unsolicited AE by preferred term (PT) were nasopharyngitis (32%-35)  and  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (29%-35%;  Table  12.2.3-5).  Most  of  the unsolicited  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity  and  most  of  them  resolved  before  study termination.
- One subject in the rMenB group had an SAE (anemia at day 35 of the 1st vaccination, leading to hospitalization, recovered after 175 days) that was considered to be at least possibly related to the study vaccine. A total of 2 subjects in the rMenB group and 1 subject in the MenACWY group had AEs leading to premature withdrawal from the study. No deaths were reported in the study.

## 2.3.3. Rapporteurs discussion on clinical aspects

The study shows non inferiority of combined rMenB+MenACWY vaccine to either rMenB or MenACWY administered  alone.  This  is  demonstrated  by  lower  limits  of  the  2-sided  95%  CIs  of  &gt;  0.5  for  the between  ratios  of  GMTs  (rMenB+ACWY  vs.  rMenB,  and  rMenB+ACWY  vs.  MenACWY)  after  the  4 th vaccination for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.

When comparing the vaccine groups rMenB+ACWY  and rMenB, equally strong and potent immunogenicity against all MenB strains could be demonstrated as shown by the high proportion of subjects  reaching  hSBA  GMTs  ≥  5    (strains  H44/76,  5/99,  and  NZ98/254  (97%-100%),  M10713 (87%)) in both vaccine groups after the 4 th vaccination.

Of note, increase of immunogenicity over time and in dependency of the number of vaccine doses was slowest  for  strain  M10713  with  only  68%-70%  subjects  achieving  hSBA  GMTs  ≥5  after  the  3 rd vaccination in both vaccination groups. Furthermore, the percentages of subjects with 4-fold increase in  titers  after  the  4 th vaccination  (over  pre  4 th vaccination)  ranged  from  92%-95%  in  both  vaccine groups against strains H44/76 and 5/99, reached 81% and 79% for strain NZ98/254 but were only 58%  and  60%  for  strain  M10713  in  rMenB+ACWY  and  rMenB  vaccine  groups,  respectively.  These results  indicate  that  the  response  against  M10713,  although  overall  sufficient  for  all  MenB  strains, appears in both the rMenB+ACWY and rMenB vaccine lower as compared to the other strains. This observation is in agreement with results obtained in earlier studies (see e.g. study V72\\_28), showing a lower immune response against the strain M10713.

Acceptable immune responses against the Men-groups A, C, W and Y were reached with the combined vaccine,  which  is  demonstrated  by  (1)  strong  increases  of  hSBA  GMTs ≥ 8  across  all  strains  already after  the  3 rd   vaccination  (96-100%  for  rMenB+ACWY)  and  (2)  by  a  comparable  proportion  of individuals showing an at least 4-fold increase of titers compared to pre-4 th  vaccination (71-90% range for  both  vaccine  groups;  equal  or  higher  proportions  in  the  combined  vaccine  setup  compared  to MenACWY  given  alone),  besides  the  fulfilment  of  the  primary  endpoint.  Of  note,  immunogenicity against especially serogroup A and to a limited extent against W and C appears to be more pronounced with the combined vaccine as compared to MenACWY given alone, as reflected in GMT ratios obtained after the 3 rd and 4 th vaccination, at pre 4 th /post 4 th vaccination and subjects reaching a 4fold increase from pre 4 th   to  post 4 th   vaccination with the combined vaccine compared to MenACWY alone (tables 2.3, 11.4.1-5, 14.2.1.4). This observation may speak for the production of cross-reactive Ab induced by MenB component in the vaccine combination.

The  proportion  of  individuals  reporting  solicited  systemic  or  local  AEs  was  comparable  between  the combined vaccine and rMenB but higher compared to MenACWY, indicating that especially the rMenB component appears to be more reactogenic, which is in agreement with previous studies. Most of the reported solicited local AEs after either dose of vaccine were mild to moderate in intensity. Tenderness was the most common solicited local AE while persistent crying and irritability was the most common solicited  systemic  AEs  reported  after  each  vaccination  across  the  vaccine  groups.  Unsolicited  AEs belonged mostly to the SOC 'infections and infestations', with infections of the respiratory tract (e.g. nasopharyngitis (33-35%) and bronchiolitis (14%)) occurring relatively often with both the combined and the MenB vaccine.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The results of the study demonstrate non-inferiority of the combined vaccine rMenB+ACWY against the isolated  vaccines  rMenB  or  MenACWY.  The  study  demonstrates  moreover  an  acceptable  and comparable safety profile of the combined vaccine. Based on the results further regulatory action has to be considered.

## Recommendation

- [x] Fulfilled:

- [ ] Not fulfilled:

Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  description  of  the  additional  clarifications requested as part of this procedure (see section 'Additional clarifications requested').

## Additional clarifications requested

Based on the results obtained in the current study the MAH should discuss addition of information regarding concomitant vaccination to section 4.5 of the SmPC.

## MAH´s response:

The  Company  acknowledges  the  Assessor's  request  to  provide  additional  information  regarding concomitant vaccination with Men A, C, W, Y in the Summary of Product Characteristics for Bexsero and to this end plans to submit a type II variation later this year.

## Assessor's comment:

The response of the MAH is endorsed.
