## ANNEX IV

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on tubulointerstitial nephritis from the literature and spontaneous reports highly suggestive of causality association including a close temporal relationship and a positive dechallenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin and tubulointerstitial nephritis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on the drug-drug interaction between empagliflozin and lithium from clinical trials and the literature suggestive for causal association, including in some cases a close temporal relationship and positive dechallenge/rechallenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of interaction, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin and drug-drug interaction with lithium is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing empagliflozin, empagliflozin/metformin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
