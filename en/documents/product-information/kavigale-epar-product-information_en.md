The safety and efficacy of sipavibart in children less than 12 years of age and children 12 years of age and older but less than 40 kg have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion.

## Intramuscular injection

This medicinal product should be administered as a single intramuscular injection in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.

## Intravenous infusion

Other medicinal products should not be administered through the same infusion line.

After infusion, the administration set should be flushed with sufficient sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection to ensure delivery of the required dose.

## Infusion using an infusion bag

Following dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection, this medicinal product should be administered as an infusion by gravity or with an infusion pump over approximately 20 minutes using an administration set with a sterile, low-protein binding 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line filter.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## Undiluted infusion using a syringe pump

This medicinal product should be administered with a syringe pump as a 2 ml (300 mg) undiluted intravenous infusion over at least 6 minutes.

If signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (IRR) occur, the infusion should be interrupted, slowed, or stopped and appropriate medicinal products and/or supportive therapy should be administered (see section 4.4).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Antiviral resistance

Sipavibart was designed to be effective against early omicron strains, with pseudovirus neutralisation IC50 values ranging from 3.6 ng/ml (XBB.1 variant) to 25.0 ng/ml (BA.2.75 variant). The extent and duration of protective efficacy against viruses with moderately increased IC50 (e.g. JN.1, IC50 83.1 ng/ml) is reduced and the clinical relevance of any prophylactic effect unclear. Due to the absence of in vitro neutralising activity, sipavibart is not anticipated to provide any protection against symptomatic COVID-19 due to viral variants containing F456L mutations in the spike protein (see section 5.1).

Decisions regarding the use of sipavibart for the prevention of COVID-19 should take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viral variants, including geographical prevalence. The in vitro neutralisation activity of sipavibart against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants is shown in Table 2 (see section 5.1).

Patients who receive sipavibart should be informed of the potential for breakthrough infections to occur. If signs or symptoms of COVID-19 occur (the most common symptoms include fever, chills, sore throat, cough, tiredness, and new loss of taste or smell; the most serious symptoms include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, or confusion and chest pain), advise individuals to promptly seek medical attention.

## Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration, and initiate appropriate medicinal products and/or supportive therapy.

## Infusion-related reactions

IRRs were observed in clinical trials with intravenous administration of sipavibart and were mild in severity (see section 4.8). If signs and symptoms of an IRR occur, the infusion should be interrupted, slowed, or stopped and appropriate medicinal products and/or supportive therapy should be administered.

## Clinically significant bleeding disorders

As with any other intramuscular injections, sipavibart should be given with caution to patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.

## COVID-19 vaccines

Pre-exposure prophylaxis with sipavibart is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excipient with known effect

This medicinal product contains 0.8 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

Sipavibart is not expected to be renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). Therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of sipavibart in pregnant women.

Non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with sipavibart. In a tissue cross reactivity study with sipavibart, no binding was detected to human foetal tissue or reproductive tissues.

Human IgG1 antibodies are known to cross the placenta barrier; therefore, sipavibart has the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing foetus. It is unknown whether the potential placental transfer of sipavibart provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing foetus.

Sipavibart should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether sipavibart is excreted in human milk. In humans, excretion of IgG antibodies in milk occurs during the first few days after birth, decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards. Consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, sipavibart could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of sipavibart on human fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

KAVIGALE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In patients receiving sipavibart by intramuscular injection, the most common adverse reaction is injection site reaction (4.1%). In patients receiving sipavibart by intravenous infusion, the most common adverse reactions are infusion site reactions (1.9%) and infusion-related reactions (1.9%).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: J06BD09

## Mechanism of action

Sipavibart is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that provides passive immunisation by binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Sipavibart is long-acting, with amino acid substitutions to extend antibody half-life (YTE) and to reduce antibody effector function and potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (TM). Sipavibart binds to the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (BA.2) with equilibrium dissociation constant of KD = 20.95 pM, blocking RBD binding to the human ACE2 receptor. This results in a blockade of virus entry.

## Antiviral activity

In a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay, sipavibart had antiviral activity through direct neutralisation.

## Antiviral resistance

Evaluation of neutralisation susceptibility of variants identified through global surveillance and in participants who received sipavibart is ongoing.

Neutralisation activity of sipavibart against pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 variants are shown in Table 2.

## Immunogenicity

Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were uncommonly (0.8% (5/604)) detected. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed. However, data are still limited.

## Clinical efficacy

## SUPERNOVA parent study, main cohort

The SUPERNOVA parent study, main cohort is a Phase III, randomised (1:1), double-blind, comparator-controlled clinical trial studying sipavibart for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in immunocompromised adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age. This study started in March 2023 and the primary analysis is dated March 2024 during a period in which mixed variants, including both susceptible and non-susceptible variants, were circulating.

A total of 1 669 adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg were randomised to receive a single dose of sipavibart 300 mg via intramuscular injection, and 1 666 were randomised to receive a comparator (tixagevimab 300 mg + cilgavimab 300 mg or placebo). Participants received a second dose of sipavibart 300 mg or placebo 6 months after the initial dose. The study excluded participants who received COVID-19 vaccine or those with a history of laboratory-confirmed or rapid-test confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 3 months prior to the first visit. At interim analysis, the median follow-up time post-second dose was 61 days (range 1 to 180 days).

The baseline demographics were balanced across the sipavibart and comparator treatment arms. The median age was 60 years [36.3% 65 years of age or older, 15 participants 12 years to less than 18 years (including 8 who received sipavibart)], 56.8% of participants were female, 74.1% were Caucasian, 6.5% were Asian, 12.1% were Black/African American, and 21.5% were Hispanic/Latino. All participants had at least one immunocompromising clinical condition, including but not limited to:

- taking immunosuppressive medication (74.3%)
- haematologic malignancy (15.3%)
- moderate/severe secondary immunodeficiencies (predominantly haemodialysis) (15.1%)
- solid organ transplant (14.2%)
- within one year of receiving B-cell depleting therapies (13.3%)
- solid tumour cancer and on treatment (3.4%)
- haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (2.0%)
- moderate/severe primary immunodeficiencies (1.6%)
- advanced or untreated HIV infection (1.1%), and
- received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (0.3%)

The study included dual primary efficacy endpoints, comparing the efficacy of sipavibart to a comparator in the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 (1) caused by any SARS-CoV-2 variant up to 181 days post last dose confirmed by RT-PCR and (2) attributable to matched variants (variants that do not contain the F456L mutation based on viral sequencing data and are expected to be susceptible to sipavibart) up to 181 days post last dose confirmed by RT-PCR. For each of the dual primary endpoints, a superiority test was performed to compare the relative risk of symptomatic COVID-19 between treatment arms.

Relative risk reduction where events were counted regardless of receipt of COVID-19 vaccinations / medicinal products or unblinding is presented in Table 3.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with sipavibart in one or more subset of the paediatric population in the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Following a single dose, sipavibart demonstrated approximately dose proportional increase in serum exposure as doses increased in the range of 300 mg to 600 mg for intramuscular injection or 300 mg to 1 200 mg for intravenous infusion.

## Absorption

Following a single 300 mg intramuscular dose of sipavibart in the anterolateral thigh, the geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation (CV%)) of the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of sipavibart was 48.0 (25.2%) μg/ml. The median time (range) to Cmax was 7.5 (3.9, 53) days.

Based on population PK analysis, the estimated absolute bioavailability of sipavibart following intramuscular administration in the anterolateral thigh is 80.7%.

Following the first and second dose of 300 mg sipavibart administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral thigh, the geometric mean serum sipavibart concentrations (CV%) at one-month post-dose were 29.8 (36.2%) μg/ml and 30.8 (54.3%) μg/ml, respectively. Doses were administered 6 months apart.

Following a single infusion of 300 mg and 1 200 mg sipavibart (infusion rate: 50 mg/min), the geometric mean (CV%) serum concentration of sipavibart at 20 minutes post-infusion was 101.6 (7.6%) μg/ml and 452.1 (25.8%) μg/ml, respectively.

## Distribution

The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution for sipavibart was 6.3 (19.4%) L following a single 300 mg intramuscular administration in the anterolateral thigh.

Based on population PK analysis, the estimated central and peripheral volume of distribution (relative standard error, RSE%) for sipavibart was 4.6 (1.3%) L and 0.4 (19.6%) L, respectively, following intravenous administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

Sipavibart is expected to be degraded into small peptides and component amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG antibodies.

## Elimination

Following a single 300 mg intramuscular dose in the anterolateral thigh, the geometric mean (CV%) clearance of sipavibart was 0.053 (43.1%) L/day, and the estimated mean terminal elimination half-life (standard deviation) of sipavibart was 87.3 (26.5) days.

Based on population PK analysis, the estimated clearance (RSE%) of sipavibart following intravenous administration was 0.044 (0.9%) L/day.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No specific studies have been conducted to examine the effects of renal impairment on the PK of sipavibart.

Sipavibart has a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 148 kDa and is not expected to be excreted intact in the urine. Renal impairment is not expected to significantly affect the exposure of sipavibart. Similarly, dialysis is not expected to impact the PK.

## Hepatic impairment

No specific studies have been conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of sipavibart.

Sipavibart is expected to be catabolised by multiple tissues through proteolytic degradation into amino acids and recycling into other proteins, therefore hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the PK of sipavibart.

## Elderly

Exposure to sipavibart in older adults ≥ 65 years of age (n=233) was comparable to that in younger adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age (n=354).

## Paediatric population

The recommended dose regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of sipavibart in adolescents 12 years of age or older who weigh at least 40 kg as observed in adults, since adults with similar body weight have been included in the clinical studies with sipavibart.

## Other special populations

There were no clinically meaningful differences in serum exposures to sipavibart based on sex, age (12 to 85 years of age), race, or ethnicity.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and reproductive toxicology studies with sipavibart have not been conducted.

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of tissue binding and a repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, including assessment of safety pharmacology and local tolerance.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before the medicine is given because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What KAVIGALE is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given KAVIGALE
3. How KAVIGALE is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store KAVIGALE
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What KAVIGALE is and what it is used for

KAVIGALE is a medicine called a monoclonal antibody. It contains the active substance sipavibart.

KAVIGALE is used to help prevent COVID-19 (pre-exposure prophylaxis). It is used in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years and weighing at least 40 kg who are at increased risk of infection because they have a weakened immune system caused by a medical condition or by treatments.

The active substance in KAVIGALE (sipavibart) is designed to recognise and attach to a specific protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. This prevents the virus from entering into your cells and from spreading between cells. This may help your body to resist the infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given KAVIGALE

## You must not be given this medicine

- if you are allergic to sipavibart or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given KAVIGALE

- if you have low numbers of blood platelets (components which help blood clotting), any blood clotting problems or if you are taking a medicine to prevent blood clots (an anticoagulant).

This medicine may cause an allergic reaction, which may be severe or life-threatening. If you notice any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction, get medical help immediately. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction include:

- difficulty breathing or swallowing
- swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
- severe itching of the skin, with a red rash or raised bumps.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

KAVIGALE may cause a reaction to the infusion (drip). This could happen immediately or within a few hours of the infusion. Symptoms may include:

- feeling sick (nausea)
- joint pain
- headache
- fever and chills
- upset stomach
- pain
- feeling lightheaded or faint
- red, warm face
- coughing
- chest discomfort
- dizziness
- shortness of breath.

Talk to a doctor or nurse if you notice any of these symptoms.

You may still get COVID-19 after you receive KAVIGALE. The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 changes over time and KAVIGALE may not protect you against every circulating variant of the virus. COVID-19 affects different people in different ways, but the most common symptoms include:

- fever
- chills
- sore throat
- cough
- tiredness
- new loss of taste or smell.

The most serious symptoms of COVID-19 include:

- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- loss of speech or mobility
- confusion
- chest pain.

Talk to a doctor right away if you get symptoms of COVID-19.

## Children and adolescents

KAVIGALE should not be given to children under 12 years of age and children 12 years of age and older weighing less than 40 kg. It has not been studied in these populations.

## Other medicines and KAVIGALE

It is not known if this medicine affects other medicines, or if it is affected by them. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.

This medicine has not been studied in pregnant women. It is not known if it can affect the unborn child. Your doctor will only give this medicine if the potential benefits of treatment to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the unborn child.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Driving and using machines

It is unlikely that KAVIGALE will affect your ability to drive or use machines.

## KAVIGALE contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 0.8 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How KAVIGALE is given

The recommended dose is 300 milligrams (mg).

KAVIGALE is given by your doctor or nurse as an injection into the muscle of your thigh or as an infusion into your vein. Depending on how you are given the infusion, the procedure lasts from 6 to about 20 minutes.

Your doctor or nurse will decide how long you will be monitored for side effects after you are given the medicine.

## 4. Possible side effects
