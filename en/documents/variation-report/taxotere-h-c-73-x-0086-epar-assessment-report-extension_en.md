## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Taxotere concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion contains docetaxel (active substance), which is an antineoplastic agent that enters tumour cells and disrupts intracellular structures necessary for the replication and survival of these cells. Docetaxel acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules  and  inhibits  their  disassembly,  which  leads  to  a  marked  decrease  of  free  tubulin  and eventually to cancer cell death. The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments.

The approved therapeutic indications for Taxotere are:

## Breast cancer

Taxotere  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  is  indicated  for  the  adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node- positive breast cancer.

Taxotere  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  have  not  previously  received  cytotoxic  therapy  for  this condition.

Taxotere monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  Previous  chemotherapy  should  have  included  an anthracycline or an alkylating agent.

Taxotere in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Taxotere  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included an anthracycline.

## Non-small cell lung cancer

Taxotere is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

Taxotere  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable, locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  in  patients  who  have  not  previously received chemotherapy for this condition.

## Prostate cancer

Taxotere in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

## Gastric adenocarcinoma

Taxotere in combination with cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

## Head and neck cancer

Taxotere in combination with cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Docetaxel  is  prepared  by  semi-synthesis  using  a  substance  extracted  from  yew  needles,  i.e.  10deacetylbaccatin III (DAB-10).

Currently  Taxotere  is  available  as  a  two-vial  formulation  and  it  is  supplied  as  a  vial  containing  a concentrated  solution  of  docetaxel  in  polysorbate 80  with  citric  acid  requiring  dilution  in  a  diluent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

containing  ethanol/water  mixture.  For  administration,  the  concentrated  solution  and  the  diluent  are first mixed to obtain a solution (or premix), which is used for preparation of a solution for infusion.

The  present  application  supports  a  line  extension  for  a  one-vial  formulation.  With  this  one-vial formulation, the preparation of the infusion solution is simplified by eliminating the first dilution step. The two-vial and one-vial formulations contain the same drug substance, docetaxel trihydrate, and the same excipients (ethanol, polysorbate 80 and citric acid).

The one-vial formulation is administered as an aqueous intravenous solution that contains the same drug substance in the same concentration as the currently approved two-vial formulation. The same grade, quality, and quantity of polysorbate 80 are present in the infusion solution of both formulations. The only difference between these two formulations is the quantity of ethanol.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Taxotere  is  supplied  as  a  20  mg/ml  pale  yellow  to  brownish-yellow  concentrate  for  solution  for infusion. Docetaxel is solubilized in a 50/50 v/v mixture of anhydrous ethanol and polysorbate 80 with citric acid.

Product is contained in a colorless 7 ml type I glass vial closed with grey rubber stopper sealed to the vial by an aluminium cap with a plastic lid.

Taxotere is available in two presentations: 20 mg/1ml and 80 mg/4ml.

## Active Substance

The drug substance used in this formulation, docetaxel trihydrate, is identical with the one used in the manufacture  of  the  approved  Taxotere  20 mg  and  80 mg  concentrate  and  solvent  for  solution  for infusion (EU/1/95/002/001 - 002).

## Medicinal Product

-  Pharmaceutical Development

The  objective  of  the  development  was  to  obtain  a  one-vial  formulation  of  Taxotere  which  would simplify preparation of the infusion solution by eliminating the first dilution step and hence the premix solution. The one-vial formulation concentrate is directly diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% glucose solution to prepare the solution for infusion.

The two-vial and one-vial formulations contain the same excipients (ethanol, polysorbate 80 and citric acid) and in the infusion solution the same quantity of polysorbate 80, and the only difference is the quantity  of  ethanol  (2.2-fold  higher  in  the  one-vial  formulation).  Development  of  the  one-vial formulation was conducted with reference to the existing two-vial formulation.

Pharmacokinetic  properties  of  the  product  were  considered  during  the  development  of  the  one-vial formulation. As the pharmacokinetic behaviour was driven by the micelle system and thus was linked to  the  polysorbate  to  docetaxel  ratio,  the  formulation  of  the  one-vial  was  developed  so  as  to  keep comparable docetaxel and polysorbate concentrations in the infusion solutions prepared from the onevial and two-vial concentrates. To confirm that same micelles were obtained in the infusion solutions prepared  from  the  one-vial  and  the  two-vial  concentrates,  comparative  micelles  size  determinations were conducted and docetaxel solubility was determined in the infusion solution for each formulation. No differences were observed in micelles solubility,  formation  and  size.  The  same  micellar  system was obtained in the infusion solution to be administered to the patient and that pharmacokinetic of the one-vial formulation would consequently be the same as for the two-vial formulation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It has been demonstrated that the higher level of ethanol in the product will not affect the solubility of docetaxel in the micelles. The MAH also provided an evidence to demonstrate that the higher ethanol content will not affect the release of docetaxel from the micelles upon administration in comparison with the two-vial formulation.

The  container-closure  system  consists  of  a  7 ml  type  I  glass  vial  with  bromobutyl  rubber  closure, coated  with  an  ethylene  tetrafluoroethylene  polymer  with  aluminium  sealing  cap.  This  containerclosure system is similar to the one used for the currently marketed two-vial formulation. Chlorobutyl rubber closure of the two-vial formulation has been replaced by a bromobutyl rubber closure for the one-vial  formulation  as  the  bromobutyl  rubber  stopper  is  better  characterized  and  presents  less additives. It presents also good elasticity properties.

##  Adventitious Agents

None of the excipients present in the formulation are of animal or human origin. Polysorbate 80 used in the manufacturing process of the medicinal product is of vegetal origin.

##  Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process adopted for the one-vial formulation is based on the process developed for the existing presentations. As a result the same approach to dispensing, compounding, filtration and filling has been taken. The manufacture of the one-vial product is simpler than that used for the twovial formulation since there is only the manufacturing process for the concentrate.

The manufacturing process consists of  3  steps:  1)  Compounding,  2)  Filtration  (sterilization)  and  3) Vial filling. The compounding process has been designed to ensure that the docetaxel is completely dissolved. In order to ensure that the nominal volume declared on the label can be withdrawn, the vials are filled with an overfill.

The  critical  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  identified  and  adequately  studied. Appropriate in-process controls, adequate to control the critical steps of the manufacturing process, have been established.

Manufacturing process validation was performed on three pilot scale primary stability batches and the first  validation  batches  of  each  strength.  Results  demonstrated  that  the  compounding  process consistently  produces  a  bulk  solution  which  remains  homogeneous,  throughout  the  sterile  filtration period,  and  result  in  a  finished  product  which  meets  specifications,  and  that  the  fill  control  on  the product during the filling process will accurately and reproducibly deliver the required dose.

##  Product Specification

The product specification is a standard one for injectable formulations and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, identification of docetaxel (HPLC and TLC), identification of excipients, clarity and  colour,  pH,  extractable  volume,  particulate  contamination  (visible  and  sub-visible  particles), assay (HPLC), water content, alcohol content (GC), related substances (HPLC), sterility and bacterial endotoxins.

The specifications and tests methods proposed for the drug product will adequately control the quality of the product. Analytical methods have been well characterised. Analytical methods not described in the Ph Eur have been validated for the intended use according to ICH guidelines. The HPLC method for assay, identification, and related substances was validated with respect to its specificity, linearity, precision,  accuracy,  range  and  robustness.  The  GC  method  for  determination  of  ethanol  has  been validated  with  respect  to  its  specificity,  linearity,  accuracy,  precision  and  robustness.  The  test  for sterility has been validated according to Ph Eur (effectiveness of the culture media in the presence and absence  of  the  product  has  been  studied).  The  bacterial  endotoxin  test  methods  were  validated  as recommended in the current European Pharmacopoeia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results from several batches of both strengths (three primary stability batches and one validation batch) have been presented. Batch analysis results indicate satisfactory uniformity and compliance with the agreed specification.

##  Stability of the Product

Stability studies were undertaken under ICH long-term (5°C ± 3°C and 25°C/60% RH), intermediate (30°C/65% RH) and accelerated (40°C/75% RH) conditions. Results were available after 12 months of storage  at  refrigerated  conditions,  18 months  of  storage  at  normal  and  intermediate  conditions  and after  6  months  of  storage  at  accelerated  conditions  for  three  primary  stability  batches  and  one validation  batch.  For  each  condition,  vials  were  stored  upright  and  inverted,  in  order  to  assess  an eventual product interaction/degradation with the stopper during long term storage.

No new potential degradation products were observed in the one-vial formulation as compared to the two-vial  concentrate  in  stability  studies  under  long-term  and  accelerated  conditions.  No  significant differences between samples stored upright and those stored inverted were observed.

One  batch  was  subjected  to  photostability  according  to  ICH  recommendations.  The  photostability testing showed that the drug product could be affected by light. Therefore it is recommended that the storage warning 'Protect from light' is applied to all presentations of the one-vial formulation. Similar results were obtained previously for the existing two-vial formulation.

A freeze/thaw cycling study was also conducted. A freeze-thaw study was performed according to the same stability  parameters.  The  results  show  that  the  product  is  not  affected  by  several  freeze/thaw cycles. Similar results were obtained previously for the existing two-vial formulation.

Based on the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC are acceptable.

-  Comparability Exercise for Drug Product (to be changed in the EPAR to 'Medicinal Product')

Chemical  compatibility  in  polyvinylchloride  (PVC)  infusion  bags  containing  saline  or  dextrose solutions and in polyolefin (PO) infusion bags containing saline solution has been performed for the one-vial formulation. No adsorption was observed.

Chemical compatibility has also been demonstrated in Codan giving sets (saline and dextrose solution of  docetaxel  one-vial  -  PVC-TOTM  (Tri-octyltrimetillate)  -  DEHP  free)  and  in  polypropylene syringes (undiluted docetaxel one-vial).

Obtained results proven similar compatibility behavior with infusion bags and administration sets has been demonstrated of the two-vial and the one-vial formulations.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  product  has  been  presented  in  a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues which have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve it as a Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

In addition to the pharmaceutical data to support the claim of equivalence for the one-vial and two-vial formulations,  non-clinical  studies  (3  toxicology  studies  and  1  pharmacology  study)  were  also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

conducted  to  show  the  equivalence.  Since  the  two-vial  and  one-vial  formulations  contain  the  same excipients (ethanol, polysorbate 80 and citric acid) and the same quantity of polysorbate 80, and the only difference  is  the  quantity  of  ethanol  (2.2-fold  higher  in  the  one-vial  formulation),  non-clinical studies  were  conducted  on  a  prototype  formulation  with  higher  ethanol  content  (3.3-  fold).  This bracketing approach showed that the higher ethanol content of the prototype formulation maintains a similar toxicity profile in mice, similar local tolerance in rabbits, similar in-vitro compatibility with human whole blood and plasma and similar anti-tumor activity in B16 melanoma-bearing mice.

The  summary  of in-vitro and in-vivo animal  studies  presented  demonstrated  equivalence  of  the existing two-vial formulation to the proposed one-vial formulation.

## Environmental risk assessment

No additional studies have been requested and no additional measures for handling and disposal are considered necessary. This new formulation is proposed to facilitate the administration and therefore will be used as an alternative to the existing two vials formulation. As a result, the amount of product used to treat the patients will not be increased. In addition, suppressing the dilution step before the injection  of  the  new  formulation  reduces  the  risk  of  contamination  and  the  quantity  of  waste  to  be disposed of.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

No new clinical data was submitted for this application since the new one-vial formulation contains the  same  concentration  of  docetaxel  and  the  same  excipients  as  the  two-vial  formulation  used  in clinical  trials.  The  same  grade,  quality  and  quantity  of  polysorbate  80  is  present  in  the  infusion solution of both formulations. The only difference between the two formulations in the infusion bag is the quantity of ethanol increased by approximately 2.2-fold in the one-vial formulation. No differences were observed in micelles solubility, formation and size. It is unlikely that the change to the one-vial formulation will impact docetaxel disposition.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The  CHMP  did  not  require  the  MAH  to  submit  a  risk  management  plan  because  the  one  vial formulation  will  only  substitute  the  already  approved  two  vials  formulation.  No  additional  risk minimisation  activities  are  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product  information.  In  addition Taxotere has been approved in the EU since 1995 and its safety profile is well established.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Pharmacology

The equivalence between two-vial and one-vial formulations has been demonstrated. It is unlikely that the change to the one-vial formulation will impact docetaxel disposition.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy

No  specific  clinical  study  was  considered  necessary.  The  efficacy  of  docetaxel  has  been  assessed previously in the framework of the initial Marketing Authorisation.

## Safety

The  safety  profile  of  the  new  one-vial  formulation  is  not  expected  to  be  different  from  the  safety profile  of  the  existing  formulation.  From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

-  User consultation

Product information for the one-vial formulation does not have significant changes compared to the 2vial formulation. Therefore, no additional Readability Testing was performed. The previous results of the  Readability  Testing  showed that the leaflet for Taxotere enabled at least 90% of participants to find, and at least 90% of those to express in their own words, each piece of information tested.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The  risk/benefit  is  considered  acceptable  since  the  one-vial  formulation  is  introduced  to  simplify preparation  of  the  infusion  solution  by  eliminating  the  first  dilution  step  and  hence  the  premix solution.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Taxotere  in  the  treatment  of  breast  cancer  (in combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with operable node-positive breast cancer; in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition; monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline  or  an  alkylating  agent;  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  for  the  treatment  of  patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease; in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Previous therapy  should  have  included  an  anthracycline),  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (for  the  treatment  of patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  after  failure  of  prior chemotherapy; in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  in  patients  who  have  not  previously  received chemotherapy for this condition), prostate cancer (in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer), gastric adenocarcinoma (in combination with cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease) and head and neck cancer (in combination with cisplatin and  5  fluorouracil  for  the  induction  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  squamous  cell carcinoma  of  the  head  and  neck)  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the marketing authorisation.
