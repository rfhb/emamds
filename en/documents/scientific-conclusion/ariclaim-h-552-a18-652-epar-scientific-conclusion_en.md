## SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS

## OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION

Following a request from the European Commission, the CHMP reviewed the data from clinical trials available to the national competent authorities for the following SSRI 1 /SNRIs 2 products particularly as regards their use in the paediatric population: fluoxetine, fluvoxamine,  sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram,  atomoxetine,  duloxetine, venlafaxine,  mianserine,  milnacipran, reboxetine, and mirtazapine.

The data reviewed included short-term placebo controlled randomised clinical trials submitted to the competent  authorities,  randomised  clinical  trials  published  in  the  medical  literature,  observational studies and ecological studies. The majority of trials included patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) while a few included patients with various anxiety disorders (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)). In addition there were some trials with patients suffering from Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These products are not authorised Europe-wide for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders in children or adolescents. Only some of these products are authorised for the treatment of children and  adolescents  with  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  and  only  one  of  them  for  the  treatment  of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Examination of suicide-related behaviours indicated that no completed suicide was reported in any of the reviewed studies. However, there was a clear suicide-related behaviours signal from the depression studies  and  a  less  strong  signal  from  the  anxiety  studies.  Moreover  there  was  a  signal  concerning related  adverse  events  like  hostility,  self-harm  and  emotional  lability  in  almost  all  products  and indications. With  the  preliminary  review  of  the  data  available  to  the  national  competent  authorities  the  CHMP concluded  that  there  were  grounds  for  concerns  about  increased  suicide-related  behaviours  in paediatric populations. The CHMP agreed that there was a potential signal of an increase in suicidal behaviour,  including  suicide  attempts  and  suicidal  ideation  and/or  related  behaviour  like  self-harm, hostility and mood lability in children and adolescents treated with SSRIs and SNRIs. This signal was present in all products for which studies were available, and from the available evidence it could not be excluded that this signal would be class related. Following  the  review  of  the  data  available  to  the  national  competent  authorities,  the  European Commission  triggered  on  17  December  2004  a  procedure  under  Article  18  of  Council  Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 for medicinal products containing duloxetine. In parallel to this procedure, a referral procedure  under  article  31  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  for  medicinal  products  containing atomoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mianserine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine was triggered.

1 SSRI stands for 'Serotonin-Selective Reuptake Inhibitor'. SSRIs are described as 'selective' because they affect only the reuptake pumps responsible for serotonin.

2 SNRI stands for 'Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor'. SNRIs work on the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitters

The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAHs in relation to the signal of suicidal behaviour in children  and  adolescents.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  a  warning  to  reflect  that  suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo, should be included in the Summary of Product Characteristics and relevant section of the Package Leaflet of Ariclaim.

## GROUNDS FOR AMENDMENT OF THE SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS AND PACKAGE LEAFLET

Whereas -The  Committee  considered  the  procedure  under  Article  18  of  Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No 2309/93 for medicinal products containing duloxetine -The Committee, in view of available data from clinical trials, concluded that there is a signal of suicidal  behaviour,  including  suicide  attempts  and  suicidal  ideation  and/or  related  behaviour like  self-harm,  hostility  and  mood  lability  in  children  and  adolescents  treated  with  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors, -The  Committee,  as  a  consequence,  concluded  that  a  warning  to  reflect  that  suicide-related behaviours  (suicide  attempt  and  suicidal  thoughts),  and  hostility  (predominantly  aggression, oppositional  behaviour  and  anger)  were  more  frequently  observed  in  clinical  trials  among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo, should  be  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  relevant  section  of  the Package Leaflet of Ariclaim. The  CHMP  has  recommended  the  amendment  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for Ariclaim. Medicinal product no longer authorised
