## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Friedreich's  ataxia  (FRDA)  is  a  hereditary,  neurodegenerative  and  cardiodegenerative  disorder  that primarily affects the central nervous system, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, as well the heart and pancreas. Although rare, is the most prevalent inherited ataxia with an overall prevalence in Europe of approximately 1 in 100,000. Review of the literature suggests that there is a North-South gradient in the prevalence, with a higher prevalence in the South of Europe (e.g. Spain 1:21,000) compared to the North of Europe (e.g. Norway 1:100,000). In the North-East of Europe prevalence is even lower (e.g. Finland 1:1,000,000). Males and females are equally affected.

The condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and is caused by expansions of GAA triplet repeats in the first intron of the frataxin gene. Normal alleles have 40 or fewer GAA repeats, while disease alleles have from around 100 to more than 1700 repeats. The frataxin protein has been shown to be involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur cluster containing enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory  chain  which  contribute  to  the  generation  of  cellular  energy.  Lack  of  frataxin  protein  in FRDA patients has been linked to cell-damaging oxidative stress  as  well  as  reduced  mitochondrial ATP output.

The  major  manifestations  of  FRDA  are  neurological  dysfunction,  cardiomyopathy  and  diabetes mellitus.  The  manifestations  vary  in  part  with  the  number  of  GAA  expansions.  Larger  GAA expansions, particularly on the smaller allele, correlate with early age of onset, shorter times to loss ambulation, a greater frequency of cardiomyopathy, and loss of reflexes in the upper limbs. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15 but can appear as early as 18 months or as late as 30 years of age. The first symptom is usually difficulty in walking. The ataxia gradually worsens and slowly spreads to the arms and the trunk. Foot deformities such as clubfoot, flexion of the toes, hammer toes or  foot  inversion  may  be  early  signs.  Rapid,  rhythmic,  involuntary  movements  of  the  eyeball  are common. Most people with FRDA develop scoliosis, which, if severe, may impair breathing. Other symptoms  may  occur  as  a  result  of  the  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  especially  serious  rhythm abnormalities such as tachycardia and heart block. About 20 percent of people with Friedreich's ataxia develop carbohydrate intolerance and 10 percent develop diabetes mellitus.

The  rate  of  progression  varies  from  person  to  person.  Generally,  within  10  to  20  years  after  the appearance of the first symptoms, the person is confined to a wheelchair, and in later stages of the disease  individuals  become  completely  incapacitated.  Life  expectancy  may  be  affected,  and  many people  with  FRDA  die  in  adulthood  from  the  associated  heart  disease,  the  most  common  cause  of death. However, some people with less severe symptoms of FRDA live much longer, sometimes into their sixties or seventies.

As  with  many  degenerative  diseases  of  the  nervous  system,  there  is  currently  no  cure  or  effective treatment for FRDA. Therefore, there is no approved specific therapy for such condition. However, many  of  the  symptoms  and  accompanying  complications  can  be  treated  to  help  patients  maintain optimal functioning as long as possible. Diabetes, if present, can be treated with diet and medications such as insulin. Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be treated with braces or surgery. Physical therapy may prolong use of the arms and legs.

As  the  frataxin  abnormality  appears  to  be  associated  with  increased  oxidative  stress  that  can  be detected  by  measuring  markers  of  oxidative  injury,  it  is  hypothesized  that  the  administration  of antioxidants could decrease these markers. However, it remains to be demonstrated that such a change is clinically relevant.

Idebenone [2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-hydroxydecyl)-1,4-benzoquinone] is a synthetic short chain analogue  of  ubiquinone  (Coenzyme  Q10),  the  vital  cell  membrane  antioxidant  and  essential constituent  of  the  cellular  energy  (ATP)-producing  mitochondrial  electron  transport  chain  (ETC). Idebenone appears to act as an anti-oxidant that also enhances the flux of electrons along the ETC, thereby facilitating the generation of ATP. Based on these effects it has been postulated as a potential therapeutic agent for FRDA. It is an antioxidant with the ability to operate under low oxygen tension situations. Because of its ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation, idebenone could protect cell membranes

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and mitochondria from oxidative damage and its antioxidant properties could protect against cerebral ischaemia and nerve damage in the central nervous system.

Takeda Pharmaceuticals initially developed idebenone for the treatment of cognitive disturbances and Alzheimer's  disease,  approval  being  granted  in  Japan  in  1986.  Due  to  lack  of  proven  efficacy  in Alzheimer's disease in later clinical trials, it was subsequently withdrawn from the Japanese market in 1998.  Idebenone  was  also  introduced  into  the  Italian  and  Portuguese  markets  for  the  treatment  of cognitive disturbances in 1993. In several European countries FRDA patients can obtain idebenone on a 'named patient' basis. The product has also received a limited provisional approval in Switzerland for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in FRDA, where the maximum daily dose is 15 mg/kg.

Data on toxicology, pharmacokinetics, clinical pharmacology as well as safety and efficacy in patients with  either  Alzheimer's  disease  or  FRDA  were  generated  by  Takeda.  Santhera  Pharmaceuticals (Switzerland) Ltd was granted access to these data by Takeda. This information covers approximately 1000 patients with Alzheimer's disease treated in clinical trials for between 6 and 24 months, and 290 FRDA patients treated in several open and double-blind studies with Idebenone for periods of between 6 and 12 months.

This  is  a  complete  application  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC, known  active  substance.  Idebenone  has  been  assigned  Orphan  Drug  Status  (EU/3/04/189)  by  the European Commission on 8 March 2004. According to the COMP, Friedreich's Ataxia was estimated to affect approximately 0.7 in 10,000 persons in the Community at the time when the application was made.  The  condition  was  perceived  as  a  chronically  debilitating  and  life  threatening  due  to  severe neurological  and  cardiac  complications  and  short  life  expectation.  In  addition,  no  satisfactory treatment has been authorised in the Community for patients affected by this condition.

The indication for which the applicant initially applied is ' Treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia '.

During the procedure the applicant proposed the following amended indication: ' Sovrima is indicated for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in paediatric and young adult patients, or in adult patients diagnosed within the last 5 years. Sovrima is also indicated in adult Friedreich's Ataxia patients with cardiomyopathy .'

The proposed posology was:

'Patients weighing 45 kg or under:  150 mg three times a day Patients weighing over 45 kg:          300 mg three times a day

Available clinical data indicate that some patients may benefit from a higher dose as indicated below:

Patients weighing 45 kg or under:  450 mg three times a day.

Patients weighing over 45 kg:         750 mg three times a day.'

'Treatment should be initiated by prescribers with experience in FRDA. Adults: If symptoms do not improve or stabilize within 12 months, treatment in adult patients should be reassessed.'

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Sovrima is presented as film-coated tablets containing 150 mg of idebenone as active substance. The other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, povidone K25, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide and purified water.

The film coating consists of polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide, aluminum lake and purified water.

The primary container consists of high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene (PP) twist off cap.

## Active Substance

The Active substance is idebenone its chemical name is 2-(10-hydroxydecyl)-5,6-dimethoxy-3methyl-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione according to the IUPAC nomenclature.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Idebenone is yellow-orange crystalline powder. In fact two polymorphs of idebenone are known (form A and B) with  different  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  and  different  melting  point.  It  was  verified  that crystallization leads constantly to form A, whatever the nature of the solvent. Form B is obtained only after  melting  and  re-solidification.  Furthermore,  it  was  noticed  that  with  the  current  manufacturing process only form A is obtained. It can be concluded that polymorphism is not an issue since the two forms are distinguishable by their melting point and their IR spectra and both of these characteristics are controlled at release of the drug substance.

Idebenone is insoluble in water, freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether and dioxane and slightly soluble in n-hexane. Idebenone is achiral.

## Manufacture

Idebenone  is  synthesised  in  two  reaction  steps  following  purification  by  re-crystallisation.  The manufacturing process has been adequately described.  Critical  parameters  have  been identified  and adequate  in-process  controls  included.  Specifications  for  starting  materials,  reagents,  and  solvents have been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been presented. Structure elucidation has been performed by infrared absorption spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, 1 HNMR spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The molecular weight was determined  by  elemental  analysis  which  is  in  agreement  with  the  expected  molecular  weight.  The proposed molecular structure was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction.

## Specification

The active substance specifications include tests for appearance (crystalline powder), color (yelloworange), appearance of a solution 10% in ethyl acetate, identification (IR-KBr, m.p), content of water (Ph.Eur),  sulfated  ash  (Ph.Eur),  heavy  metals  (Ph.Eur),  residual  catalysts  (plasma  atomic  emission spectroscopy), residual solvents (GC), impurities (HPLC), assay, particle size (laser diffraction) and microbiological limit tests.

It was verified that all specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The non-pharmacopoeia analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were well described and their validations are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. Impurities were described, classified  as  process  related  impurities  and  possible  degradation  products,  and  qualified.  Residual solvents  were  satisfactorily  controlled  in  the  active  substance  according  to  the  relevant  ICH requirements. Certificates of analyses for the active substances were provided and all batch analysis results comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.

## Stability

The  stability  results  from  long-term  and  accelerated  studies  were  completed  according  to  ICH guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  active  substance.  During  the  stability  studies  the following parameters were controlled: appearance, content of water, related substances and assay. It was noticed that the test methods applied are those used for release of the drug substance. Following the stability studies was concluded that the active substance is very stable substance, in particular in the solid state. However, in aqueous buffers, degradation was observed at high pH-values, but after irradiation with a Xenon light source no decomposition was observed in solid state. The results of the long-term  and  accelerated  studies  fulfil  the  proposed  specification.  Therefore,  the  results  justify  a retest period proposed by the company in the intended packaging

## Finished Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. Sovrima film-coated tablets were developed in two tablet strengths (60 mg, 150 mg) which were used in  clinical  trials.  However,  only  one  tablet  strength  (150  mg)  was  applied  for  with  the  present Marketing Authorisation application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Idebenone was previously developed for the treatment of  cognitive  disorders  (45  mg).  This  dosage form has been on the market for many years without any known problems related to manufacture, dissolution and stability. Therefore, as a starting point a 45 mg film-coated tablet of idebenone was developed, with cores of the same qualitative composition as the previous tablets. It was noticed that the use of a classical mixture of iron oxides was not adequate for the film-coat, since patients suffering from Friedrich's ataxia typically show a modification of their iron metabolism. In this context, other mixture (polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide, aluminum lake and purified water) was selected for the film-coat. However, this mixture contains sunset yellow as colorant, which shows a similar color as idebenone. Therefore, the obtained film-coat was sufficient for blinding of formulations used in clinical trials and to avoid potential discoloration of the film-coat by the active substance.  Nevertheless,  during  the  assessment  a  concern  was  raised  with  regard  to  the  use  of  this particular colorant, since Sovrima might be used in the paediatric population. In this context it was ultimately  agreed  that,  in  the  event  of  a  positive  opinion  and  authorization,  the  applicant  had  to commit to search for and evaluate possible alternatives to the azo-dye sunset yellow. For the clinical development  and  for  commercialization,  a  film-coated  tablet  containing  150  mg  idebenone  was developed. The coating parameters were optimized in order to minimize an increase of hardness and of disintegration  time  and  a  decrease  of  the  dissolution  rate.  The  relevant  process  parameters  were investigated  in  order  to  achieve  acceptable  dissolution  rates.  Furthermore,  for  the  clinical  trials  a formulation of a film-coated tablet containing 60 mg was developed as well.

It was noticed that all the excipients used are well known and commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. Statements of the suppliers of lactose on the risk of BSE/TSE were provided.

## Manufacture of the Product

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard manufacturing processes such as mixing, blending, compressing and coating.

Furthermore,  the  equipment  used  is  commonly  available  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  It  was demonstrated that there are no critical steps in the manufacturing process.

The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications.

## Product Specification

The  finished  product  specifications  were  established  according  the  ICH  guidelines  and  include  the following tests: shape, colour, average mass, identification, assay, impurities (HPLC), uniformity of weigh (PhEur), dissolution and microbial limits (Ph Eur).

It  was  verified  that  no  new  impurities  have  been  arising  compared  to  the  active  substance  and  the specifications have been justified.

All  analytical  procedures  that  were  used  for  testing  the  finished  product  were  properly  described. Moreover,  all  relevant  methods  were  satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH guidelines.

The  batch  analysis  data  for  three  pilot  scale  batches  confirm  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of the finished product.

## Stability of the Product

The stability studies were conducted according to the relevant ICH guidelines. Three full-scale batches have been stored at long term, intermediate and accelerated conditions. All batches were packed in the proposed  market  packaging.  It  was  verified  that  the  following  parameters  were  controlled:  colour, content of water, related substances and assay were determined and the same analytical procedures as for  the  release  analysis  were  used.  It  was  noticed  that  the  stability  of  the  active  substance  was investigated under stress conditions (high temperature, light oxygen and influence of pH).

One  production  batch  per  strength  was  stored  for  photostability  at  ICH  conditions  and  the  results obtained justify, that no labelled storage condition concerning exposure to light is required.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture, control of the active substance and the finished product has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  the  tests  carried  out  indicated  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics. The inclusion of the azo-dye in the tablets composition remained an unresolved issue at the time of the opinion.

## Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Idebenone was originally developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, which evaluated the  non-clinical  aspects  of  the  product  to  support  its  use  in  cognitive  impairment.  Many  of  these studies are described in the published literature. In addition, Santhera Pharmaceuticals GmbH recently performed  additional  non-clinical  studies  covering  a  package  of  Safety  Pharmacology  studies  in compliance  with  GLP  and  designed  to  conform  with  ICH  Guideline  S7A,  two  28  day  repeat  dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, and a standard battery of genotoxicity tests conforming to the ICH Guidelines S2A and S2B.

All pivotal toxicity studies, including new safety pharmacology studies, were performed in accordance with  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  principles.  Most toxicology studies were conducted in accordance with applicable study guidelines and in compliance with regulations .

## Pharmacology

Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) and functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial ETC, thus increasing the production of ATP (Sugiyama and Fujita, 1985; James et al. , 2005). Idebenone also inhibits lipid peroxidation and protects cell membranes and mitochondria from oxidative damage (Suno and Nagaoka, 1984a, 1984b). The proposed mode of action, which was supported by the data submitted, is that idebenone is reduced by complex I to 2H-idebenone which can return electrons to complex III, thereby facilitating the generation of ATP.

## Primary pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic effect was supported in appropriate in  vitro and in  vivo models  at  clinically relevant concentrations/dosages including a genetically-modified mouse model of FRDA.

In in  vitro phamacodynamic  studies  using  isolated  mitochondria  from  heart  and  brain  tissue,  the reduced  form  of  idebenone  inhibited  lipid  peroxidation  and  swelling  of  mitochondria.  Almost complete inhibition lipid peroxidation was observed at a concentration of 200 µ M (EC50 50 µ M). None of  idebenone  main  metabolites  (QS-4,  QS-6,  QS-10)  could  prevent  lipid  peroxidation  to  the  same extent.  The  inhibition  of  lipid  peroxidation  by  idebenone  was  improved  in  the  presence  of  the substrates for mitochondrial respiration.

In relation to the intended indication, a study in the ischemic rat heart model showed that idebenone can  activate  the  energy  metabolism  of  cardiac  muscle  and  also  improve  cardiac  function  after reperfusion. In  vitro studies  further  showed  that  idebenone  can  protect  cultured  fibroblasts  derived from  FRDA  patients  from  cell-damaging  oxidative  stress  thereby  increasing  cellular  survival. Idebenone restored enzyme activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in heart biopsies of FRDA patients.

In vivo , the systemic effect of idebenone was tested in a genetically-modified mouse model of FRDA generated by targeted deletion of the frataxin gene in striated muscle. The Frda/MCK mutant mouse, like FRDA patients, develops a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which eventually evolves into a dilated cardiomyopathy. Idebenone-treated Frda/MCK  mutant  mice  exhibited  a  reduction in the left ventricular hypertrophic process (-24% measured as left ventricular mass; p&lt;0.01) and a reduction of the  left  ventricular  diameter  (-16%;  p&lt;0.01)  at  Week  6  (i.e.  after  3  weeks  of  90  mg/kg/day  of idebenone) compared to placebo-treated Frda/MCK mutant mice. The delay in the onset of the cardiac alterations was about 1 week and idebenone increased the life span of the Frda/MCK mutant mice by 10% (p&lt;0.012; N=15/group) with an average survival rate of 79±9 days versus 71±9 days for placebotreated animals. The results from this study indicated that idebenone improves cardiac parameters in FRDA mutant mice in a precise time window (5-6 weeks old FRDA mutant mice), after the onset of the disease but just before the collapse of Fe-S enzyme activities. In summary, idebenone showed an effect  on  mitochondrial  function  in  the  FRDA  mouse  model.  The  administered  effect  dose  (90 mg/kg/day) in the FRDA mouse model is in the same range as the clinical dosages (32-50 mg/kg/day).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  the  protective  actions  of  idebenone  on  ischemic  cardiac  muscle  were  investigated  in anesthetized dogs with coronary stenosis . Idebenone, administered intravenously for 30 minutes after stenosis was initiated, dose-dependently reduced the S-T interval. At 5 mg/kg idebenone, suppression was nearly complete reaching levels approaching those of pre-stenosis conditions almost immediately after drug application. These reduced levels were maintained for the duration of the experiment (60 minutes). Since idebenone suppressed the increase of the S-T interval in the ischemic region of the heart but did not show an effect on systemic blood pressure, heart rate and coronary flow, it can be concluded that idebenone seems to improve the energy metabolism of the cardiac muscle mitochondria in the ischemic region of the dog heart.

## Secondary pharmacodynamics

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies (in various animal models).

Such  studies  showed  that  idebenone  inhibits  the  development  of  stroke  and  renal  vascular  lesions associated  with  severe  hypertension.  Idebenone  had  an  ameliorating  effect  on  neurological  deficits (i.e. onset of stroke, survival time) related to cerebral ischemia. In normal rats, idebenone did not alter brain concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) or choline in a dose range of 10-100 mg/kg, i.p. However, a significant decrease in ACh and an increase in choline occurred in various brain regions of ischemic rats.  Pre-treatment  with  idebenone  (10  mg/kg,  i.p.)  inhibited  these  changes  due  to  ischemia  in forebrain regions.

## Safety pharmacology programme

No safety concerns of relevance for the human situation were observed in animal safety pharmacology studies. Idebenone (300-1000mg/kg) had no or only minor effects on either the central nervous system or somatic nervous systems. There were not remarkable undesired effects in behaviour, spontaneous locomotor activity, skeletal muscle coordination, barbiturate sleeping time, electroshock or metrazolinduced  seizures,  pain  responses,  spontaneous  EEG  and  behaviour  in  conscious  cats,  spontaneous EEG in gallamine-immobilized cats, spinal reflex in anaesthetised cats and neuromuscular junction in rat isolated phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations.

The only finding was a slight decrease in body temperature observed at 300 mg/kg, orally, assessed of low clinical relevance. No effects were seen on intestinal transport in mice and on gastric secretion in rats. Spasmolytic effects of Idebenone were observed in vitro in smooth muscle preparations at high concentrations (10 -5 - 10 -4 M), which over (&gt; 140 times) the maximum human plasma concentration of parent  Idebenone  following  a  dose  of  750  mg  (23.6  ng/ml)  three  times  a  day  (t.i.d.).  However, idebenone significantly inhibited the tail currents of the hERG channel with an approximate IC20 of 0.17 µM a concentration of &gt;7.4 times the maximum idebenone plasma concentrations following 750 t.i.d. in humans. In vivo , in the dog telemetry study, no effects on QT interval or other ECG parameters were observed at doses up to 500 mg/kg.  The bioavailability of idebenone was, however, low in this study.  In a 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study in dogs with oral dosing of 500 mg/kg, ECGs recorded at  Tmax  3h  after  dosing  in  Week  4,  demonstrated  no  effect  on  the  QTc  interval.  No  adverse cardiovascular effects were noted in the safety pharmacology studies.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No specific non-clinical (or clinical) pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

Idebenone was well and rapidly absorbed in the species tested (rat, mouse and dog). After a single dose 91% was found to be absorbed in rats and 62% in dogs, tmax  occurred within 1 hour. However, due to a high first pass metabolism, less than 1% of parent idebenone reaches the systemic circulation. Concentrations  of  parent  idebenone  in  plasma  were  considerably  lower  than  the  concentrations  of metabolites,  and  detectable  in  plasma  only  during  a  short  period  of  time.  Thus,  no  half  life  was calculated on parent idebenone in any species. The terminal half lives of total radioactivity in plasma of rats and dogs after oral administration of [ 14 C]idebenone were 4.5 and 15.4 hrs, respectively. At higher doses, systemic exposure did not increase in proportion to dose. The dose levels at which this nonlinearity started differed between species and studies. In dogs, systemic exposure in terms of AUC0-24  increased  proportionally  to  the  dose,  up  to  100  mg/kg,  while  Cmax  did  not  increase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

proportionally, in the dose range 10 to 500 mg/kg. In rats, Cmax    increased proportionally up to 500 or 1000  mg/kg  depending  on  study.    Different  analytical  methods  together  with  large  variability  in exposure data make the interpretations of nonlinearity highly uncertain. No time dependent effect on systemic  exposure  was  shown  and  no  difference  between  gender  was  seen  with  regard  to  parent idebenone. Administration of idebenone  suspension  in fed condition increased bioavailability considerably in dogs, the rate of absorption increased (tmax  = 8h) and the systemic exposure in terms of mean Cmax and AUC0-24 increased 14-and 45-fold, respectively. This was also seen in humans given fat rich food although the increase in bioavailability was not as pronounced.

## Distribution

More than 99% of idebenone is bound to plasma proteins in all species tested including humans. A smaller fraction &lt;25% was bound to lipoproteins and the remainder to albumin and other protein(s). The distribution radioactivity to erythrocytes was &lt; 10% in rats and dogs.

Highest  concentrations  of  radioactivity  after  oral  administration  of  [ 14 C]idebenone,  were  found  in liver,  kidney,  blood,  lung,  spleen,  skeletal  muscle, thymus, stomach and intestine. No accumulation was seen in any tissue  studied  after  repeated  dosing.  Parent  idebenone  distributed  to  brain  and  the highest  concentration  of  idebenone  and  the  active  metabolite  QS-10  was  evident  in  cerebellum. Conjugated idebenone and metabolites were also detected in brain at concentrations approx 10 times higher  than  the  parent  idebenone.  Distribution  of  idebenone  and/or  its  metabolites  to  placenta  and foetal tissues was demonstrated. The levels of radioactivity in fetal plasma and tissues at 2 and 6 hrs after administration were about 20% of the levels in maternal plasma. Idebenone and/or its metabolites were also excreted into milk in moderate amounts.

## Metabolism

Idebenone is eliminated mainly via metabolism. A high first pass metabolism occurring in liver and intestinal mucosa results in that &lt; 1% of idebenone reaches systemic circulation. The metabolism of idebenone includes oxidation and shortening of the side chain resulting in the metabolites QS-10, QS8,  QS-6  and  QS-4.  These  metabolites  including  the  parent  compound  is  further  modified  by conjugation (glucuronidation or sulfatation) resulting in conjugated forms of the metabolites as well as the parent compound. The metabolism profile between species differ quantitively but not qualitatively. The main metabolites in rats were sulfate conjugates of QS-4, QS-6 and QS-10. In dogs, the main metabolites in plasma were sulfate conjugate of idebenone and QS-4. The predominant metabolites in human  plasma  were  identified  as  the  sulphate  conjugate  of  idebenone  and  the  O-desmethylated glucuronic acid conjugate of QS-10 glucuronide. No human specific metabolite has been identified. Thus, the species chosen for toxicity studies are considered acceptable.

## Excretion

At 72 h after oral or intravenous administration of [ 14 C]idebenone, elimination of radioactivity was almost complete. The main excretion route of idebenone and/or its metabolites was via urine in rats and dogs, which accounted for approximately 60 to 70 % of the dose. The main metabolites in urine of rats  were  sulfate  conjugate  of  QS-4,  QS-6  and  QS-10.  In  dogs,  the  main  metabolites  were  sulfate conjugate  of  idebenone  and  QS-4.  In  humans,  approximately  80%  of  the  dose  was  found  to  be excreted via urine, and major metabolites were the glucuronic acid and sulphate conjugates of QS-4.

## PK drug interactions

The  potential  for  inhibition  of  human  Cytochrome  P450  enzymes  (CYP1A2,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1, CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  and  CYP3A4)  by  idebenone  was  investigated  in  human  liver  microsomes in vitro (study 904600). The liver microsomes were supplied from several donors and frozen in -80 prior to the test procedure. A dose-related inhibition of at least 50% of CYP2C19 was detected at idebenone concentrations  up  to  1 µ g/ml  (IC50=0.81 µ g/ml).  At  least  50%  inhibition  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 activities was detected at idebenone concentrations between 1 to 5 µ g/ml. CYP 2C9  was  not  inhibited  at  concentrations  up  1000 µ g/ml  idebenone.  No  pharmacokinetic  drug interaction studies with idebenone were performed in vivo .

Considering the human exposure at maximal therapeutic levels, the risk for inhibition of CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and  CYP3A4  seemed  low.  A  risk  of  inhibition  of  CYP1A2  and  CYP2C19  could  not  be excluded and the risk  for PK interactions  was further  evaluated  in  clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies (see 'Pharmacokinetic interaction studies' in the Clinical Aspects section 3.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Single  dose  toxicity  was  studied  in  mice  and  rats  after  oral,  subcutaneous  and  intraperitoneal administration. The acute toxicity of idebenone was low in both species, where the LD50 was ≥ 10000 mg/kg  after  oral  and  subcutaneous  administration.  After  intraperitoneal  administration  the  average LD50 was above 700 mg/kg in mice and above 800 mg/kg in rats.

The acute toxicity of the main metabolite QS-4 was also studied, revealing lower LD50 than for the parent  drug:  values  of  490  mg/kg  and  1410  mg/kg  were  measured  in  mice  after  i.p.  and  oral administration respectively. In rats, the LD50 of the QS-4 metabolite was 420 mg/kg and 5490 mg/kg after i.p. and oral administration respectively.

The clinical signs of acute toxicity were essentially the same after administration of idebenone or QS4; however, respiratory depression was seen in both rats and mice after administration of QS-4 but not after administration of idebenone.

## Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Idebenone was extensively tested in oral repeat-dose toxicity studies in mouse (3 months), rat (up to 12 months) and dog (up to 12 months). In studies ≥ 3  months, mice, rats and dogs were exposed to idebenone doses (oral / oral diet) up to 2000, 2500 and 500 mg/kg/day, respectively. Coloured urine due to coloured metabolites was observed in all three species. Coloured faeces were also seen in dogs occasionally.

In mice and rats, the main effect of idebenone was local changes in the forestomach mucosa. Yellow colouration and mucosal thickening of the forestomach, occasionally accompanied by forestom ach dilatation and appearance of red spots in the fore- and glandular stomach was observed at necroscopy. The  histopathological findings comprised  of dose-dependent  increase in incidence/severity of submucosal inflammatory infiltrates, erosions and ulcerations of the forestomach, and hyperkeratosis and epithelial and basal cell hyperplasia, focal necrosis and oedema. In addition, degeneration and/or hyperplasia of the mucosal epithelium in the glandular stomach was observed in single rats. Oedema of the submucosa in the glandular stomach was also noted in single rats dose with 500 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. In conclusion, in the mouse and rat subchronic and/or chronic studies the target organ was the  forestomach,  a  rodent-specific  organ  with  low  clinical  relevance  for  the  human  situation.,  the NOAEL (forestomach findings) was 640 mg/kg/day and approximately 20-160 mg/kg/day in mice and rats, respectively, giving exposure margins of 4-6 in mice and in the range of 1-30 in rats, compared to the highest recommended dose in man.

A  high  incidence  of  pituitary  tumours/hyperplasia  and  mammary  fibroadenomas/carcinomas  was observed in female rats (oral diet) of the highest dose (160 mg/kg/day) in the 52-week study (C-14434). Nevertheless, in the light of new historical data provided by the applicant, including incidences of pituitary and mammary tumours from the performing CRO Hazleton Laboratories around the time when the study was performed (circa 1984-1989), the reported findings  were considered  to be  due more to a spurious finding than to a treatment related finding. Further reassurance was provided by data  resulting  from  carcinogenicity  experiments  in  rats  and  mice  where  no  similar  findings  were reported.

In  dogs,  no  systemic  toxicity  and  therefore  no  target  organ  was  identified.  The  only  effects  in  this species were clinical signs, including gastrointestinal disturbances such as loose faces, diarrhoea and emesis,  which  limited  the  maximum  repeatable  dose  to  500  mg/kg/day  (NOAEL).  The  exposure margin was in the range of 8-200 compared to the highest recommended dose in man. Treatment of dogs  with  idebenone  was  associated  with  statistically  significant  changes  in  some  haematology, clinical biochemistry and organ weight parameters but, since no clear patterns were evident and the observed deviations remained within the normal physiological limits, these changes were considered to be of no toxicological relevance.

Data from the more recent 28-day repeated dose toxicity studies corresponded well with the findings reported for the previous studies. There were only minor quantitative differences between the toxicity profiles of idebenone identified in the two sets of studies using materials from two different sources.

The toxicity of QS-4, the major metabolite of idebenone, was evaluated in a 5-week study in male rats, using intraperitoneal doses up to 45 mg/kg/day. No  animal died, and no treatment-related abnormalities  were  observed  at  any  dose  tested.  However,  no  conclusions  could  be  made  in comparison to idebenone-treated rats since the highest dose was too low in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, in the mouse and rat, the target organ was the forestomach, a rodent-specific organ, a finding  considered  to  be  of  low  clinical  relevance.  The  exposure  margins  at  NOAEL  (forestomach findings) were 4-6 (mice, NOAEL 640 mg/kg/day) and 1-20 (rats, approximately 20-160 mg/kg/day) compared to the highest recommended dose in man. In dogs, no target organ could be identified; in this species soft faeces, diarrhoea, salivation and emesis appeared to be dose limiting at doses &gt; 500 mg/kg/dose. The exposure margin at NOAEL (500 mg/kg/dose) was in the range of 8-200 compared to the highest recommended dose in man. Idebenone may be regarded as a relatively safe substance with  no  major  or  serious  adverse  effects.  However,  a  high  incidence  of  pituitary  and  mammary tumours was observed in rats in the 52-week study (C-14-434), and this was considered to be more a spurious finding rather than a treatment-related effect.

Repeated dosing in mice, rats  and  dogs  showed  overall  no  change  in  systemic  exposure  (AUC)  of parent idebenone compared to single exposure. No gender difference in exposure with regard to parent idebenone was obvious. In general, a decrease in exposure in relation to dose was seen in rats at doses above 500 to 1000 mg/kg and earlier in dogs around 100 mg/kg. However, the high inter-individual variability in all dosed groups made interpretations of non-linearity uncertain.

The major metabolite QS-4 showed no change in systemic exposure, except for in the 13- and 26week rat study where AUC increased more than 5-fold from the first to the last week of dosing. There was also a tendency of higher exposure of QS-4 in females compared to males, which was however not consistent through all studies.

The systemic exposure between studies at the same doses differed significantly both in rats and dogs (up to 19-fold). Various feeding strategies, formulation and analytical methods could explain partly these differences.

## Genotoxicity

The genotoxicity of idebenone was extensively studied according to relevant guidelines in vitro and in vivo .  Idebenone showed no genotoxic potential with respect to gene mutations in bacteria (Ames test, three studies) and DNA damage in the Rec assay. Idebenone gave an equivocal result in the Mouse lymphoma (TK locus) assay and produced positive results in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test (in two studies) using human peripheral lymphocytes. As the Applicant claims, the calstogenic effect could  be  considered  to  be  linked  to  the  cytotoxic  effect  at  high  concentrations in  vitro ,  which  are probably  related  to  the  redox  properties  of  the  substance.  However,  the  effect  could  possible  also depend  on  that  whole  blood  cultures  (containing  lysed  blood  cells)  were  used  in  the in  vitro chromosomal aberrations tests.  In addition, no genotoxic effects were induced in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test (two studies with doses up to 5000 mg/kg and one study with doses up to up to 2000 mg/kg), in  vivo chromosomal  aberration  test  (rat,  dosed  up  to  2500  mg/kg/day)  and  in  the Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test in rat liver (dosed up to 2500 mg/kg). For the in vivo studies the calculated exposure margins (parent idebenone) in mouse were 7-52 (Cmax) and 289 (AUC) and in rats 15 (Cmax) and 137 (AUC) compared to the highest recommended dose in man.

Taken together, the weight of evidence was sufficient to conclude that idebenone poses no genotoxic potential.

## Carcinogenicity

In dietary carcinogenicity studies, mice and rats were treated with idebenone for 24 months at dose levels of 0, 640, 1280, 2000 mg/kg/day in mice, and 0, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day in rats. The mice showed  treatment-related  non-neoplastic  tissue  changes  in  the  forestomach  (minimal  non-specific histopathological  signs  of  local  irritation  in  the  forestomach,  mainly  epithelial  cell  hyperplasia  and hyperkeratosis)  in  all  idebenone-treated  groups  (640-2000  mg/kg/day).  The  rats  showed  treatmentrelated  non-neoplastic  tissue  changes  in  the  forestomach  (increase  in  yellow  and  thickened  mucosa which correlated microscopically with an increased incidence of squamous cell hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis,  variably  accompanied  by  gastritis,  forestomach  erosions  and  basal  cell hyperplasia) in both the idebenone-treated groups (500 and 1000 mg/kg/day).

No treatment-related tumour response was observed in male and female mice and in male rats after idebenone. A low incidence of squamous and basal cell tumours was seen only at the highest dose (1000 mg/kg/day, exposure margins of 108-133) in the forestomach of female rats. It was agreed that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these proliferative findings in the forestomach, a rodent-specific organ, were  most  likely a consequence of local irritation, and were considered to be of low clinical relevance.

Nevertheless, in a 52-week dietary toxicity study an increased incidence of pituitary tumours/hyperplasia and mammary fibroadenomas/carcinomas was observed in female rats receiving 160 mg/kg/day had when compared with controls. Further reassurance on the more likely spurious origin of these findings rather than treatment-related adverse effects was provided.

Based on parent idebenone PK data, the calculated exposure margins are 10.5 (Cmax) and 136 (AUC) in  mouse  at  NOAEL  (2000  mg/kg/day)  and  41-51  (AUC)  in  rats  at  NOAEL  (500  mg/kg/day) compared to the highest recommended dose in man.

## Reproduction Toxicity

In the rat fertility study with doses up to 500 mg/kg/day no effects on male or female fertility were observed but paternal toxicity was noted at the highest dose. In the rat embryo foetal development study  with  doses  up  to  1000  mg/kg/day,  even  at  maternally  toxic  dose  levels,  no  treatment-related changes at external, visceral or skeletal examination in the fetuses were observed.

In the rabbit embryo-foetal development study with doses up to 500 mg/kg/day, no treatment -related teratogenicity was found. Slight maternal toxicity was noted at 150 mg/kg/day such as chromaturia and decreased body weight gain.

In the pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats, treatment with idebenone had no effects on  gestation  or  parturition.  Maternal  necropsy  showed  no  treatment-related  abnormalities.  Maternal dosing  had  no  adverse  effects  on  pup  growth  and  performance  and  on  the  offspring's  reproductive performance.

In conclusion, idebenone seemed to have no effects on fertility and general reproductive performance, and there was no evidence of embryotoxic or teratogenic potential. The calculated exposure margins for  500 mg/kg (parent idebenone) in rats were 21-28 (AUCss) and for 150 mg/kg in rabbits were 2 (AUCss) to the average exposure for the highest recommended dose in men.

## Local tolerance

No  specific  local  tolerance  studies  were  performed.  The  lack  of  such  studies  was  considered acceptable as the local toxicity  findings  observed  were limited  to  the  forestomach  in  the  rat  (tissue species-specific), and no effects were reported in the dog.

## Other toxicity studies

## Immunotoxicity

Idebenone does not seem to be an immunotoxic compound neither in the repeat dose toxicity studies nor when idebenone was examined by means of the antibody production test in Ta:A/J mice and the active systemic anaphylactic (ASA) test in guinea-pigs.

## Dependence

Due to the characteristics and intended use of Idebenone, concerns related to dependence potential are not expected.

## Impurities

The  total  of  all  impurities  (identified  and  unidentified)  was  set  to  a  maximum  of  1.0%  and  the specification limit for the mayor impurity of Idebenone - Impurity A - was set to 0.5%. The Applicant performed a package of qualification studies with levels of Impurity A as high as 0.68%, including an Ames test, a mouse micronucleus test and a 4-week toxicity study in rats. Taking into consideration data  from  these  studies,  where  a  increasing  level  of  Impurity  A  neither  increased  the  toxicity  nor changed the toxicity profile of idebenone, Impurity A could be qualified to a specification limit of 0.5%.

## Excipients

The excipients are well-known compounds. However, the inclusion of an azo-dye (Sunset Yellow) in a paedriatric population was considered not acceptable, as it is not desirable in formulations intended for a  paediatric  population,  because  of  its  sensitizing  potential  as  well  as  its  alleged  role  in  children developing hyperactivity symptoms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Photosafety

Idebenone does not absorb light at the wavelengths in the range of 290-700nm.  Thus, there is no need for photosafety testing with idebenone.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The Applicant performed an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for idebenone. A log Kow of &gt; 2.99 did not exclude bioaccumulation potential. However, considering the ADME profile obtained in laboratory animals and humans, bioaccumulation was considered to be unlikely.

The applicant provided acceptable published data on the prevalence of the disease Friedreich`s ataxia in Europe. Based on these data the applicant calculated the concentration in surface water (PECsw) for Sovrima resulting in a value below the trigger value of 0.01µg/l for a phase II environmental fate and effect analysis. However, according to guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, a calculation of PECsw has  to  be  based  on  a  market  share  of  100%  for  a  given  product.  Thus,  according  to  the  guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  the  calculated  value  of  PECsw  exceeds  the  trigger  for  a  Phase  II environmental fate and effect assessment. The applicant's proposal to conduct a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis for the active substance as a follow-up  measure (FUM) was considered an acceptable approach if a positive opinion was to be granted.

SD: Single-dose; O: open-label; PC: placebo-controlled; DB: double-blind.

In  addition  to  the  data  derived  from  the  NICOSIA  trial,  data  from  a  recent  open  label  study  with idebenone in FRDA patients performed in Spain (Pineda 2008) and from several published trials with idebenone  in  FRDA,  one  of  which  was  double-  blind,  placebo  controlled  (Mariotti,  2003)  were presented to support the present application of idebenone in FRDA.

At the time of the application the applicant was conducting a Phase III study in Europe (MICONOS trial), designed as a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled study investigating the effects of three dose levels of idebenone versus placebo on neurological and cardiac function for 12 months in patients  with  Friedreich's  ataxia.  The  study  planned  to  recruit  204  patients  in  Germany,  France, Belgium,  the  Netherlands  and  the  UK.  However,  the  recruitment  rate  was  slow  due  to  the  disease prevalence  in  the  Northern  European  countries,  where  the  study  was  conducted,  being  lower  than described  in  the  literature.  Additionally,  many  patients  in  Europe,  particularly  in  Southern  Europe, have  access  to  idebenone  through  government-sponsored  compassionate  use  programmes  and  are therefore not willing to join a placebo-controlled study. As of 15 th May 2008 a total of 167 patients (137  of  which  were  adults)  had  been  recruited.  The  study  was  planned  to  deliver  efficacy  data  on neurological (primary) and cardiac (secondary) endpoints in the adult population as well as safety data and, based on the current recruitment rate, the results from this trial were expected in late 2010 at the earliest.

In the US, a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled study (US IONIA study) of two doses of idebenone versus placebo in FRDA patients under 18 years of age began in late 2007. This study was requested  by  the  FDA  to  support  the  data  obtained  in  the  NICOSIA  study.  The  study  planned  to analyze the effect of idebenone on the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) as the neurological  endpoint  and  to  generate  further  data  on  neurological  and  ADL  efficacy  in  paediatric patients.  This  trial  planned  to  recruit  60  paediatric  FRDA  patients,  and  data  were  expected  to  be available by 2010.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  are  no  CHMP  guidelines  on  the  clinical  development  of  medicines  for  the  treatment  of Friedreich's Ataxia.

Regulatory advice was obtained from the Dutch and Portuguese health authorities in 2004. Protocol assistance was given by CHMP (advice finalised during the plenary meeting held on 23-26 May 2005) concerning  different  aspects  of  the  clinical  development  on  the  MICONOS  phase  III  study  with idebenone in FRDA patients with cardiomyopathy and neurological dysfunction that was ongoing at the time of the application (see above) but for which there were recruitment difficulties.

There was no paediatric development programme, but it was not required at the time of submission.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The  clinical  studies  conducted  by  Santhera  and  Takeda  were  stated  to  be  Good  Clinical  Practice principles compliant. Two Phase I studies conducted by the National Institutes of Health in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, originally not intended for regulatory use, were not fully GCP compliant.

## Pharmacokinetics

The phase I clinical pharmacology program consists of 13 studies: 4 single- and multiple-dose studies (also investigating food  effect), 4 interaction  studies  (amitriptyline,  fluvoxamine,  lithium  and donepezil), 1 hepatic and 1 renal impairment study, 1 metabolism and disposition of 14 C-idebenone and 1 single- and 1 multiple-dose study in children, adolescents and adults with FRDA. Overall, at least 120 healthy subjects, 12 subjects with renal disease, 12 subjects with hepatic impairment and 94 FRDA patients were evaluated, and a total of 239 subjects reached study completion. No population analyses were performed.

Idebenone  and  subsequent  metabolites  were  analysed  with  a  HPLC-MS/MS  method  in  plasma  and urine.  LC  and  coulometric/electrochemical  detection  were  also  used  in  some  of  the  studies.  In  PK studies in special populations total idebenone (sum of unconjugated and conjugated idebenone) was analysed but there were no data on the pharmacologically active compound - unconjugated idebenone. Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  by  using  non-compartmental  methods  and  standard statistical methods were applied.

In  the  phase  I  programme  of  the  clinical  development  the  150  mg  film-coated  tablet  intended  for marketing was used, whereas a 60 mg film-coated tablet was used in the Phase II study and in the ongoing MICONOS study. Different batches were tested in vitro and showed no differences in their in vitro dissolution characteristics. Bioequivalence between the two formulations could not be assumed based on the in vitro dissolution profiles only (due to the different qualitative and quantitative tablet composition).

## Absorption

After administration in fasting conditions, tmax of unconjugated and total idebenone was reached within a range of approximately 0.33-5 hours and 0.33-2.67 hours respectively. The absolute bioavailability of unconjugated idebenone was not determined, because no intravenous formulation was administered. The absolute bioavailability was however low, due to a high first pass effect. The absorbed amount was  however  extensive,  although  not  necessarily  in  the  form  of  unchanged  idebenone,  because  of signs  of  gut  flora  metabolism  from in  vitro studies.  No in  vitro study  was  performed  to  evaluate permeability  across  Caco-2  cells  and  to  determine  if  any  transport  protein  was  involved  in  the absorption.

After intake of high-fat food, AUC and Cmax of unconjugated idebenone were increased approximately five  to  six-fold  and  four-fold  respectively.  An  increased  exposure  was  also  seen  after  a  continental breakfast.  Administration  with  food  is  recommended  in  the  proposed  SPC  (section  4.2),  due  to  the very low absorption of unconjugated idebenone without food. The pivotal efficacy and safety study was performed in fed conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following repeated thrice daily dosing for three weeks with 750 mg (the highest dose), the mean (SD) values of Cmax and AUC0-8 were 22.4 (13.5) ng/ml and 32.2 (19.2) ng x hr/ml, respectively.

## Distribution

No  determination  of  the  volume  of  distribution  was  made  since  no  intravenous  formulation  was administered.  The  plasma  protein  binding  of  unconjugated  idebenone  ranged  from  93.0-99.7  %.  A lower protein binding was observed at the lowest concentration tested; otherwise the protein binding was independent of concentrations. It was unclear what caused the deviation in protein binding at the lowest concentration tested of 1 ng/ml. The major binding protein was albumin (approximately 75 %). No confirmation of the degree of protein binding was made in healthy subjects or in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.

## Elimination

Unconjugated  idebenone  is  metabolised  by  CYP450  enzymes  (mostly  CYP1A2,  CYP2C19  and CYP3A4) and by conjugation (glucuronidation and sulfatation). CYP450 catalyses shortening of the carbon side chain resulting in QS10, 8, 6, 4 and corresponding conjugates.

In  vivo metabolite  profiling  was  performed  up  to  168  hours.  The  major  metabolites  identified  in plasma were the sulphate conjugate of idebenone and the O-desmethylated glucuronic acid conjugate of QS-10. In urine, the major metabolites observed were the glucuronide and sulphate conjugates of QS-4.  In  faeces,  there  was  a  low  excretion  of  approximately  7  %  of  the  dose  in  humans  and  the metabolites could not be identified. The fraction of total idebenone and total QS10 excreted in urine after  oral administration was lower than or just above 1% respectively. Approximately 87 % of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and faeces. Repeated or a higher dose (up to 750 mg t.i.d.) did not seem to change significantly the metabolite profile pattern.

Since the major portion of the metabolites in plasma constitutes conjugated versions of idebenone, the risk of interactions affecting the CYP metabolism of idebenone was considered to be low.

No true clearance values were available since no intravenous formulation was administered. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 10.8 hours, ≈ 5 hours, ≈ 5 hours and 4.4 hours after single oral administration for total idebenone, total QS10, total QS6 and total QS4 respectively. No terminal halflife of unconjugated idebenone could be determined with the sampling schedule applied.

According to the applicant QS10 stands for 10-30 % of the activity of unconjugated idebenone and reassurance that the majority of the activity likely resides with unconjugated idebenone was provided. The consequences of possible genetic polymorphism were not evaluated.

## Variability

A very high variability with respect to both AUC and Cmax of unconjugated idebenone was found, with CV% up to approximately 100 %. The CV% of total idebenone was lower, approximately 40-50%. No data on intra-individual variability was presented.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

The pharmacokinetics of idebenone and its related metabolites in healthy volunteers was shown to be dose- and time-proportional for doses between 150 mg t.i.d. and 750 mg t.i.d. (study SNT-I-003). A prolonged half-life after multiple dose administration of total idebenone and total QS4 was observed, however the cause of this deviation could not be explained by an increased volume of distribution or by changes in oral clearance over time.

## Target population

Idebenone was administered on a mg/kg basis in the target population studies, and a comparison to the exposure in  healthy  volunteers  could  not  be  made  by  direct  comparison  of  the  data.  Dose  linearity could be roughly concluded up to doses of 55 mg/kg in children and adults. In adolescents, linearity was concluded up to a dose of 75 mg/kg.

A  weight-based  posology  could  not  be  supported  with  the  available  PK  data.  Since  only  data  for conjugated idebenone were available, the PK data could not be used to evaluate the impact of body weight  on  the  PK  of  unconjugated  idebenone.  It  was  highly  doubtful  if  the  PK  of  conjugated idebenone reflected  unconjugated  idebenone.  In  addition,  the  weight-based  posology  was  based  on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

very sparse data (n=14). Thus, additional PK data or efficacy data are required to clearly show that the weight-based posology is appropriate (for both groups of the weight adjusted dose).

In the ongoing MICONOS and IONIA studies limited sampling for population PK analysis is included. These samples will be  analysed  for  both  conjugated and  unconjugated  idebenone,  allowing  further exploration of the relationship between body weight and exposure because in both studies the same 45kg cut off is being used. Depending on the distribution of weights in the ongoing studies, it could be possible  in  future  to  conclude  or  exclude  a  correlation  between  body  weight  and  clearance  of unconjugated idebenone and possibly also to include a better justified weight cut-off. As a result, it was considered necessary to wait for the results of the MICONOS and IONIA studies that were still ongoing at the time of the opinion.

## Special populations

Since unconjugated idebenone was not measured, only limited conclusions on the safety of the product could be drawn from the renal and hepatic impairment studies.

In patients with severe renal impairment the total idebenone exposure (conjugated and unconjugated) increased approximately 1.5-fold. Up to 3-fold increased exposure was observed in some individuals. For total  QS10 (unconjugated and conjugated QS10) the exposure increase was approximately 1.9fold. Up to 3-fold increased exposure was observed also for QS10 in some individuals. QS4 was not measured but it was expected to increase in patients with renal impairment because approximately 50 % of the dose is excreted as QS4 in the urine.

In patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment the total idebenone exposure (conjugated and unconjugated  idebenone)  increased  approximately  2-fold.  Up  to  3-fold  increased  exposure  was observed  in  some  individuals.  For  total  QS10  (conjugated  and  unconjugated  QS10),  the  exposure increase was approximately 3-fold. Up to 6-fold increased exposure was observed for total QS10 in some individuals.

The  applicant's  proposal  to  perform  an  additional  study  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  was considered  not  meaningful,  since  satisfactory  toxicokinetic  data  for  QS4  to  compare  with  were  not available and there were very low levels of unconjugated idebenone in the urine.

Warnings in patients with renal impairment were included in the proposed SPC (section 4.4), together with a statement that QS4 is likely increased. In addition, in the event of a positive opinion, because of the unknown increase of unconjugated idebenone and the low dose applied in the hepatic impairment study,  a  contraindication  in  patients  with  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  was  to  be recommended in section 4.3 of the SPC.

The applicant was requested to discuss the influence of age, gender and race on the PK of idebenone and  related  metabolites.  Only  data  on  total  idebenone  were  provided,  which  highly  limited  the evaluation. No sufficient data were made available to evaluate the influence of age (upper age limits 71 years), although it was acknowledged that FRDA patients rarely reach these ages. Nevertheless, a statement on caution for elderly subjects treated with Sovrima was included in the proposed section 4.2.  Likewise,  it  was  not  possible  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  gender  on  PK,  since  no  data  on unconjugated  idebenone  were  available.  With  respect  to  race,  the  PK  in  non-Caucasians  was considered not relevant for the intended indication, since FRDA is a Caucasian disease.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

An in vitro inhibition study was performed in order to evaluate the inhibition potential of unconjugated idebenone on CYP1A2, 2D6, 2E1, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. A dose-dependent inhibition was found for CYP2C19 and  CYP1A2.  Additional  inhibition  studies  with  idebenone  were  performed  in  order  to evaluate the inhibition potential on CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. No significant inhibition was found. There was no information regarding the possibility of idebenone or its metabolites being a p-gp substrate and/or inhibitor. No in vitro induction studies were performed. The metabolites QS4, QS6 and QS10 (and their conjugated versions) and conjugated idebenone were not investigated with respect to CYP inhibition or induction.

Lower doses than those suggested in the actual application were used in the lithium, amitriptylin and fluvoxamine  interaction  studies.  These  three  studies  did  not  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  concomitant medication on the pharmacokinetics of idebenone and QS10 or on unconjugated idebenone. The study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with donepezil employed a higher dose of idebenone and evaluated the effect of each medication on each other's pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of lithium was not affected by idebenone. The study with amitriptylin revealed that idebenone may  affect CYP2C19 substrates to a limited extent (approximately  30  %  increased  concentrations).  No  effects  were  seen  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of donepezil.  Since  donepezil  is  metabolised  via  CYP3A4  and  to  a  smaller  extent  via  CYP2D6,  the results  were  in  agreement  with  the in  vitro findings  that  idebenone  does  not  inhibit  CYP3A4  or CYP2D6.  It  is  not  known  what  caused  the  exposure  increase  of  unconjugated  idebenone  in  the donepezil interaction study.

The  major  elimination  pathway  appeared  to  be  conjugation.  Thus,  no  further  pharmacokinetic interaction studies were requested, given that there was a low risk of a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of unconjugated idebenone by other CYP inhibitors and inducers. Also, the risk of clinically significant interactions by  idebenone  was  considered  low,  since  the therapeutic concentrations of idebenone are low in comparison to IC50 values and because of the high degree of protein binding of idebenone.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

The mechanism of action for idebenone in the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia is not known, but there is  some evidence that mitochondria respiratory chain dysfunction and oxidative damage may play a role in the mechanism behind the disease. Given that idebenone interacts with the mitochondrial ETC acting as an electron carrier and facilitating the generation of ATP (Sugiyama et al. 1985 a &amp; b), its action in Friedreich's ataxia may be relevant, since a deficiency in mitochondrial ATP production has been reported in Friedreich's ataxia patient tissue (Lodi et al. 1999).

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The indirect signs obtained from the clinical development conducted in FRDA patients did not provide additional support.  When plasma and urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OH2'dG, a byoproduct of oxidative DNA damage) were measured along a 6-month treatment with idebenone no changes occurred. Unexpectedly, patients did not show the previously reported high plasma levels of 8OH2'dG  at  baseline.  Besides,  the  reduction  in  response  to  oxidant  treatment  was  not  observed. These findings raised doubts about the claimed effect of idebenone on the oxidative stress reduction.

No specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed. Even though this issue was considered not a major objection, it was still raised as a concern during the evaluation. Due to the lack of  information  from  clinical  studies,  additional  data  were  considered  necessary  in  order  to  better characterise the primary and secondary endpoints of the product. The applicant was recommended to perform specific interaction studies to confirm that there were no pharmacodynamic interactions with commonly prescribed medicinal products (i.e. propranolol and glibenclamide) in FRDA patients. In these studies, in addition to pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic parameters such as blood pressure  and  blood  glucose  were  to  be  determined  to  exclude  PD  interactions  with  these  comedications.

Otherwise  the  potential for pharmacodynamic  interactions  appeared  to  be  limited,  given the mechanism of action of idebenone.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy documentation provided for Sovrima in Friedrich's ataxia was primarily based on two sources:

- the phase II NICOSIA study;

- results from several published studies investigating the effect of idebenone on cardiac hypertrophy and neurological function in FRDA patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dose response studies

No formal dose-response studies were performed as, according to the applicant, the Sovrima doses selected in the pivotal study were based on previous clinical experience with idebenone at the National Institute of Health and with other published clinical studies.

## Main study

The pivotal study was a phase II study (NICOSIA study) designed as a 6-month double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical study to determine the safety and efficacy of Sovrima administered to 48 patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA).

## METHODS

## Study Participants

The pivotal study was a single-site study conducted at the NINDS Neurogenetics Branch in Bethesda, USA.

The inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of FRDA with confirmed FRDA mutations, age from 9-18 years  at  baseline,  and  weight  between  30  to  80  kilograms.  The  patients  had  to  be  ambulatory (assistance  devices  permitted),  neurologically  symptomatic,  and  with  no  exposure  to  idebenone, coenzyme Q10 or other dietary supplements for a period of at least 1 month prior enrolment.

Exclusion  criteria were:  history  of  a  hypersensitivity  reaction  to  idebenone  or  coenzyme  Q10; pregnant or lactating women; platelet count, white blood cell count or hemoglobin below the lower normal  limit;  alkaline  phosphatase,  serum  glutamic-oxaloacetic  transaminase  (SGOT)  or  serum glutamic  pyruvic  transaminase  (SGPT)  greater than 1.5  ×  the  upper  normal  limit.  Bilirubin  greater than  1.5  g/dL  and  clinically  significant  medical  disease  that,  in  the  judgment  of  the  investigators, would expose the subjects  to  undue  risk  of  harm  or  prevent  them  from  completing  the  study  were other exclusion criteria.

## Treatments

A total of 48 subjects were enrolled in the study and were randomized 1:1:1:1 in 1 of the 4 treatment arms: low Sovrima dose ( ≈ 5 mg/kg), 12 subjects; intermediate/mid dose Sovrima ( ≈ 15 mg/kg), 13 subjects;  high  dose  Sovrima  ( ≈ 40  mg/kg),  12  subjects;  and  placebo,  11  subjects.  All  48  subjects received study treatment (37 subjects received Sovrima and 11 subjects received placebo).

All of the 48 subjects received at least 171 days of dosing. The median duration of treatment was 181 days for all groups except the intermediate Sovrima dose, which had a median dosing period of 182 days. The range of duration of dosing was 171 to 192 days for the combined Sovrima group and 176 to 197 for the placebo group. No subject discontinued study drug or withdrew from the study. Although all  subjects  attended  the  baseline  and  6-month  visits,  one  subject  was  unable  to  undertake  efficacy evaluations at Month 6 due to a heavy cold.

After the first visit, Sovrima (60 or 150 mg tablets) or placebo were to be administered orally t.i.d. with food continuing for 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive identical placebo tablets or one of the doses outlined in Table 2, based upon their weight. Patients were randomised into one of four treatment groups, the dose being adjusted depending on whether body weight was above or below 45kg.

Table 2. Treatment doses of Sovrima in the Nicosia trial.

| Patient Body Weight   | Sovrima Low Dose:   | Sovrima Mid Dose:   | Sovrima High Dose:   | Placebo   |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| <45 kg                | 180 mg/day          | 450 mg/day          | 1350 mg/day          | Placebo   |
| >45 kg                | 360mg/day           | 900 mg/day          | 2250 mg/day          | Placebo   |

Doses administered in three divided doses (eg, 450 mg = 150 mg t.i.d.)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the study protocol, patients were further stratified according to the length of the GAA repeat, to insure a balance between the groups in the proportion of patients with repeat lengths above 800 and below 800, respectively. There were 11 to 13 patients randomised in each of the dose arms.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  effect  of  varying  doses  of  Sovrima  on oxidative stress as reflected by the change from baseline in the level of the oxidative stress marker 8hydroxy-2' deoxyguanosine.

The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Sovrima, to explore the effects of Sovrima on neurological function, to explore the effects of Sovrima on cardiac parameters, to assess the  effects  of  SOvrima  on  patients'  quality  of  life,  to  explore  the  effects  of  Sovrima  on  functional capacity and to evaluate metabolic alterations, gene expression changes and markers of mitochondrial DNA damage.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy variable was change in plasma 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OH2'dG) level from  baseline  to  Month  6.  8OH2'dG,  a  by-product  of  oxidative  damage  to  DNA,  is  regarded  as  a marker for oxidative stress. Elevated levels of 8OH2'dG and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA, a byproduct of lipid peroxidation) have been reported in FRDA patients.

## Secondary efficacy variables:

## 1. Neurological testing

Secondary assessments were the mean changes from the beginning to the end of the 6-month trial period in the following scales:

The International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), developed by a special ad hoc Committee of  the  World  Federation  of  Neurology  as  an  instrument  which  could  be  used  in  trials  of  new therapeutic agents in patients with different types of ataxia. The scale allows a detailed neurological examination of areas relevant to ataxia and is based on 19 testing manoeuvres compartmentalised into posture and stance disorders, limb ataxia, dysarthria and oculomotor disorders. The total sum of the 19 testing items is 100 points, 0 being no impairment and 100 the highest possible degree of impairment (negative numbers indicate an improvement).

The Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) is a 25 manoeuvre exam which covers bulbar function, upper limb coordination, lower limb coordination, peripheral nervous system function, deep tendon reflexes,  stability  and  gait.  The  scale  also  includes  3  quantitative  performance  measures.  Negative numbers indicate an improvement on the FARS.

Activities of daily living (ADL ) were assessed with a questionnaire adapted for the patient population. The scale consisted of 9 items relevant to daily living function in FRDA patients. The items include speech, swallowing, cutting food and handling utensils, dressing, personal hygiene, falling, walking, quality of sitting position and bladder function. Each item was scored from 0 to 4, 0 being normal, 4 being unable to conduct the activity, whereby a negative change corresponded to an improvement on the ADL scale.

## 2. Assessment of cardiac function

The cardiac data were to be analysed in the following populations:

- The full randomised population
- Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as indicated by:

a)  Maximum LV wall thickness,  on  echocardiographic  or  MRI  assessment,  greater  than  or equal to 13 mm - or greater than the upper normal limit corrected for age and body surface area calculated using the formulae by Henry (Henry et al, 1980)

b) Patients with cardiomyopathy indicated by Relative Wall Thickness on echocardiography  of  &gt;0.42  (Plehn  J,  as  presented  at  3rd  International  Friedreich's  Ataxia Scientific Conference in Bethesda, Maryland, 2006).

Measures to be analysed included left ventricular mass (by cMRI), left ventricular mass/volume ratio, left  ventricular  mass  index  (by  cMRI),  maximal  wall  thickness  (by  cMRI),  interventricular  septal thickness (by echocardiography), relative wall thickness (by echocardiography), tissue doppler lateral E',  CSA  (critical  surface  area,  by  echocardiography),  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (by  cMRI). Other echocardiographic and cMRI measures were examined in an exploratory manner.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Quality of Life Survey (SF-10™)

A  brief  10-question  survey  was  administered  by  the  principal  or  an  associate  investigator  to  the parent(s)  or  guardian(s)  to  examine  the  subject's  health-related  quality  of  life.  This  survey  was developed as a valid health status assessment for the paediatric population (children ages 5 and over). The measure was not validated for FRDA patients and was not previously used in this population.

## 4. Other clinical assessments

## · Force Control Assessment

The force control task used in this protocol involved submaximal isometric testing of the dominant knee extensors at 25% and 50% of the maximal voluntary contraction.

## · Gait Assessment

Ataxic gait associated with cerebellar disorders is characterised by decreased gait speed, prolonged stance  phase,  and  increased  double-support  time.  Temporal  aspects  of  gait  were  measured  in  this protocol using the so called 'Stride Analyzer', which provides a measure of customary gait speed over a straight 10 m walkway. The measure was not validated for FRDA patients and was not previously used in this population.

- Aerobic Testing

Exercise testing outcome measures were 1) VO2 Peak, 2) Ventilatory Anaerobic Threshold (VAT), 3) oxygen uptake -work rate relationship (VO2-WR), and 4) Stroke Volume (SV) measured by TEB.

- Visual Motor Testing Methods

The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Trail Making Test was utilized in order to assess  visual-motor  control  through  5  separate  tests:  visual  scanning,  number  sequencing,  letter sequencing,  number-letter  switching,  and  motor  speed.  The  measure  was  not  validated  for  FRDA patients and was not previously used in this population.

## Sample size

The sample size of 48 subjects (12 per arm) was chosen as an estimate of the smallest sample set that could provide a sufficient number of completing subjects within each arm to provide 90 % power to detect  differences  in  the  specified  pattern  for  a  test  with α level  of  0.05.  Previous  available  data (Schulz et  al. ,  2000) was used as a basis for both estimated changes (an average percent decline of 20%) and variance (standard deviation of 0.18). Recruitment continued until 48 subjects were enrolled in  the  study.  To  allow  for  approximately  20%  screening  failures,  the  accrual  ceiling  was  set  at  60 subjects.

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomized (1:1:1:1 to 1 of 3 active treatment groups or placebo) by block stratification using 2 strata defined by GAA repeat length of the shorter allele (&lt;800 and &gt;800) at the beginning of Day 2, after ensuring that all study criteria had been met. Because repeat length is directly correlated with disease onset and severity, subjects were randomized so as to ensure that all arms were balanced with regard to patient phenotype.

## Blinding (masking)

The active and placebo medications were of identical appearance. Each patient was assigned a unique identification  number  and  was  randomized  to  a  treatment  group.  The  randomization  code  was  not provided  to  the  study  personnel;  sealed  individual  emergency  envelopes  were  provided  to  the investigator, who was allowed to open them only in the event of a serious adverse event in which he deemed the information necessary.

Pharmacokinetic measurements were made only at the end of the study after completion of the clinical assessments.

## Statistical methods

Analyses of the primary, secondary and other efficacy endpoints described above were to be based on all randomized subjects (intent-to-treat population [ITT]). Subjects in this population were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. No other populations were defined.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  analysis  of  the  mean  change  in  the  8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine  plasma  level  for  the evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  to  be  performed  using  an  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA) model  that  extracted  the  effects  due  to  treatment  and  the  stratification  factor  (allele  length  &lt;800, ≥ 800). For subjects who did not have month 6 values, the last available post-randomization value was to  be  used  to  calculate  change  from  baseline.  Based  on  this  ANOVA  model,  a  step-down  method, starting from the highest dose, was to be used in the treatment comparisons between active group and placebo in order to account for multiple comparisons.

If the comparison between Sovrima high dose and placebo was significant (at alpha = 0.05), then the next comparison was to be between Sovrima intermediate dose and placebo. If this comparison was significant (at alpha = 0.05), then the last comparison between Sovrima low dose and placebo was to be  performed  (at  alpha  =  0.05).  The  primary  endpoint  was  also  described  for  the  pooled  Sovrima group versus placebo. In addition, a subpopulation of mildly affected FRDA patients (as defined by an ICAR score of &gt;10 and &lt;54 at baseline) was also assessed for neurological function and activities of daily  living  parameters.  Descriptive  statistics  for  the  primary  variable  were  to  be  provided  for  the following  subgroups:  gender  and  ethnic  origin  (whites,  other  races).  For  each  subgroup,  the  95% confidence  intervals  were  to  be  provided  for  treatment  effects  (individual  Sovrima  groups  versus placebo as well as pooled Sovrima versus placebo). An exploratory analysis of the efficacy and safety endpoints  was  to  be  conducted  on  a  more  sensitive  population  that  excluded  subjects  who  had  a baseline  ICARS  score  of  more  than  54  or  less  than  10.  An  analysis  was  also  to  be  conducted  that excluded patients who had poor compliance (&lt;80% on pill count and/or diary data).

The mean change in the other efficacy endpoints from baseline to  month  6  was  to  be  analyzed using  an  ANOVA  model that  extracted  the  effects  due  to  treatment  and  stratification  factor  (allele length &lt;800, ≥ 800). Other efficacy endpoints were meant to be supportive of the primary endpoints, and hence no adjustment for multiplicity was to be made. Percent change from baseline was also to be computed and described by treatment groups for the primary, secondary and other efficacy variables. The cardiac data were to be analysed in the following populations:

-  The all randomised population;
-  Patients with Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as indicated by: ≥

- Maximum LV wall thickness, on echocardiographic or MRI assessment, to 13 mm - or greater than the upper normal limit corrected for age and body surface area calculated using the formulae by Henry (Henry et al, 1980);

- Relative Wall Thickness on echocardiography of &gt;0.42.

All variables were to be analysed as the change from baseline. No formal testing of significance was to be carried out, although p-values were to be calculated for comparisons between each dose of Sovrima and placebo as well as for pooled Sovrima groups versus placebo, in order to aid in the interpretation of any differences observed.

## Recruitment

The protocol was advertised on the NIH website and through support groups such as the Friedreich's ataxia  Research  Alliance  (FARA).  Active  recruitment  also  included  responding  to  inquiries  made during the NINDS phase 1 trials. Inquiries were responded to by a letter briefly describing the study and  requesting  genetic  confirmation  for  FRDA  and  medical  records  were  mailed  or  faxed  to  the protocol  research  contact.  Upon  receipt  of  the  records  and  genetic  confirmation,  the  subjects  were contacted to confirm the receipt of the requested information and were entered into the active protocol database. Using the active protocol database, the subjects were requested to participate in the study on a rolling basis and interested parties were scheduled for outpatient admission to the clinical centre. Subjects who signed informed consent and assent forms but who were excluded on the second day of testing  based  on  screening  laboratory  findings  were defined  as  screen  failures and  counted towards patient accrual. The subject's case report form reflected the reason(s) for exclusion and their record were maintained in the study files.

## Conduct of the study

Following informed consent and assent, the subjects underwent an initial medical history and physical exam followed by specific neurological, functional and cardiac testing over a 2-day outpatient visit. The subjects provided blood and urine samples for safety laboratory and biochemical analysis. Each eligible subject was then randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment arms and was provided with a 6-month supply of study drug or placebo to be administered t.i.d. The subjects were to have 2 scheduled visits at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Research Center (NIH CRC) at baseline and at month 6 for testing and laboratory monitoring over a 2-day outpatient visit. Follow-up laboratory monitoring was to be conducted monthly and at the end of the study (6 months). Additionally, the subjects were also to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

have  an  ECG,  vital  signs  (including  orthostatics),  a  physical  examination  and  medical  history performed after 1 and 3 months by their primary care physician. The subjects were to have monthly follow-up  telephone  contact  except  at  month  6,  when  the  follow-up  was  to  be  part  of  the  2-day outpatient visit.

## Baseline data

The basal demographic characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 3 (below).

Table 3. Basal demographics of the Nicosia study.

| Parameter:   |               | Placebo          | Low dose         | Mid Dose        | High Dose        |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Age (years)  | Mean Range    | 13.6 10.8 - 18.0 | 14.7 11.0 - 17.1 | 13.9 9.1 - 17.4 | 13.7 10.8 - 17.8 |
| Gender       | %Male %Female | 54.5 45.5        | 41.7 58.3        | 46.2 53.8       | 66.7 33.3        |
| Weight (kg ) | Mean SD       | 50.9 14.9        | 52.5 16.5        | 44.6 11.2       | 45.3 9.3         |
| Height (cm)  | Mean SD       | 158.2 12.8       | 155.3 11.2       | 151.3 14.0      | 153.9 10.2       |

The  mean  age  of  onset  of  FRDA  was  similar  for  the  low  and  high  Sovrima  dose  groups  and  the placebo group (8.0, 8.2, and 8.2 years, respectively), but slightly lower in the intermediate Sovrima dose group (6.6 years). The minimum age in the range for age of onset of FRDA was lower for the low and intermediate Sovrima dose groups (1.5 years and 1 year, respectively) than for the high dose group and placebo (4.5 and 3 years, respectively). The mean ages (±standard deviation) of FRDA diagnosis for the low, intermediate, and high Sovrima dose groups were similar at 10.3 (±1.9) years, 9.7 (±2.4) years, and 9.8 (±2.3) years, respectively.

Patients were well matched at baseline across groups for age, sex, weight and height. The expected predominance of white subjects was observed (97.3% in the combined Sovrima group and 100% in the placebo group).

A  total  of  34  of  the  48  subjects  in  the  population  of  all  randomized  subjects  had  hypertrophy  at baseline as assessed by predefined criteria of either

- a maximal left ventricular wall thickness of 13 mm or greater or
- a maximal left ventricular wall thickness greater than the upper limit of normal for maximal left ventricular wall thickness.

All patients received previously treatment for FDRA and other concomitant conditions. Antioxidant treatments for FRDA were withdrawn at least 1 month before the recruitment. A total of 38 out of 48 patients (7 in the low dose group, 11 in the mid dose group, 8 in the high dose group and 9 in the placebo group) had been treated with idebenone and/or coenzyme Q10.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy variable

Levels of the oxidative stress marker 8OH2'dG were determined using carbon column-based liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in two batches  of  samples (48 samples  collected at baseline  and  48  samples  collected  at  end  of  treatment).  The  baseline  level  of  8OH2'dG  was  in  the same range as in healthy controls, which is in contrast to a previous publication (Schulz at al. 2000). The concentration for urinary 8OH2'dG normalised to creatinine was 4.77 (placebo), 4.79 (low dose), 4.15 (mid dose) and 5.50 (high dose) ng/mg creatinine - comparable to the range of 8OH2'dG levels seen in healthy controls (3.7-4.6 ng/mg creatinine). After 6 months of treatment, the mean levels of 8OH2'dG  measured  in  the  urine  were  reduced  in  all  study  groups  (range:  -1.35  to  -2.27  ng/mg creatinine) with no statistical difference among treatment arms (Table 4).

## Secondary efficacy variable

## International Cooperative Rating Scale (ICARS)

The total range of the ICARS is 0 to 100. Patients on the low dose Sovrima improved slightly (0.26 ICARS points) while patients on placebo deteriorated slightly by 0.08 ICARS points when compared to  baseline.  Patients  treated  for  6  months  with  Sovrima  at  the  mid  and  high  dose  improved  by  ~4 points (corresponding to ≥ 10% improvement compared to baseline values) on the ICARS. The p-value for the overall ANOVA model to detect differences between treatment groups was 0.345. Using a pair wise comparison for each dose group vs. placebo indicated a trend to improvement favouring the mid (p=0.080) and high (p=0.086) doses of Sovrima versus placebo.

-4.5

The  ICARS  scores  at  baseline  were  not  identical  in  all  treatment  groups,  and  the  influence  of  the baseline ICARS as a confounding factor to the analysis was therefore tested. Only small differences in the  outcome  of  the  analysis  were  observed  when  including  baseline  scores  as  a  covariate  in  the ANOVA model, indicating that the differences observed were not related to baseline differences.

An analysis  pre-specified  in  the  statistical  analysis  plan  was  conducted  in  which  patients  with very  mild  impairment  (ICARS  baseline  score  less  than  10  points)  and  patients  with  more  severe impairment (corresponding to an ICARS baseline score of greater than 54 points) were excluded. Only one patient had a score below 10 whereas 13 patients in total had ICARS scores over 54. Using this analysis, patients on the high and mid dose of Sovrima improved by 5.8 and 4.3 points respectively on the  ICARS.  Patients  on  low  dose  Sovrima  only  slightly  improved,  by  0.48  ICARS  points,  while patients receiving placebo deteriorated by ~2 points. Pair wise comparisons to placebo showed that the effects of mid and high dose Sovrima was statistically significant with p-values of 0.009 and 0.002, respectively.  When the  mid  and  high  dose  groups  were  pooled,  there  was  a  statistically  significant improvement on the ICARS.

Thus, the results for ICARS in all patients randomised showed a trend for improvement for the mid and  high  doses  vs.  placebo,  but  the  differences  for  the  individual  doses  of  Sovrima  were  not statistically significant. There was no clear trend for dose-response between the mid and high doses. In the  Day  80AR  the  applicant  was  asked  to  clarify  what  should  be  regarded  as  a  clinically  relevant change in  ICARS for an individual  and  then  present  the  percentage  of  patients  who  fulfilled  these criteria  in  each  treatment  group.  The  applicant  performed  a  responder  analysis  where  a  clinically relevant change in the ICARS was defined as an effect with a magnitude equivalent, in absolute terms, to the natural rate of decline observed over a one year period in an untreated population. The results show a trend for an increase of responders in the mid and high dose groups of Sovrima.

## The Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS)

The main component of the FARS is a detailed neurological examination consisting of 25 manoeuvres along  with  three  quantitative  performance  measures.  The  examination  covered  the  following  areas: bulbar  function,  upper  limb  coordination,  lower  limb  coordination,  peripheral  nervous  system function, deep tendon reflexes, stability and gait (maximum deficit = 117). A reduction in the FARS score was indicative of an improved neurological performance.

A  mean  improvement  with  2.43  FARS  points  was  observed  for  the  placebo  group.  The  low  dose Sovrima  group  improved  less  than  the  placebo  group,  mean  1.83  FARS  points.  The  mid  dose improved  with  4.6  FARS  points  and  the  high  dose  5.9  FARS  point.  The  differences  did  not  reach statistical significance.

In response to the Day 120 LoQ the applicant presented the changes in the FARS subscores for the individual subjects in the NICOSIA study. There was a trend for improvement for the mid and high dose  groups  compared  to  placebo  and  low  dose  groups  with  the  exception  of  the  high  dose  bulbar score and the score for posture

## FARS functional scores

Performance measures conducted with the FARS included the following items: a timed 25-foot walk for  ambulation, a 9-hole peg board test for upper limb coordination and function and a quantitative measure of speech performance, the PATA test.

There  were  no  consistent  or  dose-dependent  differences  between  the  Sovrima  and  placebo  and  the results of the functional tests were highly variable.

## Activities of daily living

Patients  treated  for  6  months  with  Sovrima  generally  improved  on  the  ADL  scale,  with  a  stronger effect seen for the mid and high dose groups (mean improvement by 1.2 and 0.8 ADL points for the mid and high doses respectively). Patients on placebo deteriorated on the ADL scale by a mean of 1 point.  Applying  pair  wise  comparison  to  placebo  indicated  that  patients  on  the  mid  dose  improved (p=0.035) while patients on the high dose showed a trend towards improvement (p=0.083).

## Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)

The Clinical Global Impression of Change was determined using a scale based on an interview with the patients and caregiver. The level of overall change from baseline was assessed on a 7-point scale. There were no significant differences between active groups and placebo in the proportion of patients showing improvement on the CGIC. With regard to the fatigue scale, no differences between treatment groups on improvement of worsening of fatigue were observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Quality of Life

A quality of life scale (SF-10) was included in the efficacy assessments. There were no differences observed between the groups. In response to the Day 120 LoQ, the applicant has presented the results of  the  SF-10  physical  and  SF-10  psychological  subscores.  No  consistent  statistically  significant differences between placebo and the Sovrima groups were observed.

## Aerobic Exercise test

Aerobic exercise tests were conducted using a bicycle ergometer. No significant changes for any of the dose groups versus placebo were observed in exercise parameters such as peak workload and peak oxygen consumption.

## Gait assessment

There were no significant differences between the groups.

## Visual Motor Testing Methods

There were no significant differences between the groups.

## Cardiac results

Changes in cardiac anatomy and function were determined by cMRI and echocardiography.

34  of  the  48  subjects  in  the  population  of  all  randomized  subjects  had  hypertrophy  at  baseline  as assessed by predefined criteria of either

- a maximal left ventricular wall thickness of 13 mm or greater or
- a maximal left ventricular wall thickness greater than the upper limit of normal for maximal left ventricular wall thickness (as defined by Henry, 1980).

With the responses  to  the  D  120  LoQ  the  Applicant  submitted  an  Addendum  to  the  Final  Clinical Study Report of the Nicosia trial which was stated to contain a final analysis of the study data for multiple cardiac parameters derived by cMRI and echocardiography. Data were presented on changes in  left  ventricular  mass  index  (LVMI)  and  Left  Ventricular  Ejection  Fraction  (LVEF)  derived  by cMRI.  The  changes  in  LVMI  presented  in  the  D120  response  document  differed  from  the  results presented in the original application, showing a more pronounced deterioration of the placebo group (from previously 1.01 g/ m 2 to now 1.78 g/m 2 ) and more improvement in the mid dose Sovrima group (from previously -3.24 to now -4.16 g/m 2 )  when compared with the results presented in the original dossier.  With  the  revised  analysis,  the  results  for  the  mid  dose  of  Sovrima  became  statistically significant. The results for LVEF presented in the response to D120 Questions also differed markedly from the results presented in the original dossier (see Fig 4 and Fig. 5) and the effect of the mid dose of  Sovrima  shown  in  the  new  data  was  more  pronounced  and  reached  statistical  significance  vs. placebo.

According  to  the  applicant  the  data  presented  in  Fig.  5  were  derived  from  cardiac  MRI  (cMRI) whereas  the  data  presented  in  Fig.  4  were  derived  from  echocardiography.  However,  in  the  initial application (Final Clinical Study Report-Nicosia trial) the data in Fig 4 were also reported as being derived by cMRI. This issue was confusing, as was also the different numbers of patients included in the treatment groups in the initial application and in the D120 response.

The  applicant  clarified  the  analyses  of  cardiac  parameters  by  stating  that  in  the  preparation  of  the original  study  report  the  LVEF  data  derived  from  echocardiography  assessments  were  erroneously interpreted as being MRI-derived data. The applicant also clarified the different number of patients included in the treatment groups in the original submission and in the final analysis provided with the D120  response,  which  related  to  the  fact  that  the  number  of  patients  for  which  MRI  data  were available  differed  from  the  number  of  patients  for  which  echocardiography  data  were  obtained.  In addition,  Subject  001  (placebo,  no  LVEF  data  at  baseline  by  echocardiography)  was  erroneously omitted  from  the  other  cardiac  analyses  and  was  then  included  in  the  final  analysis.  It  remained, however, that the results obtained for LVEF with MRI in the final analysis differed very much from the results for LVEF obtained with echocardiography in the first analysis. The result for the mid dose of Sovrima was considerably more positive in the final MRI analysis (increase from 2.20 to 4.62), and the results for the low dose have changed from -1.74 to + 0.90 (see Fig. 1 and 2 above). The applicant did  not  provide  an  explanation  for  the  great  differences  in  results  for  LVEF  depending  on  whether echocardiographic or MRI assessments were used.

One  additional  study  by  Pineda et  al. (Eur  J  Paediatr  Neurol  2008 in  press )  was  included  in  the responses to the day 120 LoQ. This was a small open-label prospective study in 14 adults (age range 18-46 years) and 10 paediatric patients (age range 8-18 years) with genetic diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia. The duration of the study was 3-5 years. The adult patients started with Sovrima 5 mg/kg/day 1 year, then Sovrima 10 mg/kg/day for 1 year, and 20 mg/kg/day in the last year. The paediatric group started with 5 mg/kg/day of Sovrima for 18 months, then 10 mg/kg/day during the last 3 years and 6 months of study. Neurological evaluation was performed with ICARS, a score with a range from 0 to 100. Cardiological outcomes were studied by echocardiography once per year.

The results for ICARS for the adult population revealed a progression of the disease with increasing ICARS  scores  (indicating  worsening  of  the  disease)  for  all  patients  despite  continuous  Sovrima treatment (Figure 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fig. 6. Effect of long-term Sovrima treatment on the ICARS of adult FRDA patients.

<!-- image -->

The  figure  above  shows  a  progression  of  the  disease  with  increasing  ICARS  scores,  indicating worsening  of  the  disease,  for  all  patients  despite  continuous  Sovrima  treatment.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SP, PW and LVMI values) was not modified during the follow-up of adult cases (8 cases  presented  cardiomyopathy at the beginning and the end of the study, while the other 6 cases remained within the reference range).

In the paediatric population there was an initial improvement (reduction of ICARS scores), followed by an apparent stabilization and thereafter a continuous progression, as shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Effect of long-term Sorima treatment on the ICARS of paediatric FRDA patients.

<!-- image -->

In  paediatric  patients  no  significant  differences  were  observed  in  any  of  the  echocardiographic measurements  when  comparing  baseline  conditions  and  the  end  of  the  study.  These  results  were considered of interest but not convincing with regard to the efficacy of Sovrima in FRDA.

Overall, no clear effect has been observed in this study, where heart function was within normal or almost  normal  range.  This  is  seen  by  the  authors  as  a  signal  of  prevention  of  cardiomyopathy progression in this  population.  Nevertheless,  the  percentage  of  patients  who  would  have  developed cardiomyopathy  if  they  had  not  been  treated  is  unknown  and,  therefore,  if  the  progression  of  the disease  is  or  not  prevented  is  uncertain.  The  low  number  of  patients,  the  unpredictable  risk  of developing  a  cardiomyopathy  and  the  lack  of  a  control  untreated  group  did  not  allow  any  firm conclusions.

## Supportive study(ies)

9 published studies investigating the effect of idebenone (5 mg/kg/day, equivalent to the low dose of the pivotal study) on cardiac hypertrophy and neurological function in FRDA patients were provided by  the  applicant  as  supportive  studies.  One  of  these  was  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial (Mariotti, 2003).

## 1. Effect of idebenone on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

## Rustin 1999, 2004

Three patients (age 11, 19 and 21 years) with Friedreich's ataxia were treated openly with idebenone 5 mg/kg for 4-9 months. Evaluation of LVMI showed a reduction between 21 and 32 % after treatment. For  one  of  these  patients  a  further  decrease  of  heart  hypertrophy  at  follow-up  after  5  years  of idebenone administration (5 mg/kg bw) was reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Schulz et al. 2000

This study measured concentration of 8OH2'dG, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, and DHBA, a marker  of  hydroxyl  radical  attack,  in  the  plasma  of  33  patients  with  FRDA.  However,  no  clinical evaluation of the patients was performed in this study.

## Schöls 2001

This  was  a  placebo-controlled  crossover  trial  in  nine  ambulant  patients  with  FRDA,  performed  in order  to  investigate  the  effect  of  idebenone  on  respiratory  function  using 31 P-  magnetic  resonance spectroscopy  ( 31 P-MRS). The prolonged phosphocreatine recovery after exercise was analyzed as a direct measure of oxidative phosphorylation. The nine FRDA patients (five female, four male) had a mean age of 34 ± 11 years (range 19-54 years) and onset of symptoms varied from 12 to 36 years of age. Idebenone was given at a dosage of 360 mg/d. The duration was 6 weeks. Neurological deficits were assessed using the ICAR scale (the same scale that was used in the NICOSIA study). In addition, complex hand movements  were  analysed. Cardiologic monitoring included 12-channel  ECG recordings, echocardiographic evaluation of the left ventricle and heart muscle enzymes.

( 31 P-MRS) demonstrated mitochondrial impairment in vivo in  skeletal  muscle of all FRDA patients, but no recovery with idebenone. No effects were seen in clinical scores. Echocardiography showed no improvement of cardiomyopathy.

## Artuch, 2002

This was an open-label trial performed in nine FRDA patients (age range 11-19 years) treated with idebenone 5 mg/kg/day. Patients were evaluated before the start of the study and throughout one year of treatment by ICARS scores, neurophysiological measurements and echocardiographic measurements.

Significant reduction was observed comparing the ICARS scores prior and after 3, 6 and 12 months of therapy.  No  differences  were  observed  in  echocardiographic  measurements  and  neurophysiological investigations prior and 12 months after the start of the therapy.

## Hausse et al. 2002

This was a prospective, open trial in 38 patients with FRDA aged 4-22 years (20 males, 18 females). Asymmetrical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was observed in 10 patients and concentric hypertrophy in the others. No patient had dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients were given idebenone 5 mg/kg/day for 6 months. Cardiac ultrasound indices were recorded immediately before and after six months of oral idebenone. Shortening fraction, septal thickness and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were measured. After six months of idebenone treatment, a reduction in left ventricular mass of more than 20 % was observed in half of the patients. Cardiac hypertrophy stabilised in most of the remaining patients. The change in left ventricular mass index was not correlated with the number of GGA repeats of the small allele in the frataxin gene, or the stage of cardiac disease based on the initial ultrasound findings.

## Mariotti et al. 2003

This was a 1-year randomised placebo-controlled trial of idebenone in 29 FRDA patients (6 women and 23 men). The mean age at enrolment was 26 years. 29 patients were randomised to placebo (15 patients) or idebenone (14 patients). The mean daily dose of idebenone was 324 mg (range 240-250 mg). Heart ultrasound variables were measured and neurological assessment was performed using the ICARS. After 6 months of treatment, an average reduction of 4.3 % was observed in the IVS in the idebenone group versus a 3.2 % mean increase in the placebo group (p=0.05). At 12 months, IVS thickness showed a 4.6 % reduction the idebenone group vs. a 5.5 % increase in the placebo group (p=0.004). Statistically significant reductions were also found for LVM,  but  there was no improvement  in  other  ultrasound  measures  (left  ventricular  posterior  wall  thickness,  or  ejection fraction). The analysis of the ICARS total scores and sub scores did not reveal significant differences between the two patient groups.

## Buyse et al, 2003

The authors reported a  1-year  prospective open-label  trial  with  idebenone  on  eight  FRDA  patients, aged between 8.6 and 27.1 years and with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  All patients received oral idebenone  5  mg/kg  in  three  doses,  maximum  300  mg/day  for  1  year.  Patients  were  evaluated  at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline and at 4, 8 and 12 months of treatment for ataxia, cardiac structure and function, biochemical markers and adverse effects.

The Cooperative Ataxia Group Raring Scale for Drug Trial for FRDA was used to assess neurological evolution  at  baseline  and  during  therapy.  The  results  of  the  neurological  evaluation  showed  a progressive  increase  in  total  ataxia  scores  despite  idebenone  use.  Cardiac  evaluation  showed  a reduction of Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) from 130 27 to 109 28 g/cm, p=0.03. These changes were not linear over time, appearing only toward the end of therapy. For the interventricular septum and the posterior wall there was a non-significant reduction after therapy.

## Arnold et al. 2006

In  this  open-label  study,  clinical,  electrophysiological  and  biochemical  data  were  provided  from  20 genetically confirmed FRDA patients. Neurological function and ataxia were investigated with ICARS after  treatment  with  idebenone  5  mg/kg/day.  15  of  19  treated  patients  reported  improvement  on idebenone  treatment  in  terms  of  dysarthria, hand  dexterity or handwriting  and  fatigue.  This improvement appeared gradually on treatment (within 6 weeks in 3 patients and within 6 months in the other 12). Follow-up (1.6 - 3.5 years, mean 2.9) with ICARS was available for 10 patients. The mean score did not change during follow-up. Analysis of a biomarker for oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA), showed an unexpected increase in blood MDA levels in patients on idebenone.

## Ribat et al. 2007

This was an open-label prospective study where 104 FRDA patients were examined every 6 months during  a  median  period  of  5  years.  Neurological  status  was  evaluated  with  the  ICARS  and  a quantitative  writing  test.  Cardiological  evaluation  included  echocardiography,  electrocardiography, and Holter monitoring. 88 of the patients accepted treatment with idebenone 5 mg/kg/day whereas 16 preferred  not  to  be  treated.  The  total  ICARS  score  worsened  during  follow-up,  whether  or  not  the patients  were  treated  with  idebenone  (1.93  ±  0.25  and  4.43  ±  1.56  points  per  year,  respectively). Neurological  progression  was  underestimated  by  the  ICARS  scores,  which  reached  a  plateau  in patients  with  long  disease  durations.  Cardiac  hypertrophy  decreased  under  treatment  but  cardiac function did not improve.

## 2. Effect of idebenone on neurological symptoms

The studies by Buyse et al. (2003) and Mariotti et al. (2003) discussed above did not show any effect on neurological symptoms. In the study by Artuch (2002), also briefly described above, a significant reduction was observed comparing the ICARS scores prior and after 3, 6 and 12 months of therapy with idebenone 5 mg/kg/day. In the study by Arnold et al. (2006) improvement was observed on some parts of the ICARS, whereas the study by Ribai et al. (2007) did not show any effect idebenone on neurological progression.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

In conclusion, the applicant submitted a single single-site phase II study in patients with Friedreich's ataxia.  The  mid  and  high  doses  of  Sovrima  that  were  used  in  this  trial  were  higher  than  the  doses previously used in published studies. The number of patients was limited, only 48.

No effect was seen on the primary endpoint, change in a surrogate marker for oxidative stress from baseline to month 6. The analyses of 8OH2'dG showed in fact similar results in all groups including the  placebo  group.  These  findings  were  not  in  agreement  with  the  hypothesis  that  treatment  with Sovrima decreases the levels of 8OH2'dG, a proposed surrogate marker for oxidative stress. Overall, the average 8OH2'dG level of FRDA patients was in the range of healthy controls and not abnormally high as previously reported. Differences in patients' age (patients were younger in the current study) and  technical  sampling  handling  were  proposed  as  possible  causes  of  this  unexpected  behaviour. Looking at the primary outcome results, the lack of an 8OH2'dG cut-off value at inclusion could be considered a drawback of the study. However, the role of 8OH2'dG levels in FRDA patients was still unclear and it was doubtful whether this biomarker could be considered as a valid surrogate endpoint of this disease.

Secondary  endpoints  included  clinical  scales  for  assessment  of  ataxia  (ICARS,  FARS),  ADL,  and parameters for evaluation of cardiac hypertrophy. The effect on the secondary endpoints ICARS and FARS was more pronounced for the mid and high doses of Sovrima than for the low dose, but the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

differences did not reach statistical significance, and no clear dose-response was shown between the mid and high doses. In response to the Day 120 List of Questions, the applicant presented a responder analysis where a clinically relevant change in the ICARS was defined as an effect with a magnitude equivalent,  in  absolute  terms,  to  the  natural  rate  of  decline  observed  over  a  one  year  period  in  an untreated  population.  The  results  of  the  responder  analysis  showed  a  trend  for  an  increase  of responders in the mid and high dose groups of Sovrima. There were no statistically significant effects of Sovrima on Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), a Quality of Life scale (SF-10), Gait Assessment, Visual Motor Testing methods, or Aerobic Exercise test.

For the cardiac parameters, the applicant submitted a revised analysis with the responses to the Day 120 List of Questions. In the initial application, there was a trend to improvement for a measure of cardiac hypertrophy, the Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI), in the two highest dose groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the revised analysis, the mid dose of Sovrima resulted in a statistically significant improvement of LVMI as well as in a statistically significant improvement of a cardiac functional outcome parameter, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). An unresolved issue remained as the applicant did not provide an explanation for the great differences in results for LVEF depending on whether echocardiographic or MRI assessments were used.

From  the  efficacy  point  of  view,  it  would  be  expected  that  neurological  and  cardiac  endpoints provided  clinically  meaningful  information.  Given  that  Freidreich's  Ataxia  is  an  inherited  and progressive neurodegenerative condition, a large clinical effect of idebenone was not expected in the short term. However, it was considered necessary to show at least a delay in the progression of the disease for any potential treatment] In conclusion, although the submitted data for the mid and high doses  of  Sorima  potentially  suggested  a  modest  beneficial  effect  of  Sovrima  on  neurological  and cardiac symptoms in FRDA, the submitted efficacy documentation was not considered sufficient for an approval of Sovrima for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia. In addition, the effect of Sovrima in adult patients with Friedreich's Ataxia could not be considered demonstrated with the data provided. It was concluded that the results of the Nicosia trial needed to be confirmed with results from a large randomised trial. Overall, it was deemed necessary to wait for the results of the two ongoing phase III (EU MICONOS and US IONIA) trials, which were expected to be available by 2010.

An  additional  concern  remained  in  that  the  PK  data  provided  were  very  sparse  and  unconjugated idebenone was not measured; overall, the PK data provided did not support a weight-based posology. The applicant was requested to provide additional PK data on unconjugated idebenone or clinical data in support of the weight-based posology, showing effect in patients weighing above and below 45 kg, respectively. The applicant's approach to perform sparse sampling for population PK analysis in the ongoing MICONOS and IONIA studies was welcomed. Depending on the nature of the data (e.g. a satisfactory range of distribution of weights) there may be a possibility to either exclude or conclude a correlation  between  body  weight  and  clearance  of  unconjugated  idebenone  and  possibly  also  to include a better justified weight based posology and cut-off. Thus, also for this reason the results of the MICONOS and IONIA studies were deemed necessary.

## Clinical safety

The  Applicant  put  together  a  pooled  safety  database  of  the  six  phase  III  studies  from  the  clinical development for Alzheimer's disease.

Evaluation of idebenone in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) began in the late 1990s.

The following four sets of clinical data were available to assess the safety of idebenone:

- The NIH / Santhera pivotal Phase II (NICOSIA) study in Friedreich's ataxia;
- The Takeda safety data from Phase III studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD);
- The four Santhera Phase I studies in healthy volunteers;
- The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Phase I studies in Friedreich's ataxia patients.

Patient exposure Friedreich's ataxia studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data were available on 142 patients with Friedreich's ataxia who participated in the Phase I/II studies. Of these, 78 patients received single ascending doses of idebenone 2.5 mg/kg up to 75 mg/kg, and 15 patients received 60mg/kg/day for 30 days.

In the NICOSIA study, 48 patients received higher doses of Sovrima, ranging from 180 or 360 mg/day to 1350 or 2250 mg/day, depending on body weight, for 6 months. This equates to a dose range from approximately 4 mg/kg/day up to approximately 50 mg/kg/day.

An overview of the clinical studies in FRDA patients evaluated for safety is shown in Table 6.

R: randomised; DB: double-blind; PC: placebo-controlled; PG: parallel group.

All patients who received study medication were included in the analysis of safety. A pooled database of  the  six  Phase  III  Takeda  studies  from  an  earlier  stage  of  clinical  development  for  Alzheimer's disease was created and evaluated. Data were pooled as six different treatment groups, i.e. placebo, three doses of idebenone, placebo + donepezil and idebenone + donepezil.

Patients were well matched at baseline across groups for age (mean, median and range), sex, weight and race. In all treatment groups, approximately 80% of patients were aged above 70 years and there were more females than males (the greatest proportion of females being in the idebenone 240 mg t.i.d. group).  Mean,  median  and  age  ranges  were  similar,  although  the  range  was  slightly  wider  in  the idebenone 360 mg t.i.d. treatment group. In all treatment groups, approximately 90% of patients were Caucasian.

Overall, 2048 patients were exposed to idebenone in these studies for periods of up to a maximum of 2 years.  In  all  treatment  groups,  the  majority  of  patients  received  study  medication  for  &gt;  6  months, although from 7 to 12 months the percentage of patients remaining on idebenone 360 mg t.i.d. was less than  in  the  other  monotherapy  groups.  For  patients  receiving  donepezil  with  either  placebo  or idebenone 360 mg t.i.d., exposure was similar in both treatment groups over the duration of studies PNFP 007 and PNFP 008.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The doses used in the AD trials were 360 to 1080 mg/day. Only the highest dose for AD was similar to the doses planned to be used for the FRDA indication patients (&gt; 45 kg b.w.). Thus, the Alzheimer studies did not evaluate the maximum dose proposed in this application. The Alzheimer studies also involved a different age group; as a result, the safety data derived from these studies were considered of limited use.

## Adverse events

## Friedreich's ataxia studies

Data are presented separately for each of the Friedreich's ataxia studies since the study designs and dosages differed. In the NIH Phase I studies, adverse events were generally recorded only if they were considered to be possibly related to the study medication. Averse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 9.1, and toxicities were graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC).

## - NIH study 01-N-0167

In  this  single-dose  study  all  cohorts  completed dose-escalation  to the  maximum  dose  level  allowed under the protocol (75 mg/kg) with no dose-limiting toxicity observed.  Five AEs were reported in four  of  the  children,  and  three  of  the  five  were  in  the  highest  dose  group  (75  mg/kg).  Three  AEs occurred  in  two  of  the  adolescent  patients,  all  receiving  the  75  mg/kg  dose.  Fourteen  AEs  were reported in nine adult patients. Nausea was the most commonly reported AE in adults, occurring in seven  patients,  although  only  one  was  in  the  two  highest  doses.  No  adults  in  the  two  lowest  dose groups experienced adverse events.

All the AEs were mild (NCI-CTC Grade 1), except one transient episode of hyperglycaemia reported as  Grade  3.  This  occurred  at  the  5  mg/kg  dose  level  in  a  diabetic  patient  with  a  history  of  poor glycaemic control and was deemed not related to study medication.

## - NIH study 04-N-0129

In this study patients in all age groups received a daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day for 1 month. Fourteen of the fifteen patients completed the study. One child experienced Grade 1 nausea and diarrhoea on Day 2.  Idebenone  was  stopped,  the  patient  was  re-challenged  and  the  symptoms  recurred,  leading  to withdrawal from the study. The four other children and the five adults completed the study without experiencing any AEs. Mild dyspepsia occurred in one adolescent, but it resolved and did not recur.

## - NICOSIA study

A total of 260 adverse events were reported in the study, of which 82 were reported on the low dose, 72 on the middle dose, 48 on the high dose and 58 on placebo. Adverse events generally occurred at similar  frequency  with  active  medication  and  placebo.  All  reported  adverse  events  were  mild  or moderate in severity, with the exception of two classified as serious adverse events as it is described in the ' Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events ' section.

The most common adverse events associated with Sovrima were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and dyspepsia), although there did not appear to be a clear relationship between the Sovrima dose and the overall incidence of adverse events. The reported adverse events were mild or moderate,  and  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  of  study  medication,  except  for  two  adverse  events (chest pain on placebo, nausea and vomiting 3 weeks after the end of treatment) which were classed as serious  as  they  resulted  in  hospitalisation  (please  see  section  ' Serious  adverse  event/deaths/other significant events ').

In the NICOSIA study there was no relation between AEs and dose and Sovrima appeared to have a good safety profile. The maximum doses employed in the NICOSIA study were lower than in Study 01-N-0167 (50 mg/kg/day vs 75 mg/kg/day), where most AEs were seen in the 75 mg/kg/day group.

## Alzheimer's disease studies

The number of patients with any adverse events was similar in all treatment groups, being 76% to 80% in all except the group receiving the lowest dose of idebenone (120 mg t.i.d.) where it was slightly higher  at  86%.  The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events,  severe  adverse  events  and  adverse  events leading  to  withdrawal  was  similar  in  all  treatment  groups,  including  placebo.  No  clear  dose relationship  could  be  observed  and  there  appeared  to  be  no  difference  between  monotherapy  or combination therapy.

The most common adverse events overall were psychiatric disorders, which occurred with a higher frequency  in  the  idebenone  groups  than  in  the  placebo  groups.  The  percentage  of  patients  with psychiatric disorders were 10.2 % in the placebo group compared with 15.2 %, 18.1 % and 15.0 % in the  idebenone  groups  360  mg/day,  720  mg/day  and  1080  mg/day,  respectively.  Agitation  and confusion were most common among the psychiatric disorders.

The  other  most  common  adverse  events  were  gastrointestinal  disorders,  especially  diarrhoea  and accidental  injury.  Several  of  these  events  occurred  more  frequently  on  active  than  on  placebo treatment, especially  the  followings: diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  upper respiratory tract infections and somnolence. There was, however, no clear dose relationship apparent for any of these events.

Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the safety population for each treatment group.

* Specific data on deaths were not collected on the Case Record Form (CRF) or included in the study databases, but are available from patient narratives in the individual study reports.

The safety profile of idebenone as demonstrated by the number of patients with adverse events, was comparable to placebo (or comparable to placebo added to donepezil 10 mg qd in studies PNFP-007 and -008]. Many of the most common adverse events were known to be commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease (psychiatric disorders: agitation/depression/confusion) or related to the advanced age  of  these  patients  (urinary  tract  infection/incontinence;  cardiovascular  disorders:  hypertension). However, the gastro-intestinal disorders, especially diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were less likely to be age- or disease- dependent.

The most common adverse events (i.e. those which occurred in ≥ 5 % of patients in any one treatment group) and reported as being related to study medication are presented in Table 15, by descending frequency within body system.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Phase I/II studies in Friedreich's ataxia

There were no deaths in any of the three Friedreich's ataxia studies. No serious adverse events were reported  in  the  NIH  Phase  I  studies.  In  the  NICOSIA  study,  two  adverse  events  were  classified  as serious since they led to hospitalisation. One  patient receiving placebo, with a history of cardiomyopathy,  was  hospitalised  for  investigation  of  chest  pain.  Investigations  were  negative, including  an  ECG recorded  during  the  pain  episode.  Another  patient  receiving  low-dose  idebenone was hospitalised due to nausea and vomiting for one day, 3 weeks after completing the study. The symptoms had occurred intermittently both before and during the  study.  The  event  was  considered unrelated to study medication.

## Phase III studies in Alzheimer's disease

Nineteen deaths occurred in this elderly population while on study medication or within 14 days of last dose. With one exception (in study PNFP-008, ventricular dysrhythmia in an 89-year-old was reported as possibly related according to the investigator, and assessed as not related according to the sponsor) none of the deaths were deemed by the investigators to be related to study medication.

Serious  adverse  events  occurred  most  frequently  in  the  respiratory,  gastrointestinal  and  psychiatric body  systems.  The  most  common  individual  serious  adverse  events,  although  infrequent,  were accidental injury (range 0.5% with idebenone 360 mg t.i.d. + donepezil to 2.3% with idebenone 120 mg t.i.d.; 1.9% with placebo) and agitation, where the highest incidence (1.7%) occurred with placebo treatment. The incidence of all other severe individual events was less than 1.0%, with the exception of myocardial infarction in the idebenone 120 mg t.i.d. group, which was slightly higher (1.4%). Most serious adverse events were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to study drug. The number of patients with any serious adverse events was similar across all treatment groups, including placebo. There was no trend for dose-related increase. Severe gastrointestinal adverse events were relatively uncommon (range 0.7 % with placebo + donepezil to 2.3 % with idebenone 120 mg t.i.d.), with no individual event being severe in more than 0.9% of cases.

The most common adverse events overall leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders (e.g. agitation,  confusion  and  somnolence),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (e.g.  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain, nausea  and  dyspepsia)  fatigue,  dizziness,  accidental  injury,  rash  and  cerebrovascular  disorder.  The incidence of these adverse events was relatively evenly distributed between the placebo group and the active groups with no clear dose-response.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematological findings

In the NIH Phase I Friedreich's ataxia studies, there were no significant changes in the haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. In the NICOSIA study, low white cell counts were no more common with active medication compared with placebo. However, one child in the NICOSIA study (receiving high-dose Sovrima) was noted to have a low white cell count (2.2 x 10 9 /L) at the final (month 6) visit. Sovrima was withdrawn according to plan, this being the final scheduled visit. Redraw on the same day showed a value of 2.7, while the following day the value was 2.0 x 10 9 /L. Five days later the value had risen to 3.8 x 10 9 /L. No other explanation for the observed leucopenia was found by either the investigator or the consulting haematologist, and the relationship to study medication was considered probable by the investigator .

In the WHO International Drug Monitoring Database, there were one report of aplastic anaemia and one  report  of  agranulocytosis.  Both  reports  were  confounded  by  comedications  and  this  made  it difficult to determine the possible role of idebenone.

## Hepatobiliary findings

No hepatobiliary  disorders  were reported  during  the  NIH  Friedreich's  ataxia  studies.  In  the  Takeda drug interaction study PNFP-003, one subject discontinued due to significantly elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) starting on Day 6, in Phase I of the study. These were recorded during per-protocol laboratory sampling and were not reported as adverse events. Abnormal values returned to within normal limits by the end of the study, with the exception of a clinically non-significant elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 285 u/L) at the final visit. Clinically significant elevated liver enzymes returned to baseline values within 4 weeks.

## Safety in special populations

Renal  impairment: A  study  in  patients  with  severely  impaired  renal  function  was  performed  by Takeda. In these patients plasma exposure of total idebenone and QS10 increased 1.5-fold and 2-fold respectively,  however larger  increases  were  also  observed.  One  patient  had  a  serious  adverse  event (cerebral  haemorrhage  occurring  16  days  after  dosing),  which  was  considered  unrelated  to  study medication. No firm safety conclusion could be drawn from this single dose study on 120 mg and no multiple dose study was made available.

Hepatic impairment: An hepatic impairment study was performed by Takeda. One death, which was considered unrelated to study medication, occurred in a patient after surgery related to an episode of pancreatitis. In patients with impaired hepatic function (liver cirrhosis), there was no information on the increased exposure of the pharmacologically active compound (unconjugated idebenone). Given these uncertainties, a contraindication in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment was considered necessary.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

In  healthy  volunteers,  no  significant  interactions  between  idebenone  and  lithium,  amitriptyline, fluvoxamine or donepezil were observed. No other drug-drug interaction studies with idebenone were performed and no case reports of drug interactions were provided.

## Post marketing experience

## Haematological events

Postmarketing,  there  were  23  patients  listed  with  blood  cell  abnormalities.  Among  these  were  20 events (in 17 patients) involving reduced cell counts, as follows:

- Agranulocytosis: five events
- Aplastic anaemia: one event, which ended fatally
- Granulocytopenia: three events
- Leukopenia: four events
- Thrombocytopenia: four events.
- Red blood cell count reduced: three events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatobiliary events

Postmarketing, hepatic laboratory abnormalities were reported as serious in nine patients.

## Discussion on clinical safety

In  conclusion,  the  submitted  safety  documentation  comprised  data  from  the  trials  for  Friedreich's ataxia, the trials in the program for Alzheimer's disease in US, and postmarketing experience. For the applied indication higher doses of idebenone (450-2250 mg/day) were recommended than those used previously, and the documentation for these high doses was limited. In the NICOSIA study on FRDA patients the most common adverse events associated with idebenone were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea,  nausea  and  vomiting).  There  was  no  clear  relation  between  the  dose  and  the  overall incidence of adverse events. One child in the NICOSIA study (receiving high-dose idebenone) was reported to have a low white cell count (2.2 x 10 9 /L) probably related to idebenone.

The experience from the Alzheimer trials was considered to be of limited value since the doses were in general lower, and the AD patients were older and had more concomitant medications. The highest dose group in the Alzheimer trials was 1080 mg/day and with this dose the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), somnolence, anxiety and rash.

There is a vast post-marketing experience with idebenone, particularly in Japan, which includes rare reports on serious blood adverse drug reactions and reports on serious hepatic laboratory abnormalities. However, the doses used for treatment of cerebrovascular disease were low, only 90 mg/day.  The  proposed  dose  recommendation  for  FRDA  in  the  present  application  is  much  higher, from 900 mg to 2250 mg/day for patients weighing over 45 kg. As a result, the value of the postmarketing data for the safety assessment in the new indication was considered very limited.

## Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  consider  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time.

## Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way and there are no major unresolved quality issues which could have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance.,The inclusion of the azo-dye in the tablets composition remained an unresolved issue at the time of the opinion that could be solved post-authorisation in the event of a positive opinion.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

From the pre-clinical data provided, it appeared that idebenone is without any major adverse effect and is of low oral acute toxicity in animals. The only adverse effects observed were in the forestomach of mice and rats. The forestomach is a rodent-specific organ and the finding is considered to be of low clinical relevance. Idebenone is extensively metabolized, resulting in numerous metabolites which are found in plasma in significantly higher concentrations than parent idebenone. It is not known to what

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

extent the metabolites contribute to the observed pharmacodynamic effects and the toxicity. However, in  view  of  the  low  observed  toxicity  it  was  considered  that  these  uncertainties  were  acceptable especially  in  relation  to  the  intended  indication.  The  applicant  was  requested  to  conduct  a  Phase  II environmental fate and effect analysis according to guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.

## Efficacy

The Applicant submitted the results of one 6-month phase II study in patients with Friedreich's ataxia with Sovrima doses higher than those previously used in published studies. The number of patients in the  study  was  limited  (n=  48).  No  effect  was  seen  on  the  primary  endpoint:  change  in  a  proposed surrogate  marker  for  oxidative  stress  from  baseline  to  month  6.  For  the  secondary  endpoints neurological assessment with the ICARS and FARS scales, there were trends for a more favourable outcome with the mid and high doses of Sovrima but the differences vs. placebo were not statistically significant. For measures of cardiac hypertrophy, the Applicant has submitted a revised analysis in the Day120 response document. The final analysis shows a statistically significant effect of the mid dose of  Sovrima  on  a  measure  of  cardiac  hypertrophy,  LVMI,  and  on  a  cardiac  functional  outcome parameter, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). With the responses to the Day150 LoOI, the Applicant has provided some additional support for the claimed indication in terms of published data. Furthermore, the Applicant has informed the CHMP of two on-going phase III trials; the MICONOS study and the IONIA study.

Currently there is neither sufficient PK nor efficacy data to support the weight-based posology. The current PK data does not support a weight based posology. Sampling for population PK analysis is performed in the ongoing studies MICONOS and IONIA. Depending on the distribution of weights in the ongoing studies, it may be possible in future to conclude or exclude a correlation between body weight and clearance of unconjugated idebenone and possibly also to include a better justified weight cut-off.

To conclude, the efficacy documentation for Sovrima in the treatment of FRDA is primarily based on one pivotal 6-month phase II study which included 48 patients. There was no effect on the primary efficacy  endpoint  (the  change  from  baseline  to  month  6  in  the  plasma  level  of  8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8OH2'dG), a surrogate marker for oxidative stress). A trend for positive effects of the mid and high doses of Sovrima was observed on scales for neurological assessment included as secondary efficacy endpoints. With regard to cardiac parameters, there was a statistically significant effect  of  the  mid  dose  of  Sovrima  on  measures  of  cardiac  hypertrophy  and  cardiac  function  in  the Applicant's  revised  analysis.  For  other  secondary  parameters,  including  SF-10  and  Clinical  Global Impression of Change, there were no statistically significant effects. Therefore the CHMP considered that efficacy of Sovrima for the treatment of FRDA has not been convincingly demonstrated. Even if the submitted data suggest that there might be a modest beneficial effect of the mid and high doses of Sovrima  on  neurological  and  cardiac  symptoms  in  FRDA,  the  results  need  to  be  confirmed  for  a sufficient number of patients. The results of the ongoing phase III trials MICONOS and IONIA should be awaited.

The CHMP considered the possibility of approving the product under 'Exceptional Circumstances'; however, this is not applicable given that phase III studies are currently recruiting and  their  results  will  give  additional  information  on  the  efficacy  of  the  compound.  Likewise, 'Conditional approval', with ongoing studies being part of the conditions, was also considered not applicable. Such approval requires that a positive B/R is established which cannot be said in this case given the limited and inconclusive efficacy documentation.

## Safety

The overall possibility to assess the pharmacokinetics in patients with renal and hepatic impairment is hampered  by  the  fact  that  there  are  no  data  on  unconjugated  idebenone.  However,  given  the applicant's suggestion to contraindicate the product in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and the fact that the renal excretion of unconjugated idebenone is very low, a recommendation of caution in the product information was considered to be sufficient in case a positive opinion was to be granted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant has conducted no non-clinical or clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies. In order  to  conclude  that  there  are  no  pharmacodynamic  interactions  with  commonly  co-prescribed medicinal  products  in  patients  with  FRDA  it  was  considered  necessary  to  perform  the  proposed interaction  studies  (propranolol  and  glibenclamide).  Otherwise  the  potential  for  pharmacodynamic interactions seem limited, given the mechanism of action of idebenone.

The safety documentation in the clinical studies includes data from the trials for Friedreich's ataxia, the trials in the program for Alzheimer's disease in US, and postmarketing experience. For the applied indication higher doses of idebenone (450-2250 mg/day) are recommended than the doses previously used.  The  experience  from  the  Alzheimer  trials  is  of  limited  value  since  the  doses  were  in  general lower, and the AD patients are older and have more concomitant medications. The highest dose group was  1080  mg/day  and  with  this  dose,  the  most  common  adverse  events  were  gastrointestinal  side effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), somnolence, anxiety, and rash. There is a considerable postmarketing experience with idebenone, but again the value of this experience is limited since in general low doses have been administered.

The  post-marketing  experience  with  idebenone  includes  rare  reports  of  serious  blood  adverse  drug reactions, and reports on serious hepatic laboratory abnormalities. During the procedure, the Applicant submitted  a  Risk  Management  Plan  that  does  not  fulfil  the  CHMP  requirements.  The  plans  for additional pharmacovigilance activities, extended follow-up and an observational multicentre cohort study would have been endorsed if the efficacy of Sovrima was convincingly demonstrated. However, the Applicant should describe the design, implementation and feasibility of the respective pharmacovigilance studies in adequate detail. More elaborate protocols should therefore be submitted in a revised RMP that should also include a summary of the proposed EU RMP revised in accordance with the template EMEA/192632/2006.

## Risk-benefit assessment

In conclusion, the CHMP considered that, following review of the data provided, there are concerns with respect to the risk-benefit of Sovrima for use in the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in paediatric and young adult patients, or in adult patients diagnosed within the last 5 years and in adult Friedreich's Ataxia patients with cardiomyopathy, for the following grounds:

- The efficacy of Sovrima for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia has not been demonstrated. The efficacy  documentation  is  based  on  primarily  one  study,  evaluating  a  total  of  48  Friedreich's ataxia patients. No statistically significant effect was observed for the primary endpoint.
- The reliability of the results of the secondary endpoints is questioned. There were many secondary endpoints of which only a subset showed statistical significance and only for one of the three dose levels. Given the multiplicity issues in considering multiple endpoints and multiple dose levels the level of statistical evidence is not considered compelling.
- There  is  no  clear  rationale  for  the  dose-response  pattern  with  the  mid  dose  (450  mg/day  for patients ≤ 45  kg  body  weight  and  900  mg/day  for  patients  &gt;45  kg  body  weight)  of  Sovrima apparently performing better than the high dose (1350 mg/day for patients ≤ 45 kg body weight and 2250 mg/day for patients &gt;45 kg body weight).
- The supportive evidence from published studies is insufficient. Most of the published studies were open-label  and  the  results  were  not  consistent  across  endpoints  important  to  establish  clinical benefit.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Sovrima in the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in paediatric and young adult patients, or in adult patients diagnosed within the last 5 years and in adult

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Friedreich's Ataxia patients with cardiomyopathy was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3 RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CHMP OPINION

At the July 2008 CHMP meeting the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Sovrima in the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) in paediatric and young adult patients, or in adult patients diagnosed within the last 5 years and in adult Friedreich's Ataxia patients with cardiomyopathy was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the market authorisation.

The  applicant  submitted  the  written  notice  requesting  the  re-examination  on  7  August  2008  on  19 September 2008, and the detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal as outlined in the CHMP assessment report were submitted on 19 September 2008.

The meeting of SAG-CVS was held on 5 November 2008.

## 3.1 Grounds for re-examination

Ground for refusal 1 :   The efficacy of Sovrima for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia has not been demonstrated. The efficacy documentation is based on primarily one study, evaluating a total of 48 Friedreich's ataxia patients. No statistically significant effect was observed for the primary endpoint.

Applicant's position: In the view of the applicant the observed clinical efficacy of SOVRIMA (idebenone)  for  the  treatment  of  FRDA  has  been  demonstrated.  Whilst  the  CHMP  has acknowledged that clinical benefit has been shown, the CHMP has concluded that this is a modest effect. The applicant believes, however, that the relevance of this clinical benefit has been  underestimated.  The  applicant  presents  testimony  from  experts  experienced  in  the management of FRDA patients who report that the benefit demonstrated is clinically relevant and consistent with their experience with idebenone in daily practice.

In view of the good safety profile of idebenone, and in combination with this clinical benefit, the applicant believes that the benefit/risk balance is positive at this point for paediatric FRDA patients.

The applicant presents arguments demonstrating that the lack of a statistically significant effect for the primary endpoint, a non validated biomarker, is not relevant for the conclusions on clinical benefit/risk balance.

Ground for refusal 2: The reliability of the results of the secondary endpoints is questioned. There were many secondary endpoints of which only a subset showed statistical significance and only for one  of  the  three  dose  levels.  Given  the  multiplicity  issues  in  considering  multiple  endpoints  and multiple dose levels the level of statistical evidence is not considered compelling.

Applicant's position: The applicant presents arguments that the clinical benefit was concluded from  efficacy  seen  with  validated  secondary  endpoints  which  showed  a  positive  effect, whereas  other  exploratory  endpoints  were  inconclusive.  It  is  highlighted  that  the  use  of multiple  endpoints  is  desirable  in  clinical  studies  in  orphan  diseases,  where  there  is  very limited clinical experience and where it can only be expected that several of these endpoints may be found to be inconclusive. In light of the small population available for clinical testing, the  results  should  be  interpreted  based  on  clinical  judgment,  as  presented  in  the  experts' reports provided, rather than on statistical considerations alone.

Ground for refusal 3: There is  no  clear  rationale  for  the  dose-response  pattern  with  the  mid  dose (450 mg/day for patients ≤ 45 kg body weight and 900 mg/day for patients &gt;45 kg body weight) of Sovrima  apparently  performing  better  than  the  high  dose  (1350  mg/day  for  patients ≤ 45  kg  body weight and 2250 mg/day for patients &gt;45 kg body weight).

Applicant's  position:  The  applicant  provides  arguments  that  the  mid  and  high  dose  of SOVRIMA  performed  comparably  for  all  parameters  in  which  efficacy  has  been  shown,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which is consistent with a standard pharmacological dose response. Whilst the mid and high doses consistently performed better than the low dose and placebo, the applicant proposes the use of the mid (900 mg/day) dose at the present time in paediatric FRDA patients.

Ground for refusal 4: The  supportive  evidence  from  published  studies  is  weak.  Most  of  the published studies were open-label and the results were not consistent across endpoints important to establish clinical benefit.

Applicant's position: The applicant maintains the position that although the majority of studies were open label, with the notable exception of the double blind study by Mariotti, these still demonstrated consistent efficacy in FRDA, particularly in younger patients.

The applicant believes that the presented grounds justify reexamination of the negative opinion and proposes that SOVRIMA is approved for the treatment of paediatric FRDA patients at a dose of 900 mg/day conditional upon the results of the IONIA study in paediatric patients. The results of the ongoing MICONOS study in adult FRDA patients will be submitted at a later time in support of a variation for an adult indication.

## Detailed positions

## Ground for refusal 1

Applicant's position: The clinical relevance and importance of the observed effects with idebenone in paediatric FRDA patients in the NICOSIA study as well as in the published literature has not been acknowledged adequately during the review process. Particularly in the light of the good safety profile of idebenone the available efficacy data currently provide a positive benefit/risk balance in paediatric patients. This view is supported by experts in the field as presented in expert reports:

- Professor Schulz (University of Göttingen, DE) on the efficacy of idebenone with respect to improvement in neurological function and its clinical relevance
- Professor Rademakers, (University of Leuven, BE) with a supporting statement by Professor Erne  (University  Hospital  of  Luzern,  CH)  commenting  on  the  efficacy  of  idebenone  on FRDA-associated cardiomyopathy

While all experts welcome the ongoing clinical studies (IONIA &amp; MICONOS) which are collecting additional efficacy data, particularly in adult FRDA patients (MICONOS), they also conclude their report with a recommendation that idebenone is made available to young FRDA patients immediately so that potentially avoidable decline in their condition is prevented.

The applicant agrees with the experts' opinion that the observed effects with idebenone are clinically meaningful and not 'modest' as stated in the assessment report. The background supporting the clinical meaningfulness of the results observed is discussed in detail in the expert reports. For example, concerning the importance of the neurological effect observed, the average improvement on the ICARS scale in the NICOSIA trial is 4 points, in contrast to the 5 point decline seen in untreated FRDA patients over one year (Fahey, 2007) .

As explained in the Day 120 and Day 180 responses the proportion of patients showing such a clinically relevant response was increased in the mid and high dose groups as shown below:

Responder analysis for the ICARS scale as presented in D120 responses

|                                               |              | Idebenone Dose   | Idebenone Dose   | Idebenone Dose   |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
|                                               | Placebo N=11 | Low N=12         | Mid N=13         | High N=12        |
| Patients with response on ICARS of > 5 points | 1 (9.1%)     | 2 (17%)          | 5 (39%)          | 5 (42%)          |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical effect seen in neurological function is further emphasized by the efficacy of idebenone on activities of daily living (ADL). The average improvement on the ADL scale with idebenone is 1 point compared to an average decline of 1 point (representing loss of key functional activities). Since a 1point  change  in this  scale  is  clinically  meaningful,  the  2-point  difference  in  mean  changes  strongly supports the clinical importance of the effects observed.

When the data are presented as a responder analysis showing the number of patients that worsened compared to the number that improved / stabilized, a clear treatment effect on the mid and high dose is seen. This graph was presented in the Day 180 answers.

Further  analysis  of  the  efficacy  in  ADL  subscores  clearly  demonstrates  that  a  higher  number  of patients on mid dose idebenone improved compared to placebo in scale items addressing fine motor skills, such as speech, using utensils &amp; cutting food, dressing and personal hygiene.

In a progressive debilitating disease such as FRDA, which affects fine motor skills in young patients, preservation of activities of daily living is particularly important - but this does not seem to have been acknowledged in the current negative assessment.

The statistically significant correlation between the changes observed on ICARS and ADL scales, both of which are validated instruments, supports the conclusion of clinical meaningfulness of the neurological changes as shown in the scatter plot from the NICOSIA clinical study report.

The statement ' The efficacy documentation is based on primarily one study, evaluating a total of 48 Friedreich's ataxia patients ' in the major objection does not take into account the substantial body of evidence  from  independent  studies  which  have  reported  a  meaningful  effect  and  good  safety  of idebenone (see Table below). This has led to the compound's approval under a temporary license in Switzerland (see expert comment, Professor Erne) for treating cardiomyopathy associated with FRDA and to the initiation of compassionate use programs in several countries throughout Europe. Whilst this  availability  has  provided  clear  benefit  to  FRDA  patients,  it  has  made  the  conduct  of  placebo controlled studies very problematic.

Data concerning neurological efficacy in adults are limited to a few open-label studies using primarily low doses of idebenone which show inconsistent results. Clinically important neurological efficacy in children has however been reported by Pineda et al. (2008) who escalated doses up to the mid dose of the NICOSIA trial, and as in the NICOSIA study, observed symptomatic effects and the stabilization of neurological function (as discussed in the expert report by Professor Schulz).

The body of literature on cardiac effects was reported in the original submission but in the view of the Applicant was not considered appropriately by the assessors in reaching their conclusions. In short, the results of these studies consistently show improvement in cardiac hypertrophy and function in children and adults, where the treatment was of at least 4 months duration.

The applicant has emphasized the consistency of the results obtained in the NICOSIA study with those reported in the body of published supportive evidence. In the view of the experts this consistency is in line  with  their  own  clinical  experience  and  should  not  be  disregarded,  (see  reports  of  Professors Schulz, Rademakers and Erne).

When comparing the results of neurological and activities of daily living scales and cardiac imaging it becomes evident that in the NICOSIA trial a consistent improvement on mid and high doses versus placebo  and  low  dose  is  observed.  Therefore  the  conclusion  was  drawn  that  the  independent reproduction  of  the  same  dose  response  pattern  with  multiple  independent  methods  is  a  strong argument in favor of the pharmacological effect of idebenone in FRDA. This critical point is discussed in detail below.

Finally  in  assessing  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  idebenone  it  should  be  taken  into  consideration  that idebenone  is  very  well  tolerated  and  has  an  excellent  historical  safety  profile.  For  example,  the recommended dose of 900 mg/day would be supported by the large Alzheimer disease database which will  significantly  contribute  to  the  safety  information  since  in  this  program  &gt;  1000  patients  were treated  at  a  dose  of  1080  mg/day.  In  this  program  idebenone  was  also  shown  to  be  safe  and  well tolerated, even in the frail elderly population involved. Indeed the overall AE profile was very similar to that observed in the FRDA population.

Overall  the  applicant  is  of  the  opinion  that  clinical  benefit  in  the  paediatric  population  has  been demonstrated and that the benefit/risk balance in this population is positive.

The Applicant agrees that no  statistically  significant  effect  was  observed  for  the  primary  endpoint. However, the clinical efficacy of SOVRIMA for the treatment of FRDA has been demonstrated by a number of secondary endpoints that showed that patients on an effective dose of idebenone improved on neurological function, activities of daily living and cardiac anatomy and function.

The selection of change in 8OH2'dG, a biomarker for oxidative stress, as primary endpoint was based on  one  single  publication  which  suggested  that  8OH2'dG  is  elevated  in  FRDA  patients  and  that  a reduction  of  this  biomarker  could  offer  a  possibility  to  demonstrate  the  pharmacological  action  of idebenone in FRDA patients in a 6 months study. However, 8OH2'dG is not a validated biomarker for disease  progression  in  FRDA  and  was  an  exploratory  endpoint.  Retrospectively,  the  selection  of 8OH2'dG as primary endpoint for this study was not appropriate, as in the NICOSIA study 8OH2'dG

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was not abnormal in FRDA patients at baseline and there was no change during the progression of the disease.

Early  clinical  work  investigated  the  feasibility  of  8OH2'dG  as  a  biochemical  marker  for  FRDA (Schulz 2000). This work has shown that 8OH2'dG is elevated in FRDA patients and can be reduced by  idebenone  treatment.  When  the  NICOSIA  study  was  designed,  the  investigators  at  the  NIH proposed the change of 8OH2'dG as primary endpoint and to power the study based on the effect size observed in the Schulz study. The resulting sample size of 48 FRDA patients was compatible with the number  that  appeared  feasible  to  be  recruited  by  one  study  center  from  the  paediatric  patient population.  The  more  clinically  relevant  parameters  such  as  neurological  (ICARS,  FARS)  and activities of daily living (ADL) scores as well as cardiac assessments (LVMI, LVEF) were declared secondary endpoints based on concerns that the expected effects would not be detectable in a small population.

However, the 8OH2'dG marker had not been validated in a controlled study and, most importantly, had never been tested in a paediatric FRDA population. The results of the NICOSIA study are in line with  the  available  pharmacological  data  which  indicate  that  oxidative  stress  is  not  an  appropriate measure to monitor changes in disease state in FRDA considering the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction and resulting reduction in energy production for the pathology of this disease. These data rather  indicate  that  idebenone  acted  by  improving  electron  flow  and  increasing  mitochondrial  ATP biosynthesis.

More recent clinical work is consistent with the findings of the NICOSIA study in showing that the clinical efficacy of idebenone is not necessarily accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress. The study of Arnold (2006) for example showed that another oxidative stress marker (malondialdehyde, MDA) was lower in FRDA patients compared to controls and increased to normal levels when patients were  treated  with  idebenone.  At  the  same  time,  however,  improvements  in  fine  motor  skills  and dysarthria  were  reported,  again  showing  that  markers  for  oxidative  stress  may  not  change  in accordance with clinical improvements.

In  summary , the  lack  of  a  biochemical  effect  of  idebenone  on  a  marker  of  oxidative  stress  can  be explained by the fact that baseline values for 8OH2'dG were not abnormal, which is in contrast to a previous publication that was conducted with FRDA patients of a different age profile. The NICOSIA data  are  in  line  with  current  pharmacological  models  indicating  that  frataxin  deficiency  leads  to  a reduction in ATP biosynthesis as an important component of the disease rather than oxidative stress and suggests that idebenone acts by increasing ATP production rather than as an anti-oxidant.

A lack of appropriately validated endpoints is a hindering factor to conduct clinical trials in orphan diseases in general. This should be taken into consideration when evaluating the clinically meaningful changes in secondary endpoints as observed with idebenone in the NICOSIA study.

## CHMP Position:

Results of one 6-month phase II study in patients (n=48) with Friedreich's ataxia with Sovrima doses higher than those previously used in published studies have been submitted. No effect was established on the primary endpoint: change in a proposed surrogate marker for oxidative stress from baseline to month 6.

For the secondary endpoints neurological assessment with the ICARS and FARS scales, there were trends  for  a  more  favourable  outcome  with  the  mid  and  high  doses  of  Sovrima,  however,  the differences vs. placebo has not been statistically significant.

It still has to be determined whether a 4-point improvement in the ICARS can be considered clinically relevant.

Fahey  et  al  (2007)  had  compared  the  FARS  with  others  scales:  ICARS,  Functional  Independence Measure (FIM) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI). Results showed that FARS is the best to use in clinical  trials  of  FRAD.  This  is  based  on  effect  size,  and  power  calculations  that  show  that  fewer participants  are  required  to  demonstrate  the  same  effect  of  an  intervention.  Nevertheless,  the  exact change  in  any  measure  that  is  clinically  important  in  FRAD  is  unknown  at  present  (Lynch  et  al, 2005).It has to be noted that results on FARS were not significant.

It should be determined if a 4 point improvement in the ICARS scale (the total range of the ICARS is 0 to 100)or an improvement of 10% as compared to baseline value could be considered as clinically relevant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For measures of cardiac hypertrophy the final analysis shows a statistically significant effect of the mid  dose  of  Sovrima  on  a  measure  of  cardiac  hypertrophy,  LVMI,  and  on  a  cardiac  functional outcome parameter, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF).

For  other  secondary  parameters,  including  SF-10  and  Clinical  Global  Impression  of  Change,  there were no statistically significant effects. The applicant focuses on the improvement seen on the ADL scale, which may be a hint for a clinically relevant improvement.

However, in summary this trial must be considered as a failed clinical trial based on the prespecified endpoints and outcome criteria.

The  presented  supportive  evidence  from  other  published  clinical  studies  can  be  considered  only  as highly inconclusive and is of limited value as supportive evidence. The majority of the studies has been open-label, in most of them no statistically significant improvements on neurological or cardiac outcome has been established. However, trends for improvement on neurological and cardiac outcome can be considered after treatment with idebenone.

In  a  more  detailed  view  only  three  studies  were  randomized  and  placebo-controlled.  The  6-weeks idebenone treatment (Schöls et al, 2001) at 360 mg/day (a low dose) had not demonstrated any change in clinical neurologic rating score or the motor performance test neither in comparison to baseline nor in comparison to placebo. Echocardiography could not detect relevant changes.

Mariotti et al (2002) study (idebenone treatment during 12 months) had showed persistent moderate effects on echography indexes of heart hypertrophy. Analysis of ICARS total score and subscores did not reveal significant differences between the two groups of patients.

The  third  randomized-controlled  study  (Di  Prospero  et  al,  2007)  is  the  publication  of  results  of NICOSIA study. To be noted that the authors concluded that the study results suggests that idebenone used at higher doses that previously tested may offer neurological benefit but have to be validated by Phase III clinical trials.

In  the  open-label  study  (Pineda  et  al,  2007)  mentioned  by  the  MAA,  paediatric(5-10  mg/kg/day, maximum 650 mg/day) and adults patients (5-20mg/kg/day, maximum 1400 mg/day) were treated for 3-5 years . In paediatric patients, no significant differences were observed in total ICARS score when comparing  baseline  status  and  the  end  of  the  study.  In  all  adults  patients  studied,  ICARS  scores increased. No significant differences were observed in any of the echocardiographic measurements in children,  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  was  not  modified  during  the  follow-up  of  adults  cases.  In conclusion, in children population no deterioration was observed, however, the natural history of the disease is unknown.

However, it should be discussed with the experts whether the hint that the age of the patient  'at the initiation of treatment may be an important factor in the effectiveness' of the idebenone therapy can be concluded.

Overall  the  argumentation  of  the  applicant  can  be  followed  and  benefit-risk  assessment  based  on clinical outcomes is clearly preferred over surrogate parameters with limited validation.

However,  the  results  on  the  clinical  outcomes  measured  as  secondary  endpoints  are  considered inconsistent and of questionable clinical relevance (see ground for refusal III.2).

## Ground for refusal 2

Applicant's position: This ground for refusal does not take into account the difficulty of performing clinical trials in orphan indications. For clinical research in such indications it is extremely difficult if not impossible to validate properly endpoints for clinical trials due to the lack of clinical experience and of patients available for studies. As a consequence of this it is unavoidable and indeed desirable (as  stated  in  the  Guideline  for  Clinical  Trials  in  Small  Populations)  to  include  multiple  exploratory endpoints  in  clinical  trials  and  therefore  it  is  also  unavoidable  that  many  of  these  will  not  be  met. Failure to demonstrate statistical significance in multiple endpoints in this situation reflects an inherent difficulty in the design of studies in orphan drugs and cannot be interpreted as failure of the drug to show efficacy.

Although  the  key  secondary  endpoints  that  were  included  in  the  NICOSIA  study  were  adequately validated (eg  ICARS, ADL, LVMI, LVEF), a number of exploratory endpoints were also included.

The first eight endpoints in the table are endpoints that have been clinically validated to a certain extent in FRDA patients:

- The activities of daily living (ADL) scale has been validated in FRDA patients (Subramony 2005; Lynch 2006)
- ICARS total score, a widely used outcome measure in ataxia research, has been shown to be valid  and  has  high  inter-rater  reliability  in  FRDA  patients  (Cano  2005;  Storey  2004).  This instrument was accepted as a suitable primary endpoint for the ongoing  MICONOS study as part of the Scientific Advice provided by the EMEA prior to its initiation. Likewise, the FDA also accepted changes in the ICARS as an approvable endpoint for the IONIA study during their Special Protocol Assessment.
- Cardiac  endpoints  (LVMI,  LVEF,  LVM)  have  been  validated  in  several  clinical  trials  in FRDA (summarized by Meyer 2007).
- The FARS scale is a neurological instrument under development in the US (Subramony 2005; Lynch 2006), specifically designed for FRDA. In the NICOSIA trial, the first therapeutic trial in  which the scale had been used, a similar dose response pattern compared to ICARS was observed.  Although  the  FARS  did  not  show  a  statistical  significant  response,  its  efficacy pattern was consistent with the ICARS. It should be noted however that this instrument takes at least twice as long to administer compared to the ICARS, which could have contributed to increased variability due to patient fatigue.

Several  other  endpoints  such  as  force  control  and  gait  analysis  showing  high  variability  and inconclusive results were experimental in nature and had not been used previously in clinical trials in FRDA. Similarly, exercise testing proved very difficult for this ataxic population in spite of the use of a  special  ergometer.  Lack  of  compliance  in  performing  the  exercise  test  resulted  in  very  high  data variability rendering efficacy assessments difficult.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The difficulty in prospectively selecting appropriate endpoints for a clinical trial in a rare disease is acknowledged in the Guideline for Clinical Trials in Small Populations. Even though this guideline was not applied by the CHMP in their review of the MAA, the difficulty remains.

Based  on  these  arguments,  the  Applicant  defends  the  selection  of  multiple  secondary  endpoints, including a number of non-validated and exploratory endpoints, to ensure the collection of valuable clinical data in a rare disease such as FRDA. Lack of efficacy in such exploratory endpoints should not be used to undermine the clinically meaningful effects seen in more validated endpoints.

The applicant acknowledges that the multiplicity issue has not been taken into account in the statistical analysis of the NICOSIA results. The applicant is however of the opinion that correction for this is not appropriate given the difficulty of conducting studies in this small population. The evidence for a true, clinically  meaningful  effect  is  derived  not  only  from  statistical  considerations  but  also  from  the consistent pattern of results in different tests observed across independent endpoints. This consistent pattern  in  the  dose  response  relationship  favoring  the  mid  and  high  doses  over  the  low  dose  and placebo groups was seen in the NICOSIA trial and presented in the following graph reproduced from the Day 180 responses. Such a pattern in independently assessed parameters is considered unlikely to occur by chance.

Comparison of efficacy response for the treatment groups in the NICOSIA study

<!-- image -->

This consistency is also considered by experts as strong evidence for an important effect (see expert reports Professors Schulz and Rademakers) but was not commented on or acknowledged in the current assessment  report  and  therefore,  in  the  view  of  the  Applicant,  should  be  considered  during  reexamination.

An  issue  considered  unresolved  in  the  final  assessment  report  was  the  perceived  inconsistency between results from LVEF measured by echocardiography and MRI. The Applicant disagrees with this assessment of inconsistency and is supported in this view by the opinion of experts in the field (see cardiac expert report by Prof. Rademakers). Specifically, it is well documented in the literature that  cardiac  MRI  methods  to  assess  cardiac  dimensions  are  far  more  sensitive  and  accurate  than echocardiography (Grothues 2002). This includes a recent study comparing the two methods in FRDA patients (Meyer 2007).

Indeed,  experts  have  emphasized  that  echocardiographic  measurements  of  left  ventricular  ejection fraction show greater variability than those obtained by cardiac MRI. According to Professor George

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sutherland  (St  George's  Hospital,  London):  ' this  difference  is  an  inherent  part  of  the  acquisition methods used by each technique.  Echocardiography is a real time technique and as such single heart beat measurements which may be influenced by changes in respiration show a greater variability than the cardiac MRI measurement which is a measurement averaged over a large number of consecutive beats.    This  averaging  reduces  cardiac  MRI  measurement  variability  and  thus  means  that  MRI measurements are theoretically less variable than echo measurements '.

In the NICOSIA study LVEF was measured both by cardiac MRI and echocardiography.  The overall response pattern for the placebo (worsening) and mid and high dose idebenone (improvement) was comparable for both types of assessments, as were the magnitudes of the changes observed at these doses.  The  overall  similarity  of  the  results  obtained  by  the  two  techniques  was  emphasized  in  the cardiac expert report by Professor Rademakers.

## CHMP Position:

As  outlined  earlier  the  argumentation  of  the  applicant  can  be  followed  and  benefit-risk  assessment based on clinical outcomes is clearly preferred over surrogate parameters with limited validation. The choice of the biomarker as primary outcome measure can now be considered as premature and not sufficiently justified.

The scales  used to  assess  secondary  endpoints  could  be  considered  as  appropriate  (ICARS,  FARS, LVMI, and LVM). Nevertheless, as already pointed out, the change in any measure that is clinically relevant is not discussed by the MAA.

The effect on secondary efficacy endpoint ICARS and FARS was more pronounced for the mid and high doses of Sovrima than for the low dose, but the differences did not reach statistical significance, and no clear dose-response was shown between the mid and high doses. A responder analysis was performed where a clinically relevant change in the ICARS was defined as an effect with a magnitude equivalent,  in  absolute  terms,  to  the  natural  rate  of  decline  observed  over  a  one  year  period  in  an untreated  population  (Fahey,  2007).  The  results  of  the  responder  analysis  showed  a  trend  for  an increase  of  responders  in  the  mid  and  high  dose  groups  of  Sovrima.  There  were  no  statistically significant  effects  of  Sovrima  on  other  neurological  secondary  endpoints.  However,  the  clinical relevance on the effect observed on ICARS should be discussed.

For  the  cardiac  parameters,  in  the  initial  application,  there  was  a  trend  for  improvement  for  the measure of cardiac hypertrophy by MRI as well as by echocardiography) for the Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI), in the two highest dose groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the  post-hoc  analysis,  taking  into  account  MRI  results  only  the  mid  dose  of  Sovrima  resulted  in  a statistically significant improvement of LVMI as well as in a statistically significant improvement of a cardiac functional outcome parameter, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). Taking into account that LVEF values at baseline were normal or slightly decreased these variations could be considered as consistent  for  the  two  methods  (MRI  and  echocardiography).  However,  as  for  the  neurological changes, the clinical relevance of the cardiac observed effects needs further discussion at the Scientific Advisory Group meeting.

## Ground for refusal 3

## Applicant's position:

In  the  NICOSIA  study  report  the  dose  response  pattern  for  multiple  parameters  were  presented, including both cardiac and neurological parameters. As presented by the applicant in the submission, the dose response curves of these different parameters all demonstrated a very similar pattern.

The concern was raised however that the dose response is better for the mid dose (450 mg/day for patients ≤ 45 kg body weight and 900 mg/day for patients &gt;45 kg body weight) than for the high dose (1350 mg/day for patients ≤ 45 kg body weight and 2250 mg/day for patients &gt;45 kg body weight) which cannot be explained.

The applicant does not agree with this conclusion for the following reasons:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The rating scales used (ICARS, ADL, FARS) showed a consistent dose response pattern as shown in the following graphs when data are plotted as mean ± standard errors:

Dose response of neurological endpoints from the NICOSIA trial (mean ± SEM)

<!-- image -->

For all rating scales the low dose always gave the lowest response in patients on active treatment for all  study  populations  analysed,  whilst  the  mid  and  high  dose  groups  consistently  showed  a  better response. Considering the overlapping standard errors it cannot be concluded that the high dose was different from the mid dose and the applicant concludes that the mid dose reached or approached the maximum efficacious dose.

In  agreement  with  the  neurological  data,  both  for  the  LVMI  and  LVEF,  two  independent  cardiac parameters  derived  from  MRI  imaging,  the  same  dose  response  was  observed  with  the  mid  dose numerically being better than the high dose and the mid dose being statistically different from placebo. Because  this  result  was  obtained  independently  for  two  parameters  these  results  are  considered  to reliably reflect a real change and benefit at the mid dose. Moreover the individual data demonstrate a similar response in individuals on mid and high dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dose response of cardiac endpoints from the NICOSIA trial (mean ± SEM) 4

<!-- image -->

Considering  the  standard  errors  as  presented  in  the  graphs  above,  there  is  no  apparent  difference between the mid and high doses for any of the neurological or cardiac endpoints. Direct comparison between the mid and high doses vs placebo provided stronger p-values for the mid dose.

A  responder  analysis  of  the  NICOSIA  study  further  supports  the  view  that  there  is  no  clinically meaningful difference in the efficacy of the mid and high doses of idebenone. The number of patients showing a clinically relevant response on ICARS defined as 5 or more points, a magnitude confirmed by experts (see expert report by Prof. Schulz), was similar between the mid and high doses (i.e. 39% and  42%,  respectively).  Likewise,  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  showed  clinically  relevant improvement  on  LVMI  defined  as  10%  reduction  as  supported  by  experts  (see  report  by  Prof. Rademakers) on the mid and high doses (i.e. 31% and 25%, respectively).

In summary, the applicant interprets the dose-response data as a standard S-shaped curve with the mid and high dose showing comparable efficacy invalidating this argument of the refusal.

## CHMP Position:

The weight based posology is based on very limited data and overall there was no clear difference in effects after treatment with the mid or high dosage of idebenone. However, in case that improvement seen  with  the  mid  dose  could  be  considered  as  clinically  meaningful  this  could  be  seen  as  the recommended dose.

## Ground for refusal 4

## Applicant's position:

The  applicant  agrees  that  most  of  the  published  studies  are  open  label  trials  -  with  the  notable exception  of  the  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of  Mariotti  (2003)  (see  overview  table  on published clinical data with idebenone in FRDA above). However, the applicant does not agree that the results are inconsistent, particularly for the efficacy of idebenone on cardiomyopathy which has been investigated in the majority of published data so far.

It  was  described  in  the  previously  submitted  documents  that  the  cardiac  effects  observed  in  the NICOSIA study are consistently reproduced in all studies that had a minimum treatment period of 4 months, including the double-blind placebo controlled study of Mariotti (2003). The following table summarises the outcomes of the published literature with respect to cardiac efficacy (details are shown in the overview table on published clinical data with idebenone in FRDA above).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lack of an effect reported by Schöls (2001) does not detract from the overall picture of efficacy since in that study the treatment duration (6 weeks) apparently was too short to induce a change in cardiomyopathy (reported as LVMI). This interpretation is in line with the study by Buyse (2003) who showed that changes in cardiac anatomy and function upon idebenone treatment develop over time and need several months before they can be measured.

The applicant therefore disagrees with the statement that the published literature is not consistent. In fact the NICOSIA data are strongly supported by studies reported in the published literature, including one  double-blind  placebo  controlled  study.  The  sum  of  clinical  efficacy  data  available  today  in combination  with  the  good  safety  profile  of  idebenone  results  in  a  positive  benefit/risk  balance, particularly for paediatric patients and should be the grounds for approval of SOVRIMA for FRDA in this  age  group.  This  interpretation  is  clearly  supported  by  clinical  experts  experienced  with  the management of FRDA patients (see attached reports).

## CHMP Position:

Efficacy  clinical  data  in  the  published  literature  comes  mostly  from  open-label  studies  and  are  not consistent.

Data from the randomized placebo-controlled studies show that 6-weeks idebenone treatment (Schöls et  al,  2001)  did  not  demonstrate  any  change  in  clinical  neurologic  rating  score  or  the  motor performance test neither in comparison to baseline nor in comparison to placebo. Echocardiography could not detect relevant changes.

Idebenone treatment during 12 months (Mariotti et al, 2002) had showed persistent moderate effects on  echography  indexes  of  heart  hypertrophy,  analysis  of  ICARS  total  score  and  subscores  did  not reveal significant differences between the two groups of patients.

The third randomized placebo-controlled study (Di Prospero et al, 2007) is the publication of results of NICOSIA study. To be noted that the authors concluded that the study results suggests that idebenone used at higher doses that previously tested may offer neurological benefit but have to be validated by Phase III clinical trials.

In  conclusion,  published  data  can  not  confirm  at  the  present  time  the  efficacy  of  idebenone  in  the treatment of neurologic and cardiac lesions of FRDA. Idebenone did not halt the progression of ataxia but  may  have  an  effect  on  the  progression  of  cardiomyophathy,  nevertheless  the  natural  history  of cardiac  lesions  in  FRDA  is  not  known  and  left  ventricular  diameter  and  mass  may  change spontaneously during the course of the disease in both directions (increased or decreased) (Meyer et al 2007).

## Additional supporting information provided by the Applicant

In  order  to  support  the  claim  of  clinical  relevance  of  the  available  data,  the  Applicant  herewith provides three expert reports, one focusing on the neurological effects of idebenone, and two on the cardiac  effects.  The  reports  are  written  by  specialists  in  the  field  with  clinical  experience  in  the management of FRDA patients.

Key conclusions from these reports are as follows:

Neurological Expert Report (Prof. Schulz)

- The effects observed in the NICOSIA trials are clinically meaningful.
- The effect size is similar to a year of decline and therefore clinically meaningful.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The effects on daily living function are remarkable and correlated with neurological change.
- The effects  described  in  the  NICOSIA  trial  are  in  agreement  with  clinical  observations    in children.

Cardiological Expert Report (Prof. Rademakers supported by Prof. Erne)

- The changes for LV mass and LVEF follow opposite directions when idebenone and placebo groups are compared, suggesting an effect on disease progression.
- The opposite direction of change on active drug and placebo observed in the NICOSIA study confirms the previous report of the double-blind, placebo controlled study of Mariotti.
- The potential effect on disease progression suggests possible prolongation of life expectancy as observed in an animal model of FRDA cardiomyopathy.

On-going studies: Two studies are currently ongoing with idebenone in FRDA.

The MICONOS trial (in EU) study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study with 3 active doses of idebenone and placebo. The idebenone doses tested for 12 months are identical to those tested in the NICOSIA trial. The change on the ICARS between baseline and 12 months is the primary  endpoint,  while  cardiac  parameters  assessed  by  echocardiography  and  MRI  are  secondary endpoints.

The  study  plans  to  enrol  a  total  of  204  patients,  of  which  193  have  been  enrolled  by  today.  It  is anticipated that the last patient will be enrolled by the end of 2008 / early 2009 and data from this 12 months study will be available by the middle of 2010.

It  is  important to note  that  as  of today  more  than 85% of the patients in the study are adult FRDA patients. Therefore, the MICONOS study will provide efficacy data for adult FRDA patients and the applicant will submit data from this study in support of a variation for an adult indication.

The  IONIA  trial  (in  the  US)  is  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group  design  study, comparing 2 active doses of idebenone and placebo. The doses tested are the mid and high doses, which were previously tested in the NICOSIA study. The number of patients to be recruited in this 6 month study is 65 - 70 (depending on how many patients can be identified). The study is a paediatric trial  recruiting  FRDA  patients  with  ages  8  -  18  years.  The  following  graph  shows  the  number  of patients recruited by September 2008.

It is anticipated that the last patient will be enrolled by the end of 2008 and it is expected that data become available by Q3 2009. A submission of a new MAA based on the IONIA data could be made by the end of 2009.

CHMP position:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  presented  evidence  from  the  NICOSIA  trial  and  the  other  published  clinical  studies  is  still considered  as  inconclusive.  It  is  acknowledged  that  trends  for  improvement  on  neurological  and cardiac outcome are seen after treatment with idebenone, however the relevance of the effects should be discussed with the experts in the SAG. The statements of the three experts can be discussed there within broader terms.

Overall the CHMP considers it is worth waiting for the results of the ongoing clinical trials (IONIA; MICONOS) for a definite benefit risk assessment. At this stage the results of the NICOSIA trial and the additional evidence are too inconclusive even for a conditional approval.

## Revised proposed indication

This MAA application is primarily based on the results obtained in the NICOSIA trial demonstrating efficacy  of  idebenone  on  neurological  function  and  cardiomyopathy.  Recognizing  that  this  efficacy was demonstrated in young FRDA patients in the NICOSIA study, Santhera is accepting a restricted label for the patient group that would benefit most from an immediate approval of SOVRIMA, the children up to the age of 18 years. Therefore, the following revised label is proposed:

'Treatment of cardiac and neurological symptoms in paediatric patients with Friedreich's Ataxia'

This claim is fully supported by reports about the efficacy of idebenone in the published literature.

Taken into consideration the recommendation on the PK data and their interpretation for the posology provided by the CHMP in the assessment reports, a daily dose of 900 mg (i.e. 2 tablets 3 times a day) should be the recommended posology. This dose is equivalent to the mid dose in the NICOSIA trial and is supported by an appropriate safety data base in children, adolescents and adults.

The ongoing US IONIA trial is conducted in paediatric patients and results from this trial are expected by  end  of  2009.  A  complete  new  re-filing  based  on  the  IONIA  data  and  considering  the  time  for review would lead to an access to the drug for patients only in Q1 2011. As outlined above, due to the devastating  and  progressive  nature  of  FRDA,  paediatric  patients  across  all  EU  countries  should  be given the chance to benefit immediately from idebenone at an effective dose. The applicant commits to provide data from the IONIA trial, which could constitute a condition for the approval in paediatric FRDA patients.

Data from the ongoing European MICONOS trial in adult FRDA patients will be filed at a later time in support of a variation for an adult indication.

In summary, the Applicant proposed a Conditional Approval for the treatment of cardiac and neurological symptoms in peadiatric patients with Friedreich's Ataxia at a dose of 900 mg per day (2 tablets 3 times a day) with data from the IONIA trial as a condition to be fulfilled by the end of 2009.

## CHMP position:

'Conditional  approval',  with  ongoing  studies  being  part  of  the  conditions,  is  considered  not applicable. Such approval requires all of the requirements (a)-(d) are met:

1. That the B/R is positive, as defined in Article 1 (28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC
2. It is likely that comprehensive data can provided
3. Unmet  medical  needs  will  be  fulfilled  (no  satisfactory  methods  or  major  therapeutic advantage)
4. Benefits of immediate availability outweigh risks due to additional data to be provided.

Point (1) is not fulfilled at present and point (4) cannot be considered fulfilled as compassionate use is already available.

Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA),  the most common  hereditary ataxia, is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease with progressive gait and limb ataxia and cardiomyopathy as some of its clinical  core  features.  The  major  cause  of  death  is  heart  failure  as  a  result  of  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No treatment other than supportive measures is available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

FRDA is caused by expansion of a GAA triplet located within the first intron of the frataxin gene on chromosome 9q13. There is a clear correlation between size of the expanded repeat and severity of the phenotype.  Frataxin  is  a  mitochondrial  protein  that  plays  a  role  in  iron  homeostasis.  Deficiency  of frataxin  results  in  mitochondrial  iron  accumulation,  defects  in  specific  mitochondrial  enzymes, enhanced  sensitivity  to  oxidative  stress,  and  eventually  free-radical  mediated  cell  death.  Therefore FRDA  is  considered a nuclear encoded  mitochondrial disease with decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain function and increased oxidative stress. Several medicinal products with the potential to improve mitochaondrial function (Coenzym Q10, selenium, N-acetyl-cysteine and idebenone) have been  studied  in  Friedreich's  Ataxia,  however,  proof  that  the  improvements  seen  are  clinically meaningful  is  missing.  The  following  rationale  is  behind  treatment  of  FRDA  with  idebenone: Idebenone [2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-hydroxydecyl)-1,4-benzoquinone] is a synthetic short chain analogue  of  ubiquinone  (Coenzyme  Q10),  the  vital  cell  membrane  antioxidant  and  essential constituent  of  the  cellular  energy  (ATP)-producing  mitochondrial  electron  transport  chain  (ETC). Idebenone appears to act as an anti-oxidant that also enhances the flux of electrons along the ETC, thereby facilitating the generation of ATP. Based on these effects it has been postulated as a potential therapeutic agent for FRDA.

Results of one 6-month phase II study in patients (n=48) with Friedreich's ataxia with Sovrima doses higher than those previously used in published studies have been submitted (NICOSIA trial). No effect was established on the primary endpoint: change in a proposed surrogate marker for oxidative stress from baseline to month 6.

For the secondary endpoints neurological assessment with the ICARS and FARS scales, there were trends  for  a  more  favourable  outcome  with  the  mid  and  high  doses  of  Sovrima,  however,  the differences vs. placebo have not been statistically significant. It still has to be determined whether a 4point improvement in the ICARS and the proposed responder analyses could be considered clinically relevant.

For  measures  of  cardiac  hypertrophy  the  analysis  shows  a  statistically  significant  effect  of  the  mid dose of Sovrima on a measure of cardiac hypertrophy, LVMI, and on a cardiac functional outcome parameter, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). Again, the clinical relevance of these results for the overall population of patients with FRDA is not sufficiently clear.

For  other  secondary  parameters,  including  SF-10  and  Clinical  Global  Impression  of  Change,  there were no statistically significant effects. The applicant focuses on the improvement seen on the ADL scale, which may be a hint for a clinically relevant improvement.

However,  in  summary  this  trial  is  considered  as  a  failed  clinical  trial  based  on  the  prespecified endpoints and outcome criteria.

The supportive evidence from other studies (mainly open-label) is still considered as weak. The results in  favour  of  idebenone  should  be  confirmed  by  further  clinical  trials,  therefore  the  results  of  the ongoing studies (IONIA trial in paediatric patients; MICONOS trial in adults) are waited with high interest.

## 3.2 Overall conclusions from the Joint Assessment Report

With the grounds for re-examination the applicant has reiterated its position regarding the deficiencies identified in the CHMP assessment and provided further discussion of the points forming the ground of refusal by the CHMP. The applicant proposed a Conditional Approval for the treatment of cardiac and neurological symptoms in paediatric patients with Friedreich's Ataxia at a dose of 900 mg per day (2 tablets 3 times a day) with data from the IONIA trial as a condition to be fulfilled by the end of 2009.

However, both Rapporteurs conclude that even for this restricted indication the benefit-risk assessment of Sovrima is still negative as data are not consistent and robust enough. The major concerns pointed out in the CHMP grounds for refusal 1, 2, 3 and 4 are still valid and therefore do not allow accepting marketing authorization of Sovrima at that time. The results of the ongoing phase III trials (IONIA trial in paediatric patients; MICONOS trial in adults) should be awaited.

## 3.3 Questions addressed by the CHMP to the Clinical Neurosciences Scientific Advisory Group

For the evaluation of the grounds for re-examination, the CHMP also consulted the Advisory group of Experts  who  met  the  5thof  November  2008  to  discuss  the  available  evidence  and  answer  to  the following questions from the CHMP:

1. Which are the adequate measures to show a treatment effect in patients with Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) and what can be considered as clinically meaningful taking into consideration the natural course of the disease:

- a. on neurological outcome?
- b. on cardiac outcome?

2. In view of the methodological shortcomings of the NICOSIA trial, does the SAG consider as clinically meaningful the effects seen in this trial on neurological outcome with ICARS and on cardiac outcome after mid and high dosages of idebenone?\"

## 3. Are the effects seen in paediatric patients more pronounced compared to adults?

The Applicant gave an oral explanation during the Experts meeting and had the opportunity to clarify their position in relation to the same questions.

## Answers from the CNS SAG to the questions on Sovrima/Idebenone

1. Which are the adequate measures to show a treatment effect in patients with Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) and what can be considered as clinically meaningful taking into consideration the natural course of the disease:
- c. on neurological outcome?
- d. on cardiac outcome?

SAG  answer:  Friedreich's  Ataxia  (FRDA)  is  a  true  neurodegenerative  disease  with  cardiac pathology  that  mostly  contributes  to  the  cause  of  death  in  these  patients.  However  the  clinical course  of  disease  is  variable,  decline  of  neurologic  functions  is  not  linear  (also  depending  on cardiac function) and the natural history of disease is still insufficiently characterised.

Point a): Multidimensional assessment tools (like FARS and ICARS) are considered valuable to  capture  the  several  symptoms  of  disease  but  their  metric  properties  should  be  better documented.  The  most  relevant  neurological  improvements  to  be  taken  into  account  are walking and speech; dexterity is also important for everyday life. ADL are very relevant and it  is  expected  that  clinically  meaningful  changes  should  be  at  least  partly  reflected  on  the global change.

As  for  other  neurodegenerative  diseases,  is  felt  that  the  therapeutic  benefit  would  mostly consist  in  slowing  the  progression  of  symptoms,  and  a  2-year  observation  period  would  be reasonable  versus  best  standard  of  care.  However  FRDA  being  an  orphan  disease,  ethical considerations push to identify the shortest useful observation duration. In this perspective it makes sense to wait for the results of the ongoing 1-year studies.

Point b): Short-term relevant cardiac parameters are to be considered for secondary endpoints in  the  treatment  of  FA.  The  SAG  identified  valuable  cardiac  surrogate  endpoints:    MRI, possibly  gadolinium  enhanced  in  order  to  quantify  cardiac  fibrosis;  echocardiography  for documenting both systolic and diastolic function; these endpoints should be evaluated over a period of 6-month or more adequately of 1-year.

Long-term  data  on  cardiac  morbid-mortality  are  still  scarce  in  FA,  and  the  SAG  strongly recommend to collect data on these specific outcomes overtime in the general population of FDRA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. In view of the methodological shortcomings of the NICOSIA trial, does the SAG consider as clinically meaningful the effects seen in this trial on neurological outcome with ICARS and on cardiac outcome after mid and high dosages of idebenone?\"

SAG answer : The SAG considers the results of NICOSIA study suggestive of efficacy on the neurological  outcomes;  however  they  should  be  confirmed  on  larger  numbers.  The  lack  of improvement in walking is  considered  to  limit  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  results,  even  if other relevant neurologic symptoms like speech or dexterity are improved. The observed 4-point change in ICARS is considered a relatively small effect.

Observed  cardiac  outcomes  are  considered  to  affect  only  limited  functional  aspects  and  are inconsistent across the mid and high dose. The arguments brought by the Applicant during their presentation  to  the  SAG,  based  on  a  parallel  of  FA  cardiomyopathy  with  the  hypertensive cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy as the key risk factor in FDRA, are not endorsed by the Experts cardiologists.

## 3. Are the effects seen in paediatric patients more pronounced compared to adults?

SAG answer: The SAG considered the objective elements in the dossier and presented by the Applicant during the meeting insufficient to document a more pronounced effect in the paediatric patients. Prevention of progression of the cardiac disease would be the more relevant aspect to document.

These views were shared by all the Experts.

The answers to the questions and more in details the position of the CNS-SAG was presented by the SAG  Chairman  at  the  CHMP  during  the  November  meeting.  The  Applicant  presented  their  final position in an oral explanation at the same meeting.

## 3.4 Overall conclusions on grounds for re-examination

With the grounds for re-examination the applicant has reiterated its position regarding the deficiencies identified in the CHMP assessment and provided further discussion of the points forming the ground of refusal by the CHMP. The applicant proposed a Conditional Approval for the treatment of cardiac and neurological symptoms in paediatric patients with Friedreich's Ataxia at a dose of 900 mg per day (2 tablets 3 times a day) with data from the IONIA trial as a condition to be fulfilled by the end of 2009.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  information  submitted,  considers  that  evidence  of  adequate, therapeutic efficacy is lacking, a favourable benefit/risk balance cannot be established and therefore recommends the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Sovrima.

The  results  of  the  ongoing  phase  III  trials  (IONIA  trial  in  paediatric  patients;  MICONOS  trial  in adults) should be awaited.

The CNS SAG answers confirmed the scarcity of objective elements for a revised indication in the restricted paediatric population based on the NICOSIA trial. In particular the clinical relevance of the neurological and cardiac outcome measures estimated as secondary endpoints has been questioned.

## 3.5 Grounds for Refusal

In  conclusion, the CHMP, based on review of the whole data provided and taking into account the answers from the CNS-SAG considered the following grounds for refusal are confirmed. Specifically:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is still insufficient clinical documentation with respect to the benefit/risk balance of Sovrima in the revised indication proposed by the Applicant during the re-examination procedure:

'Treatment of cardiac and neurological symptoms in paediatric patients with Friedreich's Ataxia'

- The efficacy of Sovrima for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia has not been demonstrated. The efficacy documentation is based on primarily one study, evaluating a total of 48 paediatric patients with Friedreich's ataxia. No statistically significant effect was observed for the primary endpoint.
- The reliability of the results of the secondary endpoints in the 48 paediatric patients is questioned. There were many secondary endpoints of which only a subset showed statistical significance and only  for  one  of  the  three  dose  levels.  Given  the  multiplicity  issues  in  considering  multiple endpoints and multiple dose levels the level of statistical evidence is not considered compelling.
- The supportive evidence from published studies is insufficient. Most of the published studies were open-label  and  the  results  were  not  consistent  across  endpoints  important  to  establish  clinical benefit.
- The  objective  elements  in  the  dossier  and  presented  by  the  Applicant  during  the  meeting  are insufficient  to  document  robust  and  consistent  effects  in  the  paediatric  patients  studied  in  the NICOSIA trial. Further data from the ongoing studies are considered necessary.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the therapeutic efficacy is insufficiently substantiated and the benefit/risk balance of Sovrima  in  the  treatment  of  Friedreich's  Ataxia  in  paediatric  and  young  adult  patients,  or  in  adult patients diagnosed within the last 5 years and in adult Friedreich's Ataxia patients with cardiomyopathy  is  unfavourable  and  therefore  did  not  recommend  the  granting  of  the  marketing authorisation.
