## Special populations

## Elderly

No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly with creatinine clearance values &gt; 50 mL/min (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

The dose should be adjusted when creatinine clearance (CrCL) is ≤ 50 mL/min, as shown in Tables 3 and 4 (see sections 4.9 and 5.2). The recommended durations of treatment are 5-14 days for cSSTI and 5-7 days for CAP.

a   Calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula for adults. Dose is based on CrCL. CrCL should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted according to changing renal function.

b   Ceftaroline is haemodialyzable; thus Zinforo should be administered after haemodialysis on haemodialysis days.

c Infusion times of less than 60 minutes and high dose recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses only. See sections 4.4 and 5.1.

d For treatment of S. aureus for which the ceftaroline MIC is ≤ 1 mg/L, the standard dose is recommended.

Dose recommendations for neonates, infants and children and adolescents are based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling.

There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in adolescents aged from 12 to &lt; 18 years with bodyweight &lt; 33 kg and in children aged from 2 to 12 years with End-stage renal disease (ESRD).

There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in paediatric patients &lt; 2 years with moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD.

a Calculated using the Schwartz formula for paediatric patients (in mL/min/1.73 m 2) . Dose is based on CrCL. CrCL should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted according to changing renal function.

b   Ceftaroline is haemodialyzable; thus Zinforo should be administered after haemodialysis on haemodialysis days.

c Infusion times of less than 60 minutes and high dose recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses only. See sections 4.4 and 5.1.

- d For treatment of S. aureus for which the ceftaroline MIC is ≤ 1 mg/L, the standard dose is recommended.

## Hepatic impairment

No dosage adjustment is considered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Method of administration

Intravenous use. Zinforo is administered by intravenous infusion over 5 to 60 minutes for standard dose or 120 minutes for high dose (for cSSTI caused by S. aureus with MIC of 2 or 4 mg/L to ceftaroline) in infusion volumes of 50 mL, 100 mL or 250 mL (see section 6.6). Infusion related reactions (such as phlebitis) can be managed by prolonging the infusion duration.

Infusion volumes for paediatric patients will vary according to the weight of the child. The infusion solution concentration during preparation and administration should not exceed 12 mg/mL ceftaroline fosamil.

For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Hypersensitivity to the cephalosporin class of antibacterials.

Immediate and severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam antibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins or carbapenems).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions are possible (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association with ceftaroline treatment (see section 4.8).

Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) has been reported in association with beta-lactam antibiotics (including cephalosporins) treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions.

If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, ceftaroline should be withdrawn immediately, and an alternative treatment considered.

If the patient has developed a severe skin reaction such as SJS, TEN or DRESS with the use of ceftaroline, treatment with ceftaroline must not be restarted in this patient at any time.

Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins or other beta-lactam antibacterials may also be hypersensitive to ceftaroline fosamil. Ceftaroline should be used with caution in patients with a history of non-severe hypersensitivity reactions to any other beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins or carbapenems). If a severe allergic reaction or SCAR occurs during treatment with Zinforo, the medicinal product should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.

With other beta-lactam antibiotics there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions which progressed to Kounis syndrome (acute allergic coronary arteriospasm that can result in myocardial infarction, see section 4.8).

## Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhoea

Antibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with ceftaroline fosamil and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of ceftaroline fosamil (see section 4.8). In such circumstance, the discontinuation of therapy with ceftaroline fosamil and the use of supportive measures together with the administration of specific treatment for Clostridium difficile should be considered.

## Non-susceptible organisms

Superinfections may occur during or following treatment with Zinforo.

## Patients with pre-existing seizure disorder

Seizures have occurred in toxicology studies at 7-25 times human ceftaroline Cmax levels (see section 5.3). Clinical study experience with ceftaroline fosamil in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders is very limited. Therefore, Zinforo should be used with caution in this patient population.

Direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion and potential risk of haemolytic anaemia The development of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT) may occur during treatment with cephalosporins. The incidence of DAGT seroconversion in patients receiving ceftaroline fosamil was 11.2% in the five pooled pivotal studies with administration every 12 hours (600 mg administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours) and 32.3% in a study in patients receiving ceftaroline fosamil every 8 hours (600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 8 hours), (see section 4.8). In clinical studies there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive DAGT on treatment. However, the possibility that haemolytic anaemia may occur in association with cephalosporins including Zinforo treatment cannot be ruled out. Patients experiencing anaemia during or after treatment with Zinforo should be investigated for this possibility.

## Limitations of the clinical data

There is no experience with ceftaroline in the treatment of CAP in the following patient groups: the immunocompromised, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, severe underlying lung disease (e.g. cystic fibrosis, see section 5.2), those with PORT Risk Class V, and/or CAP requiring ventilation at presentation, CAP due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus or patients requiring intensive care. Caution is advised when treating such patients.

There is no experience with ceftaroline in the treatment of cSSTI in the following patient groups: the immunocompromised, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, perirectal abscess and patients with third degree and extensive burns. There is limited experience in treating patients with diabetic foot infections. Caution is advised when treating such patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are limited clinical trial data on the use of ceftaroline to treat cSSTI caused by S. aureus with an MIC of &gt; 1 mg/L. The recommended dosages of Zinforo shown in Tables 1 to 4 for the treatment of cSSTI caused by S. aureus with ceftaroline MIC of 2 or 4 mg/L are based on pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic modelling and simulation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Zinforo should not be used to treat cSSTI due to S. aureus for which the ceftaroline MIC is &gt; 4 mg/L.

The recommended dosage of Zinforo shown in Table 2 for paediatric patients &lt; 2 months of age are based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation.

Infusion times of less than 60 minutes are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses only.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ceftaroline fosamil.

The interaction potential of ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil on medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes is expected to be low since they are not inhibitors nor inducers of CYP450 enzymes in vitro . Ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil are not metabolised by CYP450 enzymes in vitro , therefore co-administered CYP450 inducers or inhibitors are unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline.

Ceftaroline is neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor of renal uptake transporters (OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3) in vitro . Therefore, interactions of ceftaroline with medicinal products that are substrates or inhibitors (e.g. probenecid) of these transporters would not be expected.

## Paediatric population

As with adults, the interaction potential is expected to be low in paediatrics.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ceftaroline fosamil in pregnant women. Animal studies conducted in rat and rabbit do not indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at exposures similar to therapeutic concentrations. Following administration throughout pregnancy and lactation in the rat, there was no effect on pup birth weight or growth, although minor changes in foetal weight and delayed ossification of the interparietal bone were observed when ceftaroline fosamil was administered during organogenesis (see section 5.3).

As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Zinforo during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with an antibiotic with Zinforo's antibacterial profile.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether ceftaroline fosamil or ceftaroline is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Zinforo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

The effects of ceftaroline fosamil on fertility on humans have not been studied. Animal studies with ceftaroline fosamil do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Undesirable effects e.g. dizziness may occur and this may have an effect on the ability to drive and use of machines (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 3% of approximately 3242 patients treated with Zinforo in clinical studies were diarrhoea, headache, nausea, and pruritus, and were generally mild or moderate in severity. Clostridium difficile -associated disease (CDAD) and severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur.

A greater incidence of rash in Asian patients (see below) and a greater incidence of DAGT seroconversion (see section 4.4) were observed in a study of adult patients with cSSTI conducted with Zinforo 600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 8 hours.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials and post-marketing experience with Zinforo. Adverse reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency categories are derived according to the following conventions: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Kounis Syndrome

Acute coronary syndrome associated with an allergic reaction (Kounis syndrome) has been reported with other beta-lactam antibiotics.

## Rash

Rash was observed at a common frequency in both the pooled Phase III studies in cSSTI with administration of Zinforo every 12 hours (600 mg administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours) and the study in cSSTI with administration every 8 hours (600 mg administered over 120 minutes every 8 hours). However, the frequency of rash in the subgroup of Asian patients receiving Zinforo every 8 hours was very common (18.5%).

## Paediatric population

The safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the safety data from 2 trials in which 227 patients aged from 2 months to 17 years with cSSTI or CAP received Zinforo. Overall, the safety profile in these 227 patients was similar to that observed in the adult population.

In addition, the safety assessment in neonates is based on the safety data from 2 trials in which 34 patients (age range from birth to less than 60 days) received Zinforo; 23 of these patients received only a single dose of Zinforo. Overall, the adverse events reported in these studies were consistent with the known safety profile for Zinforo.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Limited data in patients receiving higher than recommended Zinforo dosages show similar adverse reactions as observed in the patients receiving recommended dosages. Treatment of overdose should follow standard medical practice.

## Patients with renal impairment

Relative overdosing could occur in patients with moderate renal impairment. Neurological sequelae, including encephalopathy, have been noted in cases where beta-lactam antibiotics (including cephalosporins) have been given to patients with impaired renal function without reducing the dose (see section 4.2).

Ceftaroline can be removed by haemodialysis; over a 4 hour dialysis period, approximately 74% of a given dose was recovered in the dialysate.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, other cephalosporins and penems, ATC code: J01DI02

The active moiety after Zinforo administration is ceftaroline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

Ceftaroline is a cephalosporin antibacterial with in vitro activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The bactericidal action of ceftaroline is mediated through binding to essential penicillinbinding proteins (PBPs). Biochemical studies have shown that ceftaroline has high affinity for PBP2a of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and PBP2x of penicillin non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP). As a result, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftaroline against a proportion of these organisms tested fall into the susceptible range (see Resistance section below).

## Resistance

Ceftaroline is not active against strains of Enterobacterales producing extended-spectrum betalactamases (ESBLs) from the TEM, SHV or CTX-M families, serine carbapenemases (such as KPC), class B metallo-beta-lactamases or class C (AmpC) cephalosporinases. Organisms that express these enzymes and which are therefore resistant to ceftaroline occur at very variable rates between countries and between healthcare facilities within countries. If ceftaroline is commenced before susceptibility test results are available then local information on the risk of encountering organisms that express these enzymes should be taken into consideration. Resistance may also be mediated by bacterial impermeability or drug efflux pump mechanisms. One or more of these mechanisms may co-exist in a single bacterial isolate.

## Interaction with other antibacterial agents

In vitro studies have not demonstrated any antagonism between ceftaroline in combination with other commonly used antibacterial agents (e.g. amikacin, azithromycin, aztreonam, daptomycin, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, tigecycline, and vancomycin).

## Susceptibility testing breakpoints

MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing have been established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for ceftaroline fosamil and are listed here: https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/other/minimuminhibitory-concentration-mic-breakpoints\\_en.xlsx

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship

As with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the percent time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the infecting organism over the dosing interval (%T &gt; MIC) has been shown to be the parameter that best correlates with the efficacy of ceftaroline.

## Clinical efficacy against specific pathogens

Efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the pathogens listed under each indication that were susceptible to ceftaroline in vitro .

## Complicated skin and soft tissue infections

## Gram-positive micro-organisms

- Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains)
- Streptococcus pyogenes
- Streptococcus agalactiae
- Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus , S. intermedius , and S. constellatus )
- Streptococcus dysgalactiae

## Gram-negative micro-organisms

- Escherichia coli
- Klebsiella pneumoniae
- Klebsiella oxytoca
- Morganella morganii

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Community-acquired pneumonia

No cases of CAP due to MRSA were enrolled into the studies. The available clinical data cannot substantiate efficacy against penicillin non-susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae .

## Gram-positive micro-organisms

- Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only)

## Gram-negative micro-organisms

- Escherichia coli
- Haemophilus influenzae
- Haemophilus parainfluenzae
- Klebsiella pneumoniae

## Antibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens

Clinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to ceftaroline in the absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance:

## Anaerobic micro-organisms

## Gram-positive micro-organisms

- Peptostreptococcus spp.

## Gram-negative micro-organisms

- Fusobacterium spp.

In vitro data indicate that the following species are not susceptible to ceftaroline:

- Chlamydophila spp.
- Legionella spp.
- Mycoplasma spp.
- Proteus spp.
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The Cmax and AUC of ceftaroline increase approximately in proportion to dose within the single dose range of 50 to 1000 mg. No appreciable accumulation of ceftaroline is observed following multiple intravenous infusions of 600 mg every 8 or 12 hours in healthy adults with CrCL &gt; 50 mL/min.

## Distribution

The plasma protein binding of ceftaroline is low (approximately 20%) and ceftaroline is not distributed into erythrocytes. The median steady-state volume of distribution of ceftaroline in healthy adult males following a single 600 mg intravenous dose of radiolabelled ceftaroline fosamil was 20.3 l, similar to the volume of extracellular fluid.

## Biotransformation

Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is converted into the active ceftaroline in plasma by phosphatase enzymes and concentrations of the prodrug are measurable in plasma primarily during intravenous infusion. Hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of ceftaroline occurs to form the microbiologically inactive, open-ring metabolite, ceftaroline M-1. The mean plasma ceftaroline M-1 to ceftaroline AUC ratio following a single 600 mg intravenous infusion of ceftaroline fosamil in healthy subjects is approximately 20-30%.

In pooled human liver microsomes, metabolic turnover was low for ceftaroline, indicating that ceftaroline is not metabolised by hepatic CYP450 enzymes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Ceftaroline is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Renal clearance of ceftaroline is approximately equal, or slightly lower than the glomerular filtration rate in the kidney, and in vitro transporter studies indicate that active secretion does not contribute to the renal elimination of ceftaroline.

The mean terminal elimination half-life of ceftaroline in healthy adults is approximately 2.5 hours.

Following the administration of a single 600 mg intravenous dose of radiolabelled ceftaroline fosamil to healthy male adults, approximately 88% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 6% in faeces.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

Dosage adjustments are required in adults, adolescents and children with CrCL ≤ 50 mL/min (see section 4.2).

There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in adolescents with ESRD aged from 12 to &lt; 18 years and with bodyweight &lt; 33 kg and in children with ESRD aged from 2 to &lt; 12 years. There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustments in paediatric patients aged &lt; 2 years with moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline in patients with hepatic impairment has not been established. As ceftaroline does not appear to undergo significant hepatic metabolism, the systemic clearance of ceftaroline is not expected to be significantly affected by hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.

## Elderly

Following administration of a single 600 mg intravenous dose of ceftaroline fosamil, the pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline were similar between healthy elderly subjects (≥ 65 years of age), and healthy young adult subjects (18-45 years of age). There was a 33% increase in AUC0-∞ in the elderly that was mainly attributable to age-related changes in renal function. Zinforo dose adjustment is not required in elderly patients with creatinine clearance above 50 mL/min.

## Paediatric population

Dose adjustments are required for neonates, infants, children and adolescents with bodyweight &lt; 33 kg (see section 4.2).

## Patients with cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis patients were excluded from CAP clinical trials.

Some case reports and published studies suggest the need for a higher dose of ceftaroline fosamil in cystic fibrosis patients due to possibility of altered ceftaroline pharmacokinetics leading to sub-therapeutic levels. Results from a population pharmacokinetic study, based on data pooled from various studies, overall showed no significant, clinically relevant differences in ceftaroline pharmacokinetic parameters in cystic fibrosis patients (age 6 years and above). Ceftaroline clearance was similar between cystic fibrosis patients and patients with CAP or cSSTI while ceftaroline central volume was similar to healthy subjects.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The kidney was the primary target organ of toxicity in both the monkey and rat. Histopathologic findings included pigment deposition and inflammation of the tubular epithelium. Renal changes were not reversible but were reduced in severity following a 4 week recovery period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Convulsions have been observed at relatively high exposures during single and multi-dose studies in both the rat and monkey (≥ 7 times to the estimated ceftaroline Cmax level of a 600 mg twice a day).

Other important toxicologic findings noted in the rat and monkey included histopathologic changes in the bladder and spleen.

## Genetic toxicology

Ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline were clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, however there was no evidence of mutagenic activity in an Ames test, mouse lymphoma and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. Furthermore, in vivo micronucleus assays in rat and mouse were negative. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted.

## Reproductive toxicology

Overall, no adverse effects on fertility or post-natal development were observed in the rat at up to 5 times the observed clinical exposure. When ceftaroline was administered during organogenesis, minor changes in foetal weight and delayed ossification of the interparietal bone were observed in the rat at exposures below that observed clinically. However, when ceftaroline was administered throughout pregnancy and lactation, there was no effect on pup weight or growth. Ceftaroline administration to pregnant rabbits resulted in an increased foetal incidence of angulated hyoid alae, a common skeletal variation in rabbit fetuses, at exposures similar to those observed clinically.

## Juvenile toxicity

Intravenous bolus dosing of ceftaroline fosamil to suckling rats from post-natal day 7 to 20 was well tolerated at plasma exposures approximately 2-fold higher than those for paediatric patients. Renal cortical cysts were observed in all groups, including controls, on PND50. The cysts involved a small portion of the kidney and occurred in the absence of significant changes in either renal function or urinary parameters. Therefore, these findings were not considered to be adverse.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Zinforo is and what it is used for

## What Zinforo is

Zinforo is an antibiotic medicine that contains the active substance ceftaroline fosamil. It belongs to a group of medicines called 'cephalosporin antibiotics.'

## What Zinforo is used for

Zinforo is used to treat children (from birth) and adults with:

- infections of the skin and the tissues below the skin
- an infection of the lungs called 'pneumonia'

## How Zinforo works

Zinforo works by killing certain bacteria, which can cause serious infections.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Zinforo

## Do not use Zinforo:

- If you are allergic to ceftaroline fosamil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- If you are allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics
- If you have had previous severe allergic reactions to other antibiotics like penicillin or carbapenem.

Do not use Zinforo if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before using Zinforo.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Zinforo:

- If you have kidney problems (your doctor may have to prescribe a lower dose)
- If you have ever had fits (seizures or convulsions)
- If you have ever had any non-severe allergic reactions to other antibiotics like penicillin or carbapenem

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · If you have had severe diarrhoea whilst taking antibiotics in the past

You may get another infection caused by another bacteria during or following treatment with Zinforo.

You may develop signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to these serious skin reactions described in section 4.

## Lab Test

You may develop an abnormal lab test (called Coombs test) that looks for certain antibodies which may act against your red blood cells. If the level of your red blood cells fall your doctor may check to see if these antibodies have caused this.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before using Zinforo.

## Other medicines and Zinforo

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Tell your doctor before using Zinforo if you are pregnant. Do not use this medicine during pregnancy unless your doctor has told you to.

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

Zinforo may cause side effects such as dizziness. This may impair your ability to drive or operate machinery.

## 3. How to use Zinforo

Zinforo will be given to you by a doctor or nurse.

## How much to use

The usual recommended dose for adults is 600 mg every 12 hours. Your doctor may increase your dose to 600 mg every 8 hours for some infections. The usual recommended dose for children depends on the age and weight of the child and is given every 8 or 12 hours. It is given as a drip into a vein lasting 5 to 60 minutes if you receive the usual dose or 120 minutes if you receive an increased dose.

A course of treatment usually lasts for 5 to 14 days for skin infections and 5 to 7 days for pneumonia.

## Patients with kidney problems

If you have kidney problems your doctor may lower your dose because Zinforo is removed from your body by the kidneys.

## If you use more Zinforo than you should

If you think you have been given too much Zinforo, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.

## If you miss a dose of Zinforo

If you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following side effects may happen with this medicine:

## Tell your doctor straight away if you get these symptoms as you may need urgent medical treatment:

- Severe skin reactions (not known, frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)
- o Reddish non-elevated, target-like or circular patches on the trunk, often with central blisters, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes. These serious skin rashes can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).
- o Widespread rash, high body temperature and enlarged lymph nodes (DRESS syndrome or drug hypersensitivity syndrome).
- Sudden swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue; a severe rash; and, swallowing or breathing problems. These may be signs of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and may be lifethreatening.
- Diarrhoea that becomes severe or does not go away or stool that contains blood or mucus during or after treatment with Zinforo. In this situation, you should not take medicines that stop or slow bowel movement.

## Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)

- Changes in a blood test called a 'Coombs test' commonly seen in patients receiving this type of antibiotic. This test looks for certain antibodies which may act against your red blood cells.

## Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

- Fever
- Headache
- Feeling dizzy
- Itching, skin rash
- Diarrhoea, stomach pain
- Feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
- More enzymes produced by your liver (as shown in blood tests)
- Pain and irritation of the veins
- Redness, pain or swelling where the injection was given.

## Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)

- Anaemia
- Raised itchy rash (hives)
- An increase in the level of creatinine in your blood. Creatinine shows how well your kidneys are working.
- Bleeding or bruising more than usual. This may be because the level of platelets in your blood has dropped.
- Changes in tests which measure how well your blood clots.
- A decrease in the total number of white blood cells, ora certain type of white blood cells in your blood (leucopenia and neutropenia).
- Changes in your mental state such as confusion, reduced level of consciousness, abnormal movements or fits (encephalopathy) - these have occurred in people when the dose they are given is too high, particularly in people with kidney problems.

## Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)

- A significant decrease in the number of certain white blood cells in your blood (agranulocytosis). You may experience fever, flu-like symptoms, sore throat, or any other infection which may be serious.
- An increase in the number of certain white blood cells in your blood (eosinophilia).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- A form of lung disease where eosinophils (a form of white blood cell) appear in the lung in increased numbers (eosinophilic pneumonia).

Sudden chest pain, which may be a sign of a potentially serious allergic reaction called Kounis syndrome has been noted with other medicines of the same type. If this happens talk to a doctor or nurse immediately.

## Other sources of information

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: https://www.ema.europa.eu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:

Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics before prescribing.

Aseptic technique must be followed in preparing the infusion solution. The contents of Zinforo vial should be reconstituted with 20 mL of sterile water for injections. Instructions for the reconstitution of Zinforo vial are summarized below:

|   Dosage strength (mg) |   Volume of diluent to be added (mL) |   Approximate ceftaroline concentration (mg/mL) | Amount to be withdrawn   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|                    600 |                                   20 |                                              30 | Total volume             |

The reconstituted solution must be further diluted to produce Zinforo solution for infusion. A 250 mL, 100 mL or 50 mL infusion bag can be used to prepare the infusion, based on the patient's volume requirements. Appropriate infusion diluents include: sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, dextrose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL and dextrose 25 mg/mL solution for injection (0.45% sodium chloride and 2.5% dextrose) or Lactated Ringer's solution. The resulting solution should be administered according to the dose selected over 5 to 60 minutes for standard dose or 120 minutes for high dose in infusion volumes of 50 mL, 100 mL or 250 mL.

Infusion volumes for paediatric patients will vary according to the weight of the child. The infusion solution concentration during preparation and administration should not exceed 12 mg/mL ceftaroline fosamil.

Reconstitution time is less than 2 minutes. Mix gently to reconstitute and check to see that the contents have dissolved completely. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The colour of Zinforo infusion solutions ranges from clear, light to dark yellow depending on the concentration and storage conditions. It is free of any particles. When stored as recommended, the product potency is not affected.

The chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 12 hours at 2-8 °C and 6 hours at 25 ºC.

From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of opening/reconstitution/dilution precludes the risk of microbial contamination the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.

The compatibility of Zinforo with other medicines has not been established. Zinforo should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs.

Each vial is for single use only.

Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Annex IV

## Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ceftaroline fosamil, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) from the literature and spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between ceftaroline fosamil and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing ceftaroline fosamil should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ceftaroline fosamil the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ceftaroline fosamil is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
