## 1. Introduction

On November 11 th  2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study A8081056 for Crizotinib, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has been also provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study A8081056, an open label expanded access protocol for the treatment of up to approximately 40 adult or pediatric (defined as age &lt;18 years) patients with tumors harboring either a chromosomal translocation or activating mutation involving the ALK or ROS1 gene or an activating genetic alteration involving the cMET gene who cannot swallow the crizotinib capsule but may be able to derive  benefit  from  treatment  with  an  alternative  oral  formulation  of  crizotinib  is  part  of  a  clinical development program.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The alternative oral formulations were an oral solution and coated microsphere formulation, both of which demonstrated bioequivalence to the formulated capsule.

Crizotinib oral solution containing crizotinib (25 mg/mL), or coated microspheres were encapsulated to 3 dose strengths (20 mg, 40 mg, and 120 mg of crizotinib). The microspheres were dosed by opening the capsules then emptying the contents onto a dosing spoon and were administered with water. The capsules were not to be swallowed whole and were only to be taken as directed in the dosing instructions.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for:

Study A8081056: Crizotinib (Xalkori) Expanded Access Protocol for the Treatment of Adult or Pediatric Patients with solid or hematologic malignancies that harbor a crizotinib-sensitive molecular alteration but who are unable to swallow crizotinib capsules

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study A8081056, is an open label expanded access protocol for the treatment of up to approximately 40 adult or pediatric (defined as age &lt;18 years) patients with tumors harboring either a chromosomal translocation or activating mutation involving the ALK or ROS1 gene or an activating genetic alteration involving the cMET gene who cannot swallow the crizotinib capsule but may be able to derive benefit from treatment with an alternative oral formulation of crizotinib (coated microspheres).

## Description

Crizotinib is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test. Commercially available dosage forms are 250 mg and 200 mg capsules. This expanded access protocol (EAP) is designed to provide access to an alternative oral formulation of crizotinib for those patients who are unable to swallow capsules.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Treatments

For adult patients, crizotinib 250 mg BID will be administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule, ie, without break in dosing. For pediatric patients, crizotinib 280 mg/m2 BID will be administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule, ie, without break in dosing.

## Objective(s)

The objective of the study was to use expanded access to evaluate the safety of an alternative oral formulation (the oral liquid formulation or coated microsphere formulation) of crizotinib with tumours harbouring either a chromosomal translocation or activating mutation involving the ALK or ROS1 gene or an activating genetic alteration involving the c-MET gene, who had a genetic aberration involving ALK, ROS1, or c-MET but who could not swallow crizotinib capsules.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Study objectives and endpoints are provided in Table 1 below:

Table 1 Study Objectives and Endpoints

| Type   | Objective                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Endpoints                                                         |

| Safety | To use expanded access to evaluate the safety of an alternative oral formulation (the oral liquid formulation or coated microsphere formulation) of crizotinib in up to approximately 40 patients with tumors harboring either a chromosomal translocation or activating mutation involving theALK or ROS1 gene or an activating genetic alteration involving the c-MET gene, who had a genetic aberration involving ALK, ROS1, or c-MET but who could not swallow crizotinib capsules. | All SAEs and Grade 3-5 adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03. |

## Study participants

## Main eligibility criteria:

1- Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of a primary or metastatic malignancy that is positive for a chromosomal translocation or activating mutation involving the ALK or ROS1 gene or an activating genetic alteration involving the cMET gene, as determined by local clinical testing that is appropriately validated in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines and/or practice standards (patients with tumours harbouring other genetic alterations that may potentially benefit from treatment with crizotinib eg NTRK3 ETV6 fusion gene may be considered on a case by case basis subject to approval by the sponsor),

2- Inability to swallow crizotinib capsules, adult patients of whom must either have a feeding tube in place or have completed clinical evaluation of dysphagia without any reversible causes identified,

3- At least 12 months of age (patients &lt;12 months of age will be evaluated on a case by case basis and discussed with the sponsor)

An infinite lag time is applied for this study.

Per protocol, Grade 3-5 Adverse Events and all Serious Adverse Events were to be recorded. Unsolicited Grade 1-2 Adverse Events have also been recorded and are presented in tables.

Except for the Number of Adverse Events Participants are counted only once per treatment in each row.

Serious Adverse Events - according to the investigator's assessment.

a. Participants who have an AE record that indicates that the AE caused the participant to be discontinued from the study. MedDRA v27.0 coding dictionary applied.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

No new safety signals were identified from the safety profile of the 14 paediatric patients treated with the alternative oral formulation of crizotinib (coated microspheres) as part of the open label expanded access  protocol  (Study  A8081056).  The  most  frequent  grade  3  and  4  treatment-related  AE  were neutropenia and diarrhoea which is consistent with the known safety profile of crizotinib hard capsule. There was one death in the paediatric population reported during the study due to disease progression.

Although the number of patients exposed is small and the median of treatment limited, the alternative oral crizotinib formulations could be considered as tolerated in the treated population with no new safety signals identified.

Benefit-risk balance remains unchanged.
