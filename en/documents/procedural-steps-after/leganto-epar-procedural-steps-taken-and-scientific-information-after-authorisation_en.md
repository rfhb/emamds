disorders when using medicinal products containing levodopa, dopamine agonists and/or Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, the CHMP/PhVWP recommended a class labelling to update and harmonise the product information of all products concerned. To this end, the product information was updated to reflect related behavioural symptoms including compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating and that the adverse reaction can occur irrespective of the indication and at normal doses. Regular monitoring of patients and a careful review of treatment, if symptoms occur, is recommended. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance and advice for the patient's family and carers was provided.
