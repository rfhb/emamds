## Introduction

On  February  2015,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Rasilez  (aliskiren),  in accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  A  short  critical  expert overview has also been provided.

Prevalence  of  hypertension  in  children  has  been  increasing  worldwide  driven  by  the  increasing prevalence of childhood obesity (Din-Dzietham et al, 2007, Flynn, 2008). Hypertension in children and adolescents is defined as average systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is  ≥  95th  percentile  for  gender,  age,  and  height  on  at  least  three  separate  occasions  (NHBPEP  4th Report, 2004). Primary (essential) hypertension in children is usually associated with a positive family history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, and clusters with other cardiovascular disease risk factors or comorbidities including obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Renal parenchymal and renovascular diseases are the most common causes of secondary hypertension in children (Riley et al, 2012).

The  renin  angiotensin  aldosterone  system  (RAAS)  plays  a  major  role  in  the  regulation  of  blood pressure (BP) and the pathogenesis of hypertension. Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to a decrease in circulating volume and BP. It cleaves the substrate angiotensinogen to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Angiotensin I is converted to the active octapeptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II interacts with cellular receptors (Ang II receptors) and through different mechanisms increases total peripheral resistance, resulting in the elevation of BP.

Blocking  the  RAAS  with  an  ACE  inhibitor  (ACEI)  or  Angiotensin  II  receptor  blocker  (ARB)  has  been commonly used in clinical practice for the treatment of patients, including children, with hypertension (Chu  et  al,  2014).  An  alternative  approach  to  blockade  of  the  RAAS  is  inhibition  of  renin,  the  rate limiting enzyme for the formation of Ang II. Aliskiren (SPP100) is the first in class, orally active, nonpeptide, specific direct renin inhibitor and blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I.

It is approved in EU for treatment of hypertension in adults.

## Information on the development program

Aliskiren's  safety  and  efficacy  are  well  established  in  adults  and  it  is  approved  for  treatment  of hypertension in adults, except in patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and are receiving an ACEI or  an  ARB  [aliskiren  Investigator  Brochure,  edition  16].  The  study  CSPP100A2365  was  designed  to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of aliskiren in the pediatric population aged 6-17 years.

The MAH stated that study title and number is part of a clinical development program.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study&lt;ies&gt;

The investigational drug (SPP100, aliskiren) was provided by Novartis Drug Supply Management (DSM) equaling 6.25 mg/37.5 mg/150 mg dosage strengths.

## Clinical study Methods

## Study number and title

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CSPP100A2365  -  A  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  8  week  study  to  evaluate  the  dose response, efficacy and safety of aliskiren in peadiatric hypertensive patients 6-17 years of age.

The  study  CSPP100A2365  is  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  8-week  study  in  pediatric hypertensive patients with ages 6-17 years.

## Objective(s)

The primary objectives of this study were:

- In Phase 1 (dose response phase), to evaluate the dose response of aliskiren in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) change at end of Phase 1, from the baseline to Week 4, as measured by office BP.

-  In  Phase  2  (placebo-controlled  withdrawal phase), to evaluate pooled treatment effect of aliskiren (mid and high doses) in msSBP change at end of Phase 2, from the end of Phase 1 (at the beginning of Week 5),compared to placebo pooled from corresponding arms, as measured by office BP.

The secondary objectives of  this  study  were  the  followings:  safety  and  tolerability  of  aliskiren,  dose response  of  aliskiren  in  mean  sitting  diastolic  blood  pressure  (msDBP,  office  BP),  effect  of  aliskiren (mid and high doses) in msDBP change compared to placebo, dose response of aliskiren in calculated mean  arterial  pressure  (MAP,  office  BP),  treatment  effect  of  aliskiren  (mid  and  high  doses)  in calculated MAP change compared to placebo, the rate of positive treatment response by dose group (positive response = msSBP &lt; 95th percentile or a 7 mmHg decrease in msSBP from the baseline), the effect of aliskiren on the 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) with focus on mean systolic and diastolic ABPM, daytime and nighttime ABPM, dipper vs. non-dipper pattern (nondipper = &lt; 10% decline in nighttime mean vs. the daytime mean in ABPM).

The exploratory objectives of this study were the followings: the relationship between change in PRA and the dose of aliskiren, the relationship between change in PRA from baseline at the end of Phase 1 and age, the relationship between baseline PRA, disease factors and BP response, age and dose.

Patients  successfully  completing  this  study  were  offered  to  participate  in  a  52-week,  double-blind, randomized extension study (CSPP100A2365E1) aimed to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of aliskiren compared to enalapril.

## Study design

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 8-week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aliskiren  in  pediatric  hypertensive  patients  6-17  years  of  age.  The  study  consisted  of  3  phases  as defined below (Figure 9-1):

- Screening phase: A single-blind placebo wash-out for up to a maximum of three weeks (21 days).

- Phase 1: A four week (28 day) randomized, double-blind dose-response phase consisting of 3 aliskiren dose groups: low (6.25/12.5/25 mg), mid (37.5/75/150 mg), and high dose (150/300/600 mg) according to weight. The dose ratio for all three dose groups were the same for the low-weight ( ≥ 20 to &lt; 50 kg), the mid-weight ( ≥ 50 kg to &lt; 80 kg) and the high-weight ( ≥ 80 kg to ≤ 150 kg) patients with a low: mid: high dose ratio of 1:6:24. Patients were stratified at baseline by weight ( ≥ 20 to &lt; 50 kg; ≥ 50 kg to &lt; 80 kg and ≥ 80 kg to ≤ 150 kg), age (6-11 and 12-17 years old), region (US, EU and ROW, as applicable), and by hypertension etiology (primary vs. secondary). For Phase 1,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients were randomized to aliskiren low, mid and high dosing groups in a 2:1:2 ratio and were dosed based on their weight category at randomization as shown in Table 9-1.

- Phase 2: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal phase of up to four weeks (28 days). Patients either continued the aliskiren treatment assigned during Phase I or were switched to placebo.

|-----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Weight Category | Low Dose                        | Mid Dose                        | High Dose                     |
| ≥20 to <50 kg   | 6.25 mg o.d (0.13 - 0.31 mg/kg) | 37.5 mg o.d (0.75 - 1.88 mg/kg) | 150 mg o.d (3.0 -7.5 mg/kg)   |
| ≥50 to <80 kg   | 12.5 mg o.d (0.16 - 0.25 mg/kg) | 75 mg o.d (0.94 - 1.5 mg/kg)    | 300 mg o.d (3.75 - 6.0 mg/kg) |
| ≥80 to ≤ 150 kg | 25 mg o.d (0.17 - 0.31 mg/kg)   | 150 mg o.d (1.0 - 1.88 mg/kg)   | 600 mg o.d (4.0 - 7.5 mg/kg)  |

*Patients were stratified by weight; patients weighing ≥ 20kg to &lt; 50 kg received the lower dose indicated in each treatment arm, patients weighing ≥ 50 kg to &lt; 80 kg received the mid dose indicated treatment amm.

The study design was discussed and agreed with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Pediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as an adequate design to characterize the efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren  in  pediatric  patients.  The  study  follows  the  FDA  trial  design  C  which avoids use of a true placebo arm and ensures interpretability of results. A negative slope of the dose response phase would indicate that the study was successful (Pasquali et al, 2002). In case the dose response  phase  is  uninterpretable  (zero  slope,  drug  effective  at  all  studied  doses),  the  placebocontrolled withdrawal phase would be used to help differentiate the efficacy of the drug. Study design C is the most commonly used trial design in pediatric hypertension (Benjamin et al, 2008).

The duration of the dose response phase (4 weeks) was based on data from studies conducted with aliskiren  in  adults  showing  that  a  substantial  proportion  (85%-90%)  of  the  BP  lowering  effect  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment, and near-maximal effect was reached by 4 weeks. The duration of the placebo-controlled withdrawal phase (4 weeks) was based on the long half-life (3441 hours) of aliskiren and the results of withdrawal trials in adults which showed that 60% of the BP reduction  effect  was  maintained  at  week  2  following  cessation  of  treatment  [aliskiren  Investigator Brochure, edition 16].

msSBP was the primary endpoint (and entry criteria) because systolic hypertension is more prevalent than  diastolic  hypertension  in  children.  Clinical  studies  indicate  that  SBP  change  is  often  better correlated with clinical outcome (cardiovascular mortality and morbidity) than DBP, although no such data  is  available  in  children.  Secondary  endpoints  included  msDBP,  MAP,  rates  of  responders  and ambulatory  blood  pressure  (mean  arterial  systolic  BP  [MASBP]  and  mean  arterial  diastolic  BP [MADBP]).

## Study population

The study population consisted of approximately 275 male and female children, 6 to 17 years of age at randomization (Visit 2), with msSBP ≥ 95th percentile for age, gender and height measured by office BP. It was estimated that, at randomization:

- at least 50% of patients would be 11 years old or younger
- at least 10% of the patient population would have secondary hypertension by history
- at least 80% of the patient population would be ≤ 100 kg.

A  total  of  255  patients  were  expected  to  complete  Phase  1,  and  approximately  237  patients  were expected to complete Phase 2.

Inclusion criteria were the followings:

-  Male  or  female,  aged  6-17  years  with  a  documented  diagnosis  of  hypertension  as  defined  in  the NHBPEP 4th Report, 2004 (msSBP as mean of 3 measurements) must have been ≥ 95th percentile for age, gender and height, at Visit 2)

- Weighed ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 150 kg at randomization (Visit 2)

-  Were  able  to  safely  wash  out  prior  antihypertensive  therapy  for  a  minimum  of  7  days  if  already receiving treatment

- Were able to swallow
- written informed consent of their parent(s)/guardian(s) consented.

Exclusion criteria were clinically abnormalities or abnormal lab values including the followings:

- high AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT or high total bilirubin
- creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m² (modified Schwartz formula),
- low White Blood Cells (WBC) count, low Platelet count,
- high serum potassium (&gt; 5.2 mEq/L),
- renal artery stenosis, history of angioedema, heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) or cardio-myopathy or obstructive valvular disease, severe hypertension (msSBP ≥ 25% above the 95th percentile),
- second or third degree heart block without a pacemaker or atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or any symptomatic arrhythmia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- solid organ transplantation
- treatment with immunosuppressant medication (e.g. cyclosporine, MMF, etc.) other than oral/topical steroids, for any medical condition
-  treatment  with  atorvastatin,  cholestyramine  or  colestipol  resins,  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO) inhibitors, ketoconazole, itraconazole, or antiarrhythmic medications (other than digoxin)
- child-bearing potential or pregnancy or nursing (lactating) women,
- hypersensitivity to study medication or to any drug of similar chemical class.

For detailed exclusion criteria, please refer to Appendix 16.1.1-Study Protocol-Section 5.2.

## Sample size

For the analysis of Phase 1, a total sample size of 200 patients was required to provide at least 90% power to detect a non-zero slope of 0.239 for change from baseline in msSBP (mmHg) as a linear function  of  aliskiren  dose  ratio  (1:6:24)  at  a  two-sided  significance  level  of  0.05.  This  calculation assumed a 2:1:2 patient allocation ratio to aliskiren low, mid and high dosing groups respectively. The (pooled) standard deviation from valsartan study CVAL489A2302 was estimated as 11 mm Hg, so this was  used  in  the  current  calculation.  A  slope  of  0.239  (mmHg  per  unit  increase  in  dose  ratio) corresponds to 5.5 mmHg reduction in SBP from low dose (6.25/12.5 mg) to high dose (150/600 mg). Considering  a  7%  dropout  rate,  a  total  of  216  patients  were  required  for  Phase  1  to  achieve  90% lower.

For the analysis of Phase 2, a total sample size of 237 patients (with 1:1 patient allocation ratio for placebo and aliskiren) was required to provide at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference in change from end of Phase 1 in msSBP of 5.5 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 10 mmHg at a twosided significance level of 0.05. The standard deviations for the change from end of Phase 1 in mean sitting SBP for the primary and secondary hypertension groups in the valsartan study CVAL489A2302 were  estimated  as  9.40  mmHg  and  9.98  mmHg,  respectively.  The  standard  deviations  in  both hypertension  groups  were  smaller  than  the  standard  deviation  considered  in  this  calculation. Considering  a  7%  dropout  rate,  a  total  of  255  patients  were  required  for  Phase  2  to  achieve  90% power. This required that 275 patients be entered into Phase 1, so that the expected 255 patients continued into Phase 2.

The sample size of 275 patients was required to achieve at least 90% power for testing the primary hypothesis in each phase at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. It was expected that the proportion of  patients  with  primary  hypertension  would  be  at  least  60%,  so  based  on  the  assumptions  of  the standard deviation and treatment effects, the planned sample size of 275 randomized patients should result  in  at  least  90%  power  for  testing  the  primary  hypothesis  in  each  phase,  at  a  two-sided significance level of 0.05.

## Treatments

The following study medications were provided in a double-blind fashion:

- Investigational drug: SPP100 (aliskiren) 6.25, 37.5 mg and 150 mg
- Control drug: placebo to SPP100 (aliskiren)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All test materials were supplied by Novartis Drug Supply Management (DSM).

A dose ratio of 1:6:24 (low : mid : high) was selected to try to ensure no efficacy overlap between the three dose groups selected for this study, which has been shown to be a factor in the success of dose response trials of antihypertensive agents in a pediatric population (Benjamin et al, 2008).

Aliskiren in adults was studied in doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg. Once daily doses of aliskiren  150  mg  and  300  mg  were  recommended  and  approved  for  use  as  monotherapy  or  in combination with other anti-hypertensive agents in adults [aliskiren Investigator Brochure, edition 16].

In addition, in study CSPP100A2256, doses of 2 and 6 mg/kg were studied in 39 hypertensive patients aged  6-17  years  with  results  showing  that  the  overall  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  findings  in  pediatric patients are similar to those seen in adults based on the body weight normalized plasma apparent total body clearance. As with adults, age, body weight, and gender appeared to have no significant effect on aliskiren  systemic  exposure.  The  exposure  levels  in  these  pediatric  patients  were  within  or  slightly below the exposure range found in adults. The aliskiren doses selected in study CSPP100A2365 (3.07.5 mg/kg for high, 0.75-1.88 mg/kg for mid and 0.13-0.31 mg/kg for low dose groups) were selected with  the  intention  of  covering  a  wider  dose  range  from  a  highly  effective  dose  (inclusive  of  a  dose higher than that used in adults (i.e. 600mg)), and also to ensure a minimally effective dose. This is consistent with recommendations for dose response studies to include a low dose that is less than the lowest  approved  adult  dose  and  a  high  dose  that  is  at  least  two-fold  higher  than  the  maximum approved adult dose (Benjamin et al, 2008).

A modelling and simulation analysis was done on interim data from CSPP100A2256 to predict a BP dose response in CSPP100A2365. Results showed that a dose response slope would be generated with mean SBP reductions of 7.3 mmHg, 10.2 mmHg and 13.6 mmHg for the low, medium and high dose groups, respectively.

Treatment  blinding: Patients,  investigator  staff,  persons  performing  the  assessments,  and  data analysts remained blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods:

Instructions  for  prescribing  and  taking  study  treatment:  Patients  were  instructed  to  withhold  study medication on the day of their next clinic visit and to bring all remaining study medication to their next clinic visit.

Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment: Study drug dose adjustments were not permitted. If a temporary interruption of study medication occurred, every attempt to re-initiate study medication was made.

Rescue medication: The use of rescue medication was not permitted in this study.

Concomitant  treatment:  Use  of  the  following  treatments  was  not  allowed:  anti-hypertension  drugs, cyclosporine, Itraconazole, potassium sparing diuretics, and/or potassium supplement, MAO inhibitors.

Uses of the following treatments were conditionally permitted after the start of the washout Period: chronic use of NSAIDS/COX-2, over the counter decongestants, stimulant therapy such as methylphenidate  for  attention  deficit  disorder/attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder,  chronic  use  of steroids,  other  drugs  provided  the  need  for  such  medication(s)  was  a  continuation  of  a  need  that existed prior to entry into the study and the manner in which the medication(s) were used remained essentially unchanged.

Patients  were  not  discontinued  from  the  study  until  the  study  monitor  had  been  contacted.  The decision  to  discontinue  a  patient  who  had  taken  any  of  these  concomitant  medications  (with  the exception  of  cyclosporine  and  itraconazole)  was  evaluated  on  a  case  by  case  basis  by  Novartis  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consultation  with  the  investigator.  Any  patient  who  had  taken  cyclosporine  or  itraconazole,  for  any indication, was to be discontinued immediately.

Discontinuation of  study  treatment  and  premature patient  withdrawal:  Study  drug  was  discontinued (and the patient withdrawn from the trial) if the investigator determined that continuing would have resulted in a significant safety risk for that patient or if, on balance, he/she thought that continuation would have been detrimental to the patient's wellbeing.

The  following  circumstances  required  study  drug  discontinuation:  withdrawal  of  informed  consent, inability to discontinue prior antihypertensive therapy for a minimum of 7 days during the SB placebo run-in, positive pregnancy test, lack of baseline (Visit 2) msSBP measurement, use of the prohibited concomitant medication, emergence of adverse events (AEs). The list of AEs included the followings:: msSBP is ≥ 25% above the 95th percentile at any time, symptomatic hypotension or msSBP ≤ 50th percentile for gender, age and height at any time, severe anemia defined as Hemoglobin &lt; 8 gm/dL, severe  leucopenia  defined  as  WBC  &lt;  3000/mm3,  pregnancy,  allergic  reaction  to  study  medication, protocol deviation resulting in significant risk, liver enzymes &gt;3 times the upper limit of the reference range not due to viral hepatitis.

Patients had the possibility to voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time.

Emergency unblinding did not occur in this study.

Treatment  exposure  and  compliance:  Treatment  exposure  and  compliance  was  assessed  by  the investigator  and/or  study  personnel  at  each  visit  using  pill  counts  and  information  provided  by  the patient.

SCR=Screening,BL=Baseline

Office BP measurements were done using an automated BP monitoring device and calibrated regularly in accordance with the Guidelines for Management of Hypertension: Report of the fourth working party of the British Hypertension Society, 2004 - BHS IV (Williams, et al 2004). Post-dose measurements were made at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post-dose), i.e. just prior to taking the daily dose of study medication.    The  measurements  were  done  using  the  non-dominant  arm;  however,  if  a  clinicallyrelevant difference (≥ 10 mmHg in SBP and/or ≥ 5 mmHg in DBP) was noted between the two arms at study entry, the arm with higher BP reading was used for subsequent study assessments. The arm used was documented in source documentation.

Sitting  BP  was measured after the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes and the average of three sitting BP measurements was used as the mean sitting office BP. Standing BP was measured only once

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at each visit, after the patient had been standing for 3 minutes and within 3-5 minutes after the last sitting BP measurement.

Self-measured blood pressure: At the first study visit all patients who were dispensed SB run-in study medication were also provided with an automated self-measuring BP device (SMBP). SMBP information was not analyzed. It was intended to be used as a guide to monitor the patient's home BP throughout the course of the trial.

Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM): ABPM assessments were anticipated to be done in at least 50% of the randomized patient population. Patients at pre-selected sites had ABPM collected over a 24-hour period at Visits 2, 4 and 6. Following office BP measurements, patients were instructed to wear  the  ABPM  device  for  24  hours.  The  ABPM  device  was  pre-set  to  collect  readings  every  20 minutes. All ABPM readings remained blinded to the patients.

Assessment of safety:  Safety  assessments  consisted  of  collecting  all  AEs,  including  serious  adverse events (SAEs), with their severity and relationship to study drug, and pregnancies. They also included the regular monitoring of laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) and regular assessments of vital signs, body height/weight and physical condition. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed at baseline (Visit 2) and Visit 6.  Echocardiography was offered to all patients at baseline, but was only required for patient with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Other safety assessments included pregnancy tests at screening, baseline, and Visit 6, Tanner stages evaluation for growth at baseline and Visit 6. Neurocognitive assessment was performed at baseline for all patients and at Visit 6  only  for  patients  who  discontinued  early  or  did  not  enter  the  extension  study.  Clinically  notable laboratory values were pre-defined.

Drug concentration measurements: At Week 2 (Visit 3), PK blood samples were planned to be collected in 30 to 50% of the patient population at a random time point post dose for population PK analysis. One (1) fasting trough PK sample was planned to be collected from every patient at the completion of the dose-response phase (Week 4 (Visit 4)).

Pharmacodynamic and biomarker assessments: Biomarkers related to hypertension and renal functions were  collected.  These  included  markers  such  as  PRA,  plasma  renin  concentration  (PRC),  urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and Cystatin C.

Data quality assurance - Monitoring: The responsibility for site monitoring resided with field monitors from Novartis or from Research Pharmaceutical Services Inc (RPS).

## Statistical Methods

The randomized sets (RAN1 and RAN2) consisted of all patients who received a randomization number at respective phases.

The full analysis sets (FAS1 and FAS2) consisted of all patients who were randomized into Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively.

The  per-protocol  sets  (PPS1  and  PPS2)  consisted  of  all  FAS  patients  who  completed  the  respective study phases without any major protocol deviations that impacted on efficacy assessment.

The safety sets (SAF1 and SAF2) consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of doubleblind study drug at respective phases.

The primary dose-response relationship was evaluated at the conclusion of Phase 1 and determined by the slope for change from baseline in msSBP. If the slope was statistically significant, then a difference among the doses had been identified. If a flat dose-response curve was found (i.e., the slope is not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

statistically different than zero), it would indicate that there are no significant differences among the aliskiren doses during the four weeks of treatment in Phase 1; then the analyses performed in Phase 2 would  be  used  to  further  interpret  whether  there  is  an  effect  on  BP  due  to  placebo  wash-out.  The primary efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS1 and FAS2. Additional analyses were performed using the PPS1 and PPS2. The analysis results in Phase 2 were used to evaluate whether there is a blood pressure effect due to placebo washout. The null hypothesis for Phase 2 was that the change from end of Phase 1 in msSBP was not different between the pooled aliskiren high and mid doses, and placebo  pooled  from  corresponding  arms  at  the  end  of  Phase  2.  An  ANCOVA  model  that  included treatment, weight, age strata, region, and hypertension status (primary vs. secondary) as factors and end of Phase 1 msSBP as a covariate, were carried out at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Summary of patient disposition for Phase 1 is presented in Table 10-1 and for Phase 2 in Table 10-2. A total of 268 patients were randomized in Phase 1 including 1 mis-randomized patient who did not take double blind medication and thus was not included in the safety (SAF1 and SAF2) or full analysis (FAS1 and FAS2) sets.

The majority of patients completed the study with 260 patients (97.0%) completing Phase 1 and 255 patients  (98.1%)  completing  Phase  2.  The  rate  of  discontinuation  due  to  any  reason  overall  during both  Phase  1  and  2  was  low  (4.5%),  generally  balanced  between  the  phases,  and  lower  than  the protocol projected discontinuation rate of 14%.

In Phase 1, 7 patients (2.6%) discontinued from the study (Table 10-1). The rate of discontinuation due to an AE was low with only 1 patient discontinuing in the aliskiren high dose group. This patient discontinued the study medication on Day 1 due to an AE that started during the single-blind placebo wash-out (stomach cramping).

Patient  disposition  for  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  were  also  presented  by  region,  center,  and  treatment group.

Patients successfully completing this study were offered the opportunity to participate in a 52-week, double-blind, randomized extension study (CSPP100A2365E1) aimed to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of aliskiren compared to enalapril. A total of 208 of the 255 patients (81.6%) completing study CSPP100A2365 enrolled in CSPP100A2365E1.

Protocol deviations are summarized for Phase 1 in Table 10-3 and for Phase 2 in Table 10-4.

In Phase 1, protocol deviations occurred in 121 patients (45.1%) of the overall randomized population, and occurred more often in the low dose group than in the mid and high dose groups. The majority of the reported protocol deviations were minor, with use of NSAIDS and visit occurring out of window being  the  most  commonly  reported  minor  protocol  deviations.  The  relatively  high  number  of  minor protocol deviations might be attributable to the longer than expected time to complete the study (4 years).

Major  protocol  deviations  occurred  in  18  patients  (6.7%)  of  the  overall  randomized  population  that excluded  them  from  the  per-protocol  analysis.  The  most  common  major  protocol  deviation  was  BP measurement  collected  not  at  trough  in  6  patients  (2.2%)  followed  by  compliance  with  study medication less than 80% in Phase 1 in 5 patients (1.9%).

## Baseline data

The key baseline demographic and background characteristics of the randomized patients in Phase 1 are  shown  in  Table  11-3.  Patients  in  the  three  treatment  groups  had  comparable  demographic  and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, race, weight, and hypertension etiology. The majority of patients were male and Caucasian with a mean age of 11.8 years. 47.8% of patients were in the 611 years age group and 51.9% in the 12-17 years age group. 53% of the patients were 12 years of age or younger. There were 30 (11.2%) black patients. Forty-eight patients (17.9%) had secondary hypertension. Mean weight was 68.6 kg with 58.6% of patients having body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile for age and gender.

Height  and  weight  were  reassessed  at  Visit  4  before  re-randomization  in  Phase  2  of  the  study  and considered  as  baseline  values  for  Phase  2.  The  overall  characteristics  for  patients  in  Phase  2  were comparable to those reported for the full patient population in Phase 1. As in Phase 1, there was no meaningful  difference  in  most  of  the  baseline  demographic  parameters  between  aliskiren  and corresponding placebo groups across dose groups in Phase 2, except in the distribution of weight, BMI and hypertension etiology. (Table 11-4).

Baseline BP levels were generally similar among the 6 treatment groups except for 3.4 mmHg higher baseline msSBP in the placebo mid dose group (compared to aliskiren mid dose group). (Table 11-6).

Most  of  patients  had  at  least  one  co-morbidity  (metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders,  respiratory, thoracic  and  mediastinal disorders  ,  renal  and  urinary  disorders,  nervous  system  disorders,  surgical and medical procedures, infections and infestations, and congenital, familial, and genetic disorders). Frequent conditions (≥ 10% of patients in any group) were obesity, asthma, headache, and seasonal allergy (Table 11-7). A total of 20.9% of patients had an abnormality in the renal or urinary SOC and 20.1% were considered obese by the investigator while 58.6% had baseline BMI≥95th percentile for age and gender.

## Efficacy results

## Primary objectives

At the end of Phase 1, there was a statistically  significant decrease from baseline in msSBP in all 3 dose groups (p&lt;0.001, Table 11-8). The reduction in msSBP was larger in the high dose group (-9.03 mmHg) than in the low (-5.54 mmHg) and mid dose (-5.42 mmHg) groups. Similar results were seen in the PPS1 population (-5.61, -6.13 and -9.89 mmHg, respectively, Table 14.2-1.1a).

A summary of the changes in msSBP from end of Phase 1 to the end of Phase 2 is presented in Table 11-10. At the end of Phase 2, reductions in msSBP from end of Phase 1 were seen in all three aliskiren dose  groups  but  was  significant  in  the  aliskiren  mid  dose  group  only  (-2.59  mmHg,  p=0.028).  For patients that switched to placebo in Phase 2, the msSBP change from Phase 1 end was an increase only  in  the  placebo  high  dose  group  and  was  not  significant  (+1.11  mmHg,  P=0.354).  The  msSBP change was a further decrease in the placebo low group (-0.64 mmHg) and in the placebo mid dose group (-2.90 mmHg).  The decrease in msSBP of the placebo mid dose group was borderline significant (P=0.064) and actually numerically greater compared to the aliskiren mid dose group. Similar results were seen with the PPS2 population.

## Secondary objectives

- -msDBP : At the end of Phase 1, there was a statistically significant decrease from baseline in msDBP in all 3 dose groups (p&lt;0.001) with a larger reduction observed with increasing aliskiren dose (-2.71 mmHg, -4.05 mmHg and -6.33 mmHg for the low, mid and  high dose  groups,  respectively).    The msDBP slope analysis  presented  in  Table  11-14  yielded  a  slope  estimate  of  -0.14  (mmHg  per  unit increase  in  dose  ratio)  for  the  dose-response  curve  for  change  from  baseline.    Between-group comparisons of msDBP changes from the end of Phase 1 to the end of Phase 2 between aliskiren and placebo  did  not  meet  statistical  significance  in  analyses  separate  per  dose  and  in  pooled  analyses. Findings were similar for msMAP.
- -Responders : At the end of phase 2, the proportion of responders for msSBP was 26% higher in the aliskiren pooled group compared to the placebo pooled group (62/80 vs 45/73, P=0.038).
- -ABPM : A total of 152 patients (56.7%) were included in final analysis for ABPM. All three aliskiren dose group showed reductions from baseline in post-dosing 24-hour mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (MASBP) at the end of Phase 1 (high group, mid group, and low group = -6.02, -6.01, and 2.66 mmHg, respectively). The mid and high dose groups had similar MASBP reductions. The mid and high dose groups had statistically significant greater reductions than the low dose group (P&lt;0.001). In pooled analyses for all doses, the difference in MASBP change between aliskiren groups and placebo groups  was  significant  (-2.86  mHg,  P=0.0022).  Results  were  similar  for  MADBP.  The  differences  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

MASBP and MADBP associated with aliskiren treatment were explained by differences in daytime BP not in night time BP.

UACR levels were measured for all patients at randomization. For patients with albuminuria, testing was also done at Visit4 (end of Phase 1) and Visit 6 (end of Phase 2). No specific trends were seen with  UACR  changes  at  end  of  Phase  1  or  Phase  2  (low  number  of  patients  with  albuminuria  at randomization and the uneven distribution of patients with albuminuria among the different treatment groups, Tables from 14.3-2.11 to 14.3-2.18).

-PK : Weight-based dose of aliskiren significantly correlated with plasma levels of aliskiren.

The investigator defined as drug-related the AEs of 2 patients (0.7%) in Phase 1 and 3 patients (1.2%) in  Phase 2. The two suspected AEs in Phase 1 were mild hypotension (aliskiren high dose, resolved same days) and mild flatulence (aliskiren high dose, study drug interrupted for 1 day). In Phase 2, one

patient  (placebo  high  dose)  had  rash,  pruritus,  cough,  and  fever  that  led  to  study  discontinuation. Another patient (aliskiren low dose group) had headache (treated with acetaminophen and resolved in 1 day). The third patient (placebo high dose group) had mild pharyngitis, treated with clarithromycin and resolved in 7 days).

Analysis by hypertension etiology is summarized in Table 12-13. Patients with secondary hypertension had higher rate of AEs compared to patients with primary hypertension in both phases of the study (comorbidities more frequent in the secondary  hypertension).

Among the serious AEs, there was one patient with head injury (fall), one patient with headache and syncope,  and  one  patient  with  attempted  suicide.    None  of  these  event  was  considered  aliskirenrelated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three patients discontinued the treatment: one in Phase 1 (stomach cramping during placebo run-in phase)  and  two  in  Phase  2  (the  patient  with  treatment-unrelated  attempted  suicide  and  another placebo-treated patient with rash-pruritus).

## Lab test

No patient discontinued the study due to a lab abnormality.

Small, insignificant changes in the hematology and biochemistry parameters were seen in both phases of the study.  The % of patients with notable changes in Phase 1 and 2 is shown in Table 12-20 and 12-21, respectively. There was an increase in the proportion of patients with AST values above upper limit of normal (ULN) in the aliskiren mid dose group (7.8% to 19.6%) at end of Phase 1, but most of the patients returned to normal ranges by end of Phase 2 (3.3% on aliskiren mid dose and 0.0% on placebo mid dose).

Baseline is the Week O value or the previous screening value if Week 0 value is not available.

N': number of pafients with both baseline and at least one post-baseline value during Phase 2

n=number of patients meeting the above criteria

indicates that the extreme (highestlowest) post-baseline test value is either above or below the nommal range. Source: Table 14.3-2.4

No specific trends were seen with UACR changes at end of Phase 1 or Phase 2 (low number of patients with albuminuria at randomization and the uneven distribution of patients with albuminuria among the different treatment groups).

## Vital signs

Slight changes in body weight were observed at end of Phase 1 (0.3 to 0.5 Kg) and at end of Phase 2 (0.0 to 0.5 Kg).

There were no meaningful changes in sitting pulse rate in Phase 1 and Phase 2.

A decrease of at least 20 mmHg in SBP or a decrease of at least 10 mmHg in DBP when a patient moves from sitting position to a standing position (orthostatic BP changes) in Phase 1 occurred with similar frequency among the 3 aliskiren dose groups. In Phase 2, orthostatic BP changes were more frequent in the aliskiren mid dose group (Table 12-27).

## Discussion on clinical aspects

## Summary of Efficacy

The results of the study Phase 1 demonstrated a significant dose-dependent BP lowering effect with aliskiren over a 4 week treatment period with consistent findings for msSBP (primary endpoint) and secondary objectives  (msDBP, MAP, % of responder, and ABPM in a subset of 152 patients).

The results of the study Phase 2 - that is the changes from end of Phase1 to end Phase 2 - were inconsistent because of a contrast between data for mean changes in msSBP (primary objective) and secondary objectives. For patients that switched to placebo in Phase 2, the mean of the msSBP change from Phase 1 end was an increase only in the placebo high dose group and was not significant (+1.11 mmHg, P=0.354).  The mean of the msSBP change was a further decrease in the placebo low group (0.64  mmHg)  and  in  the  placebo  mid  dose  group  (-2.90  mmHg).    Briefly,  Phase  2  results  for  the primary  objective  do  not  exclude  the  possibility  that  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  blood  pressure reduction during Phase 1 was accounted for by factors other than the treatment with aliskiren given that the substitution of aliskiren with placebo was followed by a further decrease in the mean of msSBP for the majority of patients. It is noteworthy that the mean of the msSBP decrease in the placebo mid dose group was borderline significant (P=0.064) and numerically greater compared to the aliskiren mid dose  group.      Findings  for  secondary  objectives  were  in  contrast  with  findings  for  msSBP  (%  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

responders and ABPM).  The response rate at the end of Phase 2 increased further in patients who continued to receive aliskiren  (64%, 70% and 82% in the aliskiren low, mid and high dose groups respectively)  compared  to  patients  who  were  switched  to  placebo.  The  pooled  mid/high  doses  of aliskiren had a significantly higher proportion of patients with BP response compared to placebo pooled from corresponding arms (77.5% vs 61.6%, p=0.038). ABPM at end of Phase 2 showed significantly greater  reductions  from  baseline  in  MASBP  (-2.86  mmHg,  p=0.0022)  and  MADBP  (-2.78  mmHg, p&lt;0.0001) for the pooled mid/high doses of aliskiren compared to placebo pooled from corresponding arms.

The change in msSBP and msDBP in both Phase 1 and Phase2 were generally consistent irrespective of age group, gender, race, ethnicity, weight group, and hypertension etiology.

There was a positive correlation between aliskiren trough concentration and dose.

## Summary of safety

Aliskiren was generally well tolerated in this patient population. There were no deaths reported in the study. Only 3 SAE were reported in the aliskiren high dose group (head injury in Phase 1 and suicide attempt  and  syncope  in  Phase  2).  None  of  these  3  SAE  was  suspected  to  be  related  to  study medication.

The incidence of AEs was similar among the different treatment groups with majority of AEs of mild severity.

The discontinuation rate due to any reason was low overall with very few patients discontinuing due to an AE.

The most frequently reported AEs (headache and upper respiratory tract infection) are common in this patient population.

Changes  in  laboratory  parameters  were  generally  minor  with  no  meaningful  differences  among  the different treatment groups.

## Discussion: Rapporteur's conclusions

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aliskiren in the paediatric population aged  6-17  years.  Three  dose  levels  of  aliskiren  were  evaluated  for  a  total  period  of  8  weeks:  low (0.13-0.31 mg/Kg), mid (0.75-1.88 mg/Kg) and high (3.0-7.5 mg/Kg) with a wide dose ratio between the low, mid and high dose groups (1:6:24).  The study included two phases: Phase 1 for evaluation of dose-response curve, and Phase 2 for evaluation of placebo effects (placebo-controlled withdrawal).

The primary objective and the secondary objectives of the study Phase 1 were met.

The primary objective of the Phase 2 study was not met whereas the secondary objectives of the study Phase 2 were partially met. The Applicant concludes that this inconsistency might reflect insufficient washout  of  aliskiren  effect  when  patients  were  switched  to  placebo  (long  biological  half-life  of aliskiren).    This  interpretation  does  not  appear  adequate  because  it  does  not  explain  all  the inconsistencies such as that between mean changes in msSBP and % of responders (office BP vs office BP)  as  well  as  the  contrasting  results  for  msSBP  and  MASBP  (office  BP  vs  ABPM).  Moreover,  the possibility of antihypertensive effects lasting for up to 4 weeks after treatment suspension would rise serious doubts about the manageability of aliskiren in the paediatric population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient  population  of  hypertensive  patients  aged  6-17 years  old.    The  rate  of  discontinuation  was  low.    There  were  no  deaths  and  there  were  few  SAEs (1.1%).  Most  of  the  reported  AEs  were  generally  mild  and  transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety profile of aliskiren in this short term study was similar to placebo.

## Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The efficacy of aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old because of inconclusive results of the placebo-controlled Phase 2 of the study CSPP100A2365.

Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old.

Overall, data from study CSPP100A2365 do not support an indication in the studied population.

The  Applicant  was  required  to  present  a  variation  application  to  amend  the  Product  Information  of aliskiren containing products with the results from study CSPP100A2365 (see section below).

In view of the available data regarding efficacy and safety of aliskiren in patients aged 6-17 years from study CSPP100A2365, the Rapporteur asked the MAH to either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so.

The above variation application should have amended the relevant sections of the SmPC to include the above discussed findings, in line with the wording reported below (changes to the currently approved text: deleted text is strikethrough; added text is in bold ). The PL should have been updated in line with the SmPC changes.

## 3.3. Changes to the Product Information

As  a  result  of  this  type  IB  variation,  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  of  the  SmPC  are  being  updated according to the outcome of the recently completed Article 46 procedure EMA/H/C/780/P46/039 which reviewed  the  results  of  the  aliskiren  paediatric  study  CSPP100A2365  in  children  6-17  years  with hypertension.

The proposed amendments to the SmPC were as follows (see Attachment 1) (changes to the currently approved  text:  deleted  text  is  strikethrough;  added  text  is  in bold ;  the  differences  between  the wording proposed by the Rapporteur and that proposed by the MAH are highlighted in grey):

## Assessor's comment

The  recently  completed  Article  46  procedure  EMA/H/C/780/P46/039  reviewed  the  results  of  the aliskiren paediatric study CSPP100A2365 in children 6-17 years with hypertension.

Indeed,  this  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren  in  the  paediatric population  aged  6-17  years.  Three  dose  levels  of  aliskiren  were  evaluated  for  a  total  period  of  8 weeks: low (0.13-0.31 mg/Kg), mid (0.75-1.88 mg/Kg) and high (3.0-7.5 mg/Kg) with a wide dose ratio between the low, mid and high dose groups (1:6:24).  The study included two phases: Phase 1 for  evaluation  of  dose-response  curve,  and  Phase  2  for  evaluation  of  placebo  effects  (placebocontrolled withdrawal).

The primary objective and the secondary objectives of the study Phase 1 were met.

The primary objective of the Phase 2 study was not met whereas the secondary objectives of the study Phase 2 were partially met. The Applicant concludes that this inconsistency might reflect insufficient washout  of  aliskiren  effect  when  patients  were  switched  to  placebo  (long  biological  half-life  of aliskiren).    This  interpretation  does  not  appear  adequate  because  it  does  not  explain  all  the inconsistencies such as that between mean changes in msSBP and % of responders (office BP vs office BP)  as  well  as  the  contrasting  results  for  msSBP  and  MASBP  (office  BP  vs  ABPM).  Moreover,  the possibility of antihypertensive effects lasting for up to 4 weeks after treatment suspension would rise serious doubts about the manageability of aliskiren in the paediatric population.

Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient  population  of  hypertensive  patients  aged  6-17 years  old.    The  rate  of  discontinuation  was  low.    There  were  no  deaths  and  there  were  few  SAEs (1.1%).  Most  of  the  reported  AEs  were  generally  mild  and  transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety profile of aliskiren in this short term study was similar to placebo.

In conclusion, the efficacy of aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old because of inconclusive results of the placebo-controlled Phase 2 of the study CSPP100A2365.

Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old.

Overall, data from study CSPP100A2365 do not support an indication in the studied population.

The Applicant was required to present a variation application to amend sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC of aliskiren containing products with the results from study CSPP100A2365.

Regarding the section 4.2 , the MAH adopted the wording proposed by the Rapporteur, but it would be better to move the following sentence

'Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).'

before the sentence

'The safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. '

Moreover,  the  Rapporteur  concluded  that  'Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient population of hypertensive patients aged 6-17 years old.  The rate of discontinuation was low.  There were no deaths and there were few SAEs (1.1%). Most of the reported AEs were generally mild and

transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  aliskiren  in  this  short  term  study  was  similar  to placebo. …  Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old.'

But, there are no data on long-term safety in this age category, hence it is proposed to add 'long-term safety' in the following sentence ' 'The safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. '

Therefore, the wording should be as follows:

## 'Paediatric population

Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children aged 6 to less than 18 years are described in sections 4.8 and 5.2. No recommendation on a posology can be made for children aged 6 to less than 18 years.

The long-term safety and efficacy of aliskiren in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. '

Regarding the section 4.4 , the MAH made the changes proposed by the Rapporteur as follow:

## 'Paediatric population

Therefore,  Rasilez  is  contraindicated  in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years.

Limited  safety  data  are  available  from  a  pharmacokinetic  study  of  aliskiren  treatment  in  39 hypertensive children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).'

In  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  8-week  study  with  aliskiren  monotherapy  (3 dose groups according to weight: low 6.25/12.5/25 mg  [0.13-0.31 mg/kg]; mid 37.5/75/150 mg [0.75-1.88 mg/kg]; and high dose 150/300/600 mg [3.0-7.5 mg/kg], with a wide dose ratio between the low, mid and high dose groups [1:6:24]) in 267 paediatric hypertensive  patients  aged  6  to  17  years,  aliskiren  lowered  office  and  ambulatory  blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner during the initial 4 week dose-finding phase of the study (Phase 1). However, in the subsequent 4 week randomised withdrawal phase of the study  (Phase  2),  the  effect  of  aliskiren  overlapped  with  the  effects  observed  in  patients switched to placebo in all dose groups (low, p=0.8894; mild, p=0.9511; high, p=0.0563). The  average  differences  between  aliskiren  and  placebo  for  the  low  and  mid  dose  groups were  &lt;  0.2  mmHg  and  not  significant  as  well.  The  treatment  with  aliskiren  was  well tolerated in this study. (Apply also to Rasilez HCT and Rasilamlo SmPCs under 'Aliskiren' subsection)

The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  deferred  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with Rasilez  in  one  or  more  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  in  hypertension  (see  section  4.2  for information on paediatric use).'

According to the Rapporteur, this editorial change is acceptable and hence the wording of the section 5.1 with the editorial change proposed by the MAH is endorsed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Supplementary information (other concern) is requested to the MAH (see below).

## 4.1. Other concerns which should be addressed by the applicant

Regarding the section 4.2 , the MAH adopted the wording proposed by the Rapporteur, but it would be better to move the following sentence

'Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).'

before the sentence

'The safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. '

Moreover,  the  Rapporteur  concluded  that  'Aliskiren  was  generally  well  tolerated  in  this  patient population of hypertensive patients aged 6-17 years old.  The rate of discontinuation was low.  There were no deaths and there were few SAEs (1.1%). Most of the reported AEs were generally mild and transient  in  nature.    Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  aliskiren  in  this  short  term  study  was  similar  to placebo. …  Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old.'

But, there are no data on long-term safety in this age category, hence it is proposed to add 'long-term safety' in the following sentence ' 'The safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. '

Therefore, the wording should be as follows:

## 'Paediatric population

Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children aged 6 to less than 18 years are described in sections 4.8 and 5.2. No recommendation on a posology can be made for children aged 6 to less than 18 years.

The long-term safety and efficacy of aliskiren in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. '

## 5. Assessment of the responses to the request for supplementary information

## Question

Regarding the section 4.2 , the MAH adopted the wording proposed by the Rapporteur, but it would be better to move the following sentence

'Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).'

Therefore, the wording should be as follows:

## 'Paediatric population

## Summary of the WSA's response

The MAH submitted the updated SmPC as follows:

'Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

The long-term safety  and  efficacy  of  Rasilez  in  children  aged 6  to  17 years  with  hypertension below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established. Currently  available  data  are  described  in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.

Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children aged 16 to less than 18 years are described in serious 4.8  and  5.2.  No  recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made  for  children  aged  6  to  less  than  18 years. '

## Assessment of the WSA's response

The MAH submitted the updated SmPC as follows:

'Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

The long-term safety  and  efficacy  of  Rasilez  in  children  aged 6  to  17 years  with  hypertension below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established. Currently  available  data  are  described  in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children aged 16 to less than 18 years are described in serious 4.8  and  5.2.  No  recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made  for  children  aged  6  to  less  than  18 years. '

The  SmPC  update  is  considered  in  line  with  PRAC/CHMP  request.  But,  as  the  efficacy  of  aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old because of inconclusive results of the placebo-controlled Phase 2 of the study CSPP100A2365, in order to avoid confusion in the prescriber, it would be better to write in SmPC section 4.2 as follows:

' The efficacy and long-term safety and  efficacy of Rasilez  in  children  aged  6  to  17 years  with hypertension  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are  described  in  sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.'

instead of

'The long-term safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2'.

## Conclusion

The efficacy of aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old because of inconclusive results of the placebo-controlled Phase 2 of the study CSPP100A2365.

Aliskiren appears safe in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old.

Overall, data from study CSPP100A2365 do not support an indication in the studied population.

The  Applicant  was  required  to  present  a  variation  application  to  amend  the  Product  Information  of aliskiren containing products with the results from study CSPP100A2365 (see section below).

In view of the available data regarding efficacy and safety of aliskiren in patients aged 6-17 years from study CSPP100A2365, the Rapporteur asked the MAH to either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so.

The above variation application should have amended the relevant sections of the SmPC to include the above discussed findings, in line with the wording reported below (changes to the currently approved text: deleted text is strikethrough; added text is in bold ). The PL should have been updated in line with the SmPC changes.

The MAH submitted the updated SmPC as follows:

'Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

The long-term safety  and  efficacy  of  Rasilez  in  children  aged 6  to  17 years  with  hypertension below  18  years  have  not  yet  been  established. Currently  available  data  are  described  in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.

Rasilez is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Limited data on the use of Rasilez in children aged 16 to less than 18 years are described in serious 4.8  and  5.2.  No  recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made  for  children  aged  6  to  less  than  18 years. '

The  SmPC  update  is  considered  in  line  with  PRAC/CHMP  request.  But,  as  the  efficacy  of  aliskiren cannot be considered as fully proved in the paediatric population aged 6 to 17 years old because of inconclusive results of the placebo-controlled Phase 2 of the study CSPP100A2365, in order to avoid confusion in the prescriber, it would be better to write in SmPC section 4.2 as follows:

' The efficacy and long-term safety and  efficacy of Rasilez  in  children  aged  6  to  17 years  with hypertension  have  not  yet  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are  described  in  sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.'

instead of

'The long-term safety and efficacy of Rasilez in children aged 6 to 17 years with hypertension have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2'.

The MAH agreed to update the SmPC section 4.2 with the above proposed changes.
