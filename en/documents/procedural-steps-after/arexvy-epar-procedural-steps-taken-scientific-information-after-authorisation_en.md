| Variation type II / EMA/VR/0000264399   | 18/09/2025   | SmPC, Labelling and PL   | Following the submission of the final study results of study RSV OA=ADJ-020, the section 4.5 of the SmPC of Arexvy and Shingrix has been updated to indicate that both vaccines can be co-administered. The primary objectives were met as non-inferiority was demonstrated for the HZ/su response, as well as for RSV-A and RSV-B. It should be noted that the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for anti- gE titers were numerically higher in the control group with sequential administration (61193 %CI: 55306 - 67706) compared to the Co-Ad group with concomitant administration (49327, 95%CI: 44949 - 54132), leading to a GMC ratio of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.08 - 1.42). However, the reverse cumulative distribution curves showed a similar pattern for both groups and the vaccine response rate was comparable, with VRR being 93% (95%CI 88 - 96) in the Co-Ad group and 97% (95% CI: 93-99) in the Control group. Due to the absence of a correlate for protection for anti-gE titers, it is not clear whether the observed difference in anti-gE titers will have a clinically relevant impact. It is considered that the slightly reduced response against HZ/su as observed in the Co-Ad group should not prevent the two vaccines from being given together, also taking into consideration the robust immune response still generated. It is noted that similar immunogenicity trends were observed in previous submissions upon concomitant administration of Arexvy with seasonal influenza vaccines, where numerically lower RSV A and B neutralising titres and numerically lower influenza A and B haemagglutination inhibition titres   |

This was not observed consistently across studies. Similarly, when Shingrix is co- administered with the dTpa vaccine, lower (GMCs) for one of the pertussis antigens (pertactin) was observed. The clinical relevance of this immunogenicity findings is unknown. Co administration of Arexvy and Shingrix was not associated with a clinically relevant increased risk of ADRs compared to when the vaccines were administered separately, and the safety profile of Arexvy and Shingrix co administered is comparable to the known safety profile of these two vaccines administered alone. The statements in 4.5 for co- administration of Arexvy and Shingrix with other vaccines were revised to ensure that only relevant information for prescribers is retained in the SmPC.

While response to PCV20 was consistently somewhat decreased in the co-administration group, there was still a robust immune response. The clinical relevance of the reduction is not entirely clear, but similar decreases were seen for the co-administration of PCV20 and quadrivalent influenza vaccine and were still in the same range as those observed in the registration study of PCV20. Co-administration of RSVPreF3 OA and PCV20 was not associated with a clinically relevant increased risk of ADRs compared to when the vaccines were administered separately, and the safety profile of RSVPreF3 OA and PCV20 when co- administered is comparable to the known safety profile of these two vaccines administered alone.
