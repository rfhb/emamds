| drug-drug interaction information about the effect of brigatinib on the pharmacokinetics of a sensitive cytochrome P450 3A substrate (midazolam) in patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive solid tumours based on a clinical study report (Study 1001). Update of section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order to update drug-drug interaction information regarding concomitant treatment with moderate CYP3A inducers based on results of previously submitted studies (physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) report and PBPK report addendum). Update section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to amend the ATC code. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement a statement regarding the sodium content of Alunbrig in section 4.4 of the SmPC and Package Leaflet. The MAH also took the opportunity to bring the Product Information in line with the latest QRD template (version 10.2 rev.1) and to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Moreover, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes in the PI in different languages.

After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inducer, Alunbrig should be resumed at the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the moderate CYP3A inducer. In patients with cancer, coadministration of multiple 180 mg daily doses of Alunbrig with a single 3 mg oral dose of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, decreased midazolam Cmax by 16%, AUC0-INF by 26%, and AUC0- last by 30%, relative to a 3 mg oral dose of midazolam administered alone. Brigatinib reduces plasma concentrations of coadministered medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP3A.

Dose reduction occurred in 0.4% of patients. Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking Alunbrig, and for at least 5 days after discontinuation of treatment. When outdoors, patients should be advised to wear a hat and protective clothing, and to use a broad-spectrum Ultraviolet A (UVA)/ Ultraviolet B (UVB) sunscreen and lip balm (SPF ≥30) to help protect against potential sunburn. For severe photosensitivity reactions (≥ Grade 3), Alunbrig should be withheld until recovery to baseline. The dose should be modified accordingly. |
