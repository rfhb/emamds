## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for gadoversetamide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Sclerotic bodies on skin biopsy have been associated with Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF). Two recently published articles have reported the development of gadolinium associated skin plaques, with sclerotic bodies and focal calcification on histology in patients without other features of Nephrogenic Systemic  Fibrosis.  These  gadolinium  associated  skin  plaques  were  apparent  within  a  timeframe  of approximately  4  years  following  multiple  administrations  of  gadolinium  containing  contrast  agents, including gadodiamide a non-ionic linear GdCA.

In response to the Request for Supplementary Information the MAH has confirmed that they have not received specifically with their product any cases of gadolinium associated skin plaques with fibrosis and  sclerotic  bodies  in  patients  who  do  not  otherwise  have  a  diagnosis  of  Nephrogenic  Systemic Fibrosis.  A review of published pre-clinical studies provided by the MAH has shown in relation to the tested  marketed  gadolinium  GdCAs    that  the  highest  gadolinium  skin  concentration  were  seen  with administration    of  the  non-ionic  linear  GdCAs,  with  the  highest  levels  seen  post  administration  of Omniscan.  Macroscopic  and  microscopic  NSF-like  skin  lesions  were  seen  in  the  animals  with  the highest  gadolinium  skin  concentrations.      There  is  clear  potential  for  underreporting  or  under recognition of gadolinium associated skin plaques in patients who have not presented with other signs or  symptoms of NSF and therefore it is recommended that the product information for Optimark is updated  to  reflect  these  recent  published  cases.  For  transparency,  the  PRAC  recommends  that  the amendment  to  the  product  information  should  factually  reflect  what  has  been  reported  in  the literature. In conclusion in view of the available data relevant to gadolinium associated skin plaques the PRAC considered that changes to the Optimark product information are warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for gadoversetamide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing gadoversetamide is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information Medicinal product no longer authorised

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
