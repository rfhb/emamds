The molecular weight of the protein is approximately 234 kDa.

Jivi is produced without the addition of any human or animal derived protein in the cell culture process, purification, PEGylation or final formulation.

## Excipient with known effect

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each mL solution for injection contains 0.08 mg polysorbate 80 (E 433).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder and solvent for solution for injection.

Powder: solid, white to slightly yellow. Solvent: clear solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients ≥ 7 years of age with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.

## Treatment monitoring

During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to confirm that adequate FVIII levels have been achieved. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.

When using an in vitro activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor VIII activity in patients' blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay, which can result in over- or under-estimation of factor VIII activity. It should be noted that there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by specific reagents used in the aPTTbased one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay. This is of importance when monitoring the factor VIII activity of Jivi, and when changing laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. This applies also for modified long-acting factor VIII products.

Laboratories intending to measure Jivi activity should check their procedures for accuracy. A field study has indicated that the factor VIII activity of Jivi can be accurately measured in plasma using either a validated chromogenic substrate (CS) assay or a one-stage (OS) clotting assay using specific reagents. For Jivi some silica-based one-stage assays (e.g., APTT-SP, STA-PTT) may underestimate the factor VIII activity of Jivi in plasma samples; some reagents, e.g. with kaolin-based activators, have the potential for overestimation.

The clinical effect of factor VIII is the most important element in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment. It may be necessary to adjust the individual dosing at patient level in order to attain satisfactory clinical results. If the calculated dose fails to attain the expected factor VIII levels or if bleeding is not controlled after administration of the calculated dose, the presence of a circulating factor VIII-inhibitor or anti-PEG antibodies in the patient should be suspected (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

The dose and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.

The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in IU (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).

One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one mL of normal human plasma.

## On demand treatment

The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5-2.5 % of normal activity. The required dose of Jivi is determined using the following formula:

Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed recovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%).

The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness required in the individual case.

In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in % of normal) in the corresponding period. The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1: Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery

| Degree of haemorrhage/Type of surgical procedure                  | Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/dL)   | Frequency of doses (hours) / Duration of therapy (days)                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Haemorrhage Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding | 20-40                                    | Repeat injection every 24-48 hours. At least 1 day, until bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved                       |
| More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma        | 30-60                                    | Repeat injection every 24-48 hours for 3 to 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.                                                 |
| Life-threatening Haemorrhages                                     | 60-100                                   | Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved.                                                                                           |
| Surgery Minor surgery including tooth extraction                  | 30-60                                    | Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.                                                                                               |
| Major surgery                                                     | 80-100 (pre- and post-operative)         | Repeat dose every 12-24 hours until adequate wound healing, then therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/dL). |

## Prophylaxis

All treatment decisions for identifying appropriate prophylactic treatment regimens should be guided by clinical judgement based on individual patient characteristics and treatment response. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved factor VIII levels and individual bleeding tendency. For more details, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.

## Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older

The dose is 45-60 IU/kg every 5 days.

Based on patient clinical characteristics the dose can also be 60 IU/kg every 7 days or 30-40 IU/kg two times per week (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

## Children 7 to &lt; 12 years of age

The dose is 40-60 IU/kg two times per week (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

The recommended starting dose is 60 IU/kg two times per week.

For overweight patients, the maximum dose per injection for prophylaxis should not be higher than approximately 6 000 IU.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

Jivi is not indicated in previously untreated patients and in patients less than 7 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adolescent population

On demand and prophylactic treatment dosing in adolescent patients is the same as for adult patients.

## Elderly

There is limited experience in patients ≥ 65 years.

## Method of administration

## Jivi is for intravenous use.

Jivi should be injected intravenously over a period of 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume. The rate of administration should be determined by the patient's comfort level (maximal rate of injection: 2.5 mL/min).

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Known allergic reactions to mouse or hamster proteins.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity

Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Jivi. The medicinal product may contain traces of mouse and hamster proteins. Hypersensitivity reactions could also be related to antibodies against PEG (see paragraph Immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG)). If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. Symptomatic treatment for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate. In case of anaphylaxis or shock, the current medical standards for treatment should be implemented.

## Inhibitors

The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per mL of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure days (ED) but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 50 exposure days.

The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.

In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.

## Immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG)

A clinical immune response associated with anti-PEG antibodies, manifested as symptoms of acute hypersensitivity and/or loss of drug effect has been observed primarily within the first 4 exposure days. Low post-injection factor VIII levels in the absence of detectable factor VIII inhibitors indicate that loss of drug effect is likely due to anti-PEG antibodies; in such cases Jivi should be discontinued and patients switched to a previously effective factor VIII product.

In case of clinical suspicion of loss of therapeutic effect, testing for Factor VIII inhibitors and Factor VIII recovery is recommended.

A significant decrease in the risk of an immune response to PEG was observed with an increase in age. This effect may be related to a developmental change in immunity, and although it is difficult to define a clear cut-off age for the change in risk, this phenomenon predominantly occurs in young children with haemophilia.

The implications of any potential risk to affected patients with a hypersensitivity reaction to pegylated proteins are unknown. Data show that in the affected patients, following discontinuation of Jivi, the anti-PEG IgM antibodies decreased in titre and became undetectable over time. No cross-reactivity of anti-PEG IgM antibodies with other unmodified factor VIII products was observed. All patients could be successfully treated with their previous factor VIII products.

Due to the transient nature of this immune response and disappearance of the IgM anti-PEG antibodies within 4-6 weeks, a restart of treatment with Jivi may be considered, if the recovery is normalized (see section 4.2). Patients should be monitored for recovery upon restart of treatment.

## Decreased factor VIII incremental recovery

A minor reduction of recovery (recovery around 1 IU/dL per IU/kg) after start of treatment was observed and may be due to transient low titer anti PEG IgM antibodies mainly in children. Low incremental recovery could potentially be associated with reduced efficacy during this time period. Monitoring of paediatric patients, including monitoring of post dose factor VIII activity, is recommended. If a bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose and/or the expected Factor VIII activity levels are not attained in the absence of FVIII inhibitors, consider adjusting the dose, dosing frequency or discontinuing the product.

## Cardiovascular events

In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase the cardiovascular risk.

## Catheter-related complications

If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.

## Paediatric population

The listed warnings and precautions apply to adults, adolescents and children aged 7 to &lt; 12 years. Jivi is not indicated in patients &lt; 7 years of age and in previously untreated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Information about excipients

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Polysorbate 80 (E 433)

This medicinal product contains 0.2 mg of polysorbate 80 per vial of 250/500/1 000/2 000/3 000 IU and 0.4 mg of polysorbate 80 per vial of 4 000 IU which is equivalent to 0.08 mg/mL solution for injection. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have not been reported.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.

## Fertility

In the repeat dose systemic toxicity studies in rats and rabbits with Jivi, treatment related effects on male reproductive organs were not seen (see section 5.3). The effect on fertility in humans is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Jivi has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).

Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated with factor VIII, including with Jivi (see section 5.1). If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialized haemophilia centre be contacted.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical studies in PTPs were headache, cough and pyrexia.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

A total of 256 patients constituted the safety population from 4 pivotal Phase I and III studies (one phase I study and 3 phase III studies), 148 adolescents/adults and 108 paediatric patients &lt; 12 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median number of exposure days to Jivi per patient was 195 (min-max: 1-698) for all patients in the clinical studies.

Overall, in all studies 75 patients, 39 of them below 12 years of age, were observed for a treatment duration of more than 5 years. See section 5.1 for additional details on the clinical studies.

The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred Term Level). Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000); very rare (&lt;1/10 000).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity was evaluated during clinical studies with Jivi in 159 (including surgery patients) previously treated adolescents (≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, n=14) and adults (n=145) diagnosed with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C &lt; 1%), and ≥ 150 previous exposure days and 108 paediatric PTPs &lt; 12 years of age (n=60 aged 7-&lt;12 years) and ≥ 50 previous exposure days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## FVIII inhibitors

No de novo or confirmed cases of inhibitor against factor VIII occurred. A single unconfirmed positive result of a low titre of factor VIII inhibitor (1.7 BU/mL) was reported in one adult patient undergoing surgery.

## Anti-PEG antibodies

Immunogenicity against PEG with development of specific IgM anti-PEG antibodies was observed in 2 patients. In one patient &gt; 12 years of age, the immune response was accompanied by a clinical hypersensitivity reaction after 4 injections of Jivi. Antibodies to PEG disappeared after discontinuation of Jivi.

One child ˃ 7 years, developed high titre neutralising anti-PEG IgM antibodies within the first 4 exposure days associated with loss of drug effect. Antibodies disappeared after discontinuation and patient safely re-started treatment with Jivi 2 months later.

Transient low titre anti-PEG antibodies of the IgM isotype were observed in some patients within the first 4 ED resulting in minor reduction of recovery.

No clinical immune response to PEG resulting in loss of drug efficacy or hypersensitivity was observed from the 5 th ED through the end of the extension studies.

## Paediatric population in the PROTECT Kids study

In the completed clinical study with 73 paediatric PTPs &lt; 12 years (44 PTPs &lt; 6 years, 29 PTPs 6&lt; 12 years), adverse reactions due to immune response to PEG were observed in children less than 6 years of age. In 10 of 44 patients (23%) in the age group of younger than 6 years of age loss of drug effect due to neutralising anti-PEG antibodies during the first 4 exposure days was observed. In 3 of 44 patients (7%), loss of drug effect was combined with hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.4). No triggers or predictors of the immune response to PEG could be identified.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There was one case of overdose in the clinical studies. No adverse events were reported.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02.

## Mechanism of action

The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a patient with haemophilia, factor VIII binds to patient's von Willebrand factor. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels or absence of factor VIII:C that results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Damoctocog alfa pegol is a PEGylated form of rFVIII. Site-specific PEGylation reduces clearance of factor VIII resulting in an extended half-life while maintaining the normal functions of the B-domain deleted rFVIII molecule (see section 5.2). Damoctocog alfa pegol does not contain von Willebrand factor.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Clinical studies

A total of 267 previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A have been exposed in the clinical study program which included 1 phase I study and 3 phase II/III studies. 219 patients were ≥ 7 years of age.

## Phase II/III

PROTECT VIII: The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Jivi for on demand treatment, prophylaxis with three regimens (two times per week 30-40 IU/kg, every 5-days 45-60 IU/kg and every 7-days 60 IU/kg) and haemostasis during major surgeries were evaluated in a multi-national, open-label, uncontrolled, partially randomized study which was performed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan. An extension study included patients completing the main study. The primary efficacy variable was annualized bleed rate (ABR).

One hundred and thirty-four male PTPs received at least one injection of Jivi (including 13 patients aged 12 to 17 years of age) for prophylaxis (n=114) or on-demand treatment (n=20) for a period of 36 weeks. A total of 121 patients received treatment during the extension study, 107 patients received prophylaxis and 14 patients on-demand treatment. Thirty-six patients received prophylaxis treatment for &gt; 5 years up to 7.0 years. Total median (range) time in study was 3.9 years (0.8 - 7.0 years) in all 121 patients. Haemostasis during 20 major surgeries in 17 patients was evaluated in the surgery part.

## Phase III

PROTECT Kids: Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of Jivi for three prophylaxis regimens (twice weekly, every 5 and every 7 days) and treatment of breakthrough bleeds were evaluated in a multinational, uncontrolled, open-label study in 73 paediatric patients (&lt; 12 years of age) during a period of 50 EDs and at least 6 months. This study has been performed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan. Sixty-one patients (83.6%) completed the main study, and 59 patients continued in the optional extension study with a total median time in study of 5.8 years (range 1.0-6.6 years).

Alfa PROTECT: A single group treatment, open-label, study to evaluate the safety of Jivi infusions for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in previously treated children aged 7 to &lt; 12 years with severe haemophilia A evaluated the potential risk of hypersensitivity and loss of drug effect associated with an immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) within the first 4 exposures to Jivi. Patients were treated prophylactically for 6 months and were offered continuation in an 18 months extensions study.

## Prophylactic treatment in patients ≥ 12 years

During the main study period patients were assigned to prophylaxis 2x/week (n=24) or randomized to every 5 days (n=43) or every 7 days (n=43) or received on-demand treatment (n=20) with Jivi. Ninety nine of 110 patients (90%) remained on the assigned regimen. Eleven patients in every 7 days arm increased frequency. The median dose for all prophylaxis regimens was 46.9 IU/kg/injection. The median (Q1; Q3) ABR during prophylaxis was 2.09 (0.0; 6.1) for all bleeds and 0.0 (0;0 4.2) for spontaneous bleeds as compared to 23.4 (18; 37) total bleeds in the on-demand group. Forty-two out of 110 in the prophylaxis arms (38.2%) experienced no bleeding episode.

During the extension study (median duration of 3.2 years, range 0.1-6.3 years), 23 patients were treated 2x/week, 33 patients every 5-days, 23 patients every 7 days during total time in the extension

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study and 28 patients changed treatment regimen. The median dose for prophylaxis was 47.8 IU/kg. The overall median (Q1; Q3) total ABR was 1.49 (0.4; 4.8) and 0.75 (0.0: 2.9) for spontaneous bleeds in the combined prophylaxis groups and total ABR was 34.1 in the on-demand group. Of note, ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical studies.

## Treatment of bleeding

Of the 702 bleeding events treated with Jivi during the main study, 636 (90.6%) were treated with 1 or 2 injections, thereof 81.1% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose per injection was 31.7 (14; 62) IU/kg. During the extension 1902 bleeds were treated with Jivi and 94.0% were controlled with 1 or 2 injections, thereof 84.9% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose was 37.9 (15; 64) IU/kg/injection.

## Perioperative management

A total of 20 major surgical procedures were performed and assessed in 17 patients. The median total dose for major surgeries was 219 IU/kg (range: 50-1500 IU/kg, including postoperative period up to 3 weeks). Perioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as good or excellent during all major surgeries. Additional 34 minor surgeries were performed in 19 patients. Haemostasis was assessed as good or excellent in all available cases.

## Paediatric population &lt; 12 years of age

The use of Jivi in children below 7 years is not indicated (see section 4.2, for information on paediatric use).

PROTECT Kids: A total of 73 previously treated paediatric patients (44 patients &lt; 6 years and 29 patients 6 to &lt; 12 years) received prophylaxis treatment twice weekly, every 5 days or every 7 days in the phase III study. For 53 patients who completed the main study, the median (Q1; Q3) annualised bleeding rate was 2.87 (1.1; 6.1) and the spontaneous ABR was 0.0 (0.0; 2.6). For treatment of bleeds, 84.4 % of the bleeds were resolved with 1 injection, and 91.9% of the bleeds were resolved with 1 or 2 injections.

11 patients in the age group &lt; 6 years dropped out due to an immune response to PEG associated with loss of efficacy and/or hypersensitivity reaction during the first four ED. For 59 patients who continued in the extension study the overall median (Q1; Q3) ABR during the extension period was 1.64 (0.5; 3.1). For 30 patients ≥ 12 years at the end of the extension study, the median (Q1; Q3) ABR was 1.76 (0.5; 3.3).

Alfa PROTECT: A total of 35 PTP (7 to &lt; 12 years) received prophylaxis treatment twice weekly (4060 IU/kg) with median dose of 55 IU/kg. The median (Q1; Q3) annualized bleed rate in the efficacy population (32 patients) was 0.0 (0.0; 1.9). Bleeds were resolved with 1 or 2 injections in 95.2 %. One patient presented an immune response to PEG associated with loss of drug effect within the first 4 ED. Patient discontinued treatment for 2 months, antibodies disappeared and patient could restart treatment.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Jivi was compared to that of factor VIII in a crossover Phase I study. PK was also evaluated in 12 patients aged 7 to &lt; 12 years [PROTECT Kids] and 22 patients aged ≥12 years [PROTECT VIII], and in 16 of these patients after 6 months of prophylaxis treatment in the Phase II/III study.

The PK data (based on chromogenic assay) indicated that Jivi has a reduced clearance (CL), resulting in a terminal half-life that is 1.4-fold longer and a dose normalized AUC which is 1.4-fold higher, as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to the comparative factor VIII product. Dose proportional increases were observed between the doses of 25 and 60 IU/kg indicating dose linearity between 25 IU/kg and 60 IU/kg.

Table 3 summarizes the PK parameters after single dose of 60 IU/kg in 12 patients aged 7 to &lt; 12 years and in 22 patients ≥ 12 years. Repeated PK measurements in patients ≥ 12 years did not indicate any relevant changes in PK characteristics after long-term treatment.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Jivi was evaluated in pharmacology, single and repeated dose as well as juvenile toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. In a long-term, 6-months chronic toxicity study no indication of PEG accumulation or other effects related to administration of Jivi were seen. In addition, 4 weeks toxicity studies with the PEG moiety of Jivi were conducted in two species. The PEG-linker moiety was also tested in a standard set of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies, and they did not indicate a potential for genotoxicity. These studies did not reveal any safety concerns for humans.

Single dose studies in rats with the radio-labelled PEG moiety showed that there was no indication of retention or irreversible binding of radioactivity in the animal body. Specifically, no residual radioactivity was detected in the brain, indicating that the radio-labelled compound did not cross the blood brain barrier. In distribution and excretion studies in rats, the 60 kDa PEG moiety of Jivi was shown to be widely distributed to and eliminated from organs and tissues and excreted in urine (68.4% up to day 231 after administration) and faeces (13.8% up to day 168 after administration).

No long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Jivi, or studies to determine the effects of Jivi on reproduction have been conducted.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Jivi is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Jivi
3. How to use Jivi
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Jivi
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Jivi is and what it is used for

Jivi contains the active substance damoctocog alfa pegol. It is produced by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived components in the manufacturing process. Factor VIII is a protein naturally found in the blood that helps to clot it. The protein in damoctocog alfa pegol has been modified (pegylated) to prolong its action in the body.

Jivi is used to treat and prevent bleeding in previously treated adults, adolescents and children aged 7 years or more with haemophilia A (hereditary factor VIII deficiency). It is not for use in children younger than 7 years of age.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Jivi

## Do not use Jivi if you are

- allergic to damoctocog alfa pegol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- allergic to mouse or hamster proteins.

## Warnings and precautions

## Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have

- tightness in the chest, fall in blood pressure (often shown by feeling dizzy when getting up quickly), itchy nettle-rash, wheezing, feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a rare severe sudden allergic reaction to this medicine. Stop injecting the product immediately and get medical help at once if this occurs.
- bleeding that is not being controlled with your usual dose of this medicine. Speak with your doctor immediately if this occurs. You may have developed antibodies against factor VIII (inhibitors) or antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG). These make Jivi less effective at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

preventing and controlling bleeding. Your doctor may carry out tests to confirm this and ensure that your Jivi dose provides adequate factor VIII levels. Your doctor may switch you back to your previous factor VIII treatment, if needed. After the immune response is resolved your doctor may consider a re-start of Jivi.

- previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product.
- heart disease or you are at risk of heart disease.
- to use a central venous access device for this medicine. You may be at risk of device-related complications where the catheter is inserted including:
- local infections
- bacteria in the blood
- a blood clot in the blood vessel

## Children

Jivi is not for use in children younger than 7 years of age.

## Other medicines and Jivi

Jivi is not known to influence or be influenced by other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

Jivi has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines.

## Jivi contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## Jivi contains polysorbate 80 (E 433)

This medicine contains 0.2 mg of polysorbate 80 per vial of 250/500/1 000/2 000/3 000 IU and 0.4 mg of polysorbate 80 per vial of 4 000 IU which is equivalent to 0.08 mg/mL solution for injection. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you or the child have any known allergies.

## 3. How to use Jivi

Treatment with Jivi will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with haemophilia A. After suitable training patients or carers may be able to give Jivi at home. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose of factor VIII units is measured in International Units (IU).

## Treatment of bleeding

To treat a bleed, your doctor will calculate and adjust your dose and how often it should be given, depending on factors such as:

- your weight
- the severity of your haemophilia A
- where the bleeding is and how serious it is
- whether you have inhibitors and how high their level is
- the factor VIII level that is needed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prevention of bleeding

To prevent bleeding your doctor will select an appropriate dose and frequency depending on your need. Your doctor may adjust your dose and how often it should be given based on your achieved factor VIII levels and your individual bleeding tendency.

- For adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older
- 45-60 IU per kg body weight every 5 days or
- 60 IU per kg body weight every 7 days or
- 30-40 IU per kg body weight two times per week.
- For children 7 to below 12 years of age
- 40-60 IU per kg body weight two times per week.
- 60 IU per kg body weight starting dose two times per week.

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests at suitable intervals help to ensure you always have adequate factor VIII levels. For major surgery in particular, your blood clotting must be closely monitored.

## Duration of treatment

Usually Jivi treatment for haemophilia is needed lifelong.

## How Jivi is given

Jivi is injected into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort level. The maximum rate is 2.5 mL per minute. Jivi should be used within 3 hours after reconstitution.

## How Jivi is prepared for injection

Use only the components (vial adapter, pre-filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) provided with each package of this medicine. Please contact your doctor if these components cannot be used. Do not use if any component of the package is opened or damaged.

The reconstituted product must be filtered by using the vial adapter before injection to remove any possible particles in the solution.

This medicine must not be mixed with other injections. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or contain visible particles. Follow the instructions for use given by your doctor and provided at the end of this leaflet.

## If you use more Jivi than you should

Tell your doctor if this occurs. No symptoms of overdose have been reported.

## If you forget to use Jivi

Inject your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .

## If you stop using Jivi

Do not stop using this medicine without checking with your doctor.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## Detailed instructions for reconstitution and administration of Jivi

You will need alcohol swabs, gauze pads, plasters and tourniquet. These items are not included in the Jivi package.

1. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
2. Hold an unopened vial and also a syringe in your hands to warm it to a comfortable temperature (do not exceed 37 °C).
3. Remove the protective cap from the vial (A) . Wipe the rubber stopper on the vial with an alcohol swab and allow the stopper to air dry before use.
4. Place the powder vial on a firm, non-slip surface. Peel off the paper cover on the plastic housing of the vial adapter. Do not remove the adapter from the plastic housing. Holding the adapter housing, place over the powder vial and firmly press down (B) . The adapter will snap over the vial cap. Do not remove the adapter housing at this point.

5. Hold the pre-filled syringe with solvent upright. Grasp the plunger rod as per the picture and attach the rod by turning it firmly clockwise into the threaded stopper (C).

6. Holding the syringe by the barrel, snap the syringe cap off the tip (D) . Do not touch the syringe tip with your hand or any surface. Set the syringe aside for further use.

7. Now remove and discard the adapter housing (E) .

8. Attach the pre-filled syringe to the threaded vial adapter by turning clockwise (F).

9. Inject the solvent by slowly pushing down on the plunger rod (G) .

10. Swirl vial gently until all the powder is dissolved (H) . Do not shake the vial. Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved. Look to check there are no particles or discoloration before you use the solution. Do not use solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy.

11. Hold the vial on the end above the vial adapter and syringe (I) . Fill the syringe by drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly. Ensure that the full content of the vial is drawn into the syringe. Hold the syringe upright and push the plunger until no air is left in the syringe.

12. Apply a tourniquet to your arm.

13. Determine the point of injection and clean the skin.

14. Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster.

15. Holding the vial adapter in place, remove the syringe from the vial adapter (the adapter should remain attached to the vial). Attach the syringe to the venipuncture set (J) . Ensure that no blood enters the syringe

16. Remove tourniquet.

17. Inject the solution into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle. The speed of injection should be based on your comfort, but should not be faster than 2.5 mL per minute.
