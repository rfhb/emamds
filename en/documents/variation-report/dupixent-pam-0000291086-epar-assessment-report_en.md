## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- EFC16724: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study assessing the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS)

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## EFC16724: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study assessing the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS)

## Description

Study EFC16724 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in the treatment of Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and older.

The study period per participant included a screening period of 2 to 4 weeks, a randomized IMP intervention period of 52 weeks ±3 days, and a post-intervention follow-up period of 12 weeks ±5 days.

AFRS is rare, it is seen most commonly in warm, humid environments where the inciting fungi thrive. AFRS appears to be very rare in Europe as evidenced by the paucity of published literature from Europe. Study EFC16724 was not conducted as part of an approved European Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for the treatment of AFRS with dupilumab. No PIP or PIP waiver application was submitted to EMA as it is not currently the intention of the dupilumab MAH to seek an indication for the treatment of AFRS for patients of any age in the EU.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Treatments

The IMPs were dupilumab and placebo, both supplied in pre-filled syringes. Dupilumab was administered as an SC injection with a dose regimen tailored to the participant's weight. The placebo was formulated to match the active dupilumab formulation without the active ingredient. Also refer to Section 2.2. above.

## Objectives / Endpoints

The primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are shown below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 2. Objectives and endpoints

<!-- image -->

## Sample size

Due to severe recruitment challenges attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sponsor reduced the sample size of the study from 120 participants to 62 participants and updated the primary endpoint from the proportion of subjects who undergo or plan to receive rescue therapy (SCS and/or surgery) to an objective endpoint that was not impacted by the pandemic dynamics and was clinically relevant, namely change from baseline in sinus opacifications assessed by CT scans using the LMK score at Week 52.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

All participants were centrally assigned to randomized study intervention using an IRT. Randomization was stratified first by age (adults versus adolescents/children [≥6 years old]). In adults, randomization was stratified further by time from last surgery (≤2 years [including surgery naive participants], &gt;2 years), disease pattern (unilateral/bilateral in the endoscopy at screening), and country. In adolescents/children ≥6 years of age, randomization was not stratified further.

Dupilumab 300 mg/200 mg and matching placebo matching dupilumab 300 mg/200 mg were provided in identically matched 2 mL/1.14 mL pre-filled syringes that are visually indistinguishable for each dose. With regard to the treatment with either dupilumab or placebo, they were not blinded to weightbased dose levels, due to the different volume size (2 mL versus 1.14 mL). The study was not blinded to dose regimen due to the different frequency of IMP administration (q4w versus q2w).

## Statistical Methods

The planned analyses, comparisons, statistical tests, and determination of sample size are described in the final version of the SAP and contained in the study protocol. Given the very low number of patients in the paediatric population, only descriptive analyses can be made for this age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results

## Participant flow

The patient disposition for the total study population including adults and children is shown below.

Figure 1. Participant disposition

<!-- image -->

Of the paediatric participants 4 out of 6 completed the study. One adolescent on placebo terminated the study 11 weeks and 2 days after randomization due to the participant moving far from the location of the study site. In addition, 1 child on placebo permanently discontinued study intervention at Week 38 due to issues with IMP supply logistics, and did not complete the post-intervention follow-up period. There were no safety concerns driving premature end of study in either of these participants.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recruitment

The study was conducted in the United States, Canada, China, Turkey, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Israel as well as in Argentina from 21 May 2021 (first participant first visit) to 07 March 2025 (last participant last visit).

## Baseline data

## Demographics

The mean (SD) age of the randomized population was 39.8 (16.0) years. One (1.6%) child aged 6 to 11 years and 5 (8.1%) adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were randomized while the majority of patients (56; 90.3%) were adults. A total of 45 (72.6%) male and 17 (27.4%) female participants were included in the study, most of them were White (27 [43.5%]) or Asian (25 [40.3%]); 8 (12.9%) were Black or African American. There were no paediatric participants with body weight &lt;30 kg, so no dosing regimen of 300 mg q4w was administered.

Baseline characteristics for paediatric patients are shown below.

## Number analysed

The number of paediatric patients enrolled was very small with 3 patients in placebo and 3 patients in active arm.

## Efficacy results

In the paediatric population at Week 52, the mean (SD) change from baseline in LMK scores was -8.67 (4.04) in the dupilumab group and 1.50 (7.78) in the placebo group.

In 2 adolescents from the dupilumab group, the individual change from baseline in NPS at Week 52 was -4 and -1, and in 1 adolescent from the dupilumab group the individual change from baseline in NPS at Week 36 was -5 (the last available measurement during treatment period). These results were, overall, comparable to the data obtained during the 52-week treatment period. In 2 adolescents from the placebo group with available Week 52 data, the change from baseline in NPS was 0 and -3.

At Week 52, change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction score was -1.26, -2.93 and 0 in the 3 adolescents from the dupilumab group. In the placebo group, a single adolescent participant had Week 52 data available showing the change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction score of 0.24.

At Week 52, change from baseline in TSS was -4.42, -0.07, and -8.62 in the 3 adolescents from the dupilumab group. In the placebo group, a single adolescent participant had Week 52 data available showing the change from baseline in TSS of 1.31.

## Safety results

In the dupilumab group, 32 out of 33 participants received dupilumab 300 mg q2w, including 2 adolescents (with body weight ≥60 kg at screening). In addition, 1 adolescent with body weight &lt;60 kg at screening received dupilumab 200 mg q2w. There were no paediatric participants with body weight &lt;30 kg, so no dosing regimen of 300 mg q4w was administered.

Overall, 2 out of 3 paediatric participants in the dupilumab group and 1 out of 3 paediatric participants in the placebo group experienced at least 1 TEAE. All the TEAEs were mild or moderate.

TEAEs by primary SOC and PT for the paediatric participants by the cut-off date for the main CSR are shown in the Table 5 below. Until the cut-off 07 March 2025, there were no new TEAEs reported in paediatric participants in either treatment group. Overall, the number of paediatric participants with reported TEAEs was low across treatment groups with no patterns or trends identified.

- One adolescent participant in the dupilumab group had moderate Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (worsening) during the treatment-emergent period. The study intervention was not discontinued. The participant recovered from the event without corrective treatment. This event was assessed as not related to the IMP by the Investigator.
- One adolescent participant in the dupilumab group had moderate Influenza during the treatmentemergent period. The study intervention was not discontinued. The participant received corrective treatment and recovered from the event. This participant also had mild post-treatment AEs of Accident and Joint dislocation. None of the AEs were assessed as related to the IMP by the Investigator.
- One adolescent participant in the placebo group had mild TEAEs of COVID-19, Cough, and Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (worsening) during the treatment-emergent period. The study intervention was not discontinued. The participant received corrective treatments and recovered from the events. None of the AEs were assessed as related to the IMP by the Investigator.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The applicant submitted efficacy and safety data from study EFC16724, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in the treatment of Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS). The study included adults, adolescents and children ≥ 6 years. Participants were treated for 52 weeks with dupilumab or placebo followed-up for 12 weeks.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in sinus opacifications assessed by CT scans using the LMK score at Week 52. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in sinus opacifications at Week 24, improvement in symptoms, nasal polyp presence and characteristics, overall symptom severity, quality of life, sense of smell, and three-dimensional CT volumetric measurement of the paranasal sinuses. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity of dupilumab were also evaluated.

The study mainly enrolled adult participants (90.3%) while a total of 6 participants in the age range of 6 to 17 years included were included of whom 3 received dupilumab. Two adolescents with body weight ≥60 kg received dupilumab 300 mg q2w; one adolescent with body weight &lt;60 kg at screening received dupilumab 200 mg q2w. There were no paediatric participants with body weight &lt;30 kg, so no dosing regimen of 300 mg q4w was administered. Of the paediatric participants 4 out of 6 completed the study. The limited number of paediatric patients only allows a descriptive evaluation of efficacy and safety data.

The study met the primary endpoint (evaluated for the total study population) as seen by a reduction in sinus opacification as measured by the LMK score at Week 52 (difference versus placebo in change from baseline in LMK score of -7.36). Similar results were seen for the small paediatric population included (change from baseline in LMK: dupilumab -8.67; placebo: 1.50) with similar trends of efficacy also for the secondary endpoints.

In the total study population, 69.7% participants in the dupilumab group and 78.6% participants in the placebo group experienced at least one TEAE. There was one severe TEAE in the dupilumab group and one in the placebo group, respectively. All three SAE reported occurred in the placebo group. There were no AESIs during the study. In the paediatric population, 2 out of 3 participants in the dupilumab group and 1 out of 3 paediatric participants in the placebo group experienced at least 1 TEAE. These events included 2 events of worsening of AFRS disease and one event of influenza. These events were all mild or moderate. No paediatric participants discontinued treatment for safety-related reasons.

The safety results obtained in study EFC16724 are consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. No new safety findings were identified in this study. No amendments of the product information were introduced by the applicant which is supported.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The applicant submitted efficacy and safety data from study EFC16724, a phase 3 clinical study designed and conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of dupilumab in adults, adolescents and children ≥6 years with AFRS. A total of 6 paediatric participants were enrolled. The study met its primary endpoint with similar results seen for patients 6 to 17 years included. The collected safety data are consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. It is agreed with the MAH that no amendment of the product information is warranted.
