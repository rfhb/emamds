## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1. Introduction

Imatinib is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which inhibits the Abl tyrosine kinase at the in vitro, cellular and in vivo level. The compound specifically inhibits proliferation of v-ABL and BCR-ABL expressing  cells.  In  addition,  imatinib  inhibits  the  activity  of  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor receptors (PDGFR) α and β ,  c-kit,  the  receptor  for  stem  cell  factors  (SCF),  c-Fms,  the  receptor  for macrophage-stimulating factors (M-CSF), as well as the ABL and Arg PTK. Imatinib also inhibits the cell signalling events mediated by activation of BCR-ABL, c-Kit and the PDGF receptors.

The MAH submitted a type II variation for Glivec, proposing to include 'Treatment of adult patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL)'

Folowing the assessment the indication has been specified for HES/CEL patients with demonstrated FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion kinase. A starting dose of 100 mg/day is recommended. Dose increase from 100 mg to 400 mg for these patients may be considered in the absence of adverse drug reactions if assessments demonstrate an insufficient response to therapy.

The COMP granted Glivec the orphan status for HES on 19 August 2005. A Commission Decision was issued on 28 October 2005.

## Clinical aspects

Chronic  myeloproliferative  diseases  (CMPD)  can  be  classified  as  either  being  Bcr-Abl  positive  or negative. Classic Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is defined by the presence of the Bcr-Abl fusion kinase RNA transcripts in the blood and bone marrow. Bcr-Abl negative CMPD can be further classified into 'classic' forms of CMPD, which include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,  and  myelofibrosis  with  myeloid  metaplasia.  Other  disorders  that  are  Bcr-Abl negative share certain phenotypic characteristics of the 'classic' forms of CMPD, but are considered 'atypical' as they have other unique features. Clinicopathologically these disorders include mastocytosis, varying forms of eosinophilic disorders (including HES, CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia  (CMML),  juvenile  myelomonocytic  leukemia,  chronic  neutrophilic  leukemia,  and  an unclassified category of mixed or hybrid CMPD (Pardanani &amp; Tefferi 2004 ).

Idiopathic  hypereosinophilic  disorder  is  a  rare  hematological  disorder  characterized  by  chronic overproduction  of  eosinophils,  tissue  infiltration  and  organ  damage.  Diagnostic  criteria  include sustained  eosinophilia  (&gt;1500  eosinophils/mm 3 )  for  more  than  six  months,  exclusion  of  reactive causes  of  hypereosinophilia,  such  as  parasitic  infections  or  allergic  reactions,  and  evidence  of  end organ  involvement.  Following  original  classification,  other  classification  schemes  developed  that required  HES  remain  a  disorder  of  exclusion  of  all  other  causes,  including  eosinophilia  of  clonal origin, such as the atypical chronic myeloproliferative disorders mentioned in the first paragraph of this section. In this instance, the clonal disorders would be classified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL).  In  the  most  current  WHO  classification,  a  diagnosis  of  HES  or  CEL  requires  exclusion  of reactive causes, of malignancies in which eosinophilia is reactive or part of the neoplastic clone, and of  T-cell  disorders  with  immunophenotype  and  cytokine  production  abnormalities,  with  or  without evidence of lymphocyte clonality, as reported by Bain, et al (2001) . The authors further commented on the separation of HES and CEL, following the report by Cools, et al (2003) demonstrating that many  patients  with  HES  had  a  clonal  molecular  abnormality,  the  FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion  gene (Bain 2004b)   .

If no such evidence was found, Bain (2004a)    still felt a diagnosis of CEL could be based on clinical features  (i.e.  elevated  blasts,  etc.).  Although  the  WHO  classification  of  eosinophilic  disorders recommends  a  diagnosis  of  CEL  when  clonality  is  proven  and  maintains  that  the  idiopathic hypereosinophilic  syndrome  (IHES)  remains  a  diagnosis  of  exclusion,  several  authors  have  pointed out the problems of sorting these patients in clinical practice (Vandenberghe, et al 2004, Martinelli, et al 2006) . Elevated blasts in blood and marrow are often not  present  in  patients  with  CEL  defined  by  detecting  a  cytogenetic  abnormality,  other  surrogate clinical/laboratory markers for CEL are often also present in IHES, and organ infiltration/damage can occur in both disorders. For this reason, the sponsor will broadly define HES as including both CEL and IHES in his description of the role of imatinib in the treatment of these disorders in the dossier.

Eosinophils derive in the bone marrow from CD34+ myeloid progenitor stem cells and differentiate in response to a number of T-cell derived eosinophilic cytokines and growth factors including IL-3, GM-

CSF  and  IL-5  (Ackerman &amp; Butterfield 2005) .  Eosinophils  participate  broadly  in  a  variety  of functional  roles,  including  host  defense,  allergic  responses,  and  inflammatory  reactions  (including tissue  injury  and  fibrosis).  Clinically,  these  multiple  functions  lead  to  the  protean  manifestations  of eosinophilic  disorders.  The  clinical  manifestations  of  organ  infiltration  and  subsequent  dysfunction often dominate the clinical picture. Patients with HES have a predilection for organ infiltration of the heart, the central and peripheral nervous system, the lungs and the skin.

The illness  most  often  develops  in  patients  20  to  50  years  of  age  and  has  a  strong  male  to  female predilection (9:1 ratio) (Fauci, et al 1982) . End organ manifestations are multiple.

In addition to the system specific abnormalities, patients may also have unexplained constitutional symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, fever, excessive sweating and psychiatric disturbances

The most commonly encountered clinical events, and often the most serious, are the cardiovascular complications that occur in 50-75% of all patients. These are often life threatening and life limiting in patients  with  HES.  In  the  early  phases  of  cardiac  involvement,  eosinophilic  infiltration  can  cause inflammatory disorders of the heart and intramural thrombi to form on the endocardial surfaces. In time, inflammation leads to fibrosis leading to valvular disorders and constrictive pericarditis. Once fibrosis  occurs,  the  cardiac  conditions  are  irreversible  by  medical  therapy  alone  and  often  require cardiac surgical procedures for control.

Treatment  for  HES ,  once  appropriate  diagnostic  and  extent  of  disease  evaluations  have  been performed, employ algorithms for treatment based on the presence or absence of the FIP1L1-PDGFR α

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

fusion gene (see discussion below 'The role of genetics in HES'). If the patient does not have the FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion  gene,  no  extreme  eosinophilia  in the  peripheral  blood,  and  no  evidence  of organ  dysfunction,  following  the  patient  quarterly  with  re-evaluations  is  the  currently  accepted approach.

If the disease is more extreme, then systemic corticosteroid therapies are generally administered using various regimens. If control is not achieved, other agents are added or used, including hydroxyurea, interferonα , vincristine and alkylating agents. Pheresis, anticoagulation, cardiac surgery, splenectomy, stem  cell  transplantation,  and  investigational  agents  are  included  under  specialized  circumstances (Ackerman &amp; Butterfield, 2005) .

Hypereosinophilic syndrome remains a serious disease in many patients with continued unmet medical needs  for  therapy,  especially  if  the  patient's  condition  is  not  easily  improved  with  systemic corticosteroids  or  if  the  patient  develops  serious  signs  of  organ  dysfunction.  Traditional  cytotoxic chemotherapies  are  difficult  to  take  and  not  very  effective.  Plasmapheresis  and  major  surgical procedures are not easy for the patient to tolerate and do not treat the underlying cause of the disorder. Thus, newer approaches to the treatment of HES in patients with aggressive forms of the disease need to  be  developed.  Early  reports,  prior  to  recognition  and  treatment  techniques  for  the  cardiovascular complications, gave a dismal prognosis for patients with HES. Improvements in therapies and patient support generally led to survival rates in the late 1980s reported as 80% at 5 years and 40% at 10 and 15 years (Ackerman &amp; Butterfield 2005) .

## The role of genetics in HES

The clonal nature of some patients with HES was first described utilizing X-inactivation assays in the 1990s, however it was the description of a fusion gene on chromosome 4 (FIP1L1-PDGFR α ) that first described a clonal genetic abnormality related to the HES phenotype and a rationale for its treatment with imatinib (Cools, et al 2003) . FIP1L1-PDGFR α is a unique fusion gene caused by the fusion of the  FIP1L1  gene  to  the  PDGFR α gene. The  fusion results from  an interstitial deletion of approximately  800-kb  on  chromosome  4q12  that  includes  the  cysteine-rich  hydrophobic  domain  2 (CHIC2)  locus.  This  small  deletion  is  not  readily  seen  in  routine  karyotyping,  hence  it  has  been described as a 'silent deletion'. The resulting fusion kinase, FIP1L1-PDGFR α , is constitutively active and drives the phenotype of HES in patients who have it. It is also a target for imatinib.

Other clonal  and  molecular genetic  abnormalities  have  been  identified  in  patients  with  HES.  These may or may not be associated with easily identified karyotypic abnormalities, but have added further weight to arguments and classification schemes driving attempts to separate CEL from IHES. There have been multiple  molecular  genetic  abnormalities  detected  in  patients  with  eosinophilic  disorders and recent reviews are available that describe them (Bain 2004a, Gotlib, et al 2004) . Some of these reports describe clonal abnormalities of PDGFR β , another known target for imatinib (Apperley, et al 2002) .  Other  as  yet  undescribed  cytogenetic  abnormalities  and  fusion  kinases sensitive to imatinib may be found in patients with HES and myeloproliferative disorders associated with eosinophilia (Cools, et al 2003) .

A  proportion  of  patients  with  HES  demonstrate  a  clonal  expansion  of  abnormal  lymphocyte populations.  The  abnormal  T-cell  populations  may  overexpress  the  cytokine  IL-5,  leading  to  the expansion  of  the  eosinophil  mass  causing  manifestations  of  HES.  Clonal  rearrangements  of  T-cell genes have been described and this T-cell stimulated mechanism may explain other cases of HES. It is currently unknown whether subsets of T-cell associated HES also express the FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion gene. Additionally, the sensitivity of HES patients with this T-cell driven pathogenesis to imatinib is unknown. Recent reviews comment on this aspect of HES (Gotlib, et al 2004) .

Imatinib  specifically  inhibits  Abl,  PDGFRs,  and  c-Kit  kinases  and  displays  impressive  clinical efficacy  in  Bcr-Abl-positive  CML.  (Cools, et al 2003) were  the  first  to  describe  the  relationship between FIP1L1-PDGFR α , patients with HES, and the response of the target to imatinib. They showed that the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFR α was inhibited by imatinib (IC50) at 3.2 nM,  whereas  the  same  measure  for  cells  expressing  Bcr-Abl  was  582 nM.  The  publication described responses in 9 of 11 patients treated with imatinib and the presence of FIP1L1-PDGFR α in 5 of the 9 patients whose illness responded for more than 3 months. The subsequent detection of a T647I mutation in PDGFR α ,  a  mutation  known to  confer resistance to imatinib, in  a patient who relapsed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gave  further  proof  that  FIP1L1-PDGFR α was  causally  related  to  the  disorder  in  some  patients. Cools, et al (2003) .

## 2 Clinical studies

This application is supported by:

- A phase II open label [Study B2225] in patients with life threatening diseases, including HES, known to be associated with one or more imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases and
- 34 publications and one manuscript submitted for publication (Martinelli, et al 2006)

.

The total number of HES and CEL patients included is 176 (14 from [Study B2225] and 162 from the publications).

At  least  three  investigator-led  studies,  CSTI571ADE31,  CSTI571AIT12  and  CSTI571AUS19,  are enrolling patients with HES. These studies are ongoing.

Study  B2225  was  an  open-label,  multicenter,  non-randomized,  uncontrolled,  single  arm  study evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  in  patients  suffering  from  different  life-threatening  diseases associated with Abl, Kit or PDGFR PTK and refractory to standard therapeutic options or for which no conventional therapies of definitive benefit existed.

## 2. 1. Methods

Patients were eligible to receive imatinib treatment in this study, provided they had a malignant, lifethreatening disease (solid or haematological malignancies) and the disease was refractory to standard therapeutic options or no conventional therapies of definitive benefit existed. Other inclusion criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2, adequate end organ function,  life  expectancy  of  more  than  3  months,  adequate  contraception  and  written,  informed consent.

The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients suffering from different  malignancies known to be associated with one or  more imatinib-sensitive PTKs following failure of standard therapeutic options or without therapeutic options of definitive benefit.

The primary  efficacy  variable was  the  frequency  of  response  to  treatment,  although  no  formal definition  of  response  was  included  in  the  protocol  for  haematologic  malignancies.  The  activity  of imatinib  was  assessed  primarily  by  evaluating  normalization  of  blood  counts,  and/or  relevant  bone marrow or radiologic assessments (e.g. radionuclide scanning). The response for either of these was captured in the  same way and categorized as complete response, partial response; stable disease/no response, progressive disease or unknown. The best response status was classified as unknown for any category of response (except progressive disease) if not confirmed by a subsequent evaluation after at least 4 weeks. Tumor status was assessed at baseline, at Visits 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and at End of Study. The planned duration of the study was 2 years.

The main clinical secondary efficacy variable was the evolution of the ECOG performance status. It was assessed at baseline and at Visits 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and End of Study. Similarly, periodic weight assessments were summarized by visit looking at changes over time.

The secondary  objectives were  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  imatinib,  to  evaluate  the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of imatinib in selected patients and to assess, if feasible, the functional significance of relevant signal-transduction components in target tissues by evaluating the expression and activation status of the relevant tyrosine kinase molecules or associated signaling molecules, by measuring indices of cellular proliferation and by correlating the changes in the above findings with clinical outcomes.

Safety assessments consisted  of  evaluating  adverse  events  (AE)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAE), laboratory  parameters  including  hematology,  biochemistry,  vital  signs,  physical  examinations,  and documentation of all concomitant medications and therapies. All safety and efficacy evaluations were performed on patients who received at least one dose of study medication.

No further details of the history of patient with HES, such as cytogenetic abnormalities, are provided in the clinical study report, due to missing data.

## Dosing and exposure

No dose finding studies have been performed. The dose of imatinib for this study was chosen on the basis of demonstrated efficacy and safety in other malignant diseases, suggesting that a similar dose could  be  employed  to  explore  the  efficacy  of  imatinib  in  the  new  indication.  Patients  with haematologic malignancies were initiated on imatinib therapy at a dose level of 400 mg/day.

In the published literature listed in this submission, patients received doses ranging from 100 mg to 800 mg  daily.  From  the  reports,  the  dose  selection  rationale  used  by  investigators  included  the recognition  of FIP1L1-PDGFR α inhibition  by  low  concentration  exposures  to  imatinib,  empiricism, the clinical status of the patients, known efficacy and safety profile of imatinib at the 400 mg dose.

None of these studies were large enough to provide a dose selection rationale and were not designed for  this  purpose.  In  the  first  case  series  report,  the  investigator  made  an  empiric  decision  to  begin treatment with 100 mg daily, which was reduced to 200 mg weekly in responders (Gleich, et al 2002) .  In  the  largest  case  series,  patients  were  begun  at  a  dose  of  100 mg  and  then increased in 100 mg increments weekly to a dose of 400 mg (Martinelli, et al 2006) . Clearly patients with  FIP1L1-PDGFR α can  develop  responses  on  doses  of  imatinib  as  low  as  100 mg  per  day,  but other investigators have administered imatinib at 400 mg per day to such patients. The median dose intensity was as planned in the protocol, approximately 400 mg daily for hematological malignancies, indicating a good compliance by the patients. The mean dose intensity HES patient was slightly higher than planned dose in patients with hematological malignancies (473 mg, 118%), similar to the median dose  intensity  in  the  whole  population  with  hematological  malignancies.  Of  note,  the  frequency  of dose variation (dose escalation) due to lack of efficacy is very similar in the two populations (11.4% in solid tumors and 11.1% in hematological malignancies).

The median duration of therapy was 8.8 months with a range of 16 to 709 days.

## Efficacy results

In  patients  with  HES,  efficacy  was assessed by evaluating the frequency of haematological response.

PR = Partial response, SD = Stable disease, PD = Progressive disease, UNK = unknown

The + sign indicates that the Time to Progression was censored on that day.

In the group of 14 patients with HES, four patients experienced a partial response (PR) with durations of response of at least 348, 394, 131 and 183 days and time to progression censored on Days 429, 421, 349 and 210, respectively. The duration of this partial response was longer than 4 months. Another two patients had SD, one kept on treatment for 678 days while the other progressed after 400 days. Two  patients  had  'Unknown'  as  best  response  due  to  missing  data;  one  with  time  to  progression censored on Day 177, the other progressing after 114 days.

The  ECOG  performance  status  for  the  HES  population  is  better  at  baseline  than  in  the  overall population (no worse than 2). In these patients, the overall ECOG performance status did not change substantially, with  two  patients  having  worsened  ECOG  at the  end  of  the  study  (but  only  one  with ECOG 2) and two patients improving their ECOG at the end of study from ECOG 1 to ECOG 0. The results in ECOG status do not provide relevant efficacy information. The results of cytogenetic response have not been provided and seem to have not been collected. There is not any information about improvement of symptoms or organ damage related to HES either.

As there is no description of the presence and type of any mutation or disease status in these 4 patients, it is not possible to analyse if these aspects were correlated with response.

Only  patients  aged  15  years  old  or  older  were  included  in  study  B2225.  As  HES/CEL  is  usually diagnosed in adults, the age group investigated is adequate.

## 3.3 Published Case Series and Case Reports

* The publication states that the patient presented with a reduction in eosinophils to 10.3% associated with a marked decrease in mast cells after 4 weeks with 100 mg/day imatinib. However, at 8 weeks, the Eo count increased again in the peripheral blood; an increased dose of 200 mg/day was temporarily effective up to 30 weeks of treatment, after which the disease became refractory to the increased dose.

**  The  publication  states  that  a  complete  hematological  remission  was  achieved,  although  this  patient  had only  a  transient  response  to 100 mg/day imatinib, which lasted several weeks, and had no response to an increased dose of imatinib

***  The  publication  states  that  the  patient  experienced  transient  normalization  of  peripheral  Eo  counts  within  1  week  of  the start  of 100 mg/day  imatinib.  Two  weeks  later,  the  symptoms  recurred  and  the  Eo  count  increased  without  further  improvement  despite  dose increase to 400 mg.

a Including one patient reported by Schaller &amp; Burkland (2001) already counted in the single case reports

b Treatment discontinued in one patient due to CTC grade 3 fatigue

c Duration of response in one patient of 5 months, then relapse

d Treatment discontinued in one patient due to AEs (fatigue, diarrhea, muscle cramps)

e Relapse in one patient with blast crisis

f Including one patient already reported by Rotoli, et al (2003) already counted in the single case reports

## Haematological response

107  out  of  162  patients  (66%)  reported  in  the  literature  experienced  a  complete  hematological response. Cytogenetic abnormalities were evaluated in 117 of the 176 patients treated in the published reports and [Study B2225]. Sixty-one out of these 117 patients had FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion kinase. All  these  FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion  kinase  positive  patients  achieved  a  complete  hematological response.

The  FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion  kinase  was  either  negative  or  unknown  in  115  patients,  of  which  62 (54%) achieved either a complete (n=46) or partial (n=16) hematological response.

## Cytogenetic and molecular response

There are several reports of complete cytogenetic response and a few of molecular response.

* The ultimate duration for each ongoing patient in the publications is unknown. The durations presented in this table are those reported in the publications at the time of each report.

** One patient is already reported by Rotoli, et al (2003) and counted with that publication.

*** One patient is already reported by Schaller &amp; Burkland (2001) and counted with that publication.

a The publication states that a complete hematological remission was achieved, although this patient had only a transient response to 100 mg/day imatinib, which lasted several weeks, and had no response to an increased dose of imatinib

b The  publication  states  that  the  patient  presented  with  a  reduction  in  eosinophils  to  10.3%  associated  with  a  marked decrease in mast cells after 4 weeks with 100 mg/day imatinib. However, at 8 weeks, the Eo count increased again; a dose increase to 200 mg/day was temporarily effective up to 30 weeks of treatment, after which the disease became refractory to the increased dose.

c The publication states that the patient experienced transient normalization of peripheral Eo counts within 1 week of the start of 100 mg/day imatinib. Two weeks later, the Eo count increased without further improvement despite dose increase to 400 mg.

† Best response by Novartis criteria required that responses be accurately coded on two successful visits for confirmation. Otherwise it is listed officially as 'Unknown'.

Additionally,  although  the  evaluation  of  hematological  responses  as  defined  by  improvement  in hematologic and bone marrow abnormalities was the primary basis for determining response in these patients, improvements in symptomatology and other organ dysfunction abnormalities were reported by the investigators.

In  the  largest  case  series  in  this  application,  28  out  of  59  patients  (47%)  presented  with  organ involvement (Martinelli, et al 2006) .  The most common organ involvement was with lung, skin or heart, and less common with liver, spleen or soft tissue. Organ involvement regression was recorded in all the patients that reached CR. La Starza, et al (2005) published the second largest case series in which  lung,  heart,  skin,  CNS,  or  gastrointestinal  involvement  were  reported  in  10  of  12  patients. Improvements  were  observed  in  heart  and  CNS  involvement.  Klion, et al (2004) treated  seven patients who presented with lung, heart, skin, and spleen involvement. Organ involvement resolved or normalized in all but the heart. Although the patients' constitutional symptoms improved, the signs and  symptoms  of  congestive  heart  failure  in  three  patients  with  endomyocardial  fibrosis  remained unaffected.  End  organ  damage  caused  by  eosinophilic  infiltration  is  reversible  to  a  point,  but  once organ  fibrosis  occurs  in  response  to  the  infiltration  the  disorder  is  unlikely  to  be  reversible  with therapy.

Summary of Published Case Series and Case Reports

Schaller and Burkland (2001) were  the  first  to  report  that  treatment  with  imatinib  at  a  dose  of 100 mg/day caused rapid and complete hematological remission (CHR) in a 41-year-old male patient with HES who suffered from severe, intractable side effects of long-term hydroxyurea and interferonα therapy.

Ault, et al (2002) reported  on  a  54-year-old  male  patient  with  HES  resistant  to  steroids  and chemotherapy, with persistent  hip  pain.  Upon  administration  of  imatinib  at  100 mg/day,  the  patient had a rapid and significant reduction of hip pains, as well as rapid improvement of the hemoglobin and platelet counts and disappearance of eosinophilia. He experienced no side effect from the therapy, but developed fulminant pneumococcal sepsis and died three months after initiation of imatinib treatment.

Gleich, et al (2002) reported positive response to imatinib 100 mg/day in 4 of 5 patients with HES. One of these patients had previously been reported by Schaller and Burkland (2001) .  Responding patients  were  all  males  with  normal  serum  interleukin-5  levels.  Analysis  for  c-Kit  activation  loop mutation (D816V) in the responding patients was negative, suggesting that c-Kit was not the target of imatinib.

Gotlib, et al (2002) described imatinib treatment of 5 male patients with HES unresponsive to prior therapies including corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea. Four patients had a normal karyotype and one patient  had  a  t(1:4)  translocation.  A  complete  hematologic  remission  was  rapidly  achieved  in  all patients, which was still ongoing at the time of the publication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nolasco, et al (2002) reported on a 46-year-old male with normal karyotype and Bcr-Abl negative by PCR analysis. After treatment with interferonα associated to glucocoticosteroids and hydroxyurea was discontinued due to  GI  intolerance,  hydroxyurea  was  stopped  and  imatinib  at  100 mg/day  was started.  Within  one  week,  Eo  count  decreased  rapidly  and  reached  normal  levels  at  the  end  of  the second  week  of  treatment.  Glucocorticosteroids  were  progressively  discontinued  and  imatinib  was tapered to 100 mg twice weekly by the end of the fourth week. A bone marrow biopsy at the time showed only rare eosinophils and slight fibrosis. Since then, the patient remains asymptomatic and is off any other type of treatment.

Cools, et al (2003) enrolled 16 patients with HES. All patients had received prior therapy with no or limited  success  including,  but  not  limited  to,  prednisone,  hydroxyurea  and/or  interferonα .  Eleven patients (9 men and 2 women) with symptomatic disease (e.g. endomyocardial fibrosis, gastrointestinal  Eo  infiltrates,  cranial  nerve  palsies,  rash,  hepatosplenomegaly)  were  treated  with imatinib.  Treatment  with  imatinib  (100-400 mg/day)  resulted  in  CHR  in  10  of  11  patients  after  a median of 4 weeks (range 1-12 weeks). One of the ten patients had a transient response that lasted several weeks and did not respond to increasing doses of imatinib. The median duration of response in the remaining nine patients was 7 months (range 3-15 months). Analysis of patient DNA for activating mutations in known targets of imatinib (PDGFR α , PDGF β , c-Kit) indicated the presence of a deletion on 4q12 with a breakpoint near PDGFR α .  This deletion left behind fragments of two genes, FIP1L1 and PDGFR α ,  which fused to form a novel gene, FIP1L1-PDGFR α ,  which has constitutively active tyrosine kinase analogous to the imatinib sensitive Bcr-Abl enzyme.

Cortes, et al (2003) reported  the  results  of  imatinib  treatment  in  9  patients  with  HES.  All  patients had  received  prior  therapy  with  no  or  limited  success  including,  but  not  limited  to,  steroids, hydroxyurea, interferonα and/or chemotherapy. All patients were symptomatic at the start of imatinib therapy.  All  patients  had  normal  karyotypes,  and  no  patient  had  the  Bcr-Abl  rearrangement.  Four patients achieved CR. All 4 responders were men. All patients in the series were treated with imatinib at  100 mg/day,  although  in  one  patient  the  dose  was  increased  to  400 mg/day  before  the  response could be confirmed.

Ishii, et al (2003) reported  one  41-year-old  male  patient  diagnosed  with  HES  and  myelofibrosis based  on  bone  marrow  biopsy  and  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (32%  eosinophils).  He  was  treated  with prednisolone,  interferonα ,  hydroxyurea  and  cyclosporine  A  without  significant  efficacy  for  his eosinophilia  and  complained  of  asthma-like  respiratory  symptoms.  He  was  started  on  imatinib  at 100 mg/day; after 7 days, absolute Eo count fell to within the normal range and asthma-like symptoms disappeared completely. Imatinib was administered for 7 days at 100 mg/day and then maintained at 100 mg twice weekly. At the time of the publication, no eosinophilia was noted, and there were no notable adverse events.

Klion, et al (2004) analyzed  responses  in  seven  HES  patients  treated  with  imatinib  at  300  to 400 mg/day. All seven patients had elevated serum tryptase levels and the FIP1L1-PDGFR α mutation in  RNA  from  peripheral  blood  cells.  All  seven  patients  responded  to  imatinib.  1  mo  of  imatinib administration, a rapid and dramatic decrease in Eo was found as well as complete resolution of Eorelated  signs,  except  for  cardiac  involvement.  The  lack  of  reversal  of  cardiac  abnormalities  and persistence  of  the  FIP1L1-PDGFR α mutation  in  one  patient  suggests  that  early  intervention  with higher doses than the administered (300-400 mg/day) of imatinib may be desirable in the treatment of patients with MP-HES. Abnormalities in laboratory test results, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum tryptase and B12 levels resolved in all seven patients. There was also a reversal of BM abnormalities as well as a reduction in aberrant and activated mast cells and activated Eo. The authors concluded that elevated serum tryptase is a sensitive marker of a myeloproliferative variant of HES characterized by tissue fibrosis, poor prognosis, and imatinib responsiveness.

Koury, et al (2003) reported a case where HES  was  coexisting with a rare skin disease, lymphomatoid papulosis, characterized by multiple transient papular eruptions due to focal dermal Tcell  infiltration  who  had  failed  treatment  with  hydroxyurea  for  HES  and  methotrexate,  psoralenultraviolet A light for the skin disorder, presented with severe dyspnea and biventricular heart failure. Serum IL-5 levels were markedly elevated. Imatinib was given at the dose of 400 mg/day for 2 weeks, 200 mg/day  for  7  months,  and  100 mg/day  for  11  months.  Eo  counts  and  skin  lesions  disappeared within a week, serum IL-5 rapidly declined and normalized in 5 weeks; hydroxyurea was discontinued

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in 2 weeks and prednisone reduced in the course of 6 months. At 6 months, cardiac status improved dramatically and at 18 months the patient was active. The authors concluded that an unidentified TK in the intracellular pathways of IL-5 production or IL-5 receptor signaling is the target for imatinib and that imatinib should be considered for all patients with HES or lymphomatoid papulosis.

Pardanani, et al (2003) treated five HES patients (all male, median age 46 years) and 2 with the very rare  eosinophilia-associated  chronic  myeloid disorder (Eos-CMD) (both  male, aged 45 and 58). All patients had failed previous treatments including but not limited to prednisone. At a median follow-up of 17 weeks (range 10-33 weeks), two HES and one eos-CMD patient achieved CHR and one HES achieved PR.

Pottier, et al (2003) published  a  case  report  of  a  32-year-old  male  who  had  hypereosinophilia associated with cutaneous mastocytosis. The patient failed interferonα and hydroxyurea therapy, but responded  completely  to  imatinib  400 mg/day  within  three  weeks  of  initiation. The  urticaria pigmentosa lesions persisted. The patient was still on therapy after six months.

Salem, et al (2003) reported  six  patients  with  idiopathic  HES.  All  patients  had  received  prior therapies including but not limited to corticosteroids alone (n=2) or in association with hydroxyurea (n=2) or with hydroxyurea, interferonα and cytarabine (n=2). All patients achieved partial response with these initial therapies. Five patients had normal karyotypes and one showed trisomy 8. RT-PCR was  negative  for  ETV6-PDGFRB  and  Bcr-Abl  fusion  mRNAs.  All  patients  rapidly  achieved  CHR when treated daily with imatinib at 100 mg.

Ascione, et al (2004) reported the case of a 33-year-old man  with  HES  and  with  cardiac involvement (acute coronary syndrome). A treatment with imatinib at 400 mg/day and warfarin was initiated.  After  four  months,  the  WBC  showed  Eo  count  decreased  to  normal  levels  and  an  ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm without ST segment modifications.

Frickhofen, et al (2004) reported  a  33-year-old  man  in  whom  a  diagnosis  of  hypereosinophilic syndrome was made. Treatment with azathioprine and prednisone was started, the patient's condition improved.  However,  laboratory  evaluations  confirmed  eosinophilia  with  counts  varying  between 1.5x109/L (during treatment with azathioprine) and 8.4x109/L (after discontinuation of azathioprine). Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype. The patient was started on imatinib at 200 mg/day. Within two weeks, Eo count decreased to normal levels and remained there with continued imatinib treatment. At the time of the report, the patient was feeling well without any adverse events.

Malagola, et al (2004) reported the case of a 47-year-old male diagnosed with chronic eosinophilic leukemia  (CEL).  His  karyotype  was  normal.  No  Bcr-Abl  rearrangement  was  found,  but  FIP1L1PDGFR α rearrangement  was  detected.  Treatment  with  imatinib  was  begun  on  a  dose-escalation regimen: 100 mg/day for the first week with weekly dose increases of 100 mg/day up to a maximum dose  of  400 mg/day.  Seven  days  after  start  of  treatment,  the  WBC  and  eosinophil  counts  were dramatically reduced and maintained constantly within normal ranges over 120 days of observation. Molecular response was documented 80 days after the start of the treatment.

Martinelli, et al (2004) reported the case of a 65-year-old man presenting with idiopathic HES. RTPCR analysis detected the FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion gene but no Bcr-Abl, FGFR1-Bcr or PDGFR α -Tel rearrangement. The patient was started on imatinib at 600 mg/day; after 21 days, the white cell and eosinophils  counts  fell  dramatically  and  have  remained  normal  over  17  months  of  continuing treatment.

Musto, et al (2004) observed  a  t(2:4)(p24:q12)  reciprocal  translocation  in  a  64-year-old  male affected by HES with complete clinical response, CHR and CCR to imatinib (100 mg/day) sustained for 10 months of follow-up. Cytogenic and FISH analyses suggested a different molecular abnormality than  the  FIP1L1-PDGFR α rearrangement.  The  authors  described  that  while  the  patient  with  t(2:4) achieved impressive durable response with 100 mg/day imatinib, for the other three patients 400 to 800 mg/day imatinib was necessary to achieve response..

Payne, et al (2004) reported  2  clinical  cases  of  HES  refractory  to  standard  therapy  in  two  male patients with organ involvement. Both were treated with imatinib. In one patient, a 29-year-old man with normal cytogenetics, treatment with imatinib at 1400 mg/day produced resolution of symptoms and peripheral blood count within 6 days. The patient had maintained normal blood count s and was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

symptom free more than one year after start of treatment. The second patient, a 20-year-old man also with normal cytogenetics, failed to respond to imatinib even at a maximum dose of 400 mg/day.

Rose, et al (2004) reported  the  case  of  a  leukemic  form  of  HES  refractory  to  intensive  treatment (including  hydroxyurea,  prednisone,  interferonα ,  cytarabine,  thiotepa,  etoposide  and  allograft)  in whom sustained clinical and molecular response was induced by 200 mg/day imatinib. The 29-yearold male patient in poor clinical status achieved CCR after only 15 days of treatment with imatinib and the response persisted 1 year later.

Rotoli, et al (2004) treated  a  37-year-old  male  affected  by  Loeffler's  endocarditis  with  imatinib. Cytogenetics, FISH and molecular analyses showed the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion gene. Standard  echocardiography  revealed  a  large  infiltration of the apical region,  with  apparently pedunculate  corpora  floating  in  the  LV  chamber.  Treatment  with  low  dose  imatinib  (initially 200 mg/day  reduced  to  100 mg/day  after  2  weeks)  caused  rapid  regression  of  both  eosinophilic proliferation and endomyocardiopathy. The CHR and reversion of the cardiac damage were sustained for  17  months  at  the  time  of  the  report.  The  FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion  gene  was  found  significantly decreased  after  a  few  months  of  treatment.  Using  a  contrast  echocardiographic  approach,  we demonstrated the non-thrombotic origin of the 'in-plus' image in our patient and its rapid resolution following imatinib treatment.

Smith, et al (2004) describe 3 patients with HES with cytogenetic abnormalities (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in two patients, t(5:12)(q33:p13) translocation in a third patient). The two first patients (46- and 52-year-old  men)  were  given  imatinib  at  400 mg/day  and  both  presented  rapid  normalization  of eosinophils  counts;  at  the  time  of  the  publication,  they  had  remained  clear  for  8  months  with  no apparent adverse effects from the drug. The third patient, a 56-year-old man, was given imatinib at 600 mg/day; initial rapid resolution of eosinophilia was observed; however, after 4 months of imatinib therapy the patient experienced blast crisis.

Tan, et al (2004) describe  a  32-year-old  male  with  HES  and  significant  end  organ  damage  who remained refractory to conventional therapy (hydroxyurea). No clonal karyotypic abnormalities were observed. The patient was started on imatinib 100 mg/day. The patient achieved CHR without any side effects reported.

Vandenberghe, et al (2004 )  retrospectively  characterized  17  patients  fulfilling  WHO  criteria  for IHES or CEL, using RT-PCR and FISH. Eight patients had FIP1L1-PDGFR α positive CEL, three had FIP1L1-PDGFR α negative  CEL  and  six  had  IHES.  Four  FIP1L1-PDGFR α positive  patients  were treated at an initial dose of 100 mg/day of imatinib. In all four treated patients, including one female, imatinib induced rapid and complete hematological response with normalization of the peripheral Eo count. Nevertheless, no clear improvement of the eosinophilic endomyocardial disease was observed in the three patients presenting with cardiac involvement, and one of these patients died from cardiac failure a few weeks later. The presence of FIP1L1-PDGFR α mRNA was analyzed in the blood of the three  surviving  patients  under  treatment:  the  fusion  became  undetectable  by  nested  PCR  in  two patients  and  remained  so  during  4  months  of  follow-up.  The  third  sample  from  the  female  patient remained positive. In the IHES group of patients, only one patient was treated with imatinib, which was rapidly abandoned for intolerance without evidence of response.

Wolf, et al (2004) describe a 47-year-old man with a HES, diagnosed 20 years ago. The patient was admitted due to insufficient therapeutic response to hydroxyurea: in general, he felt well, but reported increasing  neurological  problems,  such  as  ataxia,  memory  deficits  and  dysarthria.  No  insertional deletion 4q12 with concomitant fusion of the FIP1L1 to the PDGFR α locus was detected. Magnetic resonance  imaging  (MRI)  indicated  a  granulomatous  vasculitis,  most  likely  due  to  the  hematologic malignancy.  Despite  negativity  for  the  FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion  gene,  therapy  was  started  with 100 mg/day imatinib. This led to a rapid normalization of eosinophilic granulocytes in the peripheral blood as well as in the bone marrow. Partial cytogenic remission was achieved at 6 months; CR at 17 months,  confirmed  at  21  months.  Due  to  the  good  response  at  9  months  the  dose  of  imatinib  was reduced to 100 mg once weekly, which was subsequently increased at 18 months to 100 mg/day. This led to a rapid normalization of eosinophilic granulocytes in the peripheral blood as well as in the bone marrow. In addition, the neurological symptoms substantially improved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Anghel, et al (2005) describe the case of a young male patient with a six year history of HES and severe heart involvement who, after unsuccessful treatment attempts with steroids, hydroxyurea and interferonα , had a prompt, clinical and hematological complete remission following administration of imatinib.  As  his  cardiac  function  also  markedly  improved,  he  was  considered  for  heart  transplant. However, seven years after the onset of the disease and four months after the termination of imatinib treatment  the  patient  died  of  a  cerebral  hemorrhage  that  occurred  during  an  episode  of  acute respiratory sepsis.

Cervetti, et al (2005) reported on one case of HES treated with imatinib. The case concerned a 61year-old  male  presenting  HES  and  hepatomegaly  who  was  treated  with  interferonα for  5  years, obtaining normalization of peripheral blood count with unmodified hepatomegaly. Due to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and massive liver and spleen enlargement with appearance of ascites, the treatment was stopped and imatinib at 100 mg/day was initiated. Three months after beginning the treatment, hematological toxicity resolved and the patient showed significant improvement of hepatomegaly with complete resolution of ascites. The presence of FIP1L1-PDGFR α rearrangement was retrospectively tested on bone marrow samples harvested from the patient at diagnosis and after 12 months of imatinib therapy. The first sample tested positive, whilst the second did not show the FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion gene.

Imashuku, et al (2005) A  26-year-old man with HES was treated with imatinib following a 5 year history  of  prednisolone  therapy.  The  patient  had  hypereosinophilia  (absolute  eosinophil  count &gt;1500/µL) occurring in cyclic oscillations as well as histologically diagnosed eosinophilic vasculitis, bursitis, and periodic soft-tissue swellings. Laboratory data revealed high levels of serum tryptase and increased numbers of mast cells in the bone marrow, but serum interleukin-5 levels were within the normal range. The disease initially responded well to 100 mg/day of imatinib but recurred 8 weeks later. Thereafter, a 200 mg/day dose was temporarily effective. Despite the response to imatinib, the FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion gene was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Additional  molecular  and  cytogenetic  studies  showed  neither  translocations  of  PDGFR  genes  nor mutations in the c-KIT or the PDGFR genes.

La Starza, et al (2005) reported on a multicentric study that included 20 patients fulfilling the WHO criteria for HES and 6 patients without signs or symptoms of end-organ involvement. Ten of the 26 patients  presented  the  FIP1L1-PDGFR α gene.  Seven  of  these  10  patients  received  imatinib  therapy with the peripheral Eo count normalizing within 2-4 weeks. In three patients, interphase FISH and RTPCR demonstrated cytogenetic and molecular remission during therapy. Five of the FIP1L1-PDGFR α negative  patients  also  received  imatinib  therapy.  Two  of  these  patients  achieved  hematologic remission with peripheral Eo count normalization.

Musial, et al (2005) reported  a  41-year-old  man  diagnosed  with  HES  with  cardiac  involvement. Genetic  analysis  revealed  a  FIP1L1-PDGFRA  fusion  gene.  The  patient  was  unresponsive  to interferonα therapy.  He  was  started  on  imatinib  at  100 mg/day  for  the  first  3  months  and  then continued  treatment  at  100 mg  every  second  day.  Full  hematological  and  molecular  remission  was accompanied by spectacular improvement in cardiac function.

Onitilo, et al (2005) reported a 50-year-old male patient with HES with trisomy 8 who experienced a complete  and  durable  hematological  and  cytogenetic  remission  with  low-dose  imatinib  therapy (100 mg/day). He also had a significant  reversal  of  cardiac  dysfunction  with  a  reduction  in  cardiac hypertrophy, resolution of pericardial effusion and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. He remained in remission 3 years after therapy.

Roche-Lestienne, et al (2005) performed  molecular  characterization  of  HES  in  35  patients  with normal  karyotypes  by  conventional  cytogenetic  analysis.  TCR γ gene  rearrangements  suggesting  T clonality  were  seen  in  11  patients  (31%),  and  FIP1L1-PDGFR α by  RT-PCR  in  six  of  35  patients (17%), who showed no evidence of T-cell clonality. An elevated serum tryptase level was observed in FIP1L1-PDGFR α -positive  patients  responding  to  imatinib,  whereas  serum  IL-5  levels  were  not elevated  in  T-cell  associated  hypereosinophilia.  Sequencing  FIP1L1-PDGFR α revealed  scattered breakpoints in FIP1L1-exons (10-13), whereas breakpoints were restricted to exon 12 of PDGFR α . In the 29 patients without FIP1L1-PDGFR α , no activating mutation of PDGFR α /PDGFR β was detected; however; one patient responded to imatinib. FISH analysis of the 4q12 deletion was concordant with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

FIP1L1-PDGFR α RT-PCR data. Further investigation of the nature of FIP1L1-PDGFR α affected cells will  improve the classification  of  HES.  Nine  patients  were  treated  with  imatinib  (100-200 mg/day), seven males, two females, and five of the male HES patients achieved sustained CR.

Chung, et al (2006) reported a case of persistent cough associated with gastro-esophageal reflux and hypereosinophilia.  Treatment  with  proton  pump  inhibitors  and  fundoplication  did  not  control  the cough.  However,  high  dose  prednisolone,  but  not  inhaled  corticosteroids,  did.  The  presence  of  the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in myeloid cells was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis  using  CHIC2  deletion  as  a  surrogate  marker.  The  cough  and  other  disease  features  were subsequently suppressed by imatinib at the dose of 100 mg/day. This 54 year old male scientist is the first  case  of  persistent  cough  caused  by  HES  characterized  by  FIP1L1-PDGFRA  fusion  gene  and aberrant tyrosine kinase activity.

Mueller, et al (2006) The authors summarize recent knowledge of clinical features, pathophysiology and novel treatment aspects of HES by performing a comprehensive search of the available literature and report on 94 patients. The Authors particularly address the issue of organ involvement and specific characteristics of the variable clinical pictures. In addition, two cases are presented, which illustrate typical clinical scenarios and treatment outcome.

Martinelli, et al (2006) treated 59  HES  patients (age  range  18-78)  with  imatinib.  Fifty  patients received  100 mg/day  increasing  by  100 mg/day  at  weekly  intervals  to  reach  the  planned  dose  of 400 mg/day; the imatinib dose was subsequently reduced to 200-300 mg/day in 5 of these patients and maintained at that level due to AEs. Of the remaining nine patients, one patient discontinued before reaching the full dose due to rapid progression and one patient discontinued during dose escalation due to renal failure. One HIV positive patient remained on low dose to prevent possible pharmacological interaction with antiviral therapies. Four patients remained at 100 mg/day per investigator's decision due to concomitant morbidity. The two remaining patients received an unknown dose of imatinib. All patients  were  studied  by  molecular  analysis  for  expression  of  FIP1L1-PDGFR α ,  Tel-PDGFR β , FGFR1-Bcr and Bcr-Abl chimerical transcripts.

Rapid, hematological CR was recorded after one month of therapy in all 23 (39%) FIP1L1-PDGFR α positive  patients.  In  36  patients  negative  for  FIP1L1-PDGFR α rearrangement,  9  (25%)  experienced PR  and  3  CR  (PR+CR  33%).  Furthermore,  a  molecular  complete  remission  (defined  as  the disappearance  of  FIP1L1-PDGFR α at  qualitative  RT-PCR  evaluation)  was  also  recorded  in  20 FIP1L1-PDGFR α positive  patients  after  3  months  of  therapy.  The  median  follow  up  was  4  months (range  2-39).  The  authors  concluded  this  study  supports  the  use  of  imatinib  as  first  line  therapy  in FIP1L1-PDGFR α positive HES patients.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

A  Bayesian  [Meta-analysis Report]  of  efficacy  data  from  published  papers  was  performed  and compared with the [Study B2225] efficacy data to examine the effect of potential publication bias in the published reports.

This  report  cannot  rule  out  the  existence  of  publication  bias,  as  the  observed  response  rate  (i.e. complete plus partial responses) in [Study B2225] of 28.6% does not fall within the pooled posterior response rate confidence interval for literature reported patients with HES treated with imatinib, which is [74.2%,94.3%]. The posterior median response rate in the meta-analysis for the published literature is  of  83.5%.  The  discrepancy  between  the  two  could  be  explained  by  the  small  sample  size  of  the [Study B2225] HES patient population compared to the pooled sample size of the published literature (0.14 ratio between the two). Furthermore, this discrepancy could also be attributed to the fact that six out of 14 patients within the [Study B2225] HES population had a best overall response of Unknown, as they did not have a sufficient number of meaningful tumor assessments in order to be assigned a best  overall  response  different  from  Unknown  according  to  the  SWOG  criteria.  Of  note,  the publication  cut-off  date  for  the  literature  in  the  [Meta-analysis Report]  was  14-Oct-2005  and  only patients  with  HES  were  included,  which  explains  the  difference  in  the  number  of  published  cases included in the [Meta-analysis Report] compared to the present application.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The reported benefit of reported responses in the whole population from [Study B2225] and published literature, can be summarized as follow:

- A complete reported response rate of 107/176 or 61%
- An overall reported response rate of 123/176 or 70% (complete and partial responses)
- A reported response to imatinib that was often durable

If the evaluation is categorized by patients demonstrating known cytogenetic abnormalities associated with imatinib sensitivity, the benefit is higher:

- All 61 patients (100%) with known FIP1L1-PDGFR α fusion kinase achieved a hematological complete response.
- Sixty-two  of  115  patients  (54%)  with  no  or  unknown  cytogenetic  abnormality  achieved  a hematological response, either complete (46 patients) or partial (16 patients).

Many patients reported improvement in HES related organ dysfunction with imatinib therapy.

The  MAH  has  provided  additional  evidence  from  publications  concerning  162  HES/CES  patients. Although these case reports and case series are a source of heterogeneous and incomplete information, they are a very relevant part of the evidence.

In accordance with the description, the population treated with imatinib seems to have an advanced stage  of  HES-CEL,  as  many  of  the  patients  suffered  organ  damage  and  had  received  previous treatments without satisfactory results.

Regarding efficacy, there is a high rate of haematological response (83.5%), mainly complete (66%). The responses were rapid and more convincing in FIP1L1-PDGFRa positive patients (100% complete remissions).  The  duration  of  the  responses  is  heterogeneous  with  median  durations  of  about  7-8 months but wide ranges (3-more than 15 months). Some of the patients have responses lasting more than  1  year.  Of  relevance,  a  consistent  number  of  patients  obtained  cytogenetic  and  molecular response,  mainly  in  FIP1L1-PDGFRa  patients.  There  are  also  some  reports  of  improvements  in symptoms and organ dysfunction. So, in accordance to these findings, imatinib has convincing activity in certain HES-CES patients who carry the FIP1L1-PDGFRa gene.

## Clinical safety

The application for this new indication is based on study B2225, which included 185 patients with various  malignancies  possibly  associated  with  imatinib-sensitive  kinases  (45  of  them  suffered  a haematological  malignancy,  out  of  which  14  patients  were  classified  as  presenting  HES-CEL). Additional  evidence  in  35  published  articles  with  162  additional  patients,  have  been  presented  to support this indication.

Because of the nature of the reports (clinical study involving multiple diseases vs. case reports) and the  well  established  safety  profile  of  imatinib  in  myeloid  haematological  malignancies  and  solid tumours, for Study B2225 the safety of the whole population of 185 patients enrolled is considered, as well as the safety of the 14 patients with HES enrolled in the study.  The case reports are discussed with special attention to any event not consistent with the known imatinib safety profile.

Safety  was  assessed  by  collecting  reports  of  deaths,  SAEs  and  AEs,  laboratory  data  (standard haematology,  biochemistry  and  urinalysis)  and  data  on  vital  signs,  weight,  ECG  and  physical examinations.  Safety  variables  consisted  of  AEs  related  or  not  to  study  drugs  and  of  laboratory parameters, classified according to NCI common toxicity criteria.

## Patient exposure

A total  of  185  patients  suffering  from  different  diseases  associated  with  ABL,  Kit  or  PDGFR PTK were  treated  with  imatinib  in  study  B2225  at  doses  between  200  and  1000  mg  daily.  Twenty-five patients were treated for more than 1 year and seven patients for more than 2 years. Patient exposure is summarised in the following table.

Demographic characteristics regarding exposure:

In the overall study population, according to gender there were 56.8% male and 43.2% female; 94.6 %, of patient were Caucasian,  and they were mainly aged &lt;65 years. (82.2 %), and only 17.8 % were over  65  years  (range:  15-86).  Most  patients  with  haematological  malignancies  had  been  diagnosed within the preceding 12 months whereas most of the patients with solid tumours had been diagnosed more than 1 year before being recruited into the study.

In the HES patients, 11 out of 14 were males, 12 of them were Caucasian and there were no patients aged 65 years old or more, while all of them were between 16 and 64 years. There is no individualized information about history of malignancy in the HES group.

The applicant highlights that most of the information related to disease characteristics is missing for the haematology group, and therefore no conclusions can be reached.

## Adverse events

Pooling of data was not performed with results of other studies. All patients exposed to more than 1 dose of study treatment were pooled to examine the incidence rate of deaths and SAEs, the affected body systems, type of underlying event and suspected drug relatedness.

All  patients,  both  in  the  haematology  and  in  the  solid  tumour  group,  experienced  at  least  one  AE. Overall, the most frequently reported AEs in both tumor groups affected the gastrointestinal system, general  and  administration  site  disorders  or  skin,  musculoskeletal,  respiratory  or  nervous  system disorders. Patients with haematological malignancies had a higher frequency of skin disorders (68.9% vs. 57.1%), blood disorders (48.9% vs. 24.3%) and cardiac disorders (11.1% vs. 6.4%) than patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with solid tumours and a lower frequency of general disorders (62.2% vs. 80.7%), of metabolic and nutrition disorders (24.4% vs. 42.1%) and of eye disorders (13.3% vs. 26.4%).

All  HES  patients  experienced  at  least  one  AE,  the  AE  profile  was  consistent  with  the  one  of  the overall  group,  the  most  commonly  affected  system  organ  classes  being  the  gastrointestinal  system, cutaneous disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders.

The most frequently occurring adverse events in patients with HES were nausea in 9 cases, followed by diarrhea and muscle cramps in 7 cases each and then by periorbital edema and vomiting (4 cases each). All other AEs occurred in three patients or less.

Serious adverse events and deaths

There  were  23  deaths  (12.4%)  reported  in  the  overall  population  enrolled  in  study  B2225  during treatment  or  up  to  28  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  None  of  these  deaths  were considered to be related to study drug. No patient with HES died on study.

A total of 79 patients (42.7%) experienced at least one SAE, the most frequent being gastrointestinal (27 patients - 14.6%) or respiratory (26 patients - 14.1%). Although many of the AEs were mild to moderate  in  severity,  a  total  of  82  patients  (44.3%),  61  in  the  solid  tumor  group  and  21  in  the hematology group, experienced CTC grade 3 AEs by any cause and a total of 33 patients (17.8%), 27 with solid tumours and 6 with haematological malignancies, experienced CTC grade 4 AEs by any cause. The majority of these AEs were related to the underlying conditions; drug-related CTC grade 3 AEs  were  reported  in  a  total  of  54  patients  (29.2%),  40  patients  with  solid  tumours  and  14  with haematological malignancies, and drug-related CTC grade 4 AEs were reported in 7 patients (3.8%), 5 with solid tumours and 2 with haematological malignancies.

Two HES patients experienced three drug-related SAEs: patient [701/111] presented a CTC grade 3 acute renal insufficiency from Day 14 to Day 22 and a CTC grade 3 edema from Day 28 to Day 33, both  of  which  resulted  in  hospitalization  as  seen  in  [Study B2225 -PTL 10.2-1].  Patient  [901/152] experienced CTC grade 3 decreased sperm count on Day 362 which did not lead to further action.

Three additional HES patients experienced non-related, non-fatal SAEs: patient [201/093] had CTC grade 3 ascites which resolved in two days with non-drug therapy; patient [201/147] had a CTC grade 3 chest infection from Day 7 to Day 20 which led to hospitalization and administration of concomitant medication; he was again hospitalized on Day 24 due to the following SAEs: CTC grade 2 sweating which  resolved  after  one  day,  CTC  grade  2  endomyocardial  fibrosis,  ischemic  lesions  in  cerebral hemispheres, diarrhea and dizziness and CTC grade 1 nausea, which led to permanent discontinuation of the study treatment. Patient [701/171] had a CTC grade 2 cerebral ischemia from Day 89 to Day 93 which led to hospitalization and the use of concomitant medication.

## Analysis by organ system or syndrome

## Cardiovascular system

In  the  overall  population  of  185,  four  patients  experienced  drug-related  vascular  events  (2.2%),  all CTC grade 1 in severity. Cardiac disorders were considered SAEs in four cases (2.2%).

Two HES patients presented two cardiovascular SAEs which were not considered study drug-related: patient  [201/147]  presented  a  CTC  grade  2  restrictive  cardiomyopathy  which  led  to  study  drug discontinuation, and patient [701/171] presented transient CTC grade 3 peripheral ischemia which led to hospitalization and administration of concomitant medication.

## Renal and urogenital system

A total of three patients (1.6%) experienced AES that were considered drug-related, and in two cases (1.0%) were of CTC grade 3 or 4 severity. In one case treatment was withdrawn because of drugrelated CTC grade 3 creatinine increase.

HES patient [701/111] presented an SAE of CTC grade 3 acute renal failure which was suspected of being  study  drug-related  and  led  to  hospitalization,  study  drug  interruption  and  administration  of concomitant medication. This SAE resolved after 9 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic system

Three patients (1.6%) were withdrawn from treatment because of elevated liver enzymes, considered drug-related in two cases. No SAE affecting the hepatobiliary system was reported. No patient with HES presented hepatobiliary system disorders.

## Gastrointestinal system

A  total  136  patients  (73.5%)  experienced  gastrointestinal  system  disorders  of  any  cause,  the  most frequently observed being nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. Of those, 13 patients (7.0%) experienced grade 3 AEs and one patient grade 4 severity. A total of 27 patients experienced SAEs involving this system organ class.

Twelve  patients  with  HES  presented  gastrointestinal  system  disorders,  of  which  three  were  SAEs: patient 201/093 presented a CTC grade 3 ascites, while patient 201/147 presented CTC grade 1 nausea and CTC grade 2 diarrhea, none of which were considered study drug-related.

## Nervous system

## A total of 37 patients (20.0%) experienced AEs that were considered drug-related; all grade 1 or 2 in severity.

Six  HES  patients  presented  nervous  system  disorders,  two  of  which  were  non  drug-related  SAEs: patient [201/147] presented a CTC grade 2 cerebral ischemia that led to study drug discontinuation; it was accompanied by CTC grade 2 dizziness which resolved after one day.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

Most of the haematological abnormalities were CTC grade 3, with only eight instances of CTC grade 4  events  in  the  overall  population:  five  cases  of  neutropenia,  two  of  leukopenia  and  one  of thrombocytopenia.  As  expected,  most  of  these  CTC  grade  4  events  occurred  in  patients  with haematological  malignancies  (two  instances  of  neutropenia  and  one  each  of  thrombocytopenia  and leukopenia), with a frequency at least double of that seen in solid tumor patients, although the absolute frequency never exceeded 4.4% in the overall population.

In  HES  patients,  the  worst  hematological  abnormalities  were  CTC  grade  3  in  severity.  Four  HES patients presented one blood and lymphatic system disorder AE each (two cases of anemia and one case each of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), none of which were SAEs and none of which led to study drug discontinuation.

## Clinical chemistry

Most of the chemistry abnormalities were CTC grade 3 with four instances of CTC grade 4 events in the overall population: two cases for creatinine (1%), one for alkaline phosphatase (0.5%) and one for AST (0.5%). There was no difference between the two main populations of patients in frequency of events regardless of CTC grade, with the exception of creatinine increase, which was more severe in patients  with  solid  tumours  (two  CTC  grade  4  instances)  than  in  patients  with  haematological malignancies (two CTC grade 3 instances).

In HES patients, there was one instance of CTC grade 3 albumin decrease and one instance of CTC grade 3 creatinine increase. No HES patient was withdrawn from the study due to abnormal laboratory values.

## Safety in special populations

Women  of  child-bearing  potential  were  advised  to  avoid  becoming  pregnant  and  to  use  effective contraception during treatment (study B2225). No cases of pregnancies were reported, nor were there cases of partners of male patients becoming pregnant.

## Postmarketing safety and other sources of data

Since the international lauch date (May 2001), the Post marketing experience with imatinib has been reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  in  the  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  (PSUR)  and  the  US  Periodic Reports (USPR).

Based upon cumulative reviews in the most recent PSUR version 6 (period 11 May 2004 to 10 May 2005),  it  was  recommended  to  continue  to  monitor  the  following  events:  myocardial  infarction, cardiomegaly/  cardiomyopathy,  angina  pectoris,  thrombosis/embolism,  pulmonary  hypertension, hepatic  necrosis/cirrhosis,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  glucose  metabolism  disorders, rhabdomyolysis, hemolytic anemia, suicide attempt, ideation and suicide.

There  are  no  new  events  reported  from  Post  marketing  experience  which  have  not  already  been observed during clinical trials. No important targeted safety studies were identified. The safety profile of imatinib remains consistent with the information provided in the CDS of the product.

In the ongoing trials recruiting patients with HES, six SAEs have been reported to Novartis to date. Most were related to preexisting conditions or concomitant medications, and none was suspected of being related to the study drug.

Case reports

Out of 162 cases of HES/CEL  in  the literature, few AEs  were  reported by the authors. Schaller, et al (2001) reported that the patient they treated reported transient mild nausea on 100 mg daily imatinib, relieved with ondansetron. The patient then developed a constant mild headache, which disappeared with a dose reduction to 75 mg daily.

Cortes, et al (2003) reported  one  patient  with  a  rash  consistent  with  exacerbation  of  preexisting psoriasis and who was taken off therapy after 10 days. Abdominal cramps and nausea developed in one  patient,  necessitating  a  dose  reduction  from  100 mg  o.d.  to  100 mg  every  other  day;  all  other adverse events were grade 1 and consistent with previously reported toxicity with imatinib, including fluid retention (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 1), muscle cramps (n = 1), and nausea (n = 1).

Pardanani, et al (2003) reported  a  patient  who  developed  mild  fatigue  when  imatinib  dose  was increased from 100 mg o.d. to 400 mg o.d. and another patient who experienced grade 3 fatigue on 100 mg o.d. imatinib and elected to stop imatinib after 4 weeks of treatment.

Another  of  their  patients  developed  progressive  dyspnea  and  orthopnea  from  acute  left  ventricular dysfunction with cardiogenic shock, which required intravenous pressor support following 8 days of imatinib  therapy.  An  echocardiogram  revealed  new-onset  severe  generalized  left  ventricular  (LV) hypokinesis  (LV  ejection  fraction  decreased  from  71%  to  10%)  and  the  endomyocardial  biopsy confirmed  eosinophilic  infiltration  of  the  myocardium.  Placement  of  an  intraaortic  balloon  pump became necessary for hemodynamic support. The patient was started on high dose steroids with rapid improvement of hemodynamic parameters and was weaned of the pressors after 72 hours. After LV function recovery (LV ejection fraction 55-60% at 4 weeks after imatinib discontinuation), the patient was rechallenged with imatinib at 100 mg/day. The patient tolerated imatinib retreatment well without recurrence of cardiac toxicity.

Klion, et al (2004) reported one case of transient grade 3 neutropenia leading to interruption of the study drug followed by a dose reduction from 400 mg to 300 mg o.d., one case of grade 1 pedal and facial edema requiring no additional therapy, and one case of transient grade 2 myalgia resolved with ibuprofen.

Musto, et al (2004) reported  the  appearance  of  fatigue,  muscle  cramps,  and  diarrhea  in  a  patient treated with 400 mg/day imatinib; a dose reduction to 200 mg/day led to the return of symptoms as well as that of the eosinophils count to baseline levels. The patient refused to be further treated. No further safety observations were reported for the other published case reports.

Martinelli, et al (2006) reported  common  adverse  events  including  neutropenia,  gastrointestinal disorder, thrombocytopenia, muscle cramps, edema and anemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grade 3 or 4 events were infrequent. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was noted in two (3.4%) patients, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in one patient only (1.7%). Drug-related adverse events led to discontinuation of therapy in two patients.

Out of 162 cases of HES/CEL reported in the literature, five deaths were reported on treatment with imatinib. Taking into consideration the level of detail provided, none appears attributable to imatinib.

Ault, et al (2002) reported that their patient developed a fulminant pneumococcal sepsis and expired three months after initiation of treatment with imatinib at 100 mg/day.

Cools, et al (2003) reported  that  one  patient  died  after  3  months  of  imatinib  treatment  while  in complete remission, without further detail.

Klion, et al (2004) reported  that  a  patient  with  endomyocardial  fibrosis  in  whom  symptoms  and signs of congestive heart failure remained unaffected by imatinib therapy died 1 month after beginning imatinib  at  400 mg/day  from  disseminated  cytomegalovirus  infection  thought  to  be  a  result  of prolonged high-dose steroid use. At autopsy, extensive endomyocardial  fibrosis was  evident throughout the ventricular walls and interventricular septum.

Vandenberghe, et al (2004) reported that one patient presenting with cardiac failure and thrombotic events  early  in  his  disease  course  died  from  cardiac  failure  a  few  weeks  after  starting  imatinib  at 100 mg/day.

Anghel et al (2005) reported that four months after the withdrawal of imatinib, while in good clinical and hematological remission, the patient died of a brain hemorrhage that occurred during an episode of acute respiratory sepsis.

## Discussion on safety

In the original submission, it was reported that  caution must be exercised because of the occurrence of severe  thrombopenias  and/or  neutropenias  and  the  rare  occurrence  of  a  fluid  retention  syndrome. Transaminitis is also a known risk with imatinib. The data from this application confirm these risks, although they are manageable by either reducing the dose or temporarily suspending treatment with imatinib. No new risk questions were identified. Isolated cases of cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction  have  been  associated  with  the  initiation  of  imatinib  therapy  in  patients  with  HES  and cardiac  involvement  (Pardanani, et al 2003 ,  Pitini, et al 2003) .  The  condition  was  reported  to  be reversible with the administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily holding of imatinib. Screening with echocardiograms and serum troponin levels should be considered in patients with HES. If either is abnormal, then the prophylactic use of systemic steroids (1-2 mg/kg) for  1  to  2  weeks  concomitant  with  imatinib  should  be  considered.  Therefore,  the  CDS  Section  4.4 'Special warning and special precautions for use' has been updated accordingly.

## Benefit-Risk assessment

The initially claimed indication was HES-CEL, which  include a very heterogeneous range of diseases, with  a  wide  spectrum  of  biological  and  clinical  situations,  including,  in  one  extreme,  patients  with moderate eosinophilia without organ dysfunction who do not need treatment and, in the other extreme, patients  with  cytogenetic  aberrations  and  aggressive  forms  of  the  disease  with  massive  organ infiltration and a dismal prognosis. For some of these subgroups, there are limited treatment options and  systemic  therapies,  mainly  corticosteroids,  are  not  satisfactory,  therefore,  new  treatments  are required.

The  molecular  mechanism  underlying  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRa  fusion  gene  giving  rise  to  a  new constitutively  active  fusion  tyrosine  kinase  that  can  be  targeted  by  imatinib  makes  plausible  the biological and molecular basis for this treatment. However, this is not the case when such a molecular mechanism is not found or it is already unknown.

The dossier presented to support the indication of Glivec for the treatment of adult patients with HESCEL is limited to a phase II, uncontrolled, open label study (which includes 14 patients with HESCEL) and 35 publications, including a total of 176 patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  main  clinical  study  (B2225)  was  designed  as  a  proof  of  concept  trial,  so,  it  is  not  specifically designed for the investigation of imatinib in HES-CEL. It has several major problems of design and efficacy results are unclear. None of the 14 patients with HES-CEL had a complete response, and only 4  of  them  showed  a  partial  response.  Due  to  the  missing  information,  neither  the  adequacy  of treatment nor the low response rate can be assessed adequately.

In contrast to the clinical study B2225, the efficacy results found in case-reports and case series are positive, although this evidence can be influenced by publication bias. In particular, all patients with the FIP1L1-PDGFRa mutation showed complete haematological response. Not unexpectedly, taking into  account  the  biological  background,  the  response  was  rapid  and  durable  with  some  reports  of cytogenetic and molecular responses that translate in improvement in organ damage. This is consistent with the previous experience with imatinib in other indications with similar biological rationale.

Concerning imatinib safety profile in this disease, it did not differ substantially from that previously described and it can generally be considered well tolerated. There was  one case  of cardiac adverse event  (acute  left  ventricular  dysfunction)  related  with  imatinib,  which  could  suggest  additional monitoring in this patient population. Until more information is available, a warning about the use of imatinib in HES/CEL has been included in the SPC.

In accordance with these results, the CHMP requested additional information to clarify some clinical aspects and SPC information. The MAH response document to the day 120 CHMP list of questions mainly consists on further justification that confirm the initial findings.

For  efficacy,  more  detailed  information  about  patient  characteristics,  study  design  and  results  was requested. A new description of the results for FIP1L1-PDGFRa population has also been provided.

A controversial point was the benefit/risk of imatinib therapy in patients without the FIP1L1-PDGFRa mutation. Although some patients have demonstrated a response, in general, these responses have been slower  and  have  required  higher  imatinib  doses  than  those  in  patients  with  FIP1L1-PDGFRa associated disease. The data submitted in this application are clearly insufficient and do not allow an adequate assessment of the effects of imatinib when the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRa mutation has not been shown.

Another  aspect  that  was  based  on  limited  investigations  is  the  optimum  dose  of  imatinib  for  this indication, as responses were obtained for various doses, but this has not been discussed relating the intensity and durability of response and the safety profile obtained with them. As the studies submitted used  imatinib  100  mg  or  400  mg  obtaining  positive  results,  the  proposal  to  use  imatinib  100  mg initially in the FIP1L1-PDGFRa population is acceptable.

No long term data on the maintenance of the response and survival have been provided either. As the experience with imatinib is limited, further investigations of the use of imatinib in HES/CEL are recommended to better define its role. The company mentions more studies in this indication. For them, additional results, including molecular response, should be provided, if relevant.

The safety  profile  of  imatinib  in  HES-CEL  patients  seems  not  different  from  the  one  in  the  whole population of Study B2225, which included patients with various diagnoses.

One  HES  patient  suffered  cardiogenic  shock/left  ventricular,  which  has  been  associated  with  the initiation of imatinib therapy. As HES may be associated with cardiac dysfunction, this adverse event could  occur  more  frequently.  The  Applicant  has  reflected  this  in  the  proposed  SPC,  which  it  is reasonable to grant safety.

Case reports are focused on efficacy data and information related to safety is limited. There are few adverse  events  reported  in  HES-CEL  patients  obtained  from  publications  and  they  seem  consistent with previous experience. As the HES-CEL population can have previous cardiac problem, it is very reasonable  to  monitor  cardiac  safety  at  the  initiation  and  during  imatinib  treatment.  A  relevant warning has been introduced in the SPC .

In conclusion, imatinib treatment was well tolerated by patients with HES-CEL. Its safety profile does not  seem  different  substantially  from  the  known  safety  profile  of  imatinib  observed  in  other  larger haematological malignancies populations, such as CML.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To summarize, efficacy and safety clinical results obtained with imatinib in the advanced HES/CEL FIP1L1-PDGFR α mutation  population,  although  limited,  can  be  considered  positive.  Taking  into account  the  interest  of  having  adequate  treatments  in  this  patient  group  (the  current  treatment  with steroids  provides  symptomatic  improvement  associated  with  a  poor  safety  profile  in  the  long  term treatment) and also the mechanism of action, there is a solid rationale to support the interest of this use of imatinib as a therapy that can be more effective to control this disease. The marketing authorization holder  in  the  response  document  provides  additional  information,  which  is  acceptable  for  the Rapporteurs. The evidence presented can be considered sufficient to grant a new labelling.

The  changes  proposed  for  the  SPC  (pending  minor  amendments)  reflect  adequately  the  comments made by the CHMP.

In  the  light  of  the  above  discussion,  we  consider  that  an  indication  'Imatinib  is  indicated  in  the treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  HES-CEL  with  FIP1L1-PDGFR α rearrangement'  is acceptable.

## CONCLUSION

- -On 18 October 2006 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Follow-up measures undertaken by the Marketing Authorisation Holder

As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measures as listed below and to submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these commitments (see Letter of Undertaking attached to this report):
