## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 August 2023 an application for a group of variations.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variations requested   | Variations requested                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Type    | Annexes affected   |

Grouped application comprising two type II variations as follows:

C.I.4 - Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information based on interim (6 months post-dose 3 in 12-15 years old) and final results from study C4591001, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a phase 1/2/3, placebo-controlled, randomised, observer-blind, dosefinding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COMIRNATY against COVID-19 in healthy individuals.

C.I.11.b - Submission of an updated RMP version 10.1 in order to revise RMP milestones of final study reports of other on-going procedures, including other administrative and editorial changes.

The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Within this type II variation, the MAH has submitted the final data from the clinical study C4591001, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. Safety interim data to support a proposed update in section 4.8 in the SmPC for adolescents aged 12-15 years who had received one booster dose of BNT162b2 30µg has also been provided.

## Efficacy

Study C4591001 was a phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 years of age. The study population included more than 40,000 individuals. Participants received 2 doses of Original Comirnaty 30 µg and were followed up for up to 2 years post-dose 2. Originally, the study had an active arm and a placebo arm, but after the approval of the vaccine, the participants in the placebo arm were offered vaccination, resulting in a cross-over arm. The study continued with options to receive booster doses with the Original vaccine (3 rd  and 4 th  dose). The participants gave 3-5 blood samples to monitor for seroconversion after possible infection (N-antigen antibody detection).

In the current final report, the MAH presented data from asymptomatic infection surveillance (in population without and with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 prior infection), the incidence of SARS-CoV-2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during entire study period and also an immunogenicity analysis of a third dose of BNT162b2 at a lower dose of 5 or 10 µg administered to smaller population (N= 80) of Phase 2/3 participants.

The asymptomatic infection surveillance was performed using two distinct biomarkers: nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) in a subpopulation (N=4,000) and N-protein detections in the entire population (N=40,000). The NAAT surveillance included several uncertainties as the time window to detect viral RNA is limited, especially if the infection is asymptomatic. Also, the surveillance for asymptomatic infections did not start immediately after vaccination but started 2.9 months post-dose 2 in the United States (USA) and 5.3 months post-dose 2 in Argentina. There were only 44 asymptomatic cases accrued from 3,921 previously uninfected individuals, showing that asymptomatic cases were rather rare or have been missed. The vaccine efficacy (VE) result based on a such testing gave very wide confidence interval (CI), showing the uncertainty, VE= 37.2% (95% CI -20.0%; 66.7%). Among the small population of previously infected individuals, a high rate of asymptomatic cases were detected (45 out of 210). Despite the low numbers, the data showed better protection against asymptomatic infections for participants who have been infected before vaccination compared to the earlier infected but unvaccinated participants VE = 70.8% (95% CI: 39.7%; 87.1%).

N-protein specific antibodies were stable, long-lasting markers for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the virus strain. The entire study population was sampled for blood after at least 1 and 6 months post-dose 2 and tested for the seroconversion to N-protein. This analysis showed that Comirnaty Original 30 µg provided protection against asymptomatic infections after 2 doses during the study period: VE = 52.9% (95% CI: 47.2%; 57.9%). As this biomarker is trustable and the study population was very large, it can be concluded that 2 doses of Original Comirnaty provided protection against asymptomatic infections.

The MAH presented also the final data of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 during entire study period. This result illustrated the VE over the 2 years of pandemic, where different new SARS-CoV-2 strains evolved in a short time window. The complete incidence rate (IR)/1000 person-years (PY) was 104.6 for active arm, 125.7 for placebo arm and 169.1 for placebo cross-over arm. The Original Comirnaty was very effective in the beginning of the pandemic. After the authorisation, the placebo arm was offered vaccination and became a cross-over arm. The active arm was offered more doses as the study continued with booster doses. The cross-over arm also received boosters, but with at a later time point and therefore had received fewer doses than the original active arm every time a new strain appeared. Thus, the results are not easily interpretable but are in agreement with waning protection to new variants.

The MAH also submitted immunogenicity results for a lower booster dose (Dose 3) of Original Comirnaty (5 or 10 µg).  Lower booster doses of BNT162b2 substantially increased SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody response 1 month after Dose 3. Although there was no contemporaneous 30-µg comparator, the data presented showed that a higher booster dose of Original Comirnaty elicits a higher NA titre (geometric mean fold ratio - GMFR 30-µg = 17; 10-µg= 12; 5-µg= 11 for &gt; 55 yoa). Therefore the usage of 30-µg for booster was considered adequate.

In conclusion, the current results show that 2 doses of Original Comirnaty provided protection against asymptomatic infections, and that also lower doses of Original Comirnaty have boosting effect for adults, but the chosen 30-µg is more immunogenic.

No changes to the section 5.1 in the SmPC were suggested and this was agreed by CHMP.

## Safety

## Phase 1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Phase 1 study, primary series of BNT162b1 (10, 20, 30, 100 µg) and BNT162b2 (10, 20, 30 µg) was administered to subgroups including 24 adult participants in each group (total n=195). Most of these participants then received one booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), and an additional booster dose was administered to about half of the study population. After both booster doses, most of the reported adverse events (AEs) were related to reactogenicity and in line with what has previously been observed for the primary series.

## Phase 2/3

Phase 2/3 study C4591001 included a total of 46,406 participants aged ≥12 years, of which 99.8% received the two doses included in the primary series of BNT162b2 30µg. The age ranged from 13-92 years, with a median age of 51 years. A total number of 23,406 participants in the Phase 2/3 study received a first booster dose 6-15 months after Dose 2. The median follow-up time after booster dose was 12,3 months.

From the first booster dose up to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, the frequency of any AEs was 17% (n=3,818) among the participants ≥16 years of age, many of them were considered related to study vaccine (15% [n=3,377]) and most of them were reactogenicity events.

One severe event of angioedema which was considered related to the booster dose was reported. The event occurred one day after the booster dose and resolved after two days. Angioedema is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC at the frequency uncommon.

One adolescent participant reported one serious adverse event (SAE) of myocarditis 4 days after he received the booster dose. The event resolved within 101 days. Myocarditis is already listed in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.

## Booster dose BA.1

BNT162b2-naïve adult participants (n=330) received a dose of the variant vaccine BNT162b2SA (South Africa B.1.351). Among the BNT162b2-naïve participants that received a dose of BNT162b2SA, the reported AES was mostly related to reactogenicity.

## Low dose booster dose BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg

According to protocol amendment 14 and 15, adult participants that had already received the primary series of BNT162b2 30 µg were randomised to receive one low dose booster of BNT162b2 at 5 µg (n=79) or 10 µg (76). None of the participants that received BNT162b2 5 µg reported fever. There was a tendency to lower reactogenicity with lower dose and lower reactogenicity in participants aged &gt;55 years compared to participants aged 18-54 years.

## Additional booster dose, protocol amendment 19

Among the participants (N=467) that received a second booster dose of either BNT162b2 at 5 µg (n=33), 10 µg (n=38), 30 µg (n=182) or BNT162b2SA 30 µg (n=211), a higher frequency of any AEs was noted among the participants that received 30 µg (7-9%) compared with those who received low dose i.e., 5 or 10 µg (0-3%). The most reported events were typical for reactogenicity.

## Participants 12-15 years of age

In the Phase 2/3 study that included 825 participants aged 12-15 years, the median age was 14 years. The median follow-up time after first booster dose was 9.5 months and from Dose 2, 18.1 months. The median time from Dose 2 to booster dose was 11.2 months (range 6.3-20.1 months).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After the booster dose up to one month after the vaccination, 18% of the participants reported any AEs. Most of these AEs were reactogenicity events (general disorders and administration site conditions and headache) and were considered related to vaccination. Two events of lymphadenopathy were reported, lymphadenopathy is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC. Two events of immediate AEs were reported: fatigue and injection site pain. Three events of severe pyrexia were reported. From Dose 3 and up to the cut-off date (3 Nov 2022), SAEs were reported by 6 participants (depression/worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/suicidal attempt, pectus excavatum, elbow fracture and skull fracture), none of the events were considered related to vaccination. No participants were withdrawn due to AEs.

The results presented for participants aged 12-15 years supported the proposed update of section 4.8 of the SmPC.

No new safety concerns were detected among the participants that received one or two booster doses of BNT162b2 30µg.

The benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY, remains positive.

## 5. Introduction

This report includes final data from the clinical study C4591001, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. Safety interim data to support a proposed update in section 4.8 in the SmPC for adolescents aged 12-15 years has also been provided. No changes to the section 5.1 in the SmPC is suggested.

Study C4591001 is a Phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 years of age. The study consisted of 2 parts: Phase 1 to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s) in individuals 18 through 55 and 65 through 85 years of age; and Phase 2/3 as an expanded cohort and efficacy part in individuals ≥12 years of age. These parts and the progression between them, are illustrated in Figure 1 below.

## Unblinding Considerations

The study was unblinded in stages once all ongoing participants either had been individually unblinded or had concluded their 6-month post-Dose 2 study visit, in the following sequence:

- Phase 1 (after Visit 8 [6-month post-Dose 2 visit]).
- Phase 2/3, ≥16 years of age (after Visit 4 [6-month post-Dose 2 visit]).
- Phase 3, 12 through 15 years of age (after Visit 4 [6-month post-Dose 2 visit]).
- Original Phase 3 participants rerandomised to assess boostability and protection against emerging VOCs (after Visit 306).

## Efficacy Against Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection

VE against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in 2 ways: through impact on Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and impact on seroconversion of Nbinding antibody in originally enrolled Phase 2/3 participants not suffering from COVID-19. Data from participants who receive more than 2 doses of BNT162b2 were not included after they receive a third dose.

The incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants per 1000 person-years based on N-binding antibody seroconversion and central laboratory-confirmed NAAT was assessed to evaluate the asymptomatic efficacy of BNT162b2. In addition, the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 per 1000 person-years of follow-up through the entire study follow-up period was assessed for participants who received BNT162b2 at initial randomisation or subsequently. The assessments included a nasal (midturbinate) swab, which was tested at a central laboratory using an RT-PCR test, or other equivalent nucleic acid amplification- based test (i.e., NAAT), to detect SARS-CoV-2. In addition, clinical information and results from local standard-of-care tests were assessed. The central laboratory NAAT result was used for the case definition, unless no result was available from the central laboratory, in which case a local NAAT result could be used in the COVID-19 case definition.

## Asymptomatic Efficacy and Incidence of Confirmed COVID-19

## NAAT-Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection

For participants who consented to participate in an intensive period of surveillance, nasal swabs were obtained to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection by NAAT.

An asymptomatic case of NAAT-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive NAAT result on a nasal swab collected during the surveillance period from participants without COVID-19 symptoms at the time the nasal swab was taken, or within 14 days after it. The onset date of the asymptomatic case is the collection date of the first nasal swab that tested positive.

## Seroconversion of N-Binding Antibody

Blood samples for assessment of N-binding antibodies were drawn at multiple scheduled visits. An asymptomatic case of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on seroconversion of N-binding antibody was defined as positive N-binding antibody at a post-Dose 2 visit in participants without serological evidence of infection (determined by negative N-binding antibody) at Visit 1 or virological evidence of infection (determined by negative NAAT result at Visit 1 and Visit 2, and at the time of a potential COVID-19 illness). The requirement for a negative NAAT result at Visit 2 was to focus on assessment of protection against asymptomatic infection after 2 doses of vaccine, to the extent possible in an analysis based on seroconversion of N-binding antibody, recognizing that it was not possible to identify and exclude all asymptomatic infections that occur after Dose 1 and prior to Dose 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A secondary definition will be applied without the requirement for a negative NAAT result at Visit 2 to allow assessment of protection after 1 dose of vaccine. A positive N-binding antibody at a postvaccination visit in participants with negative N-binding antibody at Visit 1 and negative NAAT results at Visit 1 and at the time of a potential COVID-19 illness is considered an asymptomatic case.

## Efficacy Populations

In total, 4361 participants participated in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance period with the proportions of participants included in the efficacy populations similar in both vaccine groups. For participants who were excluded from the evaluable efficacy population, the most common reason was because participants did not receive all vaccinations as randomised or did not receive Dose 2 within the predefined window (19 to 42 days after Dose 1). Among the 4258 participants included in the evaluable efficacy population, 3921 participants (89.9%) had no evidence of infection prior to the start of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance period.

## Vaccine Efficacy in Participants Without Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection

For the secondary efficacy endpoint, VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in participants without evidence of infection up to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period (January 2021). Note that the median time between Dose 2 and the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period was 2.9 months for participants in the United States and 5.3 months for participants in Argentina. Cases were counted from the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period.

Among participants included in the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population, 3921 participants (2092 in BNT162b2 group and 1829 in placebo group) did not have evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. There were 24 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group compared to 20 infections reported in the placebo group. The estimated VE was 37.2% (2-sided 95% CI: -20.0%, 66.7%). This descriptive analysis was limited by the accrual of only 44 cases total, resulting in a wide 2-sided 95% CI and limiting the precision of this estimate.

VE against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 40.4% (2-sided 95% CI: -10.8%, 67.8%) for Dose 2 all-available efficacy population.

Assessor´s comment: in comparison to the entire study population, the NAAT tested population was about 10 times smaller. The time window to detect viral DNA is limited, especially if the infection is asymptomatic. Also, the surveillance for asymptomatic infections did not start immediately after the vaccination. The median time between Dose 2 and the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period was 2.9 months for participants in the United States and 5.3 months for participants in Argentina. Cases were counted from the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. Therefore the current testing involves uncertainty. The person might be just a carrier or the infection might be cleared by immune system before any symptoms appeared. There were only 44 asymptomatic cases accrued from 3921 individuals, showing that asymptomatic cases are rather rare or have been missed. The VE result based on such testing gave very wide CI, showing the uncertainty. Therefore we cannot

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

conclude that vaccination protected from carrying the infection without symptoms from this NAAT based analysis.

Vaccine Efficacy in Participants With Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection

For the exploratory efficacy endpoint, VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in participants with evidence of infection up to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. Cases were counted from the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period.,

Among participants included in the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population, 213 participants (80 in BNT162b2 group and 133 in placebo group) had evidence of infection with SARSCoV-2 prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. There were 10 asymptomatic SARSCoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group compared to 35 infections reported in the placebo group. The estimated VE was 70.8% (2-sided 95% CI: 39.7%, 87.1%) for BNT162b2. This descriptive analysis was limited by the accrual of only 45 infections total, resulting in a wide 2-sided 95% CI and limiting the precision of this estimate.

VE of BNT162b2 for the same efficacy endpoint based on the Dose 2 all-available efficacy population was 65.6% (2-sided 95% CI: 32.3%, 83.7%).

Table 5: Vaccine Efficacy - Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Based on Central Laboratory-Confirmed NAAT Result - Subjects With Evidence of Infection Prior to the Start of the Asymptomatic Surveillance Period - Evaluable Efficacy (Asymptomatic Surveillance) Population

<!-- image -->

Assessor´s comment: A rather high proportion of asymptomatic cases were detected in this small population (45/210). This implicates that Sars-Cov-19 experienced subjects are less likely to develop symptoms during a subsequent infection compared to the first infection. Anyhow, despite of the low numbers, the data shows better protection against asymptomatic infections for subjects who have been infected before vaccination compared to the previously infected but not vaccinated subjects. This phenomenon is described earlier in observational studies, where previous infection in combination with vaccination gave a broader protection against new strains than only infection or only vaccination.

## Vaccine Efficacy Against Non-S-Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2

## Asymptomatic Infection Based on N-Binding Antibody Seroconversion

## Efficacy Population

The proportions of participants included in the efficacy populations were similar in both vaccine groups. For participants who were excluded from the evaluable efficacy population, the most common reason was because participants did not receive all vaccinations as randomised or did not receive Dose 2 within the predefined window (19 to 42 days after Dose 1), followed by the reason of not having Nbinding test result at any post-Dose 2 visit. Among the 44,101 participants included in the evaluable efficacy population, 41,564 participants (90%) had no evidence of infection prior to the first post-Dose 2 N-binding test.

## VE against non-S-seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 infection Result

For the secondary efficacy endpoint, VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) against non-Sseroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in participants without evidence of infection or confirmed COVID-19.  Note that the surveillance time in the placebo group was shorter than in the BNT162b2 group and accounted for in the VE calculations. This difference is due to the placebo crossover resulting in a shorter duration of follow up for participants who originally received placebo.

Among participants included in the evaluable efficacy (seroconversion) population, 41564 participants (20872 in BNT162b2 group and 20692 in placebo group) did not have evidence of infection with SARSCoV-2 prior to the first post-dose 2 N-binding test. There were 612 cases of seroconversion of Nbinding antibody, indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group compared to 608 cases in the placebo group. The estimated VE was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) for BNT162b2.

VE of BNT162b2 for the same efficacy endpoint based on the Dose 1 and Dose 2 all-available efficacy populations was 49.7% (2-sided 95% CI: 44.0%, 54.9%) and 52.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 46.7%, 57.3%), respectively.

In the evaluable efficacy (seroconversion) population without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, VE of BNT162b2 was 60.4% and 56.6% from Dose 2 to 1 month after Dose 2 and from &gt;1 month after Dose 2, respectively. The VE for cases confirmed after Dose 2 was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) based on 612 and 608 cases in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) and placebo groups, respectively. Note that &gt;1 month after Dose 2, the surveillance time in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group (11.961 [1000 personyears]) was more than twice the surveillance time in the placebo group (4.681 [1000 person-years]),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which is accounted for in the VE calculations; this is due to the placebo crossover resulting in truncated follow-up time for participants who originally received placebo.

Assessor´s comment: An impressive number of participants (more than 40,000) have been sampled for blood after 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post dose 2 and tested for N- protein specific antibodies, which is a marker for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the strain. The seroconversion to N-protein is a stable biomarker for passed SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore this analysis gives a reliable estimate of infection. The follow-up time for the placebo arm was about half compared to the active arm, which might introduce a biased analysis. The results of the N-antibody seroconversion analysis indicate that Comirnaty Original 30 provided protection against asymptomatic infections after 2 doses.

## Incidence Rates of First COVID-19 Occurrence After Vaccination

Analyses were performed for COVID-19 cases accrued for the following groups and periods:

- Original BNT162b2 (30 µg) group during a period when multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains were circulating (ie, original/wild type strain and Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Omicron variants), pre-dominating at various times during the period from the Dose 1 vaccination date to the earliest of confirmed case, death, study withdrawal, study completion date, or the participant's first dose of BNT162b2SA vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Original placebo prior to crossover group for the time between vaccination in the blinded period, and the crossover date. The original/wild type was the predominant strain during this period. Most of the Phase 2/3 participants were unblinded (April 2021) and transitioned to the crossover group when the Delta variant was the predominant strain. Crossover of Phase 2/3 participants was completed by October 2021.
- Placebo crossover to BNT162b2 (30 µg) group for the period from first BNT162b2 vaccination. Analyses were performed for COVID-19 cases accrued for the placebo crossover to BNT162b2 (30 µg) group when Alpha and Beta variants (01 December 2020 to 10 January 2021), Gamma variant (11 January 2021 to 03 April 2021), Delta variant (04 April 2021 to 26 November 2021), Omicron variant (27 November 2021 to LSLV) were predominant.

For cases of first COVID-19 occurrence after vaccination, the IRs for participants in the original BNT162b2, original placebo prior to crossover, and placebo crossover to BNT162b2 groups were 104.562, 125.722, and 169.138 per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively.

Kaplan-Meier curve shows the case accrual from vaccination up to the end of study date for the participants who received BNT162b2 originally (original BNT162b2 group), participants who received placebo originally prior to crossover (original placebo group), and participants who received placebo originally and then crossed over to receive BNT162b2 (placebo crossover to BNT162b2 group), with severe COVID-19 cases denoted with 'S' on the curves. During the entire study period, most participants were eligible to receive up to 4 vaccine doses (2 dose primary series and 2 booster doses). In the postvaccination period, there is clear evidence of better protection by BNT162b2 compared to placebo in the immediate months following vaccination before cross over occurred. After placebo crossover, case accrual increased for both the original BNT162b2 and placebo crossover groups following different variant waves. The curves steepen substantially around 470 and 300 days for the original BNT162b2 and placebo crossover groups, respectively, which likely represents when each group was exposed to the start of the Omicron waves.

Assessor´s comment: The current results illustrate the VE over the 2 years of pandemic, where different new SARS-CoV-2 strains evolved over a short time window and Original Comirnaty became less immunogenically cross-reactive with the circulating strains. The Original Comirnaty was very effective in the beginning of the pandemic. After the authorisation, the placebo arm were offered vaccination and became a cross-over arm. The active arm were offered more doses as the study continued with booster doses. The cross over arm also received boosters, but with at a later time point and therefore had received fewer doses than the original active arm every time a new strain appeared. Thus, the results are not easily interpretable but are in agreement with waning protection to new variants.

## The MAH Summary of Efficacy

A formal secondary efficacy analysis was performed to assess vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and against non-S-seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. The incidence of confirmed first COVID-19 through the entire study follow-up period in participants who received BNT162b2 was also described.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population without evidence of SARSCoV-2 infection prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period, the VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) based on NAAT-confirmed infection was 37.2% (2-sided 95% CI: -20.0%, 66.7%) based on 24 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 group and 20 infections reported in the placebo group.
- In the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period, the VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) was 70.8% (2-sided 95% CI: 39.7%, 87.1%) based on 10 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 group and 35 infections reported in the placebo group.
- In the evaluable efficacy (seroconversion) population without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the first post-Dose 2 N-binding test, the VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) for confirmed cases. From Dose 2 to 1 month after Dose 2 and from &gt;1 month after Dose 2, the VE was 60.4% and 56.6%, respectively, and the overall VE was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) after Dose 2.
- Confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued through the entire study follow-up as multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants circulated, most notably following the emergence of Omicron. Incidence Rates for participants in the original BNT162b2, original placebo prior to crossover, and placebo crossover to BNT162b2 groups were 104.562, 125.722, and 169.138 per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively. This prompted the development and implementation of variantadapted vaccines: bivalent vaccines targeting the original/wild type strain and Omicron BA.1 or BA.4/BA.5, and most recently monovalent XBB.1.5.

## 6.2.2. Immunogenicity

## Phase 3

Summarised below are immunogenicity results for Phase 3 BNT162b2-experienced participants, 18 through 55 and &gt;55 years of age, who received a lower booster dose (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg).

## Immunogenicity Populations

The immunogenicity populations of BNT162b2-experienced participants who were rerandomised to receive a booster dose of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg) instead of approved dose of 30 µg are presented below. One participant each was excluded from the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population for not having at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result within 28-42 days after booster vaccination in the BNT162b2 (5 µg) &gt;55 years of age group and the BNT162b2 (10 µg) 18 through 55 years and &gt;55 years of age groups. One additional participant in the BNT162b2 (5 µg) &gt;55 years of age group was excluded from the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population due to having an important protocol deviation(s) as determined by the clinician. The demographics of the small immunogenicity population is presented also below.

## SARS-CoV-2 Neutralising Titres to Reference Strain

## GMTs

Among participants in the Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of SARS-CoV2 infection up to 1 month after the booster dose, SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising GMTs increased substantially at 1 month (Day 28) after the booster (Dose 3) for both dose and age groups (table below). The SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising GMTs were similar, immediately before and 1 month after booster dose across the dose and age groups.

Similar results were observed for participants in the booster (Dose 3) evaluable immunogenicity population regardless of prior infection status and for participants in the Dose 3 booster all-available immunogenicity population.

Assessor´s comment: the majority of this immunology population did not have signs of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, here was not direct comparison to the approved 30 µg dose investigated. Anyhow, the pre 3-dose titre was similar to the earlier reported 30 µg age group. After the 3 rd  dose with 5 or 10 µg, the titres were very similar to each other, around 900- 1000. The earlier data for 30 µg dose show titre above 2000, 1 month post-dose 3. We can conclude that lower dose for adults is immunogenic, but the 30 µg is more suitable.

The earlier results for Original Comirnaty 30 µg:

Among participants in the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster (Dose 3), the GMFR of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 9.0 to 12.4 (median time 6.8 to 7.2 months from Dose 2 to booster [Dose 3]) in the BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg) groups. Of note, GMFR of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum neutralising titre from before Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 30 µg was 17.7 (median time 6.8 months from Dose 2 to booster [Dose 3]) (20 May 2022 interim CSR), indicating a higher booster effect of the 30-µg dose than the lower doses (5 or 10 µg).

The GMFRs were similar for participants in the booster (Dose 3) evaluable immunogenicity population regardless of prior infection status and for participants in the booster (Dose 3) all-available immunogenicity population.

Assessor´s comment: By 1 month after Dose 3, the GMFR from before Dose 3 was 17.6 (2-sided 95% CI: 15.3, 20.2), which is higher than after 5 or 10 µg. No correlate of protection has been identified, but it is assumed that higher neutralising antibody titres likely correlates with increased protection, and therefore it can be concluded that the Original Comirnaty 30 µg is an adequate dose for a booster for adults as it resulted in higher titres than in case of lower doses.

## The MAH Summary of Immunogenicity

Lower booster doses of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg) in BNT162b2-experienced participants substantially increased SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody response 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 18 through 55 and &gt;55 years of age, based on GMTs, GMFRs, and Reverse Cumulative Incidence Curves (RCDCs). Although there is no contemporaneous 30-µg comparator for lower booster doses of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg), the GMFR for 30-µg booster (Phase 3), presented in the 20 May 2022 interim CSR, show that, based on GMFR values, a higher booster dose of BNT162b2 elicits a more robust immune response.

## 6.3. Discussion

Study C4591001 is a Phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 years of age. This report includes the final data from study C4591001. The study including more than 40,000 individuals. They received 2 doses of Original Comirnaty 30 µg, and were followed up for up to 2 years post-dose 2. Originally, the study had an active arm and a placebo arm, but after the approval of the vaccine, the placebo arm was offered vaccination thus creating a cross-over arm and the study became unblinded. The study continued with options to receive booster doses with the Original vaccine (3 and 4 th  dose) in all groups. The surveillance for COVID-19 continued during the entire study period, up to 2 years post-dose 2. Also, participants gave 3-5 blood samples to monitor for seroconversion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

after possible infection (N-antigen antibody detection).

In the current final report, the MAH presents data from asymptomatic infection surveillance during the entire study period and also an immunogenicity analysis of a third dose of BNT162b2 at a lower dose of 5 or 10 µg administered to smaller population of Phase 2/3 participants.

The asymptomatic infection surveillance was performed using two distinct biomarkers: NAAT in a subpopulation (N= 4000) and N-protein detection in the entire population (N= 40 000). The time window to detect viral RNA was limited. The surveillance for asymptomatic infections did not start immediately after the vaccination. The median time between Dose 2 and the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period was 2.9 months for participants in the United States and 5.3 months for participants in Argentina. Cases were counted from the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. Therefore, the current testing for NAAT involves uncertainties. There were only 44 asymptomatic cases accrued from 3921 individuals, showing that asymptomatic cases are rather rare or have been missed. The VE result based on a such testing gave a wide CI, VE = 37.2% (95% CI: -20.0%; 66.7%).

Interestingly, a rather high proportion of asymptomatic cases were detected among the previously infected population (45 asymptomatic cases out of 210 subjects). Although the sample size was small, it appears that a COVID-19 experienced population are at lower risk to develop symptoms during a subsequent infection compared to the first infection. Also, despite low numbers, the data showed better protection against asymptomatic infections for subjects who have been infected before vaccination compared to the earlier infected but unvaccinated subjects: VE = 70.8% (95% CI: 39.7%; 87.1%). This phenomenon is described earlier in observational studies, where previous infection in combination with vaccination gave a broader protection against new strains compared to only infection or only vaccination.

The N-protein specific antibodies are stable, long-lasting markers for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the virus strain. The entire study population (N= 40,000) was sampled for blood after 1-, 6, 12-, and 24-months post-dose 2 and tested for the seroconversion to the N-protein.

Seroconversion to the N-protein is a stable biomarker for past SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore this analysis gives a reliable estimate of infection. The follow-up time for the placebo arm was about half compared to the active arm, which might introduce a biased analysis. The results of the N-antibody seroconversion analysis indicated that Comirnaty Original 30 provided protection against asymptomatic infections after 2 doses. The N-antibody seroconversion analysis showed that Comirnaty Original 30 µg provided protection against asymptomatic infections after 2 doses during the study period: VE = 52.9% (95% CI: 47.2%; 57.9%).

The current results illustrate the VE over the 2 years of pandemic, where different new SARS-CoV-2 strains evolved over a short time window and Original Comirnaty became less immunogenically crossreactive with the circulating strains. The Original Comirnaty was very effective in the beginning of the pandemic. After the authorisation, the placebo arm were offered vaccination and became a cross-over arm. The active arm were offered more doses as the study continued with booster doses. The crossover arm also received boosters, but with at a later time point and therefore had received fewer doses than the original active arm every time a new strain appeared. Thus, the results are not easily interpretable but are in agreement with waning protection to new variants.

The MAH submitted also immunogenicity results for Phase 3 BNT162b2-experienced participants, 18 through 55 (N= 25) and &gt;55 years of age (N= 55), who received a lower booster dose (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg).  Lower booster doses of BNT162b2 substantially increased SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody response 1 month after Dose 3, based on GMTs, GMFRs, and RCDCs. Although there was no contemporaneous 30-µg comparator for lower booster doses the GMFR for 30-µg booster (Phase 3), presented earlier showed that a higher booster dose of BNT162b2 elicits a more robust

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immune response (GMFR 30-µg = 17; 10 -µg= 12; 5 -µg= 11 for &gt; 55 yoa). Therefore the usage of 30-µg for booster is accurate.

In conclusions, the MAH has presented the final report of study C4591001, with new information about 2 dose Original Comirnaty 30µg VE against asymptomatic infections, incidents rate during the entire 2 years of follow up and boosting effect of the lower doses for adults. The results show that 2 doses of Original Comirnaty provided protection against asymptomatic infections, the Original Active arm was better protected than Placebo or Placebo cross-over arm during the evolving pandemic and that also lower doses of Original Comirnaty have boosting effect for adults.

No changes to the section 5.1 in the SmPC are suggested and we agree.

## 7. Clinical Safety aspects

## 7.1. Methods

Study C4591001 was a Phase 1/2/3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 years of age. The study consisted of 2 parts: Phase 1 to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s) in individuals 18 through 55 and 65 through 85 years of age; and Phase 2/3 as an expanded cohort and efficacy part in individuals ≥12 years of age.

This report includes final results from study C4591001 and interim data for subjects aged 12-15 years who had received one booster dose of BNT162b2 30µg. Based on these data, update of section 4.8 in the SmPC has been proposed by the MAH.

## 7.1.1. Phase 1

## Disposition and Exposure

Disposition of all randomised Phase 1 participants is presented in the table below. All randomised participants received 2 doses and completed the 1-month post-Dose 2 visit during the blinded, placebo-controlled period. Note that for the BNT162b1 100-μg group, the internal review committee (IRC) determined not to administer the second dose of 100 μg to this group of participants due to reactogenicity and as per IRC decision, these participants were instead given Dose 2 of BNT162b1 at the 10-μg dose level. During the open-label follow-up period, 25.0% to 100.0% of participants originally randomised to receive BNT162b1 or BNT162b2, completed the 6-month post-Dose 2 visit. Most participant withdrawals were due to either no longer meeting eligibility criteria or protocol deviations.

## Assessor´s comment:

In this Phase 1 study, primary series of BNT162b1 (10, 20, 30, 100µg) and BNT162b2 (10, 20, 30 µg) was administered to subgroups including 24 adult subjects in each group (total n=195). Most of these subjects then received one booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), and an additional booster dose was administered to about half of the study population. Median follow-up time since first booster dose was 12-21 months in the different initial vaccine groups, and the median follow-up time after the additional booster dose was 5-6 months.

A slightly higher frequency of female participants was noted (59% vs 41%), majority were white, and the study was executed in USA. The age of the subject ranged between 20-83 years.

## 7.1.2. Phase 2/3

## Disposition of Participants from Dose 1 of BNT162b2 30 μg to Before Booster Dose

Final disposition of all randomised Phase 2/3 participants 12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of age is presented below for the blinded placebo-controlled and open-label follow-up periods.

The following is noted for these participants:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Individuals 12 through 15 years of age and ≥ 16 years of age were unblinded as they became locally eligible and wished to know their vaccine assignment to confirm prior vaccination with BNT162b2 (if randomised to this group), or to receive BNT162b2 (if randomised to placebo). Unblinded recipients originally randomised to BNT162b2 were followed in an open-label manner. Unblinded recipients originally randomised to placebo were offered BNT162b2 vaccination (Doses 3 and 4 [first and second dose of BNT162b2 30 μg, respectively]) and were also followed in an open-label manner.
- Seventeen participants were inadvertently enrolled at multiple sites, and they were excluded from all data summaries.

## Participants With Confirmed Stable HIV Disease

In total 201 HIV-positive subjects were randomised and vaccinated (n=100 BNT162b2; n=101 Placebo). During the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period, most HIV-positive participants randomised to the BNT162b2 and placebo groups received Doses 1 and 2. There were 4 participants (4.0%) in the BNT162b2 group and 4 participants (4.0%) in the placebo group who discontinued from the vaccination period (Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2). Most participants completed the 1-month post-Dose 2 visit (≥97.0%). Few participants in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups were withdrawn from the study (2.0% and 4.0%, respectively). The reasons were withdrawal by the participant, lost to follow-up, and death.

In the BNT162b2 (30 μg) group, during the open-label follow-up period, there were 58 participants (58.0%) withdrawn from the study, and most were due to other reasons. In the placebo group, during the open-label follow-up period, most participants originally randomised to placebo received Doses 1 and 2 (89.1% and 88.1%, respectively) of BNT162b2. There were 19 participants (18.8%) in this group who were withdrawn from the study. The most common reason was 'other'.

## Assessor´s comment:

The final disposition for all randomised subjects to the Phase 2/3 study C4591001 included a total of 46406 subjects aged ≥12 years, of which 99.8% received the two doses included in the primary series of BNT162b2 30µg. Among the subjects who were originally randomised to placebo 89-92% received two doses of BNT162b2 30µg. In total were 1156 subjects withdrawn from the study, most of them due to lost to follow-up (n=543) or withdrawn by subject (n=397).

In total were 201 HIV-positive subjects were randomised and vaccinated (n=100 BNT162b2; n=101 Placebo). Most of them received the primary series and remained in the study. In the placebo group who later received BNT162b2 30µg, it in noted that 19 participants (19%) of the participants withdrawn due to 'other reason'.

## Disposition of Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 30 μg.

Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 30 μg as Part of Protocol Amendment 18

The final disposition of Phase 2/3 participants 12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of age who received 2 doses of BNT162b2 30 μg and then received a booster dose of BNT162b2 30 μg as part of protocol amendment 18 is presented below.

Among the 99 HIV-positive participants who received a booster dose of BNT162b2 in Phase 2/3, 98 (99.0%) completed the booster vaccination period from the third dose of BNT162b2 to the 1-month follow-up visit, and 78 participants (78.8%) completed the study. After receiving the booster dose, 21 participants (21.2%) were withdrawn from the study mostly due to other reasons or protocol deviations.

## Assessor´s comment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among the 333 included BNT162b2-naïve subjects, 330 received a dose of the variant vaccine BNT162b2SA (South Africa B.1.351). The 6-month post-booster dose vaccination visit was completed by 66% of the subjects. Withdrawn was reported among 25 (7,5%) of the subjects.

## BNT162b2-Experienced Participants Who Were Rerandomised to Receive Booster Dose(s) Under Protocol Amendments 14 and 15 and Received an Additional Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

The final disposition of Phase 2/3 BNT162b2-experienced participants who received the 2-dose primary series of BNT162b2 30 μg and were rerandomised/assigned to receive a booster (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 (30 μg, or lower dose of 5 or 10 μg), or 1 or 2 booster doses of BNT162b2SA 30 μg under protocol amendments 14 and 15, is presented below.

An additional 5-μg or 10-pg dose of BNT162b2 will be given to approximately 144 Phase 3 participants approximately 5 to 7 months after their second dose of BNT162b2. Tofurther describe cell-mediatedimmune responses following isolations of PBMCs in a subset ofboth thePhase3participantswho reccive asingleboostervaccination andthe BNT162b2-naive group who receive BNT162b2sA, additional genetic testing may also be performed; corresponding details and an appendix have been added. An exploratory objective was addedforPhase3 participants todescribe theimmuneresponse toa thirddoseofBNT162b2orathirdorfourthdoseof BNT162b2sAat latertime points to alignwith analyses and corresponding changes detailed in the statistical section. Removed the lower age limit for eligibility for administrationofBNT162b2tothoseoriginally assigned toplacebo:thiswill nowbecoveredin the recommendationsdetailedseparately,and available in the electronic study reference portal. Allowed administration of BNT162b2 atVisits101 and 102 to pregnant participants in certain circumstances. To align with contraception requirements, reduced the EDP reporting period to 28 days after the last dose of studyintervention.   |

## Assessor´s comment:

In this part of the study (described in protocol amendment 14 and 15), subjects that had already received the primary series of BNT162b2 30 µg were rerandomised to receive booster doses of BNT162b2 at 5, 10, 30 µg or BNT162b2SA (N=780). In addition, 30 subjects were assigned to receive booster doses of BNT162b2SA. All subjects received the first booster dose. The second booster dose was not received by 41% of the subjects in the BNT162b2 30 µg group. In the other groups 37-58% of the subjects did not receive the additional booster vaccination.

## Exposure and Follow-up Time

## Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 30 μg as Part of Protocol Amendment 18

Participants 12 through 15 years of age, the median (min, max) time between Dose 2 and booster vaccination was 11.2 (6.3, 20.1) months. Most participants (93.9%) received the booster dose of BNT162b2 &lt;15 months after Dose 2.

Participants 16 years of ag and older, the median (min, max) time between Dose 2 and booster vaccination was 10.1 (4.8, 22.7) months. Most participants (85.7%) received the booster dose of BNT162b2 &lt;15 months after Dose 2.

## Assessor´s comment:

Among the 242 BNT162b2-naïve subjects who received a booster dose of BNT162b2SA, most of the booster vaccinations occurred 6-9 months after Dose 2. The median follow-up time was 12.3 months.

Phase 3 - BNT162b2-Experienced Subjects who Were Rerandomised to Receive 1 Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (Lower Dose)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median time (min, max) between Dose 2 and booster vaccination ranged from 6.8 (5.6, 7.4) to 7.2 (5.6, 7.5) months.

## Assessor´s comment:

Among the 155 subjects that all received a low dose booster of BNT162b2 at either 5 or 10µg, all of them were administered at least five months after Dose 2. Median follow-up time were 19.8-20.1 months.

Phase 3 BNT162b2 Experienced Subjects who were Previously Rerandomised/Assigned to Receive Booster Dose(s) and Received an Additional Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30µg) as Part of Protocol Amendment 19

All BNT162b2-experienced participants who were previously rerandomised/assigned to receive booster dose(s) and received an additional booster vaccination of BNT162b2 (30 µg) as part of protocol amendment 19, received the additional booster of BNT162b2 (30 µg), as assigned.

## Assessor´s comment

Among the subjects that received BNT162b2, the age ranged between 19-83 years, the distribution between gender was in general similar except for the two different dose groups and it was noted that about one third of the subjects were obese. The study was executed in the USA.

## Assessor´s comment

The age ranged from 20-80 years. Obesity was noted in 21-40% of the subjects in each group. The distribution between gender was in general similar, however, in the smallest groups (n=33 BNT162b2 5µg and BNT162b2SA 30 µg) a slightly higher frequency of male was noted. The study was executed in the USA.

## Assessor´s comment

In the Phase 2/3 study that included 825 subjects aged 12-15 years of age, the median age was 14 years. All subjects received the booster dose, six of them discontinued the study due to lost to followup. Withdrawal from study was reported among 176 subjects (21%), most common reason was 'other' (n=124). The study was executed in the USA and the distribution between gender were similar. The median follow-up time after first booster dose was 9.5 months and from Dose 2 18.1 months. The median time from Dose 2 to booster dose was 11.2 months (range 6.3-20.1 months).

## 7.2. Results

## 7.2.1. Phase 1

## Dose 1 to 6 Months after Dose 2

Reactogenicity was reported previously for these participants and therefore not included here.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two SAEs were reported by 1 participant in the BNT162b2 20-μg group and 1 participant in the 30-μg group. In the BNT162b2 20-μg group, 1 SAE of appendicitis was reported in 1 participant and was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention. In the BNT162b2 30-μg group, 1 severe SAE of neuritis was reported by 1 participant and was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention.

First Booster Dose to 1 Month after the First Booster Dose

A limited number of AEs by SOC were reported by Phase 1 participants from the first booster dose to 1 month after the first booster dose. Generally, most Preferred Terms (PTs) were reported by no more than 1 participant per the initial BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 dose groups and included, but not limited to, reports of lymphadenopathy, fatigue, axillary pain, chills, myalgia, muscle spasms, dizziness, headache, paresthesia, and presyncope. One participant (4.2%) reported an AE of deep vein thrombosis toxicity grade 2, 29 days after the booster dose. The subject was in the initial BNT162b1 20-μg group, and the event was not considered related to vaccination.

## Related AEs

Related AEs were reported in the initial BNT162b1 10-, 20-, and 30-μg groups and the initial BNT162b2 10-μg group only. Related AEs were reported by no more than 3 participants per group.

From the first booster dose to 1 month after the first booster dose, AEs assessed as related by the investigator in the initial BNT162b1 10- and 20-μg groups were reported by no more than 1 participant per group. Two participants (8.3%) in the initial 30-μg dose group reported a related AE of lymphadenopathy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the initial BNT162b2 10-μg group, general disorders and administration site conditions (chills, injection site haemorrhage) and nervous system disorders (paraesthesia and headache) were reported by 2 participants (9.1%) each.

## Immediate AEs

There were no immediate adverse events reported after the first booster dose in the initial BNT162b1 groups. In the initial BNT162b2 10-μg group, 1 immediate AE of injection site haemorrhage was reported in 1 participant.

## Severe or life-threatening AEs

From the first booster dose to 1 month after the first booster dose, 2 severe events (axillary pain and headache) were reported by 2 participants (8.3%) in the initial BNT162b1 30-μg group. One lifethreatening (Grade 4) event of colitis was reported in the initial BNT162b1 100-μg group, onset 4 days after booster vaccination, and was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study vaccine.

## SAEs and death

No deaths were reported in the Phase 1 booster safety population in the initial BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 groups from the first booster dose to 1 month after the first booster dose.

From booster dose (Dose 3) to 1 month after booster dose of BNT162b2 30 μg, 1 participant (11.1%) in the initial BNT162b1 100-μg group reported 1 SAE of colitis which was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the vaccine. This participant required overnight observation at the emergency room due to symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in stool, with the diagnosis confirmed by CT scan of the abdomen. Treatment was with oral antibiotics and a follow up sigmoidoscopy was negative with full resolution of symptoms 19 days after onset.

## Discontinuation from study due to AEs

No participants in the Phase 1 BNT162b2 booster safety population in the initial BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 groups were withdrawn due to AEs from the first booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 month after the first booster dose.

## Pregnancy

One pregnancy was reported in the Phase 1 BNT162b2 booster safety population in the initial BNT162b1 group from the first booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 month after the first booster dose.

## Additional Booster Dose to 1 Month After the Additional Booster Dose

From Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4, the number (%) of participants with any AE was 3 (3.8%); these AEs were considered by investigators as related to study intervention. No participants reported a severe or life-threatening AE. No event of pregnancy was reported. No SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths were reported.

The study did not use e-diary to collect reactogenicity events after the additional booster dose (Dose 4). Events related to reactogenicity (i.e., injection site pain, myalgia, pyrexia, and headache) were collected as AEs. Of the AEs reported during this period, some were reactogenicity events reported as AEs. The number of participants (%) who reported AEs by SOC for these reactogenicity terms are as follows:

- general disorders and administration site conditions: 1 (1.3%)
- musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 2 (2.5%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From the additional booster dose to 1 month after the additional booster dose, 3 participants (3.8%) had AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. These events, which also included reactogenicity events, were reported as AEs. One participant (1.3%) each reported injection site pain, myalgia, and pain in extremity.

## MAH Conclusion

All doses of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 were safe and well tolerated. BNT162b1 at 100μg was discontinued due to the reactogenicity profile (previously reported); no participants in either age group received any dose of BNT162b2 at the 100-μg dose level.

The frequency of participants with any AE after the booster doses (Dose 3 and Dose 4) of BNT162b2 (30 μg) was low, with most participants reporting mild, reactogenicity-type events.

The frequency of participants reporting SAEs after the first 2 doses of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, and the booster doses (Dose 3 and Dose 4), was from none to low, and all SAEs reported were assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention. There were no AEs leading to withdrawal or deaths reported.

## Assessor´s comment:

Local and systemic events for these participants was presented in the initial application for EMEA/H/C/005735/0000.

From the first booster to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, most of the reported AEs were related to reactogenicity. One event of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) not considered related to the vaccination was reported in one participant. Two events of related lymphadenopathy were reported. One event of immediate haemorrhage was reported in one participant.

The reported AEs after the administered booster doses in the Phase 1 study are in line with what has previously been observed for the primary series.

## 7.2.2. Phase 2/3

## Local Reactions and Systemic Events

Reactogenicity for subjects receiving primary series of BNT162b2 30µg has been reported previously.

Local reactions and systemic events for BNT162b2-experienced participants 18 through 55 and &gt; 55 years of age who were rerandomised to receive 1 booster dose of BNT162b2 (lower dose of 5 or 10 μg) under protocol amendment 15 are presented in this final CSR.

## Local Reactions and Systemic Events for Participants who Received Lower Dose Booster

Local reactions and systemic events in BNT162b2-experienced participants 18 through 55 and &gt; 55 years of age who received 1 booster dose of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 μg) were mild to moderate at intensity, as illustrated below.

## Assessor´s comment

Among the subjects that had received a low dose booster dose (BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg), showed a similar reactogenicity profile as what has been observed from the primary series. No subjects who received BNT162b2 5 µg reported fever. There was a clear trend to lower reactogenicity with lower dose and lower reactogenicity in subjects aged &gt;55 years compared to subjects aged 18-54 years.

## Adverse Events from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2

Final SAE analyses are reported for participants ≥16 years of age from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 during the blinded, placebo-controlled and open label follow-periods.

## SAEs dose 1 up to 6 months after dose 2

From Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, 291 participants (1.3%) in the placebo group reported SAEs after receiving placebo. All SAEs were assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention.

From Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, participants who reported at least 1 SAE were similar in the original BNT162b2 group (428 participants [2.0%]) and original placebo/BNT162b2 group (353 participants [1.7%]).

In the original BNT162b2 (30 μg) group, there were 3 participants with an SAE each assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention:

- One participant experienced a ventricular arrhythmia that occurred 1 day after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 and resolved within 8 days.
- One participant experienced a shoulder injury related to vaccine administration that resolved 153 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- One participant experienced paresthesia that occurred 47 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, which lasted 221 days and resolved.

In the original placebo/BNT162b2 (30 μg) group, 3 participants had an SAE assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention:

- One participant experienced an SAE of portal vein thrombosis that occurred 61 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, which lasted 8 days and resolved.
- One participant experienced a transient ischemic attack that occurred 5 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, which lasted 1 day and resolved.
- One participant experienced myalgia that occurred 59 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, which lasted for 51 days and resolved.

There were no clinically meaningful differences in SAEs by age group, race, sex, or ethnicity.

## Assessor´s comment

From the first dose up to 6 months after the second dose, a similar frequency of SAEs was reported in the vaccine group and in the placebo group (2% vs 1.7%).

No new safety concerns were detected here.

BNT162b2-Naïve Participants Assigned to Receive BNT162b2SA Who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, the number of participants with any AE was 27 (11.4%). Events considered by the investigator as related to study intervention were reported by 25 participants (10.6%). No participants reported a severe AE. No AEs leading to withdrawals or deaths were reported.

## Analysis of Adverse Events

Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age and ≥16 Years of Age who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

The most commonly reported AE in both age groups was injection site pain, in 66 participants (8.0%) in the 12 through 15 years of age group and 1679 (7.5%) in the ≥16 years of age group. Most AEs reported during this period reflect reactogenicity events reported as AEs. AE frequencies by reactogenicity SOC for both groups (12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of age) were:

- general disorders and administration site conditions (130 [15.8%] and 2923 [13.0%)
- nervous system disorders (49 [5.9%] and 632 [2.8%])
- musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (19 [2.3%] and 646 [2.9%])
- gastrointestinal disorders (12 [1.5%] and 203 [0.9%])

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Lymphadenopathy was reported by 8 and 360 participants (1.0% and 1.6%) in the 12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of age groups, respectively.

There were no clinically important differences regarding the percentage of participants reporting at least 1 AE by SOC and PT in the subgroup analyses by age, race, sex, and ethnicity from the administration of Dose 3 of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 month after Dose 3.

## Participants With Confirmed Stable HIV Disease who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions (7 participants [7.1%]), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (2 participants [2.0%]).

BNT162b2-Naïve Participants Assigned to Receive BNT162b2SA who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions (23 participants [9.7%]) followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (6 participants [2.5%]).

## Assessor´s comment

From the first booster dose up to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, the frequency of any AEs was 17% (n=3818) among the subjects ≥16 years of age, many of them were considered related to study vaccine (15% [n=3377]) and most of them were reactogenicity events. There was no difference among the subjects that had a confirmed stable HIV disease who received a booster dose. Among the BNT162b2-naïve subjects that received a booster dose, the reported AES was mostly related to reactogenicity.

No new safety concern was detected here.

## Related Adverse Events

## Related AEs Phase 2/3 Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 3377 participants (15.0%) in the ≥16 years of age group had AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The most common related event was injection site pain, reported in 1678 participants (7.5%) in the ≥16 years of age group. Most of the other related AEs were reactogenicity events in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, reported by 2910 (13.0%) in the ≥16 years of age group. Headache was reported by 550 participants (2.4%) in the ≥16 years of age group.

## BNT162b2-Naïve Participants Assigned to Receive BNT162b2SA who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 25 BNT162b2-naïve participants (10.6%) assigned to receive BNT162b2SA who received the booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) had AEs assessed by the investigators as related to study intervention. The most common related event was injection site pain in 11 participants (4.7%).

## Assessor´s comment

Among the subjects that received a booster dose, pain at injection site was the most commonly reported related AE. Most of the related AEs concerned reactogenicity. The same pattern was observed among the BNT162b2-naïve subjects.

No new safety concern was detected here.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immediate Adverse Events

## Phase 2/3 Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

The frequencies of immediate AEs reported within 30 minutes after the booster dose were low (≤ 0.4%) in the 12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of age groups. 26 participants reported injection site pain and 6 participants reported fatigue in the ≥16 years of age group. In addition, in the ≥16 years of age group, 31 participants (0.1%) reported immediate AEs in the SOC of injury, poisoning and procedural complications with 20 participants (0.1%) reporting exposure during pregnancy.

There were no immediate AEs reported in the BNT162b2-naïve booster safety population (assigned to Receive BNT162b2SA) after receiving the booster dose.

## Assessor´s comment

Few immediate AEs was reported after the booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg.

No new safety concern was detected here.

## Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events

## Phase 2/3 Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg)

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, severe events in participants ≥16 years of age were reported in 90 participants (0.4%). Life-threatening (or Grade 4) events were reported in 6 participants ≥16 years of age from booster dose to 1 month after booster dose. Of the 6 reported life-threatening events, 1 was considered by the investigator as related to study intervention: Angioedema reported in 1 participant, occurred 1 day after Dose 3 with a duration of 2 days. The event was reported as an SAE and resolved, and the participant continued in the study.

There were no severe or life-threatening AEs reported in BNT162b2-naïve participants assigned to Receive BNT162b2SA who received the booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg).

## Assessor´s comment

One severe event of angioedema which was considered related to the booster dose was reported. The event occurred one day after the booster dose and resolved after two days. Angioedema is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC at the frequency uncommon.

## Deaths

One death was reported in the booster dose BNT162b2 (30 μg) ≥16 years of age group. The participant died 22 days after Dose 3 with the cause of death provided as adenocarcinoma of the pancreas which was considered unrelated to study intervention.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIALSDTMCreation:10MAR2023(16:40)SourceData: adaeTableGeneration:05MAY2023 (03:09)

In the ≥16 years age groups, 2 participants had SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention:

- One 30 to 40-year-old participant experienced an SAE of spontaneous abortion toxicity grade 1 that occurred 13 days after Dose 3.
- An SAE of myocarditis of Grade 3 severity was reported in one 16-18-year-old male participant, 4 days following the booster dose. The SAE lasted for 101 days, and the event resolved with sequalae.

There were no clinically important differences regarding the percentage of participants reporting at least 1 SAE in the subgroup analyses by age, race, sex, and ethnicity from the administration of Dose 3 of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 month after Dose 3.

Among the BNT162b2-naïve participants assigned to receive BNT162b2SA who received booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), there were no SAEs reported after receiving the booster dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessor´s comment

The frequency of SAE was &lt;0,5% among the subjects ≥12 years of age that received a booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg. One SAE of myocarditis was reported. Myocarditis is already listed in the SmPC both in section 4.4 and 4.8. One event of spontaneous abortion toxicity grade 1 was reported 13 days after vaccination, the participant had an additional miscarriage 105 days after vaccination which was not considered related to the vaccination. The investigator considered the first spontaneous abortion to be possible related with the vaccination, which was not agreed by the MAH. The opinion of the MAH can be supported since the presented data does not allow to conclude upon a possible relation to vaccination.

## Discontinuation from Study due to AEs

One participant in the ≥16 years of age group had an AE leading to withdrawal that was considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention (adenocarcinoma of the pancreas).

No participants in the population of BNT162b2-naïve participants assigned to receive BNT162b2SA who received booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) were withdrawn due to AEs from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3.

## Assessor´s comment

One participant discontinued the study due to adenocarcinoma of the pancreas which was not considered related to vaccination.

## Pregnancy

One pregnancy was reported in BNT162b2-Naïve participants assigned to received BNT162b2SA who received booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg).

## First Booster to 1 and 6 Months after Booster Dose (Lower Doses)

## BNT162b2 (5 μg) Groups

From the BNT162b2 (5 μg) booster dose to 1 month after the booster dose, the number of BNT162b2experienced participants with any AE was 3 and 2 participants (11.5% and 3.8%) in the 18 through 55 years of age and &gt; 55 years of age groups, respectively. One participant (1.9%) reported a related AE in the &gt; 55 years of age group. No participants reported severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths in either age group. Through 6 months after the booster dose, AEs were reported by 2 additional participants &gt; 55 years of age, with 1 participant (1.9%) reporting an SAE that was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention. No AEs leading to withdrawal or deaths were reported in either of the age groups.

## BNT162b2 (10 μg) Groups

From the BNT162b2 (10 μg) booster dose to 1 month after the booster dose, 2 (8.0%) participants 18 through 55 years of age reported an AE. No participants in the &gt; 55 years of age group reported any AEs. One participant (4.0%) reported a related AE in the 18 through 55 years of age group. No SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths were reported in either of the age groups.

Through 6 months after the booster dose, AEs were reported 6 months after the booster dose by 1 additional participant each in 18 through 55 years of age and &gt; 55 years of age. No SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths were reported in either of the age groups.

AEs by SOC and preferred term from the administration of a booster dose of BNT162b2 (lower dose of 5 or 10 μg) to BNT162b2-experienced participants rerandomised to receive a booster dose of

## Related Adverse Events

Related AEs were reported by 1 participant (1.9%) in the BNT162b2 (5 μg) &gt; 55 years of age group only and included general disorders and administration site conditions (fatigue), metabolism and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nutrition disorders (dehydration), and nervous system disorders (dizziness). One participant (4.0%) reported a related AE of lymphadenopathy in the BNT162b2 (10 μg) 18 through 55 years of age group.

## Immediate Adverse Events

There were no immediate AEs reported in the BNT162b2-experienced (lower dose) booster safety population after the booster dose.

## Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events

There were no severe or life-threatening AEs reported in BNT162b2-experienced (lower dose) booster safety population after the booster dose.

## Deaths

No deaths were reported in the BNT162b2-experienced (lower dose) safety population from the booster dose to 6 months after the booster dose.

## Serious Adverse Events

From booster dose (BNT162b2 5 or 10 μg) to 6 months after booster dose 1 participant (1.9%) in the BNT162b2 (5 μg) &gt; 55 years of age group reported 1 SAE of back pain, which was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the vaccine.

## Discontinuations from Study Due to Adverse Events

No participants in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 (lower dose) booster safety population were withdrawn due to AEs from booster dose to 6 months after booster dose.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

One participant (2.0%) reported a significant AE of unilateral deafness in the BNT162b2 (10 μg) &gt; 55 years of age group that began approximately 2 and a half months after receipt of booster vaccination and was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention.

## Assessor´s comment

No new safety concerns were detected among the subjects that received low booster dose (BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg). No SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths were reported. Most of the reported AEs were related to reactogenicity.

Related Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term

Related AEs were reported in the BNT162b2 (30 μg), BNT162b2SA (30 μg), and BNT162b2SA (10 μg) groups.

In the BNT162b2 (30 μg) and BNT162b2SA (30 μg) groups, most related AEs reported were reactogenicity-type events and generally included injection site pain, pyrexia, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and chills.

There were no related AEs reported in the BNT162b2 (5 μg) and BNT162b2SA (30 μg, 2 doses) groups. There was 1 participant reported related AE in the BNT162b2 (10 μg) group.

Immediate Adverse Events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no participants in any of the groups who reported any immediate AEs after the additional booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg).

## Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events

There were no participants in any of the groups who reported any severe or life-threatening AEs after the additional booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg).

## Deaths

There were no deaths reported in participants after the additional booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg).

## Serious Adverse Events

From the additional booster dose to 1 month after the booster dose, 1 participant (0.5%) reported an SAE in the BNT162b2SA (30 μg) group that was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention.

## Discontinuations From Study Due to Adverse Events

No participants in the BNT162b2 were withdrawn due to AEs after the additional booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg).

## Assessor´s comment

Among the subjects (N=467) that received a second booster dose (protocol amendment 14, 15 and 19) of either BNT162b2 at 5, 10, 30 µg or BNT162b2SA 30 µg, a higher frequency of any AEs was noted among the subjects that received 30 µg (7-9%) compared with those who received low dose i.e., 5 or 10 µg (0-3%). The most commonly reported events were typical for reactogenicity.

No new safety concern was detected here.

## MAH Conclusion

Data previously presented from this clinical study showed that the primary 2 dose series of BNT162b2 30 μg was highly effective against symptomatic COVID-19, including cases that were severe and/or resulted in hospitalisation, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant.

Additional efficacy data presented in this CSR show that BNT162b2 30 μg likely also provides some protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in an analysis conducted prior to the emergence of Omicron. In addition, the cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased as multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants circulated, most notably following the emergence of Omicron. This resulted in the development and implementation of variant-adapted vaccines: bivalent vaccines targeting the original/wild type strain and Omicron BA.1 or BA.4/BA.5, and most recently monovalent XBB.1.5.

Overall immunogenicity responses were similar for lower booster doses (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 μg) in the BNT162b2 5- and 10-μg groups, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing GMTs substantially increased at 1 month after the lower booster dose. In addition, administration of lower booster dose of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 μg) was safe and tolerable.

The primary 2-dose series for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 at doses of 10, 20, and 30 μg was safe and tolerable. Administration of booster dose(s) (Dose 3, 4, or 5) of BNT162b2 30 μg to participants who had completed the 2-dose series showed continued safety and tolerability with most AEs consistent with reactogenicity-type events, and no new safety concerns.

## 7.2.3. Phase 2/3, subjects aged 12-15 years.

## Local Reactions and Systemic Events

There are no analyses of local reactions and/or systemic events in this report because solicited reactogenicity was not collected using e-diaries after the booster dose (Dose 3), but rather as unsolicited AEs on the case report form.

## Adverse Events

An overview of AEs from administration of Dose 3 one month after Dose 3 is shown below.

From Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (03 November 2022), in addition to the 152 participants who reported AEs up to 1 month after Dose 3, 9 additional participants reported an AE, for a cumulative number of participants with any AE of 161 (19.5%). As of the cut-off date, events considered by the investigator as related to study intervention remained the same as at 1 month after Dose 3, reported by 139 participants (16.8%). In addition to the 6 participants with a severe AE that were reported up to 1 month after Dose 3, as of the data cut-off date there were 3 additional participants who reported a severe AE; which were also considered unrelated by the investigator.

The most commonly reported AE was injection site pain, in 66 participants (8.0%). Most AEs reported during this period reflect reactogenicity events reported by the investigator as AEs. AE frequencies in SOCs for such reactogenicity terms were:

- general disorders and administration site conditions: 15.8%

- nervous system disorders: 5.9%

- musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 2.3%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- gastrointestinal disorders: 1.5%.
- Lymphadenopathy was reported by 8 (1.0%) participants.

AEs reported from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 by SOC and preferred term are presented below.

## Immediate Adverse Events

The frequencies of immediate AEs reported within 30 minutes after the booster dose were ≤0.4%, with 2 participants reporting injection site pain and 1 participant reporting fatigue.

## Assessor´s comment

Among the 825 subjects aged 12-15 years who received a booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, 18% reported any AEs. Most of these AEs were reactogenicity events (general disorders and administration site conditions and headache) and were considered related to vaccination. Pyrexia was reported in 28 (3.4%) of the subjects. Two events of lymphadenopathy were reported, lymphadenopathy is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC.

Two events of immediate AEs were reported: fatigue and injection site pain.

The results are in line with previous results and no new safety concern was detected here.

## Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 8 severe events (pyrexia [N=3 (0.4%)], depression [N=2] (0.2%), and one (0.1%) each of aggression, suicidal ideation, and dysmenorrhea) were reported by 6 (0.7%) participants. One life-threatening (Grade 4) event of a suicide attempt was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the study vaccine.

## Adverse Events from Dose 3 to the Data Cut-off Date

From Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (03 November 2022), which represents a median of 9.5 months of follow-up after Dose 3, the number of participants with any AE was 161 (19.5%). There were 9 additional participants that reported any AE beyond the 1-month after Dose 3 visit. The additional events were unrelated and included 3 Grade 3 SAEs (pectus excavatum, epiphyseal fracture and suicide ideation) and 2 Grade 4 SAEs (depressed fractured skull and subdural hematoma in the same participant).

## Deaths

No deaths were reported in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster safety population as of the data cut-off date (03 November 2022).

## Serious Adverse Events from Dose 3 to 1 Month After Dose 3

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 3 SAEs were reported by 2 participants (one participant reported depression, one participant reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and were assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the vaccine.

## Serious Adverse Events from Dose 3 to the Data Cut-off Date

From Dose 3 to the data cutoff date (03 November 2022), 8 SAEs were reported by 6 participants, including 3 SAEs reported by 2 participants after the 1-month follow-up visit after Dose 3. These 5 SAEs were assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the study vaccine and are summarized below.

- A SAE of pectus excavatum of Grade 3 severity, 97 days following the booster dose. The participant underwent repair surgery with nuss bar placement and the SAE was considered recovered/resolved 67 days after the date of onset.
- A SAE of epiphyseal fracture/growth plate fracture of right elbow of Grade 3 severity, 71 days following the booster dose that recovered/resolved 64 days after the date of onset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- A SAE of suicide ideation of Grade 3 severity, 129 days following the booster dose that recovered/resolved 33 days after the date of onset.
- A participant reported 2 SAEs of traumatic left temporoparietal depressed skull fracture and traumatic subdural haematoma of Grade 4 severity, 110 days following the booster dose, resulting from an accident to the head that were recovering/resolving at the data cutoff date (03 November 2022).

## Safety-Related Participant Withdrawals

No participants in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster safety population were withdrawn due to AEs from Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (03 November 2022).

## Pregnancy

No pregnancies were reported in the Phase 2/3 BNT162b2 booster group from Dose 3 to the data cutoff date (03 November 2022).

## Assessor´s comment

Three events of severe pyrexia were reported. From Dose 3 and up to the cut-off date (=3 Nov 2022), SAEs were reported by 6 participants (depression/worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/suicidal attempt, pectus excavatum, elbow fracture and skull fracture), none of the events were considered related to vaccination. No subjects were withdrawn due to AEs.

No new safety concern was detected here.

## MAH Conclusion

In this report, safety data are evaluated from 825 participants 12 through 15 years of age with median follow-up of 9.5 months after Dose 3. The AE profile among adolescents reflects expected reactogenicity events, age-appropriate events consistent with the general population, with low incidence of severe events. The incidence of SAEs in adolescents was low. All SAEs, including all SAEs in the psychiatric disorders SOCs, were assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention. No participants were withdrawn from the study because of an AE. No deaths occurred in the adolescent group. Review of AEs and SAEs suggested no new patterns or new safety signals among adolescents which continues to support the safety of BNT162b2 administered as a booster dose to individuals 12 through 15 years of age.

## 7.3. Discussion

This report includes final data from the clinical study C4591001, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. Safety interim data to support a proposed update in section 4.8 in the SmPC for adolescents aged 12-15 years who had received one booster dose of BNT162b2 30µg has also been provided.

Study C4591001 is a Phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 years of age. The study was executed in the USA and consisted of 2 parts: Phase 1 to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s) in individuals 18 through 55 and 65 through 85 years of age; and Phase 2/3 as an expanded cohort and efficacy part in individuals ≥12 years of age.

## Phase 1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Phase 1 study, primary series of BNT162b1 (10, 20, 30, 100µg) and BNT162b2 (10, 20, 30 µg) was administered to subgroups including 24 adult subjects in each group (total n=195). Most of these subjects then received one booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), and an additional booster dose was administered to about half of the study population. Median follow-up time since first booster dose was 12-21 months in the different initial vaccine groups, and the median follow-up time after the additional booster dose was 5-6 months. From the first booster to one month after the first booster dose, most of the reported AEs were related to reactogenicity. The reported AEs after the administered booster doses in the Phase 1 study are in line with what has previously been observed for the primary series.

## Phase 2/3

The final disposition for all randomised subjects to the Phase 2/3 study C4591001 included a total of 46,406 subjects aged ≥12 years, of which 99.8% received the two doses included in the primary series of BNT162b2 30µg. Among the subjects who were originally randomised to placebo, 89-92% received two doses of BNT162b2 30µg. In total were 1,156 subjects withdrawn from the study, most of them due to lost to follow-up (n=543) or withdrawn by subject (n=397). The age ranged from 13-92 years, with a median age of 51 years. A total number of 23,406 participants in the Phase 2/3 study received a first booster dose, and 89% of them had completed the 6-month post-booster vaccination visit. Among the 22,581 subjects ≥16 years of age that received a booster vaccination, most of these vaccinations occurred 6-15 months after Dose 2. The median follow-up time after booster dose was 12.3 months.

From the first booster dose up to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, the frequency of any AEs was 17% (n=3,818) among the subjects ≥16 years of age, many of them were considered related to study vaccine (15% [n=3,377]) and most of them were reactogenicity events.

One severe event of angioedema which was considered related to the booster dose was reported. The event occurred one day after the booster dose and resolved after two days. Angioedema is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC at the frequency uncommon.

One subject reported one SAE of myocarditis 4 days after he received the booster dose. The event resolved within 101 days. Myocarditis is already listed in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8.

## Booster dose BA.1

BNT162b2-naïve adult subjects (n=330) received a dose of the variant vaccine BNT162b2SA (South Africa B.1.351). Among the BNT162b2-naïve subjects that received a dose of BNT162b2SA, the reported AES was mostly related to reactogenicity.

## Low dose booster dose BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg

According to protocol amendment 14 and 15, adult subjects that had already received the primary series of BNT162b2 30 µg were rerandomised to receive one low dose booster of BNT162b2 at 5 µg (n=79) or 10 µg (76). None of the subjects that received BNT162b2 5 µg reported fever. There was a tendency to lower reactogenicity with lower dose and lower reactogenicity in subjects aged &gt;55 years compared to subjects aged 18-54 years.

## Additional booster dose, protocol amendment 19

Among the subjects (N=467) that received a second booster dose of either BNT162b2 at 5 µg (n=33), 10 µg (n=38), 30 µg (n=182) or BNT162b2SA 30 µg (n=211), a higher frequency of any AEs was noted among the subjects that received 30 µg (7-9%) compared with those who received low dose i.e., 5 or 10 µg (0-3%). The most reported events were typical for reactogenicity.

## Subjects 12-15 years of age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Phase 2/3 study that included 825 subjects aged 12-15 years, the median age was 14 years. All subjects received the booster dose, six of them discontinued the study due to lost to follow-up. Withdrawal from study was reported among 176 subjects (21%), most common reason was 'other' (n=124). The study was executed in the USA and the distribution between gender were similar. The median follow-up time after first booster dose was 9.5 months and from Dose 2 18.1 months. The median time from Dose 2 to booster dose was 11.2 months (range 6.3-20.1 months).

After the booster dose up to one month after the vaccination, 18% of the subjects reported any AEs. Most of these AEs were reactogenicity events (general disorders and administration site conditions and headache) and were considered related to vaccination. Two events of lymphadenopathy were reported, lymphadenopathy is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC. Two events of immediate AEs were reported: fatigue and injection site pain. Three events of severe pyrexia were reported. From Dose 3 and up to the cut-off date (=3 Nov 2022), SAEs were reported by 6 participants (depression/worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/suicidal attempt, pectus excavatum, elbow fracture and skull fracture), none of the events were considered related to vaccination. No subjects were withdrawn due to AEs.

The results presented for participants aged 12-15 years supports the proposed update of the SmPC section 4.8.

## 8. Risk management plan

The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 10.1 (DLP 18 June 2023, dated 03 August 2023) with this type II variation application.

## 8.2. Pharmacovigilance plan

## Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities

Part III.1 Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities was updated to clean-up routine activities and remove PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) 30 mcg presentation from vial differentiation/ potential medication error.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities

Study BNT162-01 was completed and final CSR was submitted on 07 August 2023 (Procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0187). Study BNT162-01 is an interventional EU safety study addressing Use in immunocompromised patients.

Study WI235284 was completed, and final CSR was submitted on 30 June 2023 (Procedure NEMEA/H/C/005735/II/0186/G). Study WI235284 is a US low-interventional effectiveness study addressing Vaccine effectiveness.

Study C4591001 was completed, and final CSR is submitted on 09 August 2023 (Procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0188/G, i.e., this procedure). Study C4591001 is a global interventional safety study addressing Use in frail patients with comorbidities (C4591001 subset) and long term safety data.

Consequently, these studies have been removed from part III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities and part III.3 Summary Table of Ongoing and Planned Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities (not reproduced in this AR).

## PRAC Rapporteur's Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan

The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

## 8.3. Risk minimisation measures

This section has been updated based on the changes made in PART III.

## PRAC Rapporteur's Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures

The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s).

## 8.4. Overall conclusion on the RMP

The MAH took the opportunity before the Opinion to update the version of the RMP to 11.0, and the sign off date to October 2023, as per the recommendations in the EMA guidance.

The changes to the RMP are acceptable.

## 9. Changes to the Product Information

As a result of this group of variations, section 4.8 of the SmPC are being updated to reflect data on booster dose administration into adolescent participants between 12 and 15 years of age.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.
