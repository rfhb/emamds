## 1. Introduction

On 19.12.2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Bexsero, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

No amendments to the Product Information are being submitted as part of this procedure.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Bexsero (rMenB+OMV NZ) vaccine was first registered in the European Union (EU), through the centralized procedure on 14 January 2013, and has received marketing authorization in twelve additional (non-EU) countries. The current therapeutic indication in the rMenB+OMV NZ Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) is for active immunization of individuals from 2 months of age and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by N meningitidis serogroup (or group) B.

The MAH stated that (V102\\_19) is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Bexsero (rMenB+OMV NZ) was used as a comparator in this study. Standard formulation of Bexsero was used in this study.

The licensed rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine (volume 0,5 ml) contains 50 µg of recombinant Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) fusion protein (also referred to as recombinant protein [rp]287-953), 50 µg ofrecombinant Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) protein (rp961c), 50 µg of recombinant factor H binding protein (fHbp) fusion protein (rp936-741), 25 µg of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain NZ98/254 containing PorA P 1.4 (the immunodominant antigen present in the OMV component), and 1,5 mg of aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant adsorbent.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the final report for study V102\\_19.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study V102\\_19: A Phase II, Randomized, Open-label, Multicenter Study to Assess the Immunogenicity and Safety of GSK Meningococcal MenABCWY Vaccine, and of GSK Meningococcal Group B and MenACWY Conjugate Vaccines Administered Concomitantly in the Same Arm or in 2 Different Arms, or Alone in Healthy Subjects 10 to 25 Years of Age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description

In study V 102\\_19, immune responses to an investigational Meningococcal MenABCWY vaccine have been assessed and compared with responses to 2 licensed vaccines, Menveo (Meningococcal group A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine, referred to as MenACWY throughout this document) and Bexsero (Meningococcal group B vaccine, referred to as rMenB+OMV NZ or rMenBOMV ) when administered concomitantly (in the same arm or in 2 different arms) or either vaccine alone.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether there is a potential immune interference (possible lymph nodes stress) when MenABCWY (the combination vaccine consisting of MenACWY lyophilized component and rMenB+OMV NZ liquid component) is administered to healthy adolescents and adults following a 2-dose vaccination schedule with doses administered 2 months apart. Bexsero and Menveo were used as comparators in this study.

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary Objective:

- To assess the immune response to 2 doses of MenABCWY, rMenB+OMV NZ, or rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm or in 2 different arms, and to a single dose of MenACWY at 1 month after the last vaccination

## Secondary Objectives:

- Immunogenicity objective: to assess the immune response to 2 doses of MenABCWY, rMenB+OMV NZ, or rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm or in 2 different arms at 1 month after the first vaccination
- Safety objective: to assess the safety and tolerability of 2 doses of MenABCWY, rMenB+OMV NZ, or rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY administered concomitantly in the same arm or in 2 different arms, and to a single dose of MenACWY

## Study design

Study V 102\\_19 was a Phase Il, open-label, randomised, controlled study conducted at 16 centres in the Czech Republic. A total of 500 subjects (10-25 years old at the time of first vaccination) were randomised (1:1:1:1:1) to 5 groups and received vaccinations as follows:

MenABCWY study group: 1 intramuscular (IM) dose of MenABCWY twice, 2 months apart.

rMenBOMV +ACWY\\_S study group: concomitantly received 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 IM dose of MenACWY in the same arm (approximately 2.5 cm apart) twice, 2 months apart.

rMenBOMV +ACWY\\_D study group: concomitantly received 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 IM dose of MenACWY in 2 different arms twice, 2 months apart.

rMenBOMV study group: 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ twice, 2 months apart.

MenACWY study group: 1 IM dose of MenACWY once.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population /Sample size

Approximately 500 subjects were planned to be randomly assigned at a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following 5 study groups, with stratification by age group within each group (10 to 17 years and 18 to 25 years):

## Treatments

- MenABCWY: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 18 to 25 years) were to receive 1 intramuscular (IM) dose of MenABCWY twice, 2 months apart.
- rMenBOMV +ACWY\\_S: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 18 to 25 years) were to concomitantly receive 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 IM dose of MenACWY in the same arm (approximately 2.5 cm apart) twice, 2 months apart.
- rMenBOMV +ACWY\\_D: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 18 to 25 years) were to concomitantly receive 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ and 1 IM dose of MenACWY in 2 different arms twice, 2 months apart.
- rMenBOMV : Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 18 to 25 years) were to receive 1 IM dose of rMenB+OMV NZ twice, 2 months apart.
- MenACWY: Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects aged 10 to 17 years and 50 subjects aged 18 to 25 years) were to receive 1 IM dose of MenACWY once.

After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to the first vaccination, subjects were allocated a study group and treatment number and blood samples were drawn. At Visit 1 (Day 1), subjects received their first dose of study vaccine(s).

The subjects were observed closely for at least 30 minutes following the administration of the vaccine(s), with appropriate medical treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded during this 30-minute period. The subjects/parent(s) or legally acceptable representative (LAR) were given a diary card and were trained on how to self-measure local solicited AEs and body temperature.

The second dose of study vaccine(s) was administered at Visit 3 (Day 61), with the exception of the MenACWY group who only received a single dose at Visit 1.

To test for immune response within the serogroups, blood samples were collected at Visit 1 (Day 1), Visit 2 (Day 31), and Visit 4 (Day 91), with the exception of the MenACWY group who only had blood drawn at Visit 1 and Visit 2.

Paper diary (pDiary, referred to as Subject Diary hereafter) reminder calls to the subject/subject's parent(s)/LAR(s) about completion of the Subject Diary were performed 3 and 5 days (±1 day) after each vaccination (i.e., Day 4 and Day 6 after the first vaccination and accordingly after the second vaccination). Safety follow-up calls were made to the subject by a healthcare professional to collect relevant safety information on Day 15 and Day 75.

Test vaccine, dose, mode of administration and lot number: All vaccines used were developed and manufactured by GSK. The study vaccines specific to this study were:

- MenABCWY obtained by extemporaneous mixing of lyophilized MenACWY powder in a vial with rMenB+OMV NZ supplied in a prefilled syringe
- rMenB+OMV NZ as suspension for injection in a prefilled syringe

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- MenACWY conjugate vaccine obtained by extemporaneous mixing of the lyophilized MenA powder component in a vial with the MenCWY liquid components.

The lot numbers used were DSR0141992 and DSR0141993.

Duration of study: For each subject (except for subjects randomized to the MenACWY study group), the duration of study was approximately 3 months, with vaccination at Day 1 and Day 61 followed by a 30-day follow-up period. For subjects randomized to the MenACWY study group, the duration of study was approximately 2 months; with vaccination at Day 1 followed by a 30-day follow-up period.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoints

- Immune responses against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B* test strains and N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, as measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA), 1 month after the last vaccination in all study groups
- hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) against each of the N. meningitidis serogroup B test strains and against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y
- hSBA GMTs against all of N. meningitidis serogroup B test strains (pooled). Percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) against each of the N. meningitidis serogroup B test strains and against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y
- Percentage of subjects with a 4-fold increase in hSBA titers against N. meningitidis serogroup B test strains and against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y

*Serogroup B strains tested are M14459 (factor H binding protein; fHbp), 96217 (Neisserial adhesin A; NadA), NZ98/254 (PorA), and M07-0241084 (Neisseria heparin binding antigen; NHBA); these were pooled to estimate the effect of immune interference due to stress to lymph nodes.

Note: A 4-fold rise is defined as:

- a. for individuals whose pre-vaccination titers were &lt; the limit of detection (LOD), the postvaccination titers had to be ≥4 -fold the LOD or ≥ the LLOQ, whichever was greater;
- b. for individuals whose prevaccination titers were ≥ the LOD and &lt; the LLOQ, the post -vaccination titers had to be at least 4 times the LLOQ; and
- c. for individuals whose prevaccination titers were ≥ the LLOQ, the post -vaccination titers had to be at least 4 times the pre-vaccination titer.

The ratios of GMTs between study groups were analyzed to evaluate effect of treatment as described below:

- a. Immune interference due to stress to lymph nodes (lymph-node effect) in rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S versus rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study groups, on the pooled B strains, and individually by serogroup A, C, W-135, Y, and B test strains.
- b. Other unknown interference in the MenABCWY versus rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S study groups, by serogroup A, C, W-135, Y, and B test strains.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- c. The difference in immune response compared to control groups in rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S versus rMenBOMV and MenACWY, rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D versus rMenBOMV and MenACWY, and MenABCWY versus rMenBOMV and MenACWY study groups, by serogroup A, C, W-135, Y, and B test strains.

## Safety Endpoints

- Solicited local and systemic AEs in all study groups: occurrence of solicited local and systemic AEs during the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination (Day 1 to Day 7 and Day 61 to Day 67 [Day 1 to Day 7 only for subjects in the MenACWY group])
- Unsolicited AEs in all study groups: occurrence of unsolicited AEs during the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 30 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination (Day 1 to Day 31 and Day 61 to Day 91 [Day 1 to Day 31 only for subjects in the MenACWY group])
- Serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), in all study groups from informed consent signature to Visit 4 (Day 91)

## Statistical Methods

## Primary immunogenicity endpoints (1 month after the last dose)

- hSBA geometric mean titer: As titer results were not normally distributed, summary statistics were calculated using log-transformed titer results. The anti-logarithm of the summary statistics was presented. Unadjusted summaries included the number of subjects with non-missing titer results, GMT, geometric standard deviation (GSD), 80% confidence interval (CI) for GMT, minimum, and maximum. Adjusted summaries were calculated at baseline using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model (which included study group and center as fixed effects), and at Analysis Visit (AVISIT) 4 (1 month after last dose) using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model (which included study group, center, and strain [only the ANCOVA model fitted to pooled serogroup B test strains] as fixed effects, and baseline log-transformed titer with centering at zero as continuous covariate). Both the ANOVA and ANCOVA models were fitted to individual serogroups A, C, W-135, Y and the individual serogroup B test strains, as well to the pooled serogroup B test strains only. The adjusted GMT, standard error (SE), and 80% CI from the ANOVA and ANCOVA models were presented.
- hSBA geometric mean ratios: The GMR was summarized by study group atAVISIT 4 for each serogroup (A, C, W-135, Y) and the 4 individual serogroup B test strains. Unadjusted summaries included the number of subjects with non-missing titer results at AVISIT 4, GMR (at AVISIT 4 only), GSD of the difference in log- transformed titer results at AVISIT 4 and baseline, 80% CI for GMR, minimum, and maximum. Adjusted summaries at baseline were calculated using an ANOVA model, and at AVISIT 4 using an ANCOVA model. The adjusted GMT, SE, and 80% CI from the ANOVA and ANCOVA models were presented. Ratio was calculated by dividing antibody titer from AVISIT4 (1 month after last dose) with baseline antibody titer.
- Percentage of subjects with titers above LLOQ and percentage of subjects with a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer: The percentage of subjects with titers above the LLOQ and percentage of subjects with a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer along with the associated 2-sided 80% Clopper-Pearson CIs were computed by study group at baseline and AVISIT 4. In addition, differences in percentages of subjects with titers above the LLOQ and percentage of subjects with a 4 -fold increase in hSBA titer and their 2-sided 80% CIs between selected study groups were calculated using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen.

Secondary immunogenicity endpoints (1 month after the last dose): The analyses described above for the respective primary endpoints was repeated using AVISIT 2 (1 months from primary dose) instead of AVISIT 4. The MenACWY study group was not included in the secondary analyses as subjects in the MenACWY group received single dose of vaccine and analyzed as primary immunogenicity endpoints.

Safety: All safety analyses were run descriptively.

## Efficacy results

## Immunogenicity

Primary Objectives (one month after the last vaccination)

- One month after the last vaccination, the GMTs against pooled serogroup B strains, serogroup B test strain M14459 and strain 96217, and serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y were similar between the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S and rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study groups. The GMTs against serogroup B test strain NZ98/254 and strain M07-0241084 were lower for the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S study group compared with the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study group.

## Secondary Objectives (one month after the first vaccination)

- One month after the first vaccination, the GMTs against pooled serogroup B strains; serogroup B test strains M14459, 96217, NZ98/254, and M07-0241084; and serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y were similar between the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S and rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study groups.
- One month after the first vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ ag ainst serogroup B test strains M14459, 96217, NZ98/254, and M07-0241084; and serogroups A, C, and, W-135 were similar between the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S and rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study groups. The percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ against serogroup Y were lower in the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S study group compared with the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study group.

.

- One month after the first vaccination, the percentages of subjects with a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer against serogroup B test strains M14459, 96217, NZ98/254, and M07-0241084; and serogroups C, W-135, and Y were similar between the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study groups. The percentages of subjects with a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer against serogroup A were lower in the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S study group compared with the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D study group.

## Safety results

Overall, the percentages of subjects with local and systemic reactions were similar in the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S, rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D, and rMenBOMV study groups and were lower in the MenACWY study groups compared with other study groups.

Within 1 to 7 days of any study vaccination, the most common local solicited reaction was pain which was reported in subjects after the first vaccination and in subjects after the second vaccination. A total of subjects after the first vaccination and subjects after the second vaccination reported severe pain.

The percentages of subjects with unsolicited AEs were similar across the study groups (14.7% to 26.0%). The most commonly reported AE after any vaccination were injection site pain (up to 5.3%) followed by upper respiratory tract infection (up to 5%) and injection site induration (up to 4.8%).

A total of 14 (14.0%), 17 (16.3%), 14 (14.0%), 13 (13.8%), and 6 (5.9%) subjects had at least one unsolicited medically attended AEs in rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S, rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D, rMenBOMV, and MenACWY study groups, respectively.

No deaths were reported in this study. A total of 2 (1.9%), 1 (1.0%), and 2 (2.1%) subjects had at least one SAEs post-vaccination at any visit in the rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_S (concussion in both the subjects considered not related to study vaccines), rMenBOMV+ACWY\\_D (tibia fracture considered not related to study vaccines), and rMenBOMV study groups (lower limb fracture in 1 subject considered not related to study vaccines and syncope in 1 subject considered related to study vaccines), respectively.

No subjects were withdrawn from the study or study vaccine due to AEs. None of the subjects reported an AESI (arthritis) in the study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether there is a potential immune interference (possible lymph nodes stress) when new investigational vaccine MenABCWY (the combination vaccine consisting of MenACWY (Menveo) lyophilized component and rMenB+OMV NZ (Bexsero) liquid component) is administered to healthy adolescents and adults following a 2-dose vaccination schedule with doses administered 2 months apart. Bexsero and Menveo were used as comparators in this study.

The results showed that the highest antibody response against MenB serotypes was archived when rMenB+OMV NZ (Bexsero) was administered alone. Also, if Bexsero and Menveo were administered at the same time, but on different arms, the antibody levels against MenB was comparable as if Bexsero was administered alone.

The safety data did not add any new information about Bexsero safety profile. Interestingly, fever after Bexsero administration was rare (1%) whereas in investigational product it reached to 6 % of recipients to report appearance of fever. The study population was relatively small (Subjects at age 10-17; N= 147) and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low. No new safety or efficacy concern is raised from this study.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concern for Bexsero. This P46 procedure is considered fulfilled.

## PAM Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
