## 1. Introduction

On July 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Koselugo, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s)

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study D1346C00011 - A Phase 1 Open Label Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics  and  Clinical  Efficacy  of  Selumetinib  (a  Selective  Mitogen  Activated  Protein  Kinase Kinase [MEK] 1 Inhibitor) in Chinese Paediatric and Adult Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN) a standalone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

In Study D1346C00011 (Study 11), selumetinib was taken orally in a 10 mg (white) or 25 mg (blue) capsule.

Batch numbers for selumetinib 10 mg: 3164167R, 3187749R

Batch numbers for selumetinib 25 mg: 3174108R, 3185367R

As recommended in the SmPC, multiple doses of selumetinib were administered at 25 mg/m 2  BID (every 12 hours) continuously for 28-day cycles (no rest periods between cycles). The dosage was adjusted for changes in Body Surface Area (BSA) and doses were to be rounded to the nearest 5 to 10 mg using a dosing nomogram ( Table 1 ).

Table 1. Dosing Nomogram for the Selumetinib PK Study

| 25 mg/m²   | BSA (m²)      |   0.55 to 0.69 |   0.7 to 0.89 |   0.9 to 1.09 |   1.1 to 1.29 |   1.3 to 1.49 |   1.5 to 1.69 |   1.7 to 1.89 |   21.9 |

## Assessor's comment:

The  drug  products  (10  and  25  mg  capsules)  used  in Study  11 supporting  clinical  data  in  Chinese paediatric and adult patients in this submission are already approved and deemed suitable for the claimed dosing scheme. No complementary biopharmaceutical investigation is needed.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

In Europe, selumetinib is approved (conditional market authorisation) under the brand name of Koselugo. Two strengths of hard capsules, 10 and 25 mg are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Selumetinib is actually used as monotherapy for the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) aged 3 years and above.

The recommended dose of selumetinib is 25 mg/m 2  individualised based on body surface area (BSA) and taken orally twice daily (BID). Dosing is rounded to the nearest achievable 5 mg or 10 mg dose (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg for BSA ≥ 1.9 m 2 ). Selumetinib is not recommended in patients with a BSA &lt; 0.55 m 2 .

The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of selumetinib were sufficiently characterized in the initial MAA. Please refer to section 5.2 of the current SmPC.

In the current PAM procedure EMEA/H/C/5244/P46, the Applicant submitted the results of Study 11 : a Phase 1 Open Label Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Efficacy of Selumetinib in Chinese Paediatric and Adult Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN)'. No change in PK properties is claimed and no change to the product information is proposed within the current PAM submission.

## 2.3.2. Clinical Pharmacology

## 2.3.2.1. Methods

## Bioanalysis

In study 11 ,  selumetinib  and  its  active  metabolite  N-desmethyl selumetinib in human plasma were quantified in human plasma, however the bioanalytical report was not provided.

## Study D1346C0011

This was an open label, single arm Phase 1 study with two independent cohorts to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and clinical efficacy of selumetinib in Chinese paediatric and adult patients with NF1 and inoperable plexiform NF.

Approximately 16 paediatric and adult patients were planned to be enrolled.

Patients received a single oral dose of selumetinib 25 mg/m2 at Cycle 0 day 1. During the following two days wash-out period, intensive PK samples were collected before and after this first single dose until Cycle 1 Day 1.

At Cycle 1 Day 1, patients received multiple dose of selumetinib 25 mg/m2 BID (Dose capped at 50 mg for BSA over 1.9) on a continuous schedule (28 days per cycle). Intensive PK sampling was performed at Cycle 1 Day 8 for the assessment of AUC12h at steady-state.

PK samples consisted at Cycle 1 Day 0 of pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 30 h post dose and at Cycle 1 Day 8 of pre-dose, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 12h post dose.

Standard Plasma PK parameters after single (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUC, AUC0-12h, AUCt) and multiple dose (Cmaxss,  AUC0-12h,ss , and Rac) for selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib were calculated using standard non- compartmental (model-independent) analysis methods.

PK results were retrieved from a CSR report with a cut-off date of 30 January 2022 .

## 2.3.2.2. Results

Overall 16 children aged 4 to 16 years old (median 11 years), with 9/7 male/female and 16 adults aged 18 to 51 years (median 24.5 years) with 9/7 male/female were enrolled.

## Paediatric single dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Geometric mean selumetinib and N desmethyl selumetinib plasma concentration-time profiles following single oral administration of 25 mg/m 2  selumetinib are shown in Figure 1 and associated PK parameter estimates in Table 2 .

## Semi-Logarithmic Scale

<!-- image -->

Following  single  oral  dose  of  selumetinib  25  mg/m 2   in  paediatric  Chinese  patients,  absorption  of selumetinib was generally rapid with a median Tmax of 1.5h. For selumetinib, geometric mean Cmax was 871 ng/mL, AUC0-12h 2015 ng.h/mL and arithmetic half-life of 7.2 h. For N desmethyl selumetinib, geometric mean Cmax was 64 ng/mL, AUC0-12h 175 ng.h/mL and arithmetic half-life of 7.8 h.

Main inclusion criteria

## Age

Paediatric cohort : Chinese patients ≥3 years and &lt;18 years of age with a BSA ≥0.55 m2 at the time of study enrolment who were able to swallow whole capsules. There must be a minimum of 6 patients each in the 3 to 11 and 12 to 17 years age groups at the time of enrolment.

Adult cohort : Chinese patients ≥18 years of age at the time of study enrolment who were able to swallow whole capsules

## Disease diagnosis

A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may involve multiple fascicles and branches. A histologic confirmation of the tumour was not necessary in the presence  of  consistent  clinical  and  radiographic  findings,  but  was  to  be  considered  if  malignant degeneration  of  a  PN  was  clinically  suspected.  Inoperable  PN  is  defined  as  PN  that  cannot  be completely surgically removed without a risk of substantial morbidity due to encasement of, or close proximity to, vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN.

- Patients' NF1 and inoperable PN required treatment due to actual symptoms or had the potential to develop significant clinical complications, as judged by the investigator, including but not limited to head and neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, paraspinal lesions that could cause myelopathy, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major deformity (e.g. orbital lesions) or were significantly disfiguring,  lesions  of  the  extremity  that  cause  limb  hypertrophy  or loss  of  function,  and  painful lesions.
- Patients must have at least one measurable typical or nodular PN, defined as a lesion of at least 3 cm  measured  in  one  dimension,  which  could  be  seen  on  at  least  3  imaging  slices  and  had  a reasonably well-defined contour. Patients who have undergone surgery for resection of a PN were eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and was measurable. The target PN was defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which had to be amenable to volumetric MRI analysis and classified as either typical or nodular (ie must not be solitary nodular).
- Performance status: Patients &gt;16 years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level of ≥70, and children ≤16 years old must have a Lansky performance of ≥70.
- Adequate haematological function defined as absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5×109/L, haemoglobin ≥9g/dL, and platelet count ≥100×109/L.
- Adequate  organ  function  defined  as  follows:  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2×upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN except in the case of patients with documented Gilbert's disease (≤2.5×ULN). Estimated creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/minute.

## Main exclusion criteria

- Evidence of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour.
- Prior malignancy or other cancer requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
- A life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion,  could  compromise  the  patient's  safety,  interfere  with  the  absorption  or  metabolism  of selumetinib, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.
- Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease as defined by the following:
- o Known inherited coronary disease;
- o Blood pressure (BP) &gt; the 95th percentile for age, height, and genderFor paediatric patients Uncontrolled hypertension (at screening: BP ≥150/95 despite optimal therapy).
- o Acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment
- o Uncontrolled angina
- o Symptomatic heart failure New York Heart Association Class II to IV,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Prior or current cardiomyopathy including but not limited to the following:
- o Known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- o Known arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
- o Previous moderate or severe impairment of LVEF &lt;45% on echocardiogram or equivalent on multigated acquisition (MUGA) even if full recovery has occurred.
- o Baseline LVEF below the LLN or &lt;55%
- o Severe valvular heart disease;
- o Current or history of atrial fibrillation ;
- o QT interval corrected by Fridericia's method (QTcF) &gt;450 ms or other factors that increased the risk of QT prolongation.
- Known history of human immunodeficiency virus, serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, or any uncontrolled active systemic infection
- Patients with ophthalmological findings/conditions.
- Have had prior treatment with a MEK, Ras or Raf inhibitor (including, but not limited to vemurafenib).
- Supplementation  with  vitamin  E  greater  than  100%  of  the  daily  recommended  dose.  Any multivitamin containing vitamin E must be stopped prior to initiation of selumetinib.
- Receiving  herbal  supplements  or  medications  known  to  be  strong  inhibitors  or  inducers  of  the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes unless such products can be safely discontinued at least 14 days before the first dose of study medication.

## Sample size

The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of selumetinib. Per the Chinese Phase I PK guideline, at least 8 to 12 patients per cohort were required. To allow for dropouts and nonevaluable cases, 16 patients in each cohort were planned to be enrolled to obtain adequate PK and safety data. There must be a minimum of 6 patients each in the 3 to 11 and 12 to 17 years age groups at the time of enrolment.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Not applicable.

## Statistical Methods

There is no formal hypothesis testing on this study.

Safety data were presented using descriptive statistics by cohort. Evaluations of safety included, but were not limited to, adverse events (AEs), clinical safety laboratory assessments, physical examination, vital signs, bone growth (paediatric cohort only), and Tanner stages (paediatric cohort only).

Pharmacokinetic data were listed and summarised by cohort and timepoint. PK parameters included but were not limited to AUC, Cmax, and tmax. Individual and geometric mean (Gmean) selumetinib and Ndesmethyl selumetinib plasma concentrations were presented graphically as appropriate.

Efficacy  endpoints,  including  best  overall  response  (BOR),  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  target  PN volume change, time to response (TOR), duration of response (DoR), time to progression (TTP), and progression free survival (PFS), were presented based on investigator and independent central review (ICR) assessment per Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) criteria.

Clinical outcome assessments (COAs) were evaluated and presented for pain, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical functioning, patients' global impression of symptom severity (PGIS), and patient's global impression of change (PGIC). The primary analysis of the COAs was based on descriptive statistics. In  addition,  change  from  baseline  was  analysed  using  a  mixed  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM) approach.

## Recruitment

First patient enrolled: 16 December 2020

Last patient last visit: 15 August 2023

## ▪ Paediatric cohort

A total of 20 paediatric patients (informed consent received) were enrolled in the paediatric cohort, 16 of whom received at least one dose of selumetinib and were included in the Safety Analysis Set. As of this DCO (15 August 2023), 15 patients were still receiving treatment with selumetinib. One patient had discontinued treatment early due to PD; all patients had terminated and completed the study.

## ▪ Adult cohort

A total of 17 adult patients (informed consent received) were enrolled in the adult cohort, 16 of whom received at least one dose of selumetinib and were included in the Safety Analysis Set.

As  of  this  DCO  (15  August  2023),  13  patients  were  still  receiving  treatment  with  selumetinib;  2 discontinued  treatment  because  of  'patient  decision'  and  one  discontinued  treatment  due  to  'other' reasons. All patients had terminated the study; 13 patients had completed the study; 2 patients had withdrawn, and one terminated the study due to 'other' reasons.

## Baseline data

## ▪ Paediatric cohort

Demographic characteristics

The median age was 11.0 years old, nine (56.3%) patients were male, Median values for height, weight, and BSA were 134.60 cm, 28.00kg, and 1.095 m2 (range 0.66 to 1.94 m2)

## Target PN Volume Changes

All 16 patients had completed at least 1 post-baseline tumour assessment by interim DCO and were included in the summary of change in target PN volume from baseline (see Table 11) and had the chance to complete the Cycle 24 assessment.

Based on investigator assessment, by the end of Cycle 24, the mean (SDev) percentage change in target PN volume from baseline was -41.38% (13.53%).

Based on ICR assessment, by the end of Cycle 24, the mean (SDev) percentage change in target PN volume from baseline was -27.15% (18.3%).

A negative change denotes a reduction in PN volume.

Only assessments closest to the protocol scheduled visit day are selected for this summary, therefore unscheduled visits may be excluded. n is the number of patients with a recorded size at baseline and given timepoint.

Max = Maximum; Min = Minimum; N = Number of patients in cohort; PN = Plexiform Neurofibromas; SD = Standard deviation

## Duration of response and time to response

Based on investigator assessment, 13 patients reached cPR, the median TTR was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.55, 7.39) months, and the median DoR was not reached.

As of this DCO, 11 patients were still in response at the DCO. The shortest DoR was 8.7 months, and the longest DoR was 20.1 months. 3 patients with cPR had PD based on the REiNS Criteria or death.

Based on ICR assessment, 10 patients reached cPR, the median TTR was 8.7 (95% CI: 3.55, 9.30) months, and the median DoR was not reached. As of this DCO, 8 patients were still in response. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

shortest DoR was 5.3 months, and the longest DoR was 23.7 month. 2 patients with cPR had PD based on the REiNS Criteria or death.

## Progression-free survival

Based on investigator assessment, 5 patients (31.3%) had PD based on the REiNS Criteria, and the median PFS was not reached. The median follow-up time was 22.01 months (range: 11.1 to 27.4). The investigator-assessed PFS rate at 24 cycles was 75.0% (95% CI: 46.34, 89.80).

Based on ICR assessment, 6 patients (37.5%) had PD documented based on the REiNS Criteria, the median PFS was not reached. The median (range) follow-up time was 22.00 (3.7-27.4) months. The ICR-assessed PFS rate at 24 cycles was 62.5% (95% CI: 34.86, 81.09).

## Time to progression

As of this DCO, based on investigator assessment or ICR assessment, the median TTP was not reached

## Pain assessment

The effect of selumetinib on pain was assessed through (1) self-evaluation of the worst pain intensity (Faces Pain Scale) that the patient had during the past week and (2) how pain interfered with daily functioning (PII), which was rated by the patient and by the parent. In addition, patients recorded the pain medication that was used in the 1 week prior to randomisation in a pain medication survey. During study treatment, pain medication/analgesia was recorded within concomitant medications.

Day

<!-- image -->

Children aged 4 to 17 years at enrolment completed Faces Pain Scale. A higher score represents more pain, ie, a decrease in score is favourable. Error bars represent 95% CIs for each respective adjusted mean change from baseline. The analysis was performed using a MMRM analysis of change from baseline for all post-baseline visits, with baseline score in the model as a covariate and scheduled visit as an explanatory variable.

Only visits with more than 10 patients are included.

Baseline was defined as the last result obtained prior to the start of study treatment

Children from 8 to 17 years of age completed self-reported PII. Parents or the legal guardian of children from 5 to 17 years of age completed the parent proxy PII. A higher score represents more interferences on daily activities. Error bars represent 95% CIs for each respective adjusted mean change from baseline.

The analysis was performed using a MMRM analysis of change from baseline for all post-baseline visits, with baseline score in the model as a covariate and scheduled visit as an explanatory variable.

Only visits  with  more  than  10  patients  are  included.  Baseline  was  defined  as  the  last  result  obtained  prior  to  the  start  of  study treatment.

Physical functioning assessment

The PROMIS consists of 8 items using a 5-point Likert scale format (ie, 1 = unable to do, 5 = can do without any difficulty), with a full score of 40.

The analysis was performed using a MMRM of change from baseline for all post-baseline visits, with baseline score in the model as a covariate and scheduled visit as an explanatory variable. Only visits with more than 10 patients were include

## HRQoL Assessment

PedsQL consists of 4 subscales, ie, physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. For PedsQL, 0 = almost always a problem and 100 = never a problem, where higher scores indicate better HRQoL. A Total Scale Score is the average across all items answered across all the 4 scales

The paediatric cohort completed PedsQL. Patients aged 5 to 17 years completed the self-report questionnaire. The parent-report questionnaire was to be completed for all age groups. A higher score indicates better QoL, so an increase in score is favourable. Error bars represent 95% CIs for each respective adjusted mean change from baseline.

Baseline was defined as the last result obtained prior to the start of study treatment. The analysis was performed using a MMRM analysis of change from baseline for all post-baseline visits, with baseline score in the model as a covariate and scheduled visit as an explanatory variable. Only visits with more than 10 patients are included.

## Adult cohort

Objective Response Rate was provided but not shown here.

## Target PN Volume Changes

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analysis of change in target PN volume only included the data from scheduled visits completed within the time window specified in the protocol. In general, all 16 patients had at least one post-baseline assessment and had the chance to complete the Cycle 24 assessment.

## TTR and DoR

TTR and DoR analysis were included but not shown here.

## Progression-free Survival

As of this DCO, based on investigator assessment, no patient had PD, and the median PFS was not reached. The investigator-assessed PFS rate at 24 cycles was 100%.

## Time to Progression

As of this DCO, based on investigator assessment or ICR assessment, the median TTP was not reached.

## Pain Assessment

The effect of selumetinib on pain was assessed through (1) self-evaluation of pain intensity (NRS-11) of the target PN selected by the physician, overall tumour pain, and overall pain, and (2) self-evaluation of the extent to which the pain interfered with daily functioning (PII). In addition, patients recorded the pain medication that was used in the one week prior to randomisation in a pain medication survey. During study treatment, pain medication was recorded within concomitant medications.

## Physical Functioning Assessment

Physical function in the adult cohort was measured by the PROMIS short form; the overall compliance rate of the assessment was 96.8%.

## HRQoL Assessment

The effect of selumetinib on HRQoL was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PlexiQoL for the adult cohort.

## Safety results

## ▪ Paediatric cohort

At this DCO (15 August 2023), the median (min, maximum [max]) actual treatment duration was 22.80 (18.5, 30.8) months and the median total treatment duration was 23.26 (18.5, 30.8) months.

## All 16 patients had at least one AE:

Most reported AEs were Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or 2. There were 6 AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 that were reported in 3 (18.8%) patients. There were 3 (18.8%) patients with 5 AEs that were classed as serious adverse events (SAEs). All were assessed as not related to treatment. There were no CTCAE Grade 4 or 5 AEs:

- A  patient who had D-j ureteral catheterisation and resection of retroperitoneal plexus neurofibroma on 19 December 2017, reported CTCAE Grade 3 sepsis which resulted in a dose interruption after 137 days of selumetinib treatment, and reported another event of CTCAE Grade 3 sepsis together with CTCAE Grade 3 urinary  tract  infection  after  181  days  of  treatment.  None  of  the  3  SAEs  were  assessed  as treatment related. The investigator considered that the sepsis and urinary tract infection could be related to long-term D-j ureteral catheterisation. All 3 events were resolved.

-  A    patient  had  CTCAE  Grade  3  scoliosis  (verbatim:  scoliosis  worsened)  reported  after  303  days  of selumetinib treatment, reported as serious after 693 days of treatment. The AE was not assessed as treatment related and the dose was not changed. The AE had not resolved by the time of the DCO.

- A  patient had CTCAE Grade 3 multiple injuries (after being hit, kicked, twisted, bitten, or scratched by someone) reported after 385 days of selumetinib treatment. The AE was not assessed as treatment related and the dose was not changed. The event was resolved.

No deaths were reported.

No patients experienced AEs which led to study treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. A total of 10 (62.5%) patients experienced AEs which led to dose interruption.

Case of rhabdomyolysis (not currently listed under the section 4.8 of Koselugo SmPC):  A patient had a CTCAE Grade 1 TRAE of corneal exfoliation. The reported text from the investigator was 'The subnasal corneal epithelium of the right eye was lightly desquamated'. The event started on Day 450 and resolved after 79 days, with treatment given. There was no change to planned study treatment. The same patient had a CTCAE Grade 2 TRAE of rhabdomyolysis. The AE started on Day 450 and resolved after 10 days, with no treatment given. There was no change to planned study treatment. The patient had their Cycle 16 visit on Day 450 and CK was 638 U/L (reference range 26 to 192), approximately 3 times the upper limit of normal. This fell at Cycle 20 (193 U/L) and Cycle 24 (196 U/L). According to data on file, the patient had both lower limbs pain, tenderness, mild lower limbs oedema, symptoms of frequent urination, urgency,  no  dysuria,  and  normal  urine  colour.  Routine  urine  examination  revealed  haematuria,  and routine urine examination returned to normal the next day. The investigator considered that the AE was possible rhabdomyolysis.

No trends of unexpected clinically significant changes were observed in clinical laboratory evaluation, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG)/ echocardiogram (ECHO), and Tanner stages.

No death was reported.

## ▪ Adult cohort

At the DCO, the median (min, max) actual treatment duration was 23.69 (7.5, 30.9) months and the median total treatment duration was 25.08 (8.6, 31.3) months.

All  16  patients  had  at  least  one  AE.  The  most  common  AEs  (&gt;  40%)  were  dermatitis  acneiform, hyperphosphatemia, AST increased, conjunctivitis, and hyperuricaemia, most of which were known ADRs for selumetinib.

All 16 patients reported at least one TRAE. Most reported AEs were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 were reported in 4 (25.0%) patients (one event in each patient); 2 were considered possibly related to treatment.

Two (12.5%) patients reported 2 SAEs; both were considered unrelated to treatment. There were no CTCAE Grade 4 or 5 AEs. No deaths were reported. No patients experienced AEs that led to study treatment discontinuation. 7 (43.8%) patients experienced AEs that led to dose interruption. One (6.3%) patient reported an AE of paronychia of CTCAE Grade 3 which was assessed to be treatment related and led to permanent dose reduction. A total of 13 patients (81.3%) reported AESIs, all of which were known ADRs of selumetinib. No trends of unexpected clinically significant changes were observed in clinical laboratory evaluation, vital signs, ECG, and ECHO.

No unexpected significant changes were observed in clinical laboratory evaluation, vital signs, ECG and ECHO.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  Applicant  provided  results  of  a  Phase  1  Open  Label  Study  that  aimed  to  assess  the  Safety, Pharmacokinetics  and  Clinical  Efficacy  of  Selumetinib  in  Chinese  Paediatric  and  Adult  Patients  with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN).

A total of 16 patients aged 4 to 16 years were treated in the paediatric cohort and 16 patients in the adult cohort. Patients received oral doses of selumetinib 25 mg/m2 BID continuously for 28-day until progressive  disease  (PD)  based  on  the  investigator's  decision  or  unacceptable  drug-related  toxicity, whichever occurred first.

There was no primary efficacy endpoint for this study. The secondary objectives were objective response rate (ORR), target PN volume change, time to response (TTR), duration of response (DoR), time to progression (TTP), and progression-free survival (PFS), based on investigator and independent central review  (ICR)  assessment  per  the  Response  Evaluation  in  Neurofibromatosis  and  Schwannomatosis (REiNS)  criteria.  Clinical  outcomes  included,  effect  of  selumetinib  on  pain,  physical  functioning,  and quality of life.

## Paediatric cohort:

The observed Objective Response Rate (ORR) on the target tumour volume, was 81.3% (95% IC 54.5%, 96%) based on investigator assessment and62.5% (95% IC 35.4.0%, 84.8%) based on ICR assessment. No patients had a complete response. The median TTR was 3.7 (95% CI: 3.55, 7.39) months based on investigator assessment, and 8.7 (95% CI: 3.55, 9.30) months based on ICR assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median DoR, PFS, and TTP were not reached.

A trend over improvement in pain and physical functional assessment was observed.

Adult cohort:

No patients had a complete response. The median DoR, PFS, and TTP were not reached. A trend over improvement in pain and physical functional assessment was observed.

Overall, the efficacy results in the paediatric cohort are coherent with those observed in SPRINT study during the initial marketing authorisation assessment of Koselugo. However, the interpretability of these results is limited due to the small number of patients included and the open-label design of the study.

Safety outcomes from both cohorts paediatric and adults have been displayed in this AR in order to capture any new signal or trend.

On a safety aspect the provided data are consistent with the safety profile of selumetinib as displayed under the section 4.4 and 4.8 of Koselugo SmPC and no new safety issues have been identified.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

From a clinical Pharmacology perspective, the PK of selumetinib and its metabolite was characterized in a cohort of 16 paediatric and 16 adult Chinese patients and results from this study are in line with those reported in Koselugo Section 5.2, Ethnicity.

Based on the data provided by the MAH regarding the results of D1346C00011 study, no new safety or efficacy  concerns  have  been  identified  as  compared  to  previous  studies  and  experiences  in  patients treated with Koselugo.
