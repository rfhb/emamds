## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Problem statement

This is an application for Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International was submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Reference is made to Xeplion (EMEA/H/C/002105) including all indications, pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations, authorised and granted in the EU. The applicant refers to module 2-5 of Xeplion MA. This informed consent application is a complete true duplicate of Xeplion including the same indication, all pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations as approved for Xeplion.

The quality, nonclinical, and clinical data for Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International are identical to Xeplion. No new quality, nonclinical or clinical data has been submitted and no new data is needed.

Paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone) is the major metabolite of risperidone, which is approved for treatment of schizophrenia since 1994. Paliperidone shares the characteristic serotonin (5HT2A) and dopamine (D2) antagonism and receptor binding profile of its parent risperidone. It binds also to a1-adrenergic receptors, and, with lower affinity, to H1-histaminergic and a2-adrenergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of paliperidone.

The goals of treatment of schizophrenia are to rapidly eliminate symptoms, reduce the number of relapses, and reduce the severity of the illness. Improving the level of social function and relationships are also important.

Antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment of schizophrenia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Quality aspects

Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International  is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC, only module 1 is provided and module 3 of the duplicate dossier cross-refers to the upto-date module 3 of the original dossier (Xeplion), which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures. The declaration submitted by the Applicant states that Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International possesses the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substances and same pharmaceutical form as Xeplion. No new quality data have been submitted.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Reference is made to the non-clinical documentation included in the Xeplion (EMEA/H/C/002105) market authorisation application.

Therefore, the non-clinical data in support of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International MAA are identical to that in the Xeplion dossier, which have been assessed and authorised by the CHMP. No additional non-clinical data have been submitted which is acceptable.

## 2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment for paliperidone palmitate dated 2009 has been submitted. It is concluded that paliperidone palmitate is not expected to pose any risk to the environment when used as stated in the SmPC. However, there are several deficiencies identified   and   the CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed:

1. The applicant is kindly asked to provide suitable information on an experimentally derived noctanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) for the active substance paliperidone in order to assess its PBT potential. In accordance with the Q&amp;A EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 the log Kow should be determined experimentally. Studies performed in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines are preferred. In case Paliperidone has a log Kow &gt;4.5 it should be assessed in a step-wise procedure for persistence (OECD 308), bioaccumulation (OECD 305) and toxicity.
2. The calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in the ERA Phase I provided by the applicant for paliperidone is based on market forecast assumption data. This is not acceptable (see Q 4 of the Q&amp;A document EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010).
3. The applicant submitted a study report on Adsorption/Desorption of Paliperidone according to Guideline OECD 106 resulting in values on Koc in soil &gt; 10000 L/kg. Based on the results on Koc in soil the trigger for a terrestrial environmental fate and effect analysis is exceeded and the respective terrestrial environmental fate and effect analysis according to the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr.2 1 *) has to be provided. However, there is still the possibility to provide a study on adsorption of the active ingredient to sewage sludge since this is the recommended trigger for a terrestrial assessment.
4. Resulting from the submitted test on Ready Biodegradability (OECD 301) paliperidone is considered to be not readily biodegradable. Therefore, the applicant is asked to provide a test on Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment systems (OECD 308). If the results from the water

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sediment study (OECD 308) demonstrate significant shifting of paliperidone to sediment effects on sediment dwelling organisms should be investigated.

The required studies can be submitted as post-marketing measure.

This was considered as resolved as a respective letter of agreement was provided by the company, including an anticipated and agreed time schedule

## 2.3.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The CHMP considers the non-clinical aspects of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International to meet the requirements to support this application.

A Letter of Recommendation has been received by the company and agreed in relation to the ERA-related issues raised during the procedure.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Reference is made to Xeplion (EMEA/H/C/002105) including all indications, pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations, authorised and granted in the EU.

Since this application is an informed consent of the Xeplion application, the clinical data in support of the Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Xeplion dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

Therefore, no additional clinical data have been submitted and reference has been made to Module 5 data for Xeplion which is acceptable.

## 2.4.1. Conclusions on the clinical aspects

The CHMP considers the clinical aspects of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International to meet the requirements to support this application.

## 2.5. Risk Management Plan

## Safety concerns

This informed consent application is a complete true duplicate of Xeplion including the same indication, all pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations as approved for Xeplion.

The Applicant has submitted a common RMP for the paliperidone products which was updated as part of the informed consent procedure. All relevant sections and annexes of this RMP have been completed by the addition of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International.

## Conclusion

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 9.1 is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

The PSUR frequency will be amended in line with the authorised paliperidone products.

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

As part of this application, the Applicant requested the CHMP agreement to amend the PSUR reporting frequency for the new Informed Consent licence from 6-monthly to annually, with a DLP of 30 June of the reporting year.

It was considered acceptable to apply for an amendment of the PSUR reporting frequency for the new Informed Consent licence to file, through a Type IAIN C.I.10 variation.

## 2.7. Product information

The SmPC, labelling text and Package Leaflet submitted by the applicant are identical to Xeplion.

Since Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is a duplicate of Xeplion, the SmPC should be updated (as appropriate) in relation to the finalization of any ongoing procedures for Xeplion before or in the same month as the CHMP opinion of the informed consent opinion.

The Applicant confirmed that the product information (PI) of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International will be updated in case any procedure concerning the PI of Xeplion will be approved before the CHMP opinion of the informed consent application. The Applicant confirmed that currently there're no ongoing procedures concerning the PI of Xeplion. Therefore, no updates to the PI of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International are expected prior to the CHMP opinion of the informed consent application, which is adequate.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Xeplion. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

The overall B/R of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is favourable in the following indication:

Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilised with paliperidone or risperidone.

In selected adult patients with schizophrenia and previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or risperidone, Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International may be used without prior stabilisation with oral treatment if psychotic symptoms are mild to moderate and a long-acting injectable treatment is needed.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:
