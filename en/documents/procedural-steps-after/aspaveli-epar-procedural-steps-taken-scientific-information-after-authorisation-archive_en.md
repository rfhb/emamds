1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0002   | Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC based on final results from study APL2-302 (Pegasus) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a global, Phase 3, prospective, randomised, multicentre, open-label, active-comparator- controlled study in 80 subjects. The objective was to confirm treatment efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan monotherapy for the treatment of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). The submission of this study addresses MEA 001. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 1.0 has been agreed. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 19/05/2022 | 15/02/2023 | SmPC and PL | Update of sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC to reflect efficacy and safety results from the final study APL2-302, including the 48 weeks data. Results of the key efficacy analyses of (OLP) confirm the results observed during the 16-week randomized completion phase (RCP) and suggest an improvement in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) markers. The PK analysis within OLP showed that therapeutic concentrations of pegcetacoplan were maintained for up to Week 48. The Package Leaflet (PL) was updated accordingly.
