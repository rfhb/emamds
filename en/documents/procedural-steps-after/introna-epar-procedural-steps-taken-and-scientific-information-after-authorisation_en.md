2010, as part of a class-labelling change, the Product Information of ribavirin and the interferon-containing products is updated to remove from SmPC section 4.6 the requirement of double contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male patients, and to revise SmPC section 5.2 to reflect the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to transfer in seminal fluid.

C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH

This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

Update of section 4.3 and 4.5 to update the product information in line with Sebivo to reflect  a contraindication for the use of interferon  in combination with Sebivo. The PL is updated accordingly.

C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation ribavirin. The malformative risk is possible in human, but it is not confirmed. For paternal exposure, the malformative risk is unlikely in humans. Taking into account the number of reference cases outnumbering 300 after paternal exposure with no increase of congenital anomaly risk, it is recommended to remove the requirement of double contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male patient. For female patients, the CHMP agreed that they should be instructed to use an effective contraceptive. For male patients, the CHMP recommended that either male patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to use an effective contraceptive. Furthermore the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to the transfer of ribavirin in seminal fluid are included in the SmPC. 19/05/2011 29/06/2011 SmPC and PL The efficacy and the safety of telbivudine in combination with 180 µg pegylated interferon alfa-2a once weekly was investigated in the Phase IIIb CLDT600A2406. An increased risk of peripheral neuropathy was observed with this combination.  As a consequence the SmPC and PL for telbuvidine and pegylated interferon alfa 2a have been updated, contraindicating the combination of telbuvidine and standard or pegylated interferon alfa products. Due to the similarity of the two interferon alfa 2a and interferon alfa 2b products an increased risk of peripheral neuropaty associated with the combination of interferon alfa 2b products cannot be ruled out. As such the CHMP has recommended that the prescribing information of all the interferon alfa containing products be adapted accordingly. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The details of the Romanian local representative are updated in the Package leaflet. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Product | 19/03/2008 | 22/04/2008 no | SmPC and PL longer | In the context of the 5 year renewal of IntronA the MAH was requested to update the product information with the results of the development programme in HIV/HCV co- infected patients with pegylated interferon/ribavarin. Extensions of indication to include treatment of HCV in HIV/HCV co-infected patients were granted by the CHMP for the alfa 2b pegylated interferons and Rebetol in June 2007 based on the results of 2 clinical trials conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. The results of these two studies are now reflected in the SPC of the standard interferons. Additionally it is mentioned that in both studies, patients who received standard interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin. |

| II/0061   | Update of section 4.4. and 4.8 of the SPC with the adverse reaction Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. Section 4.8 is also updated in line with SPC guideline further to a request from the CHMP. The PL is updated accordingly. Changes have also been made to the contact details of Sweden in the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 13/12/2007   | 28/01/2008    | SmPC and PL   | A cumulative review carried out by the Marketing Authorisation Holder identified 11 cases of Vogt-Koyanagi- Harada syndrome associated with interferon alfa therapy. In all cases, the role of alfa interferon could not be totally ruled out. However it is now well-recognized that Hepatitis C infection itself can be involved in the development of auto-immune disorders. The CHMP considered that the very rare frequency and the seriousness of this hardly known disease must be taken into account and therefore the adverse reaction has been included in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC, which should improve awareness and treatment and consequently outcome of this serious condition. authorised                                                                                                                 |

Overall a literature search and review of the Global Pharmacovigilance Database of the Marketing Authorisation Holder did not identify a signal of an increased risk of cutaneous vasculitis when interferon and hydroxyurea are co-administered; however the results of the pharmacoepidemiology analysis with calculations of Proportional Reporting Ratio did identify a possible signal of this phenomenon. A possible higher severity of cutaneous vasculitis with interferon/hydroxyurea combinations was also noted in some cases (potentially leading to amputations or requiring aggressive immunosuppressive therapy).

No histopathological effects on bone were observed. No ribavirin effects were observed regarding neurobehavioral or reproductive development. In view of the results of the preclinical study on bone growth, a warning was warranted in order to highlight to prescribers the need to clearly assess the benefit-risk of the combined use of ribavirin and interferon alpha 2b in young children in period of growth.

Pure red cell aplasia is a condition where the body stops or reduces the production of red blood cells. This causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy. A number of cases reported in the safety review are in favour of a potential link between ribavirin and/or interferon therapy and the development of pure red cell                                                            |

| II/0054 | Update of section 4.4 of the SPC further to the adoption of a class labelling for psychiatric disorders by the CHMP on 23rd March 2006. The Package Leaflet has been updated to reflect the SPC changes Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 28/06/2006 Product | 19/07/2006 no | SmPC and PL longer | Following a safety review on suicide and attempted suicide Section 4.4 of the SPCs of a number of the interferon alfa- 2b and ribavirin containing medicinal products, respectively were updated to include a warning on the duration of psychiatric disorders. This update took place in September 2005. On assessment of a subsequent pharmacovigilance follow up measure for ribavirin the CHMP requested a class labelling to put more emphasis on psychiatric disorders in the SPC and Package Leaflet of the interferon-alfa and ribavarin containing products. Due to differences in the indications it was not possible to propose a class labelling \"text\" for all these products. Therefore the existing paragraphs pertaining to psychiatric disorders in the SPC and Package Leaflet of IntronA have been moved to the beginning of the corresponding sections and placed in a warning box in order to draw attention to these serious adverse effects. |

The CHMP concluded that contraceptive measures should be used during treatment and for 4 months after treatment discontinuation in female patients and their partners and during treatment and for 7 months after treatment discontinuation in male patients and their female partners. Section 4.6 of the SPC of IntronA has therefore been updated to add the seven month duration of contraction for male patients and their female partners when alfa- Interferon is used in combination with ribavarin. Regarding lactation the CHMP agreed that given the importance of the treatment to the mother, prescribers should not be given a choice between the discontinuation of treatment or breastfeeding. Rather a warning should be included in Section 4.6 that breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to treatment. longer authorised   |

| II/0052 | Update of Section 4.4 of the IntronA SPC, further to the assessment of the PSUR 7 and of Pharmacovigilance follow up measures, to alert the prescribers on the fact that patients treated with ribavirin and interferon combination therapy and Zidovudine could be at higher risk of developing anaemia. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. The annexes have also beeen updated in line with the latest QRD template (version 7). Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Medicinal Product | SmPC, Annex Labelling and PL Further to the assessment of PSUR 7 for IntronA/Viraferon (period covered 8 March 2004 to 9 September 2004) a report has drawn attention to a potential increase of anaemia in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV who received concomitant treatment with interferon or pegylated interferon and ribavirin with Zidovudine (AZT). As anaemia is an important limiting factor for the success of combination therapy in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV, the CHMP requested that the MAH review safety data with regard to the necessity to include a warning in the SPC and Package Leaflet. In light of the safety review provided by the company the CHMP concluded that the hypothesis of an interference between haemolysis due to ribavirin and the myelosuppresive effect of AZT with reduction of erythropoiesis as suggested in literature should                  |

| II/0051 | Update of the information in section 5.1 of IntronA SPC with results of the long-term follow-up protocol to assess patients after completing 24 weeks of follow-up in a Clinical trial for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with Rebetol and IntronA. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 23/02/2006 Product | 29/03/2006 no longer | SmPC This was a 5-year, long-term follow-up study of naïve or relapse subjects who completed the 24-week follow-up period in 1 of 6, placebo controlled treatment protocols comparing IntronA (non pegylated interferon alfa 2-b) / Rebetol (ribavirin) combination therapy (for 24 or 48 weeks), with Intron A monotherapy (for 24 or 48 weeks) in naïve or relapse subjects. Long-term follow-up began at the Follow-Up Week 24 visit in the treatment protocol, ie, 6 months post-treatment. The results of the study confirm the durability of the virologic response up to 5 years. The likelihood of maintaining virologic response over 5 years in subjects who initially achieved a sustained response is 97% with a 95% Confidence Interval of [95%, 99%] .The limitations of the study (limited percentage of non responders that enter the long term study and high number of discontinuation), preclude any conclusion across initial treatment groups. Further, if the long-term clearance of the virus could be considered as a clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events related to progression of liver disease. This change in section 5.1 of the SPC applies to Rebetol and also to Intron A and Viraferon, both non pegylated interferon alfa 2b. authorised |

children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropria

The CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of IntronA continues to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the benefit/risk profile of this medicinal product remains favourable.

The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis, taking into account any evidence of disease progression such as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as prognostic factors for response, HCV genotype and viral load. The expected benefit of treatment should be weighed against the safety findings observed for paediatric subjects in the clinical trials. Interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening). (See ribavirin capsule SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dosage modification guidelines for combination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh < 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution SPC).

Sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults.
