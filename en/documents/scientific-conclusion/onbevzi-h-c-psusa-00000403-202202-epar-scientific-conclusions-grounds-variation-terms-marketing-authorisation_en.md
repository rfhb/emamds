## Scientific conclusions

<!-- image -->

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for bevacizumab, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid-type reactions are included in SmPC section 4.8 under 'Hypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions'. However, in view of available data on anaphylactic shock from the literature and spontaneous reports including a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between bevacizumab and anaphylactic shock is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing bevacizumab should be amended accordingly. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bevacizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bevacizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
