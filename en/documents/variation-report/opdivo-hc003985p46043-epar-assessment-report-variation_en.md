## 1. Introduction

On 18.12.2020 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

Study CA209915 encompass both products and therefore a single (integrated) assessment report for Opdivo/Yervoy is written.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The approval of nivolumab for the adjuvant melanoma indication was based on the results of the CA209238 study, a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind study of nivolumab versus ipilimumab in subjects with completely resected Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV melanoma.

Based on data from Study CA209067, combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was approved as a first-line treatment option for patients with advanced melanoma.

As a result, Study CA209915 was designed to investigate whether nivolumab and ipilimumab combination treatment will improve RFS compared to nivolumab monotherapy (primary outcome) as adjuvant treatment in patients with completely resected Stage IIIb/c/d or Stage IV no evidence of disease (NED) melanoma. A total of 1844 adults and adolescents between 12 to &lt;18 years of age were randomized to nivolumab + ipilimumab or nivolumab monotherapy in Study CA209915. Of these, 3 adolescent subjects were randomized and treated; 2 adolescents were treated with nivolumab monotherapy and 1 adolescent was treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy.

In the overall population in Study CA209915, there was no evidence of improved efficacy for nivolumab + ipilimumab compared with nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with completely resected Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV NED melanoma. No new safety signals were detected in this study.

No definitive conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy and safety of nivolumab + ipilimumab compared with nivolumab monotherapy in the population of adolescents (&lt; 18 years) with completely resected Stage IIIb/c/d or Stage IV NED melanoma due to the small sample size (n=3). Therefore, no updates to the Product Information of OPDIVO or YERVOY are being proposed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Study participants were treated with one of the following:

- Arm A: nivolumab 240 mg IV Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV Q6W (for 1 year of study drug treatment)
- Arm B: nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W (for 1 year of study drug treatment) with nivolumab placebo on Weeks 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, &amp; 47 and ipilimumab placebo on Weeks 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, &amp; 49

The original study design included an ipilimumab monotherapy treatment arm (Arm C). Randomization into Arm C was discontinued upon implementation of Amendment 06, after 99 subjects had been enrolled. No adolescent patient was treated with ipilimumab monotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For adolescents between 12 to &lt;18 years of age, the dosing of nivolumab was based on body weight as follows: Q2W dosing - 3 mg/kg IV Q2W up to a maximum of 240 mg; Q4W dosing - 6 mg/kg Q4W up to a maximum of 480 mg.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study CA209915: a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs nivolumab monotherapy in participants ( ≥ 12 years) with completely resected Stage IIIb/c/d or Stage IV NED melanoma.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study CA209915

A phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs nivolumab monotherapy in participants ( ≥ 12 years) with completely resected Stage IIIb/c/d or Stage IV NED melanoma.

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

The primary objective of Study CA20915 was to compare the efficacy, as measured by recurrence-free survival (RFS), provided by nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in participants with completely resected stage IIIb/c/d or stage IV NED melanoma (in all randomized participants with tumor PD-L1 expression level &lt; 1% and all randomized participants).

Secondary objectives included:

- To compare the OS provided by nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in participants with completely resected stage IIIb/c/d or stage IV NED melanoma (in all randomized participants with tumor PD-L1 expression level &lt; 1% and all randomized participants).
- To evaluate the association between PD-L1 expression and RFS.
- To evaluate investigator-assessed outcomes on next-line therapies.

Exploratory objectives include assessment of safety and tolerability, evaluation of distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), Health Related Quality of Life, changes in health status and work productivity, associations between BRAF mutation status and clinical efficacy, the potential association of biomarkers with clinical efficacy and/or incidence of adverse events (AEs), assessment of effect of natural genetic variation in select genes on clinical endpoints and/or incidence of AEs, characterization of the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of nivolumab and ipilimumab, and exploration of exposure-response relationships with respect to safety and efficacy.

## Study design

Study CA20915 was a randomized, double-blind study. The study design is outlined below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The original study design included an ipilimumab monotherapy treatment arm (Arm C). Randomization into Arm C was discontinued upon implementation of Amendment 06, after 99 subjects had been enrolled. No adolescents were treated with ipilimumab monotherapy.

## Study population /Sample size

A total of 1844 adults and adolescents between 12 to &lt;18 years of age were randomized to nivolumab + ipilimumab or nivolumab monotherapy in Study CA209915. Of these, 3 adolescent subjects were randomized and treated.

## Treatments

Study participants were treated with one of the following:

- Arm A: nivolumab 240 mg IV Q2W plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV Q6W (for 1 year of study drug treatment)
- Arm B: nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W (for 1 year of study drug treatment) with nivolumab placebo on Weeks 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, &amp; 47 and ipilimumab placebo on Weeks 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, &amp; 49

For the 3 included adolescents between 12 to &lt;18 years of age, the dosing of nivolumab was based on body weight as follows: Q2W dosing - 3 mg/kg IV Q2W up to a maximum of 240 mg; Q4W dosing 6 mg/kg Q4W up to a maximum of 480 mg.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was recurrence free survival, in all randomized subjects and in all randomized subjects with tumor PD-L1 &lt;1%.

Key secondary endpoint was OS.

## Statistical Methods

The sample size of the study was based on a comparison of the RFS distribution between subjects randomized to nivolumab + ipilimumab and subjects randomized to nivolumab. RFS was evaluated for treatment effect using the following testing strategy: RFS was compared first in the all randomized subjects with tumor PD-L1 expression level &lt; 1% subgroup with an alpha allocation of 0.03 (twosided); and if significant (which was not considered to be the case per DMC recommendation in Nov2019), the alpha allocated to this subgroup was to be recycled to the treatment comparison in the overall population (all randomized subjects). For the comparison of RFS between nivolumab + ipilimumab and nivolumab in all randomized subjects with tumour PD-L1 expression level &lt; 1%, at least 257 RFS events were required in the 2 treatment arms for a two-sided experiment-wise α = 0.03 log-rank test to show a statistically significant difference in RFS between the treatment arms with at least 90.0% power when the average hazard ratio (HR) of the nivolumab + ipilimumab arm to the nivolumab arm was 0.65. Approximately 600 subjects with tumour PD-L1 expression level &lt; 1% were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to nivolumab + ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Of the 1844 subjects randomized to nivolumab + ipilimumab or nivolumab, 1833 (99.4%) were treated (916 with nivolumab + ipilimumab, 917 with nivolumab).

## Baseline data

The demographic characteristics of the overall population are summarized in Table 1.

Of the overall population, 3 adolescent subjects were randomized and treated.

- Subject CA209-915-xx-xx, a 15-year old white male with PDL1 status ≥ 5%, was randomized to nivolumab (nivo) at a site in Australia. This subject had been treated with wide local excision, resective surgery, and complete lymph node dissection prior to the study. This subject completed the treatment period.
- Subject CA209-915-xx-xx, a 16-year old white male with PD-L1 status &lt; 1%, was randomized to nivolumab + ipilimumab (nivo+ipi) at a site in Italy. The subject had been treated with resective surgery and complete lymph node dissection prior to the study. This subject died of disease progression.
- Subject CA209-915-xx-xx, a 16-year old white female with PD-L1 status &lt; 1%, was randomized to nivolumab (nivo) at a site in the UK. The subject had been treated with resective surgery and complete lymph node dissection prior to the study. This subject experienced disease recurrence after RFS of 11.2 months.

## Efficacy results

The primary study objectives of demonstrating improved RFS with nivolumab + ipilimumab vs nivolumab as adjuvant therapy in all randomized subjects or in all randomized subjects with tumour PD-L1 &lt; 1% with completely resected stage IIIb/c/d or stage IV NED melanoma was not met. At this analysis, subjects were followed for a minimum of approximately 24 months (from 22-Jun-2018 [last subject randomization] to 12-Jun-2020 [data cutoff]).

## All randomized subjects:

- Nivolumab + ipilimumab did not demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of RFS vs nivolumab (HR = 0.92 [97.295% CI: 0.77, 1.09]); stratified log-rank p = 0.26861).
- RFS results for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs nivolumab were similar across the baseline tumor PD-L1 expression level subgroups.
- There was no improvement in DMFS with nivolumab + ipilimumab vs nivolumab.

All randomized subjects with tumor PD-L1 expression &lt; 1%:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- As per the 24 months exploratory follow-up RFS data analysis, the results in the PD-L1 &lt; 1% population were consistent with those in the overall population (all randomized subjects). There was no improvement in RFS with nivolumab + ipilimumab  vs nivolumab (HR = 0.91 [95% CI: 0.73, 1.14]).
- As per the DMC recommendation in Nov-2019, nivolumab + ipilimumab did not demonstrate a statistically significant  improvement in the primary endpoint of RFS vs nivolumab.
- There was no improvement in DMFS with nivolumab + ipilimumab vs nivolumab.

Results for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for the overall population are summarized in Table 3.

## Safety results

As of the 08-Sep-2020 database lock (minimum follow-up: ~24 months), the safety profiles of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W and nivolumab monotherapy (480 mg Q4W) in all treated subjects with completely resected Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV melanoma (Table 8) were consistent with those in other tumor types, with no new safety signals. In summary:

- In total, 4 deaths were attributed to study drug toxicity (liver failure, myasthenia gravis, respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonitis) by the investigator, all in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group.
- The overall frequencies of all-causality SAEs and drug-related SAEs (any grade and Grade 3-4) were higher in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group than in the nivolumab group.
- The overall frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (any grade and Grade 3-4) were higher in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group than in the nivolumab group.
- The overall frequencies of any-grade AEs were similar in the nivolumab + ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment groups. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 AEs and drug-related AEs were higher in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group than in the nivolumab group. However, Grade 3-4 events were uncommon.
- In both treatment groups, most subjects with immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs) within the categories of rash, pneumonitis, hypersensitivity, nephritis and renal dysfunction, and endocrine, experienced Grade 1-2 events. However, there was more Grade 3-4 vs Grade 1-2 immune related diarrhea/colitis and hepatitis in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group. The majority of IMAEs resolved and were manageable using the recommended treatment guidelines for early work-up and intervention.
- In both treatment groups, most subjects with select AEs experienced Grade 1-2 events. Select AEs, including those that were severe (Grade 3-4), were manageable using the established algorithms. Except for endocrine events, most drug-related select AEs in both treatment groups had resolved at the time of database lock. Some endocrine AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.
- Abnormalities in hematology laboratory results, liver tests, kidney function tests, and electrolytes in subjects treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab or nivolumab were primarily Grade 1 or 2.
- Nivolumab and ipilimumab ADA development did not appear to have an effect on the safety or

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH submitted the final CSR for study CA209915 as part of this Article 46 procedure, because 3 adolescent patients were included in this phase 3 study. These adolescent patients were treated with nivolumab monotherapy (n=2) or nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy (n=1) in the adjuvant setting for melanoma.

Nivolumab as monotherapy is currently indicated for the adjuvant treatment of completely resected stage IIIb/c or IV melanoma in adults. It is also indicated in adults for treatment of inoperable or metastatic disease, as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab. Nivolumab is not indicated for patients &lt;18 years of age in any setting.

Ipilimumab as monotherapy is indicated for treatment of inoperable or metastatic melanoma in patients from 12 years of age.

The phase 3 study CA209915 did not meet its primary endpoint, with no statistically significant difference in RFS between the control arm of nivolumab monotherapy and the intervention arm of nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy. Therefore, an indication for nivolumab + ipilimumab as adjuvant melanoma treatment, either in adults or children &gt;12 years of age, has not been applied for and is not foreseen.

Nivolumab currently is not indicated in the paediatric population and it is not expected that it is currently used in clinical practice in the adjuvant setting of melanoma treatment in paediatric patients. No firm conclusion on (lack of) efficacy can be drawn from the data submitted in the current procedure, because only 3 adolescent patients were included in study CA209915. Inclusion of the data of these 3 patients in the SmPC is not considered clinically relevant nor informative for the prescriber, from an efficacy point of view, at this time.

Of note, the indication for ipilimumab in adolescents with advanced melanoma was based on extrapolation of data in the adult population and the result of PK-studies. The MAH has provided information on the development plan and the ongoing activities for nivolumab in the paediatric population with advanced melanoma. One clinical study studying nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy has completed accrual and study completion is expected in December 2021. A PK modelling and simulation study will use data from this clinical study to propose dosing recommendations for nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy in adolescents with advanced melanoma (expected completion date February 2022). If the MAH intends (in the future) to submit an application for nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy in the paediatric population, the company is strongly recommended to request CHMP Scientific Advice before submission.

In the event an application for nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab+ipilimumab  combination therapy in the paediatric population would be submitted, the relevance of the currently submitted study for the applied indication, and by that inclusion of the obtained (PK, efficacy or safety) results into the SmPC should be reconsidered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No new safety signals were reported from study CA209915, for the included population as a whole or for the 3 adolescent subjects. Therefore, also from a safety perspective, inclusion of the data in the SmPC is also not considered necessary at this time.

The MAH proposes not to amend the SmPC of Opdivo or Yervoy based on the submitted results, this is supported.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

It is agreed with the MAH that no efficacy conclusion for the paediatric population can be drawn from the results of the 3 adolescents subjects included in study CA209915, and also that no new safety concerns arise.

Nivolumab is not indicated in the paediatric population, and ipilimumab is not indicated in the adjuvant melanoma setting. Either nivolumab as monotherapy or nivolumab+ipilimumab as combination therapy are not registered, recommended or expected to be used as adjuvant melanoma treatment in clinical practice in paediatric patients.

Therefore, inclusion of the submitted data in the SmPC is not considered informative nor necessary at this time.

In the future, interaction with regulatory authorities on the dossier before an application for nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy in the paediatric population is submitted, is strongly encouraged. If such an application would take place, the inclusion of the data submitted as part of the current procedure should be reconsidered.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## QUESTION 1

The MAH is asked to provide information on the development plan and the ongoing activities for nivolumab in the paediatric population with advanced melanoma.

## RESPONSE

BMS is fully committed to the paediatric development of nivolumab, including for advanced melanoma. As part of the agreed nivolumab Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for the treatment of all conditions included in the category of malignant neoplasms, except nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, (PIP ref. EMEA-001407-PIP01-12-M03, latest EMA decision P/0432/2020, dated 05 November 2020), the 2 following studies are ongoing:

- Study 2 (CA209070 ):  Open-label, multi-centre trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity, safety, and anti-cancer activity of nivolumab and of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in paediatric patients from 1 year to &lt; 18 years of age with a refractory or relapsed malignant solid tumour, including advanced melanoma. This study has an expansion phase evaluating nivolumab in paediatric patients from 1 year to &lt; 18 years of
- age (and adults) with a refractory or relapsed malignant solid tumour such as Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma. In this study and in the expansion phase, patient's current disease state must be one for which there is no known curative therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Estimated date of completion: December 2021.

- Study 4 : Study to generate paediatric dosing recommendation for nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab.

Date of completion: February 2022.

Study 2 (CA209070) completed accrual in March 2020. Available data from nivolumab monotherapy cohorts have been published. 1  BMS is actively working with the Sponsor of Study CA209070 to obtain the full data from the trial in order to conduct a complete assessment of the results and prepare the corresponding Clinical Study Report. With regards to Study 4 (modelling and simulation measure), BMS will work on the model once the data from CA209070 are available, and a report will be prepared according to the agreed completion date indicated in the PIP. The applicant wants to bring to your attention that a consensus review conference on checkpoint inhibition in paediatric patients consisting of academics, family/foundation representatives, industry and members from both the EMA and FDA was recently published. 2  Based on the limited activity identified to date, there was 'collective agreement that there is no scientific rationale for children to be enrolled in new monotherapy trials of additional checkpoint inhibitors with the same mechanism of action of agents already studied (eg, anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, anti- CTLA-4) unless additional scientific knowledge supporting a different approach becomes available. This shared perspective, based on scientific evidence and supported by paediatric oncology cooperative groups, should inform companies on whether a paediatric development plan is justified.' Therefore, once the totality of data is available, any potential new indication in the paediatric population will be subject to a health authority interaction to agree on the dossier content to support a benefit/risk evaluation of nivolumab and/or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in the treatment of paediatric patients with advanced melanoma.
