## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  Taxotere.  This  scientific discussion has been updated until 1 February 2005. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Taxotere as monotherapy is intended for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  In  combination  with  doxorubicin  Taxotere  is  indicated  as first-line  treatment  for  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer. Taxotere  in  combination  with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included an anthracycline.

Furthermore, Taxotere as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

Taxotere is also indicated in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for this condition.

Docetaxel, the active substance of Taxotere, is prepared by semisynthesis using a substance extracted from yew needles, i.e. 10-deacetylbaccatin III (DAB-10).

Docetaxel  is  an  antineoplastic  agent  that  acts  by  promoting  the  assembly  of  tubulin  into  stable microtubules  and  inhibits  their  disassembly,  which  leads  to  a  marked  decrease  of  free  tubulin  and eventually to cancer cell death. The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments.

Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells, which is essential for vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions.

Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some but  not  all  cell  lines  overexpressing  the  p-glycoprotein  that  is  encoded  by  the  multidrug  resistance gene. In vivo , docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental antitumour activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.

The  main  mechanism  of  resistance  is  due  to  overexpression  of  the  cell  surface  drug  transporter glycoprotein  GP170  encoded  by  the  MDR1  gene  and  responsible  for  multidrug  resistance  to  many structurally similar anticancer drugs: taxoids, vinca-alkaloids, anthracyclines, podophyllotoxins.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Docetaxel,  active  substance  of  Taxotere,  is  prepared  by  semisynthesis  using  a  substance  extracted from the needles of European yew tree and Indian), 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB).

Taxotere  is  presented  as  a  concentrate  for  infusion  and  is  available  in  two  dosage  strengths  of docetaxel trihydrate corresponding to 20 mg and 80 mg of docetaxel (anhydrous) in polysorbate 80. The composition of the viscous solution is identical for both strengths (40 mg/ml). The accompanying solvent contains 13% ethanol in water for injection.

A study was carried out on the physical stability of the infusion solution to determine a period of use. The overall results showed that respecting the conditions defined the infusion solution remained clear for up to 6 hours after solution, regardless the type of bags (PVC or polyolefin) and infusion vehicle (0.9%  NaCl  or  5%  glucose)  used.  Taking  into  account  these  results,  the  instructions  for  the administration  of  the  final  infusion  solution  and  for  the  preparation  of  the  premix  solution  were simplified as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Taxotere infusion solution is administered to patients intravenously within the 4 hours including a  1-hour  infusion  under  aseptical  conditions.  The  maximum  concentration  acceptable  was defined to be 0.74-mg/ml docetaxel. The infusion solution is prepared by diluting the required premix volume (i.e. 10 mg docetaxel/ml) into a 250 ml bag or bottle containing 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% glucose solution.
- The  premix  itself  is  obtained  by  manually  mixing  the  content  of  one  vial  of  Taxotere concentrate for infusion (20 or 80 mg) with the content of one vial of the correspondent specific solvent. The premix solution, which contains 10-mg/ml docetaxel, should be used immediately to  prepare  the  infusion  solution.  However,  the  chemical  and  physical  stability  of  the  premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between +2 ° C and +8 ° C or at room temperature. The reconstitution should be made under aseptical conditions.

The original formulation of Taxotere (formulation 2) has been replaced by formulation 3. The quality of the current polysorbate 80 DF has been optimised, resulting in an improvement in stability. This resulted in a change in the specifications, an extension of the shelf life and a change in the storage conditions of the finished medicinal product. As a consequential change, analytical methods of both polysorbate DF and Taxotere concentrate have been adapted.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

An  extensive  preclinical  programme  was  carried  out  in  different  laboratories  in  Europe,  North America  and  Japan.  Overall  the  results  were  consistent  with  those  obtained  from  similar  studies performed in other laboratories.

The  toxicology  file  clearly  defined  the  acute  toxicity  in  tested  species  and  the  lack  of  cumulative toxicity in animals but failed in identifying some of the side effects observed in humans such as skin toxicity and fluid retention syndrome despite the use of 'strategy mimicking studies'.

Docetaxel has been shown  to be mutagenic in cytogenic tests, as predicted based on its pharmacological activity.

No  carcinogenicity  studies  were  performed,  which  is  acceptable  regarding  the  intended  use  of Taxotere.

Docetaxel has been shown to be both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats and to reduce fertility in rats. Thus docetaxel is contraindicated in pregnant women.

No major objection was raised to this part of the dossier.

In order to support the change in formulation, additional toxicity studies have been carried out. The results of these studies indicate that formulation 3 had a similar toxicity profile as formulation 2 and, in  particular,  had  no  intravenous,  paravenous  or  intra-arterial  irritation  potential,  and  that  it  was compatible in vitro with human plasma, serum and blood under conditions similar to that of clinical use.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  preclinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  supplied  sufficient  information  on  plasma  clearance,  tissue and tumour distribution and metabolism of docetaxel and support the schedule and doses used in early clinical studies.

The plasma protein binding of docetaxel is high (more than 95%). Potential interactions with tightly protein-bound drugs were investigated and no change in the protein binding of docetaxel was found. In vitro potential interactions between  docetaxel  and  compounds  that  induce,  inhibit or are metabolised  (and  thus  may  inhibit  the  enzyme  competitively)  by  cytochrome  P450-3A  such  as ciclosporine,  terfenadine  and  ketoconazole  were  observed.  These  findings  have  been  adequately addressed in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Clinical Pharmacology

The pharmacokinetics in humans has deserved extensive studies, of which a large part was dedicated to population pharmacokinetics.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for docetaxel are adequately defined, and show little variability in the tested population (even a coefficient of variation of 55% for plasma clearance is in the low range of the variations usually observed). A large number of patients were included in the studies; therefore one  cannot  expect  significant  modifications  in  relation  to  age  in  adult  patients,  to  tumour  type  or tumour  burden.  However,  more  variability  is  to  be  expected  with  patients  with  poor  performance status and/or abnormal liver function tests.

The impact of altered performance status, denutrition and low plasma protein level can be suspected but will have to be studied in a representative population of patients.

PK parameters were not a prognostic factoraccording to 2 studies investigating  PK  and  efficacy  in patients with breast cancer (168 patients) and in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (151 patients).

PK/PD  did  not  establish,  as  expected  from  the  limited  variability  of  PK  parameters,  any  relation between PK parameters and efficacy

Relation of PK to neutropenia was studied in 534 patients: no correlation was observed.

Relation of PK to fluid retention was analysed using a COX model in 575 patients; actuarial risk for fluid retention was slightly increased in patients with low plasma clearance. However, stability of PK in relation to fluid-retention was not studied.

There were no formal clinical studies to evaluate in vivo the  drug interactions of docetaxel. In vitro studies  showed,  however,  that  the  metabolism  of  docetaxel  may  be  modified  by  the  concomitant administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A, such as ciclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole.

Five  phase  I  studies  with  Taxotere  in  combination  with  other  anticancer  agents  were  conducted  to define the dose limit toxicities, the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose of Taxotere when  combined  with  5-fluorouracil,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin  and  vinorelbine.  The  overall preliminary results submitted for these studies showed that Taxotere could be safely combined with vinorelbine,  5-fluorouracil  both  bolus  and  continuous  infusion,  cyclophosphamide  and  doxorubicin. The safety profile of the combinations tested did not show a qualitative and quantitative increase in the adverse effects observed with Taxotere as monotherapy.

The  pharmacokinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with a threecompartment  pharmacokinetic  model.  Docetaxel  is  approximately  94% protein bound  and  is eliminated in both the urine and faeces following a metabolism conducted by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. As  prednisone  and  prednisolone  are  known  to  induce  moderately  CYP3A4,  PK  of  docetaxel  in combination with prednisone was studied as part of the pivotal trial in the prostate cancer indication. The  results  of  this  pharmacokinetic  assessment  were  similar  for  docetaxel  alone  and  for  the combination with prednisone. No statistical difference was observed for total clearance between the two periods with or without concomitant prednisone (p-value= 0.9808).

A pharmacokinetic interaction study XRP6976D-1001 demonstrated that there was no pharmacokinetic  interaction  during  the  co-administration  of  doxorubicin  cyclophosphamide,  and docetaxel.

## Clinical experience

## Efficacy

Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Six phase II studies were conducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. A total  of  117  patients  had  received  no  prior  chemotherapy  and  111  patients  had  received  prior chemotherapy, which included 83 patients who had progressive disease during anthracycline therapy (anthracycline  resistant).  In  these  clinical  trials,  docetaxel  was  administered  at  a  100-mg/m 2 dose given as a one-hour infusion every 3 weeks.

The overall response rate (ORR) was 56% in the anthracycline resistant patients with a 4.4% complete response rate (CR). A 46% ORR was observed in the anthracycline refractory patients with 7.3% CR. The median duration of response was 27 weeks in the anthracycline resistant patients and 28 weeks in the anthracycline refractory patients. The median survival time was 11 months in the anthracyclineresistant patients.

There was a high response rate in  patients  with  visceral  metastases,  53.1%  in  the  49  anthracycline resistant patients in whom visceral metastases were present.

In anthracycline resistant patients, a significant response rate of 40% was seen in patients with liver metastases and a 63.2% response rate was observed in patients with soft tissue disease.

Two-phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 metastatic breast cancer patients who had failed  on  alkylating  agents  and  392 patients  who  had  failed  on  anthracycline  therapy,  have  been performed with docetaxel at the recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks.

In patients who had failed on alkylating agents, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every  3  weeks).  Without  affecting  overall  survival  time  (docetaxel  15  months  vs.  doxorubicin  14 months) or time to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks), docetaxel increased response  rate  (52%  vs.  37%,  p=0.01)  and  shortened  time  to  response  (12  weeks  vs.  23  weeks, p=0.007).  Three  docetaxel  patients  (2%)  discontinued  the  treatment  due  to  fluid  retention,  whereas 15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart failure).  This  study  supported  the  indication  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  Previous  chemotherapy  should  have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent.

In patients who had failed on anthracycline therapy, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin  C  and  vinblastine  (12  mg/m²  every  6  weeks  and  6  mg/m²  every  3  weeks).  Docetaxel increased  response  rate  (33%  vs.  12%,  p&lt;0.0001),  prolonged  time  to  progression  (19  weeks  vs.  11 weeks, p=0.0004) and prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01).

## Locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy

The application for broadening the indication to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  is  based  on  the  results of one  phase  III study of  docetaxel vs vinorelbine/ifosfamide in patients previously treated for NSCLC and two phase III studies against best supportive  care,  one  in  previously  treated  patients  and  the  other  in  naive  patients.  The  study  vs vinorelbine/ifosfamide failed to show a significant effect on the primary endpoint (overall survival), while it showed a significant increase in one secondary endpoint, the response rate, which was 10.5% and 6.5% in the docetaxel 100 and 75 mg/m² respectively compared with 0.8% in the vinorelbine/ifosfamide.  The  study  versus  best  supportive  care  in  previously  treated  patients  was analysed  in  two  parts  corresponding  to  two  successive  periods  and  doses  of  docetaxel:  100  and 75 mg/m 2 . In this study a significant increase in overall survival (p = 0.016) was observed only in the second period. Docetaxel treatment showed also positive effects in several secondary endpoints of this study:  Time  to  progression  was  significantly  improved  in  the  overall  docetaxel  group  (10.6  weeks versus 6.7 weeks), as well as in docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 (12.3 weeks versus 7.0 weeks) and in docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 subgroups (9.1 weeks versus 5.9 weeks). Docetaxel treatment was also associated with a clinical benefit translating in reduced need for analgesics, symptomatic agents and radiotherapy. The lower dose was generally better tolerated than the higher dose. Taken together the data from this study lead to a positive benefit/risk ratio of docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 in second line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

A significant benefit in overall survival versus best supportive care (p = 0.026) was obtained also in the  third  phase  III  study  conducted  in  chemotherapy-naive  patients.  The  response  rate  was  in  the range, which is known to be achieved with the most active single agents. Furthermore, less patients treated  with  docetaxel  needed  complementary  radiotherapy  or  pharmacotherapy  compared  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  receiving  only  best  supportive  care.  This  trial  demonstrates  a  positive  benefit/risk  ratio  for docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 over best supportive care in chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients. However, it was considered by the CPMP that combination chemotherapy containing cisplatinum is the currently best  treatment  in  that  setting.  Therefore,  a  comparison  vs  such  an  active  comparator  should  be provided to consider an extension of the indication to first-line treatment.

## First-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with doxorubicin

One large  phase  III  study,  involving  429  previously  untreated  patients  with  metastatic  disease,  has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) (AT) versus doxorubicin (60  mg/m²) in  combination  with  cyclophosphamide  (600  mg/m²)  (AC).  Both  regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks . The patient population was representative of metastatic breast cancer patients commonly referred for first-line treatment and there were no imbalance in the patient characteristics between the two arms. The primary efficacy parameter was time to progression (TTP) using a logrank test to compare the two treatment groups. The secondary efficacy parameters were  response  rate,  duration  of  response,  survival,  quality  of  life  and  although  not  defined  in  the protocol the time to treatment failure was also analysed.

TTP provided by a strict TTP analysis (accounting for a list of conventions in case of missing tumor assessments) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.045. The median TTP was 35.1 weeks (95%CI : 32.7 ; 37.6) in AT arm and 31.4 weeks (95%CI : 27.4 ; 34.3) in AC arm. The classic analysis of TTP (taking into account the real date of documented progression independently of the missing tumor assessments), lead to a larger difference regarding the median TTP between the two groups (p=0.0138) being 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in the AT arm and 31.9 weeks in the AC (95% CI: 27.4 - 36.0) arm. Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.009. The ORR was 59.3% (95%CI : 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95%CI : 39.8 - 53.2) in AC arm. The median duration of response was longer in the AT group compared to the AC group  (45.7  weeks vs 39.0  weeks  in  ITT,  p=0.3125).  This  difference  was  however  not  statistically significant.  Distribution  of  time  to  treatment  failure  was  statistically  different  between  the  two treatment  groups  (p=0.0479).  The  median  time  to  failure  was  25.6  weeks  on  AT  (95%  C.I.:  22.3  28.0) and 23.7 weeks on AC (95% C.I.: 20.6 - 26.0). There was no difference regarding quality of life between the two treatment arms. Furthermore the overall survival was similar in the two groups (20.4 months on AT and 20.9 months on AC), but the study was was not considered mature enough to detect any clinically relevant difference between treatment groups due to the fact that 57% of the patients were still alive at the cut-off date. Moreover, the majority of the censored observations (76% in AT and 81% in AC) are distributed before or in the vicinity of the observed median in each group (i.e. before 21 months). The second or the third line of treatment usually drives the survival in metastatic disease. The proportion of patients who received further chemotherapy was balanced in the two arms (47%  of  patients  in  AT  arm  and  48%  of  patients  in  AC  arm).  However  more  patients  in  AC  arm received further chemotherapy with Taxanes (27% of patients in AC arm vs 6% in AT arm) and more patients in AC arm received docetaxel as further therapy than in AT arm (18.1% vs 2.3%). Taking into consideration that docetaxel is the only cytotoxic agent to have shown in large randomized phase III trials a statistically significant increase of survival in metastatic breast cancer patients who previously failed an anthracycline containing regimen, the fact that 18.1% of the AC group received docetaxel as second-line treatment may have had a positive impact on the their overall survival.

Overall  the  study  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  the  docetaxel-doxorubicin  combination  over  the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin combination in terms of TTP and response rate.

## First line treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

One main phase III study (TAX 326), one supportive phase III (TAX 308) and a series of uncontrolled phase I and phase II platinum-based combination studies were submitted to support this indication. The recommended dose for docetaxel was identified as 75mg/m 2 , for the combination with cisplatin. Three of the studies assessed clinical pharmacokinetics and confirmed an absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and the platins.

The application was based on a single 3-arm randomised controlled trial (TAX 326) comparing two drug combinations of docetaxel plus cisplatin or carboplatin with the 'standard' active drug regimen of vinorelbine plus cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive patients with NSCLC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Selection criteria for TAX 326 include patients of age ≥ 18 years, with unresectable locally advanced and/or  recurrent  (Stage  IIIB)  or  metastatic  (Stage  IV),  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed NSCLC, and at least one measurable or evaluable lesion. Recurrence was defined as evident tumour progression  after  surgical  or  radiation  treatment.  Previous  therapies  were  limited  to  surgery  for NSCLC, and/or radiation therapy for NSCLC. No prior treatments with a biologic response modifier or chemotherapeutic agents were allowed. A Karnofsky Performance Status &gt;70 was required, as well as adequate organ function. Patients with symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases, or history of brain or leptomeningeal metastases unless adequately treated (stable for 4 weeks after completion of  that  treatment),  untreated  superior  vena  cava  syndrome,  untreated  spinal  cord  compression, hypercalcemia of malignancy, clinically significant ( ≥ Grade 3 NCI criteria) pericardial effusion, or aymptomatic (i.e. requiring thoracentesis) pleural effusion, were excluded.

Patients were randomised to one of the following treatment arms:

- -ARM  A:  docetaxel  75  mg/m 2   +  cisplatin  75mg/m 2   day  1  q21  daysARM  B:  docetaxel  75 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC6 day 1 q21 days
- -ARM C: vinorelbine 25 mg/m2  days 1, 8, 15, and 22; + cisplatin 100 mg/m 2  day 1 q28 days The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival. The secondary efficacy endpoints were : Overall objective Tumor Response, Time to Progression, Safety, and QOL, Other clinical benefit parameters. The main efficacy results are summarized in the table 1:

In combination with capecitabine for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

The claim was mainly based on comparative data deriving from a large randomised controlled clinical trial  (SO14999).  This  claim  was  supported  by  an  additional  and  independent  interaction  trial (SO15304)  investigating  PK  interactions  between  docetaxel  and  capecitabine  in  a  population  of patients  with  advanced  solid  tumours  in  general. Study  SO14999 is  an  open-label,  multicenter, multinational,  randomised,  parallel-group  phase  III  clinical  trial.  It  was  designed  to  compare  the efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  capecitabine  (intermittent  schedule)  in  combination  with  ('reduced') docetaxel vs. ('full dose') docetaxel administered as single agent in patients with locally advanced or

metastatic  breast  cancer  failing  an  anthracycline-containing  (first-line)  regimen.  Stratification  was done by previous paclitaxel treatment since paclitaxel pre-treatment, or failure, was not an exclusion criteria.

- Combination  arm:  Capecitabine  orally  at  1250  mg/m 2 twice  daily  (within  30  minutes  after completing a meal) for two weeks followed by a one week rest. Docetaxel as a 1-hour infusion of  75  mg/m 2 on  the  first  day  of  each  cycle  (every  3  weeks)  together  with  appropriate  comedication (prophylaxis of hypersensitivity reactions by oral corticosteroid).
- Docetaxel single agent arm: Docetaxel as a 1 hour infusion of 100 mg/m 2 on the first day of  each  cycle  (every  3  weeks)  together  with  appropriate  co-medication  (prophylaxis  of hypersensitivity reactions by oral corticosteroid).

The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP).

The Secondary endpoints were: Survival, Objective Response (OR), Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-30 (version 2.0) form and its breast cancer module QLQ-BR23).

In  a  subgroup  of  16  patients  of  the  combination  arm,  the  PK  parameters  c max ,  tmax,  AUC ∞ and  t 1/2 (apparent half life) were determined on study day 14 and 77. Blood samples, overall not exceeding 90 ml, were drawn pre-dose (capecitabine), and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 hours after administration of capecitabine at aliquots of 5 ml.

Two  different  populations  were  analysed  for  TTP;  the  ITT  and  per  protocol  population  and  two different  analysis  (primary  and  on  treatment  approach)  of  these  populations  were  planned.  The efficacy results from Study SO14999 are presented in tables 2 and 3.

The objective of this trial to show statistically significant superiority in terms of the primary endpoint time to progression has been reached (186 vs. 128 days). This obviously also translates in a relevant prolongation  (90  days;  442  vs.  352  days)  of  overall  survival  (Table  3).  The  overall  pattern  of significant and similar results clearly indicates that the combination results in more objective tumour responses, which translate in prolonged TTP and OS.

## In combination with trastuzumab in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer

This indication was mainly based on data from Study M77001, which is discussed below. Supportive data were provided from Study JP16003, a clinical pharmacology study in Japanese patients, assessing the  pharmacokinetics  of  trastuzumab  and  Taxotere  in  combination  and  Publications  from  six completed  and  two  ongoing  phase  II  supportive  efficacy  studies.  Safety  information  from  four ongoing  multicenter trials on  HER2-positive  MBC  patients  treated with the combination  of trastuzumab and Taxotere was provided.

Study M77001 was an open-label, comparative, multicenter, multinational, randomized phase II study, conducted as pivotal trial . Eligible  patients  had to  have  metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2 overexpression/amplification (IHC3+  and/or  FISH  positive) who  had  not previously received chemotherapy  for  advanced  disease.  All  patients  were  randomised  to  receive  trastuzumab  in combination with docetaxel or docetaxel alone.

The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) in each treatment arm (complete response CR plus partial response PR) during the treatment period. Secondary endpoints were to characterise the safety profile of docetaxel plus Trastuzumab and of docetaxel as a single agent in patients with HER2positive MBC, to determine the time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), time to response, duration of response and overall survival. Results in the full analysis set are presented below.

The presented results from the pivotal study M77001, demonstrate that a significantly higher overall tumour  response  was  observed  in  the  patients  receiving  the  combination  docetaxel  +  Trastuzumab compared  to  the  monotherapy  group  with  docetaxel.  The  combination  Trastuzumab  +  docetaxel  is more effective than docetaxel alone for anthracycline pre-treated (administered in adjuvant intent) and anthracycline naïve patients in terms of overall response rate,  median duration of response, median

TTP and median survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Supportive efficacy data for the combination therapy are available from 6 completed and 2 ongoing studies reported in the literature.

The estimated median survival times have increased with longer follow up to an estimated median of

30.5 months compared with the docetaxel alone arm (estimated median 22.1 months) (p=0.0062). It  was  considered  that  although  single  agent  docetaxel  is  not  an  approved  first  line  treatment  in metastatic breast cancer, it is widely used. Moreover as use of anthracyclines in the adjuvant setting is current  practice,  metastatic  patients  are  usually  unsuitable  to  be  treated  with  anthracyclines.  As efficacy  was  proven  both  in  anthracycline-naive  and  anthracycline-pre-treated  patients,  there  are  no grounds to restrict the indication to patients who have had prior anthracycline therapy or for whom anthracycline therapy is not suitable.

In conclusion 3-weekly Taxotere in combination with Herceptin administered weekly is an efficacious treatment  of  patients  with  HER2-positive  metastatic  breast  cancer.  In  principal  no  new  emerging safety signals could be identified. The benefit risk ratio for Taxotere in the indication: in combination with  trastuzumab  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received  chemotherapy  for  their metastatic disease is therefore positive.

## Adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide

The  main  study,  TAX316,  is  a  prospective,  parallel,  non-blinded,  randomized,  positive-controlled, multinational phase III trial comparing docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) versus 5-fluorouracil in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide  (FAC)  as  adjuvant  treatment  of  operable  breast  cancer  patients  with  positive axillary lymph nodes.

Both  regimens  were  to  be  administered  for  a  total  of  6  cycles  unless  treatment  was  precluded  by relapse, subject refusal, or unacceptable toxicities.

- TAC :  Doxorubicin  was  administered  first  at  50  mg/m²,  by  15-minute  iv  infusion  followed  by Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m², by 1-to 5-minute iv infusion and in one-hour interval between the end of doxorubicin infusion, Taxotere, 75 mg/m², by 1-hour intravenous infusion, every 3 weeks.
- FAC : Doxorubicin was administered first at 50 mg/m², by 15-minute intravenous infusion followed by 5-fluorouracil, at 500 mg/m², by 15-minute intravenous infusion and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m², by 1-to 5-minute intravenous infusion, every 3 weeks.
- G-CSF was used in case of febrile neutropenia or infection, for delayed recovery of neutrophil count at day 21 and as prophylactic treatment after a prior episode of febrile neutropenia. For both arms no primary  prophylactic  administration  of  G-CSF  was  permitted.  Prophylactic  antibiotic  therapy  was mandatory for all patients in the TAC group whereas patients in the FAC group received prophylactic antibiotics only after an episode of febrile neutropenia.

The primary objective was to compare disease-free survival (DFS). Overall survival (OS) is the main secondary objective and is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of  death.  Other  secondary  criteria  are  comparison  of  the  two  treatment  groups  quality  of  life  (as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR23) and on the pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy (P-glycoprotein, p53, Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X, Bag-1, hormone receptors and proliferation  index).  The  results  of  the  second  interim  analysis  at  399  DFS  events  and  at  a  median follow-up of 55 months, formed the basis of the approval. The majority of events were breast cancer relapses (85.5 %), second primary malignancies (11.5) % and deaths (3 %).

Clinical efficacy results of study TAX316 for the entire study population are convincing in terms of decrease  of  the  risk  of  disease  relapse  and  survival  benefit.  The  results  are  clinically  relevant  and reached statistical significance: DFS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 - 0.88, p=0.001); OS (HR 0.70, 95% CI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.53 - 0.91, p=0.008). The robustness of this substantial benefit was confirmed using a multivariate Cox model adjusted for prognostic covariates.

The  results  are  particularly  relevant  in  the  1-3  nodes  stratum.    For  the  4  or  more  positive  nodes stratum, the results although numerically higher for the TAC arm did not reach statistical significance. The final analysis of TAX316 which the MAH committed to conduct (expected in 2007) will answer the question whether there is a significant benefit of TAC for both strata separately.

It is well established that nodal involvement is an important prognostic or risk factor for subjects with operable breast cancer, and that, irrespective of the treatment; DFS and OS decrease as the number of positive  lymph  nodes  increases.  With  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint,  DFS,  the  95%  confidence interval for subjects with 4+ is clearly overlapping the confidence interval for the subjects with 1-3 nodes (0.46-0.82 in nodes 1-3 compared to 0.63-1.08 in 4+). Regarding OS, this overlapping is less marked but  it  exists  (0.29-0.70  in  nodes  1-3  compared  to  0.66-1.33  in  4+).  It  seems  that  with  this interim analysis the benefit-risk-ratio is not fully defined for patients in the stratum N 4+. This will be possible after the final analysis. This issue is addressed within the SPC.

The final analysis of the study TAX 316 planned after observing a total of 590 DFS events, will be submitted (late 2007), as well as an annual safety update based on a yearly data review by the existing independent data monitoring committee for study TAX 316.

## In combination with prednisone or prednisolone in hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer (HRPC).

The indication was  obtained from the results from the multicenter phase III randomized trial TAX 327. The study compared Taxotere administered either every three weeks or weekly in combination with  prednisone  versus  mitoxantrone  in  combination  with  prednisone    in  the  treatment  metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Study participants were subjects with histologically / cytologically metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate unresponsive or refractory to hormone therapy (based  on  castration  by  orchiectomy    and/or  LHRH  agonists  with  or  without  antiandrogens  or estramustine.)

## Treatment regimen:

Arm  A (MTZ  q3w,  reference  arm):  Mitoxantrone  12  mg/m²  intravenously  every  21  days,  plus prednisone 10 mg orally given daily, for 10 cycles. Prednisone could be continued after completion of 10 cycles.

Arm B (TXT q3w, experimental arm): Docetaxel 75 mg/m² intravenously (day 1) every 21 days, plus prednisone 10 mg orally given daily, for 10 cycles.

Prophylactic dexamethasone 8 mg per os was to be administered at 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before Taxotere infusion.

Arm C (TXT qw, experimental arm): Docetaxel  30  mg/m²  intravenously  on  days  1,  8,  15,  22,  29, every 6 weeks, plus prednisone 10 mg orally given daily, for 5 cycles.

Dexamethasone 8 mg per os was to be administered 1 hour before docetaxel infusion.

In each study arm prednisone could be continued after completion of treatment.

The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary objectives were predefined reductions in pain, an  improvement  in  QoL,  a  reduction  of  serum  PSA  levels  of  at  least  50%,  and  objective  tumor responses  (the  original  time  to  progression  (TTP)  secondary  endpoint  was  changed  to  event  (pain, PSA, tumour, disease) progression free survival by Amendment No.2 ). Pain reduction (incidence and duration), prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (incidence and duration), response in patients with measurable disease, Quality of Life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Prostate FACT-P Questionnaire consisting of different subscales), safety, PK in combination with prednisone.

A total of 1006 subjects were randomized: 335 subjects in the TXT q3w group, 334 subjects in the TXT q1w group, and 337 subjects in the MTZ q3w group.

With regard to the primary endpoint of overall survival, combined Taxotere groups and Taxotere q3w treatment  were  statistically  superior  to  mitoxantrone  plus  prednisone  (HR=0.834  [0.701-0.992], p=0.0398; Taxotere q3w  HR=0.761  [0.619-0.936], p=0.0094), while the difference was not statistically significant in the qw treatment am (HR =0.912, [0.747-1.113, p=0.3624). Given the fact that Taxotere qw presented a better safety profile that TAX q3w, and that some patient may benefit from the qw schedule, this information is reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC.

A reduction in pain was more frequent among subjects receiving docetaxel every 3 weeks than among those treated with mitoxantrone,  pain reduction rate of 34.6% vs 21.7% (p=0.01) respectively.  No significant difference could be shown in the duration of pain response.

Rates  of  PSA  response  were  significantly  higher  in  subjects  receiving  docetaxel  (45.4%  vs  47.9% respectively)  than  those  receiving  mitoxantrone    (31.7%),  p=&lt;0.001  for  both  comparisons.  No significant difference was seen in the duration of PSA response.

Tumor response rates were numerically higher in both TXT groups (12.1% for TXTq3w, 8.2 % for TXTqw)  as  compared  to  the  MTZ  group  (6.6  %),  but  the  differences  did  not  achieve  statistical significance.

The QoL evaluated by fact-P, showed that the percentage of subjects who had improvement in the QoL was similar in subjects receiving docetaxel (22% for the every 3 weeks and 23% for the weekly) and  significantly  higher  compared  to  those  subjects  treated  with  mitoxantrone  (13%),  p=0.009  and p=0.005 respectively.

## Safety

Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy

The safety profile of docetaxel has been extensively studied. The most important adverse events are severe  neutropenia  and  infections  and  fluid  retention.  Most  of  the  adverse  events  described  below were reported in the initial trials and confirmed in trials performed and reported after granting of the Marketing  Authorisation.  Rare  events,  revealed  in  these  post-authorisation  trials,  are  described accordingly and have been added to the appropriate sections of the SPC. Treatment was discontinued because of side effects in 10-15% of patients.

Leuconeutropenia: frequent short lasting at  the  recommended  dose,  readily  reversible,  noncumulative  and  not  complicated  by  fever  and  infections  (22%).  However,  when  a  mucositis  exists (longer/repeated  infusion,  simultaneous  use  of  corticosteroids),  it  could  lead  to  an  increased  risk  of neutropenic fever and infections.

Fluid retention: although not severe in most cases, some patients discontinue the treatment; the final report  from  a  study  investigating  the  pathophysiology  of  fluid  retention  in  24  advanced  breast  and ovary cancer patients treated with docetaxel at the recommended dosage confirmed the relationship between  the  cumulative  dose  of  docetaxel  and  the  development  of  a  reversible  fluid  retention syndrome. In  general  the  most  frequent  clinical  appearance  of  fluid  retention  was  a  peripheral  soft pitting oedema of the lower extremities moving to a hard lymphedema at a later stage. The mechanism in  the  generation  of  the  fluid  retention  involved  two  steps:  progressive  congestion  of  the  interstitial space  by  proteins  and  subsequently  by  water  between  the  2nd  and  4th  cycle  followed  by  a  later insufficiency  in  the  lymphatic  drainage.  Premedication  with  corticosteroids  allows  for  significant reduction in its incidence and severity. The original recommendation for fluid retention premedication was 5-day regimen with an oral corticosteroid. The Marketing Authorisation Holder provided a report on  3-day  versus  5-day  corticosteroids  regimen.  Following  the  assessment  of  the  report  it  was concluded  that  the  recommended  premedication  to  reduce  both  the  incidence  and  severity  of  fluid retention could be shortened to a 3-day steroid regimen.

Acute hypersensitivity  reactions: they  encompass  a  broad  spectrum  of  clinical  manifestations  but appear to be of limited severity. Their mechanism is unclear and the use of antihistaminic agents (anti H1 or anti H2) has not been effective in reducing them.

Myalgias  and  arthralgias: the  mechanism  is  also  unclear,  and  no  preventive  measures  have  been specifically studied.

Neuro-sensory toxicity was observed in about 50% of patients, mostly grade I.

Skin toxicity, mostly grade 1 (erythema), had been observed in 64% of the patients at the time of the marketing  authorisation.  In  addition,  localised  bullous  eruptions  were  rarely  reported  in  the  fifth Periodic  Safety  Assessment  Report  (PSUR).  To  reflect  these  findings,  the  sections  4.4  'Special warnings and special precautions for use' and 4.8 'Undesirable effects' of the SPC and the package leaflet have been revised accordingly.

Mucositis occurred in 43% of patients, with some dependence upon the schedule regimen proposed.

Hepatic  and  renal  toxicity: increases  in  serum  transaminases  (AST,  ALT),  bilirubin  and  alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in less than 5% of the  patients.  Due  to  eligibility  criteria  the  initial  studies,  provided  limited  data  in  patients  with abnormal liver function tests at baseline. In subsequent studies it was observed that the occurrence of serious adverse events was increased in patients with liver impairment at baseline (p&lt;0.01). To reflect these findings, the sections 4.4 'Special warnings and special precautions for use' and 4.8  'Undesirable  effects'  of  the  SPC  have  been  revised  accordingly.  Grade  I  increase  in  creatinine (1.26-2.5 × N) was reported for 11.1% of patients for an overall incidence of 13.2%.

Other :  Other  events  usually  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  included  alopecia,  asthenia,  stomatitis, neurosensory and gastro-intestinal symptoms and their incidence appeared to be stable. In the overall population  only  asthenia  had  an  incidence  of  severe  toxicity  greater  than  10%.  The  results  of  a monocentric open label non-randomised study carried out on 98 patients showed that the usage of cold

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cap, commonly used with other antimitotic agents, can be useful in preventing alopecia induced by docetaxel therapy. Based on the assessment of PSURs the following adverse events have been added to section the SPC: gastrointestinal perforations, neutropenic enterocolitis, myocardial infarction and thromboembolic events.

After the Marketing Authorisation had been granted on 27 November 1995, during Phase II and III clinical  trials,  some  hospital  pharmacists  misinterpreted  the  instructions  for  preparation  of  Taxotere infusion solution. Consequently, new information related to the content of vials, clarification on the preparation  of  the  infusion  solution  and  reference  to  aseptical  preparation  were  introduced  into  the sections 6.5 'Nature and contents of container' and 6.6 'Instructions for use/handling' of the SPC. The Labelling and Package Leaflet were amended accordingly.

## Locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy

Adverse effects in all studies were in line with those observed in patients with breast cancer. Generally a higher incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events, especially infections and pulmonary adverse events, were observed in NSCLC patients treated with 100 mg/m² compared with the 75 mg/m² dose level.

## First-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with doxorubicin

Adverse events were reported using the NCI-CTC scale and COSTART. The doxorubicin /docetaxel (AT arm) showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), Grade 3-4 infection (8% versus 2.4%), Grade 3-4 diarrhea (7.5% versus 1.4%), severe asthenia (8.5% versus 2.4%), and severe pain (2.8% versus 0%) than the docxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a higher incidence of severe  anaemia  (15.8%  versus  8.5%)  than  AT  arm,  and,  in  addition,  a  higher  incidence  of  severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 20% (13.1 % versus  6.1%),  absolute  LVEF  decrease ≥ 30%  (6.2%  versus  1.1%).  Overall  the  combination doxorubicin/docetaxel seems to be less well tolerated than the AC combination. However, this toxicity appears  to  be  predicatble  and  manageable,  as  indicated  by  the  discontinuation  rates,  which  were similar  in  the  two  treatment  arms  and  the  quality  of  life,  which  was  comparable  and  stable  during treatment and follow-up in both arms. Moreover, toxic deaths occurred only in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive  heart  failure)  and  in  4  patients  in  the  AC  arm  (1  due  to  septic  shock  and  3  due  to congestive heart failure).

## First line treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

In  general,  the  investigational  treatment  docetaxel  plus  cisplatin  and  the  control  treatment  V+Cis showed a comparable safety profile. The treatment duration was comparable for both groups despite the higher number of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events in the V+Cis treatment group. When  the  safety  profile  of  the  combination  D75+Cis  is  compared  to  the  known  safety  profile  of approved  indications  (docetaxel  monotherapy  and  docetaxel  in  combination  with  doxorubicin)  no unlabelled undesirable effects are apparent. In general, the incidence of undesirable effects was in the range  of  that  found  with  docetaxel  monotherapy  at  the  dose  of  75  mg/m 2 or  with  docetaxel  in combination  with  doxorubicin  (DA).  The  incidence  of  neurotoxicity  of  D75+Cis  is  in  the  range reported for docetaxel monotherapy at a dose of 100 mg/m 2. . Higher incidences were reported only for vomiting (D75+Cis: 53.4 %, DA: 45 %) and anorexia (D75+Cis 28.8 %, D75 single agent: 19 %).

## Adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in combination with doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide

The safety profile of docetaxel associated with AC is as expected. However in the adjuvant treatment of  early  breast  cancer  severe,  serious  and  long-term  toxicity  is  of  even  more  interest  than  in  other applications.  In  comparison  with  the  control  arm,  TAC  safety  profile  is  worse  and  raises  serious concerns in terms of hematotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, colitis, and leukaemia.

Approximately  one  third  of  patients  experience  severe  AEs  and  serious  AEs.  More  than  8 %  of patients show serious and severe AEs related to study treatment. This is mainly due to the incidences of  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and  fever  in  the  absence  of  infection,  which  are  clearly  more frequent during TAC treatment. Consequently the use of G-CSF and antibiotics was much higher in the TAC group. Prophylactic antibiotics were compulsory for TAC treatment. Approximately 30  % of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients received G-CSF as curative or prophylactic treatment in the TAC group compared to 5.6 % in the  FAC group. In spite of this prophylaxis there were twice as much neutropenic infections in the TAC group. Six percent of the patients withdrew from the trial due to adverse events.

Generally the pattern of the reported AEs is as expected for the combination with doxorubicin. There were  clearly  more  AEs  of  fluid  retention,  anemia  (including  transfusion  requirements,  myalgia, stomatitis,  neuro-sensory,  taste  perversion,  thrombocytopenia  and  arthralgia  in  the  TAC  group compared to the control. Vomiting was observed more often in the FAC group.

Overall the toxicity is considerably high but it is manageable with prophylactic antibiotics and often G-CSF and close monitoring of the patients during the treatment phase. Appropriate information and precautions have been included in the SPC.

With respect to long-term toxicity the profile of TAC is also unfavourable compared to FAC: Alopecia remains in  3.2 % of TAC patients (vs. 1.4  % FAC), more TAC-treated patients stay with ongoing neuro-sensory toxicity (TAC: n = 9, FAC n=2), peripheral edema (TAC: n = 18, FAC n=3) than FACtreated patients. Cardiac failure was observed in 12 TAC patients and 4 FAC patients. So far 3 patients in the TAC group and 1 in the FAC group developed acute leukemia.

The occurrence of secondary leukaemia is a well known toxicity of anthracyclines. This adverse effect is  under review for docetaxel. The possibility of an increased risk with the association of docetaxel and doxorubicin cannot be disregarded.

Furthermore, the SPC section 4.4 is amended in order to give appropriate information regarding the management of acute toxicity (neutropenia, gastrointestinal toxicity) and description of late toxicity (cardiotoxicity, leukaemia). Since some toxicities remain a concern in an adjuvant setting, an intensive monitoring  concerning  cardiotoxicity,  secondary  leukaemia,  and  serious  gastrointestinal  toxicity (including colitis, perforation, and hemorrhagic diarrhea) is ongoing.

## In combination with capecitabine for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer

For  the  investigation  of  safety,  all  clinical  adverse  events  encountered  during  the  study,  as  well  as abnormal laboratory test values and results of regular physical examinations (vital signs) had to be clearly  recorded  in  the  CRF.  All  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  abnormal  laboratory  parameters  were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute of Canada Common Toxicity Criteria (NCIC CTC) grading system.

The safety of the combination of capecitabine plus ('reduced') docetaxel vs. 'full dose' docetaxel can be briefly summarised as follows: Overall, the results are consistent with the predictions of the safety profile of the single substances. In general, the combination is more toxic than docetaxel monotherapy.

The  difference  is  mainly  due  to  'hand-foot  syndrome'  (HFS)  and  to  a  lesser  extent  also  due  to gastrointestinal  symptoms,  namely  diarrhoea  and  stomatitis.  The  physician  can  handle  the  AEs  by dose modifications without affecting efficacy in the combination arm.

Age of more than 60 years represents a risk factor for treatment related grade 3 - 4 AEs, serious AEs and  withdrawals  from  treatment.  Based  on  the  results  of  this  subgroup  analysis,  a  starting  dose reduction of capecitabine to 75% (950 mg/m 2 twice daily) is recommended for patients 60 years of age or more treated with the combination of capecitabine plus docetaxel and if no toxicity is observed the dose of capecitabine may be cautiously escalated to 1250 mg/m 2 twice daily.

## Safety in Her2+ metastatic breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab

The data set for the safety evaluation was based on the pivotal study M77001 and on the Japanese clinical  pharmacology  study  JP16003.  Additional  information  is  provided  from  2  interim  safety reports and from published literature reports. Approximately 700 patients with HER2-positive MBC exposed to Trastuzumab plus docetaxel have been treated. However, the database with fully assessable safety information is limited and consists mainly of the data from the pivotal study.

Patients  always  received  Trastuzumab  in  the  recommended  dose,  however  the  dosing  regimen  of docetaxel varied across studies. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with no new or unexpected safety signals.

The  incidence of common,  non-serious  adverse  events  was  higher  in the combination  with trastuzumab, as was the incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) and serious adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The addition of Trastuzumab to Taxotere increased the incidence of transient grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% versus 22% in the Taxotere alone arm). The same was observed for febrile neutropenia (23% versus 17%), suggesting that Trastuzumab may exacerbate the Taxotere-associated myelosuppression. No  new  concerns  have  been  identified  regarding  the  severity  and  frequency  of  infusion-related reactions  with  the  combination  Trastuzumab+  Taxotere.  However,  the  risk  of  neutropenic  events  is increased and exceeds that of Taxotere alone.

There were fewer safety related withdrawals for patients in the combination arm.

The safety profile described in the main analysis (6 months after last patient entered) has not changed with the addition of data up to the 12 month cut-off. No new unexpected adverse events have occurred and the relative incidence of different types of AEs is similar to that seen at the 6-month analysis.

The incidence of decreases in LVEF (falls &gt; 15% or absolute value &lt;40%) remains the same.

It  can  be  concluded  that  no  new  emerging  safety  concerns  could  be  identified  and  in  principle,  the toxicity profile is consistent with that of the two drugs alone.

## Safety in Hormone refractory prostate cancer patients

The indication 'prostate cancer' differs from others licensed in the respect that the patients are elderly men,  who  are  more  likely  to  suffer  from  infra-  and  supravesical  obstruction  and  resulting  renal impairment.  Patients  with  renal  impairment  (elevated  creatinine)  have  not  been  included  in  the submitted clinical trial.

The most common adverse events are alopecia, nail changes, anorexia, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, and tearing. In principle no new emerging safety signals were identified. Among the most commonly reported and possibly severe adverse events of docetaxel are anaemia, neutropenia, sensory and motor neuropathy, and gastro-intestinal symptoms.

More severe and serious (grade 3-4) adverse events were observed in the Taxotere groups (45.8 % and 43.0  %)  than  in  the  mitoxantrone  group  (34.6%).  Laboratory  safety  data  also  indicated  a  higher toxicity  of  Taxotere  as  compared  with  mitoxantrone  (anaemia,  grade  3-4  neutropenia,  febrile neutropenia,  and  neutropenic  infections).  Neurotoxicity  and  gastrointestinal  toxicity  was  more common  in  the  Taxotere  groups,  whereas  mitoxantrone  exhibited  more  cardiotoxicity,  resulting  in decreased left ventricular function. However the rate of cardiotoxicity in the Taxotere groups is not negligible, particularly in this aged population.

Otherwise,  the  safety  profile  of  Taxotere  is  modified  in  the  oldest  treated  population  (&gt;75),  as follows :  increased  rate  of  fatigue,  infection,  gastrointestinal  toxicities,  peripheral  oedema,  sensory neuropathy, nail change and anorexia. This severity and seriousness of fluid retention in older patients, including an analysis of risk factors, is detailed in the section 4.4 of the SmPC.

## 5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

The  CPMP  recommended  in  1995  that  the  Marketing  Authorisation  should  be  granted  under exceptional circumstances, as information from comparative randomised Phase III clinical studies was not yet available at that time. In 1997, two Phase III randomised comparative trials in anthracycline or alkylating  agents  resistant  patients  were  submitted  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  and confirmed  the  favourable  benefit/risk  profile  of  Taxotere.  Since  all  specific  obligations  stated  in Annex II C of the CPMP Opinion dated 19 December 1996 have been fulfilled and the benefit/risk profile has been reassessed, there were no remaining grounds for the Marketing Authorisation to be kept under exceptional circumstances. The Marketing Authorisation has been amended accordingly.

The  CPMP  Members  have,  during  the  review  process  of  the  initial  and  subsequent  applications, agreed that there are  sufficient clinical data to support clinical safety and efficacy allowing a positive recommendation for granting the Marketing Authorisation for Taxotere for the following indications:

## Breast cancer

TAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node- positive breast cancer.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TAXOTERE (docetaxel) in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition.

TAXOTERE (docetaxel) monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent.

TAXOTERE (docetaxel) in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

TAXOTERE (docetaxel) in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included an anthracycline.

## Non-small cell lung cancer

TAXOTERE (docetaxel) is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

TAXOTERE (docetaxel) in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for this condition.

## Prostate cancer

TAXOTERE  (docetaxel)  in  combination  with  prednisone  or  prednisolone  is  indicated  for  the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

The  use  of  docetaxel  should  be  confined  to  units  specialised  in  the  administration  of  cytotoxic chemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use of anticancer chemotherapy.
