| S/0044              | 6th annual re-assessment. The efficacy and safety data collected as part of the specific obligation for Obizur during the period covered by this annual re-assessment confirmed its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 22/04/2022 | 20/06/2022 | SmPC                             | The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance with the specific obligations and the impact of the data submitted by the MAH on the benefit/risk profile of the medicinal product, concluded that marketing authorisation of Obizur should be varied. Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated with the following information: 'If testing of anti-rpFVIII antibodies is negative at baseline, a dose lower than the recommended 200 U/kg may be used as the initial treatment dose. Clinical response should be closely monitored as dosing below 200 U/kg has been associated with a lack of efficacy (see section 4.4).'' |

| R/0033    | Renewal of the marketing authorisation. | 17/09/2020 | 16/11/2020 | SmPC and PL | Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Obizur in the approved indication remains favourable, but recommended that one additional five-year renewal be required based on the following pharmacovigilance grounds: Safety issues identified with Obizur warrant additional evaluations and analyses conducted in a second renewal: Lack of drug effect Summary tabulation cumulatively lists 108 serious adverse reactions. Leading SOC at the PT level is SOC 'General and administration site disorders' with 30 SARs, 18 referring to PTs related to drug effect decreased/drug ineffective/ Condition aggravated and thus accounting for 60 %of the serious adverse event PTs reported in this SOC. In 'cumulative all' events (including non-serious) 25 out of 46 events in SOC 'General disorders' refer to lack of drug effect-PTs which is 54 %of all PTs in this SOC. In view of the committees lack of drug effect therefore represents a prominent concern for Obizur. Based on the limited information available on case level many cases might be associated with dosing other than the recommended dose in the SmPC despite the additional risk minimisation measures. While a minority of patients only receive the currently recommended dose of 200 IU there seem to be a high number of 'lack of drug effect' cases of which the majority (68%) is associated with under dosing. Furthermore, it seems that that under dose may be also associated with occurrence of anamnestic reaction leading |

Anamnestic reaction Thirty-nine (39) serious adverse events were reported through clinical trials for Susoctocog alfa. SOC Immune system disorders is presenting with two SAEs, one thereof referring to anamnestic and one to anaphylactic reaction. Furthermore, during the current renewal interval SUSAR 'anamnestic reaction' was reported in the clinical trial CHAWI (study in patients with congenital haemophilia A with inhibitors undergoing surgical or other invasive procedures; 241502). Out of the eight subjects included in the trial six developed new inhibitors (anti-rpFVIII or FVIII) or experienced an increase in their previously known FVIII inhibitors. The committees recommended that anamnestic reaction be explicitly included in the safety concerns for the product as a separate identified risk. The MAH will communicate the risk of 'lack of efficacy' and in particular the risk of anamnestic reaction associated with under dosing by an update of the educational material in due time following this renewal.   |

| II/0030 | Update of the sections 4.4 and 4.8 of SmPC to add information on anamnestic reaction and to list it with the frequency very common. The Package leaflet has been updated accordingly.

These anamnestic rises may result in lack of response to OBIZUR. Furthermore, anamnestic reaction was included in the ADR table with the frequency 'very common'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
