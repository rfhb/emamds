## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for umeclidinium bromide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

- 1  serious  ADR    of  'ocular  hypertension'  with  positive  de-challenge  and  2  non-serious 'intraocular pressure increased' have been reported cumulatively with Umeclidinium bromide therapy;
- 'Ocular hypertension' or 'intraocular pressure increased' are known class effect of antimuscarinic  that could lead to glaucoma;
- The  Product  information  of  Umeclidinium  bromide/Vilanterol  has  been  recently  updated  to include  the undesirable effect 'intraocular pressure increased';

Based  on  the  above,  the  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  Umeclidinium  bromide should be updated to reflect the undesirable effects 'intraocular pressure increased' under the SOC 'eye disorders' with frequency 'not known'.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considers that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing umeclidinium bromide are warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for umeclidinium bromide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing umeclidinium bromide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
