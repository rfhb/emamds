(acne inversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

## Crohn's disease

Halimatoz is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adult patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and / or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.

## Paediatric Crohn's disease

Halimatoz is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including primary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and / or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or have contraindications for such therapies. Ulcerative colitis Halimatoz is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Uveitis Halimatoz  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  non-infectious  intermediate,  posterior  and  panuveitis  in adult  patients  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to  corticosteroids,  in  patients  in  need  of corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. Paediatric uveitis Halimatoz is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Halimatoz treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Halimatoz is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Halimatoz (see section 4.4). Patients treated with Halimatoz should be given the Patient Reminder Card. After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Halimatoz if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. Medicinal product no longer authorised

During treatment with Halimatoz, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and / or immunomodulatory agents) should be optimised.

## Posology

## Rheumatoid arthritis

The recommended dose of Halimatoz for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be continued during treatment with Halimatoz.

Glucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during treatment with Halimatoz. Regarding combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1.

In monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other week.

Available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.

## Dose interruption

<!-- image -->

The recommended Halimatoz dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 160 mg initially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with Halimatoz, if necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with Halimatoz.

There may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. Available data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or longer resulted in the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose interruption. Ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic arthritis The recommended dose of Halimatoz for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. Psoriasis The recommended dose of Halimatoz for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered subcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Continued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. Beyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of continued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with an inadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate response is achieved with 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be reduced to 40 mg every other week. Hidradenitis suppurativa Medicinal product no longer authorised

Continued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement within this time period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Should treatment be interrupted, Halimatoz 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be reintroduced (see section 5.1).

The benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see section 5.1).

## Crohn's disease

The recommended Halimatoz induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction.

After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Halimatoz and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Halimatoz may be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since the previous dose. During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. Some patients who experience decrease in their response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Halimatoz every week or 80 mg every other week. Some patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy through week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. Ulcerative colitis The recommended Halimatoz induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. Some patients who experience decrease in their response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Halimatoz every week or 80 mg every other week. Available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. Halimatoz therapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Uveitis

The recommended dose of Halimatoz for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited experience in the initiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with Halimatoz can be initiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two weeks after initiating treatment with Halimatoz.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a yearly basis (see section 5.1).

Continued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within this time period. If re-treatment with adalimumab is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be followed. The safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of 13 months. There is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. Adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) There are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. The posology of adalimumab in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see section 5.2). The recommended Halimatoz dose is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at week 1 via subcutaneous injection. In adolescent patients with inadequate response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with Halimatoz if necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with Halimatoz. Continued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement within this time period. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Should treatment be interrupted, Halimatoz may be re-introduced as appropriate.

The benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data in section 5.1)

There is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric Crohn's disease

The recommended dose of Halimatoz for patients with Crohn's disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on body weight (table 4). Halimatoz is administered via subcutaneous injection.

When Halimatoz therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients &lt; 30 kg or 80 mg for patients ≥ 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are available on the use of an adalimumab loading dose in children &lt; 6 years of age (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is no relevant use of Halimatoz in children aged less than 2 years in this indication.

It is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a yearly basis (see section 5.1).

## Paediatric ulcerative colitis

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab in children aged 4-17 years have not yet been established. No data are available.

There is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication.

Patients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Halimatoz. Because the elimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period.

Psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis There is no relevant use of adalimumab in the paediatric population for the indications of ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Method of administration Halimatoz is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package leaflet. Adalimumab is available in other strengths and presentations. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see section 4.4). Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III / IV) (see section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Infections Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment with Halimatoz should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Halimatoz should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections ).

Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Halimatoz should be monitored closely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Halimatoz should be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Halimatoz in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications.

## Serious infections

Serious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or other opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab.

Other serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and septicaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis. Before initiation of therapy with Halimatoz, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive ('latent') tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Halimatoz therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). In all situations described below, the benefit / risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered. If latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be consulted. If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Halimatoz, and in accordance with local recommendations. Use of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Halimatoz in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab.

Patients should  be instructed to seek  medical  advice if signs / symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis  infection  (e.g.,  persistent  cough,  wasting/weight  loss,  low  grade  fever,  listlessness) occur during or after therapy with Halimatoz.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other opportunistic infections

Opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving adalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes.

For patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dyspnoea, and / or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Halimatoz should be promptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections.

Serious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab administration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Halimatoz should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

Hepatitis B reactivation Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, who are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Halimatoz. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Halimatoz should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Halimatoz should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. Neurological events TNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and / or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including  Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Halimatoz in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Halimatoz should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with noninfectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Halimatoz therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. Allergic reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immunosuppression

In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte / macrophages, and neutrophils.

Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.

Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including adalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.

With current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations.

Rare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in young adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6mercaptopurine and Halimatoz should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Halimatoz cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional caution should be exercised in considering Halimatoz treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). All patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of nonmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Halimatoz. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8). In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking.

## Haematologic reactions

Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Halimatoz. Discontinuation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Halimatoz therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities.

## Vaccinations

Similar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.

It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Halimatoz therapy.

## Surgery

Patients on Halimatoz may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months following the mother's last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. Congestive heart failure In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Halimatoz should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Halimatoz is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Halimatoz must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. Autoimmune processes Treatment with Halimatoz may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Halimatoz and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Halimatoz should not be given (see section 4.8). Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5). Concomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDs (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see section 4.5). Medicinal product no longer authorised

There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on Halimatoz should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.

## Small bowel obstruction

Failure to respond to treatment for Crohn's disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture that may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause strictures.

## Elderly

The frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7 %) was higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5 %). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.

Paediatric population See Vaccinations above. Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). The combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 'Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists'). The combination of adalimumab and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 'Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists'). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of child bearing potential Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Halimatoz treatment. Pregnancy Medicinal product no longer authorised

A large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab resulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn.

In a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn's disease (CD) treated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7 %) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8 %) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted OR 1.31, 95 % CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5 %) in the adalimumabtreated women with CD and 3/32 (9.4 %) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95 % CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design.

In a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available (see section 5.3).

Due to its inhibition of TNF α ,  adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.

Adalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab during pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months following the mother's last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. Breast-feeding Limited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1 % to 1 % of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns / infants are anticipated. Consequently, Halimatoz can be used during breastfeeding. Fertility Preclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Halimatoz may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual impairment may occur following administration of Halimatoz (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Adalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitisrelated arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients receiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, controlled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9 % for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4 % for controltreated patients.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain.

Serious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

affect the immune system and their use may affect the body's defence against infection and cancer.

Fatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV reactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been reported with use of adalimumab.

Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

## Paediatric population

In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on postmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency in table 6 below: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency seen among the various indications has been included.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Injection site reactions

In the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and / or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 7.2 % of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.

## Infections

In the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in the adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated patients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.

The incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and 0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control-treated patients.

In controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections (including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of tuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary  histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders No malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years during adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with Crohn's disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. During the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per 1,000 patient years among 5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 patient years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for adalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95 % confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient years among adalimumab-treated patients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95 % confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient years among control patients. The rate (95 % confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient years among control patients.

When combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension studies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 patient years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient years.

In post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment years. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 0.2 and 0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4).

Rare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab (see section 4.4).

## Autoantibodies

Patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis studies I-V. In these trials, 11.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1 % of placebo and active control-treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms.

In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3 % of adalimumabtreated patients and 0.6 % of control-treated patients.

Hepato-biliary events In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6 % of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3 % of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to &lt; 4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with a control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9 % of controlled-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6 % (5 / 192) of patients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. In  controlled  Phase  3  trials  of  adalimumab  in  patients  with  plaque  Psoriasis  with  a  control  period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8 % of adalimumabtreated patients and 1.8 % of control-treated patients. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 days and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4 % of control-treated patients.

Across all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases elevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

marketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, such as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab.

## Concurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine

In adult Crohn's disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse events were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine / 6-mercaptopurine compared with adalimumab alone.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg / kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα ) inhibitors, ATC code: L04AB04 Halimatoz is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. Mechanism of action Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50  of 0.1-0.2 nM). Pharmacodynamic effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

After treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.

A rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with adalimumab. In patients with Crohn's disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumabtreated patients.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Rheumatoid arthritis

Adalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.

RA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had insufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.

The primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the percentage of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and V had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.

RA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses of 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. RA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have been intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab every week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an openlabel extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab / MTX was administered every other week up to 10 years. RA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, antirheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and / or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. RA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week / methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week up to 10 years.

## ACR response

The percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent across RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in table 7.

In RA study III, these improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks. In the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained response when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. Among those, 86 patients (75.4 %) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 41 patients (36 %) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0 %) had ACR 20 responses; 56 patients (69.1 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1 %) had ACR 70 responses. In RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was statistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p &lt; 0.001).

In RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment.

In RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at week 104 (see table 8).

## Radiographic response

In RA study III, where adalimumab-treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of approximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. Adalimumab / methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see table 9).

In the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less.

In RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued treatment maintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was maintained through that time.

JSN score 2.0 (1.2-2.8) a p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. b p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test c p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy using the Mann-Whitney U test Following 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression (change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score ≤ 0.5) was significantly higher with adalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy (63.8 % and 61.2 % respectively) compared to methotrexate monotherapy (37.4 % and 33.5 % respectively, p &lt; 0.001) and adalimumab monotherapy (50.7 %, p &lt; 0.002 and 44.5 %, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). In the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at Year 10 in the modified Total Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomised to methotrexate monotherapy, adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy, respectively. The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3 %, 23.7 % and 36.7 % respectively. Quality of life and physical function Health-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses / schedules of adalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses / schedules of adalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV).

In RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 showed greater improvement (p &lt; 0.001) for adalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy versus methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through week 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in physical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment.

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in phase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTXtreated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been withdrawn from MTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone ( ≤ 0.2 mg / kg / day or 10 mg / day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg / m 2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in table 11. Table 11 distribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase age group 4 to 7 years 8 to 12 years 13 to 17 years Patients demonstrating a paediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into the double blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg / m 2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were defined as a worsening of ≥ 30 % from baseline i n ≥ 3 of 6 paediatric ACR core criteri a, ≥ 2 active joints, and improvement of &gt; 30 % in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease flare, patients were eligible to enrol into the open label extension phase (table 12). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age group 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. Overall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into consideration, Halimatoz is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as monotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). pJIA II The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children (2-&lt; 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing &lt; 15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg / m 2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. At week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5 % and 90.0 %, respectively, using the observed data approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50 / 70 / 90 at week 12 and week 24 were 90.3 % / 61.3 % / 38.7 % and 83.3 % / 73.3 % / 36.7 %, respectively. Amongst those who responded (paediatric ACR 30) at week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the paediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up to 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this time period.

## Enthesitis-related arthritis

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised to receive either 24 mg / m 2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg / m 2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from Baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6 % (median percent change -88.9 %) in patients in the adalimumab group compared to -11.6 % (median percent change -50.0 %) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84 %) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), paediatric ACR 50 response, and paediatric ACR 70 response.

## Axial spondyloarthritis

## Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

Adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline score of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in all groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1 %) patients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4 %) patients with glucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. Subjects (n = 215, 54.7 %) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received early escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently treated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. In the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with adalimumab compared to placebo. Significant response was first observed at week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks (table 13). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Subjects who flared during the double-blind period were allowed adalimumab 40 mg eow rescue therapy for at least 12 weeks.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with no flare by Week 68 of the study. Flare was defined as ASDAS ≥ 2.1 at two consecutive visits four weeks apart. A greater proportion of patients on adalimumab had no disease flare during the double-blind period, when compared with those on placebo (70.4% vs. 47.1%, p&lt;0.001) (Figure 1).

Psoriatic arthritis Adalimumab, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, PsA studies I and II. PsA study I with 24 week duration, treated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy and of these, approximately 50 % were taking methotrexate. PsA study II with 12-week duration, treated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week (eow). There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of adalimumab in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-like psoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied.

ACR responses in PsA study I were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. ACR responses were maintained in the open-label extension study for up to 136 weeks.

Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on adalimumab or placebo and at week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used.

Adalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean ± SD) 0.8 ± 2.5 in the placebo group (at week 24) compared with 0.0 ± 1.9; (p &lt; 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week 48).

Psoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate and placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter dose increases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are no data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving MTX who achieved a ≥ PASI 50 response at week 8 and / or 12 did not receive further dose increases. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score ranged from 'mild' (&lt; 1 %) to 'moderate' (48 %) to 'severe' (46 %) to 'very severe' (6 %).

In subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 (n=102), 84 % continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab-treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. Improved physical function continued during the open label extension up to week 136. Psoriasis The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (≥ 10 % BSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12 or ≥ 10) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73 % of patients enrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with concomitant hand and / or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-blind study (Psoriasis Study III). Psoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least a PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75 % relative to baseline), entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained ≥P ASI 75 response at week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in period A, were re-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from 'moderate' (53 % of subjects included) to 'severe' (41 %) to 'very severe' (6 %).

Patients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an openlabel extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks.

In Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response from baseline at Week 16 (see tables 17 and 18).

Of the patients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-label extension trial, 38 % (25 / 66) and 55 % (36 / 66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively. A total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy for 52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7 % and 59.0 %, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, were considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 69.6 % and 55.7 %, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks).

A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an openlabel extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a median time to relapse (decline to PGA 'moderate' or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of these patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5 % (218 / 285) of patients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA 'clear' or 'minimal' after 16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1 % [123 / 178] and 88.8 % [95 / 107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal. Significant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX (Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, improvements in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant compared to placebo.

In an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50 %, 26.4 % (92 / 349) and 37.8 % (132 / 349) of patients achieved PASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively.

Psoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands and/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3 %, respectively [P = 0.014]).

The efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 paediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA ≥ 4 or &gt; 20 % BSA involvement or &gt; 10 % BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 with clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy.

Psoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients with moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included the Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see table 19). Adalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin involvement (BSA ≥ 10 % (60 % of patients) and BSA &lt; 10 % and ≥ 5 % (40 % of patients)).

Patients received adalimumab 0.8 mg / kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg / kg eow (up to 20 mg), or methotrexate 0.1-0.4 mg / kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At Week 16, more patients randomised to adalimumab 0.8 mg / kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to 0.4 mg / kg eow or MTX (table 20).

Patients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to 36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). Patients were then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg / kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response rates observed during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 75 response of 78.9 % (15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6 % (10 of 19 subjects). In the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained for up to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. Hidradenitis suppurativa The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3month trial of systemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III disease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. Study HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In period A, patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in period A were rerandomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in period B. Study HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In period A, patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg every week starting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3 % of patients had continued baseline oral antibiotic therapy during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in period A were re-randomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to placebo in period A were assigned to receive placebo in period B. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension study in which adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab population was 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily.

## Clinical Response

Reduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was assessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50 % reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo achieved HiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced a clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see table 21). Patients treated with adalimumab had significantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment.

Treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas. Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in the first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group experienced worsening of abscesses (23.0 % vs 11.4 %, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0 % vs 13.9 %, respectively). Greater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skinspecific  health-related  quality  of  life,  as  measured  by  the  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index (DLQI;  Studies  HS-I  and  HS-II),  patient  global  satisfaction  with  medication  treatment  as measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical health as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I). In patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at week 12, the HiSCR rate at week 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing frequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see table 22).

Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI &lt; 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I (CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2. In CD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further evaluated.

a patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly after 12 weeks of treatment. b patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no improvement were required to discontinue from the studies and were counted as non-responders. Among patients who were at least partial responders at week 12, and who received continuous weekly adalimumab therapy, the HiSCR rate at week 48 was 64.3 % and at week 96 was 65.1 %. Longer term treatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. Among patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, the HiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar to that observed before withdrawal (56.0 %). Adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa There are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab for the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and exposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on crossindication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more frequent doses (see section 5.2). Crohn's disease The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and / or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80 % of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications.

Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were randomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed separately from those not in clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8.

Adalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body weight (&lt; 40 kg or ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score &gt; 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been intolerant to infliximab.

* p &lt; 0.001 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions ** p &lt; 0.02 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions a of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline Among patients who were not in response at week 4, 43 % of adalimumab maintenance patients responded by week 12 compared to 30 % of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that some patients who have not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through Week 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2). 117 / 276 patients from CD study I and 272 / 777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed through at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, continued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 patients, respectively. Quality of life In CD study I and CD study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients randomised to adalimumab 80 / 40 mg and 160 / 80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 and 56 in CD study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group.

Statistically and clinically significant improvements from Baseline were also observed in both treatment groups for quality of life parameters (including IMPACT III). One hundred patients (n = 100) from the Paediatric CD Study continued in an open-label long-term extension study. After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0 % (37 / 50) of the 50 patients remaining in the study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0 % (46 / 50) of patients continued to be in clinical response per PCDAI. Ulcerative colitis The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2, or 80 mg adalimumab at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. After week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg eow. Clinical remission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore &gt; 1) was assessed at week 8. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg eow thereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of remission at week 8 and for maintenance of remission at week 52.

Patients induced with 160 / 80 mg adalimumab achieved clinical remission versus placebo at week 8 in statistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18 % vs. 9 % respectively, p = 0.031) and study UC-II (17 % vs. 9 % respectively, p = 0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with adalimumab who were in remission at week 8, 21 / 41 (51 %) were in remission at week 52.

Approximately 40 % of patients in study UC-II had failed prior anti-TNF treatment with infliximab. The efficacy of adalimumab in those patients was reduced compared to that in anti-TNF naïve patients. Among patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, week 52 remission was achieved by 3 % on placebo and 10 % on adalimumab. Patients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term extension study (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75 % (301 / 402) continued to be in clinical remission per partial Mayo score. Hospitalisation rates During 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related hospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The number of all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs . 0.26 per patient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related hospitalisations were 0.12 per patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year.

In study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score.

## Uveitis

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg / day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of prednisone 60 mg / day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 15.

Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg / day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19.

The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was 'time to treatment failure'. Treatment failure was defined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

Patients who completed studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term extension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on study medication beyond week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. Clinical Response Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see table 29). Both studies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus placebo (see Figure 2). Table 29 time to treatment failure in studies UV I and UV II Note: treatment failure at or after week 6 (study UV I), or at or after week 2 (study UV II), was counted as event.

Note: P# = Placebo (Number of Events/Number at Risk); A# = Adalimumab (Number of Events/Number at Risk). In Study UV I statistically significant differences in favour of adalimumab versus placebo were observed for each component of treatment failure. In Study UV II, statistically significant differences were observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of adalimumab. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Of the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of studies UV I and UV II, 60 subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to  complications secondary to diabetic retinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74 %) reached 78 weeks of openlabel adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3 %) were in quiescence (no active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose ≤ 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2 %) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (&lt; 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6 % of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were generally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. Overall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18 % discontinued due to adverse events, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8 % due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment.

## Quality of Life

Patient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, using the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with statistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and total score in study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in study UV II. Vision related effects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in study UV I and for colour vision, peripheral vision and near vision in study UV II.

## Paediatric Uveitis

<!-- image -->

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled study of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to &lt; 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious anterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if &lt; 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week in combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. The primary endpoint was 'time to treatment failure'. The criteria determining treatment failure were worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with development of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted use of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. Clinical Response Adalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3, P &lt; 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects treated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects treated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown by the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). Medicinal product no longer authorised

After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64 %. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg / kg, concentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg / kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15 ml / hour, the distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96 % of those in serum.

Immunogenicity Anti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the occurrence of adverse events. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with the reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption and distribution Medicinal product no longer authorised

Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg / ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg / ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

proportionally with dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week.

Following the administration of 24 mg / m 2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 µg / ml (102 % CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg / ml (47.7 % CV) with concomitant methotrexate.

In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to &lt; 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing &lt; 15 kg dosed with adalimumab 24 mg / m 2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was 6.0 ± 6.1 µg / ml (101 % CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 ± 5.6 µg / ml (71.2 % CV) with concomitant methotrexate.

In patients with Crohn's disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 µg / ml during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µg / ml during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg / ml were observed in Crohn's disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week.

Following the administration of 24 mg / m 2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μ g / ml for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μ g / ml with concomitant methotrexate. In adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 µg / ml during adalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. Following the administration of 0.8 mg / kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab trough concentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 µg / ml (79 % CV). Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state concentration at week 68 was 8.0 ± 4.6 µg/ml. In adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μ g / ml at week 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were approximately 8 to 10 μ g / ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. Adalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients (paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn's disease, and enthesitis-related arthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since exposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and inadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was 160 / 80 mg or 80 / 40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. At week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40 / 20 mg eow) or Low Dose (20 / 10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (± SD) serum adalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7±6.6 µg/ml for patients ≥ 40 kg (160 / 80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 µg / ml for patients &lt; 40 kg (80 / 40 mg).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (± SD) adalimumab trough concentrations at week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 µg / ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 µg / ml for the Low Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to receive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose-escalated from eow to weekly regimen, the mean (± SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 were 15.3 ± 11.4 μ g / ml (40 / 20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 ± 3.5 μ g / ml (20 / 10 mg, weekly).

In patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 µg / ml during the induction period.  Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 µg / ml were observed in ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week.

In adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg adalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of approximately 8 to 10 µg/ml. Adalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients (paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn's disease, and enthesitis-related arthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children &lt; 6 years. The predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial increase in systemic exposure. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation predicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other week when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, patients with adolescent HS, and paedia tric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD). Exposure-response relationship in paediatric population On the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response relationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent adalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response (EC50) was 3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1 -6 μg/ml). Exposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, respectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg /mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, respectively). Elimination Medicinal product no longer authorised

Population pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight differences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum levels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower in patients with measurable AAA.

## Hepatic or renal impairment

Adalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity / perinatal developmental study has been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg / kg (9-17 monkeys / group) and has revealed no evidence of harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Halimatoz 20 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe adalimumab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts using this medicine because it contains important information.

-Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -Your doctor will also give you a Patient Reminder Card , which contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before your child begins using Halimatoz and during treatment with Halimatoz. Keep this Patient Reminder Card with you during your treatment and for 4 months after your (or your child's) last injection of Halimatoz. -If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child's. -If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Halimatoz is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before your child uses Halimatoz 3. How to use Halimatoz 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Halimatoz 6. Contents of the pack and other information 7. Instructions for use 1. What Halimatoz is and what it is used for Halimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body's immune (defence) system. Halimatoz is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: · polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, · enthesitis-related arthritis · paediatric plaque psoriasis, · paediatric Crohn's disease, · paediatric non-infectious uveitis. The active ingredient in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target in the body. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF α ), which is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNFα, Halimatoz blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these diseases.

Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis

Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of the joints that usually first appear in childhood.

Halimatoz is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Halimatoz to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.

## Paediatric plaque psoriasis

Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body's immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells.

Halimatoz is also used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. Paediatric Crohn's disease Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. Halimatoz is used to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of his / her disease. Paediatric non-infectious uveitis Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation leads to a decrease of vision and / or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Halimatoz works by reducing this inflammation. Halimatoz is used to treat children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the front of the eye. Your child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of his / her disease. 2. What you need to know before your child uses Halimatoz Do not use Halimatoz · if your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

- if your child has a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is important that you tell your doctor if your child shows symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see 'Warnings and precautions').
- if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition (see 'Warnings and precautions').

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Halimatoz.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Allergic reaction

- If your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash, do not inject more Halimatoz and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare cases, these reactions can be life-threatening.

## Infection

- If your child has an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example leg ulcer), consult your doctor before starting Halimatoz. If you are unsure, contact your doctor.
- Your child might get infections more easily while he / she is receiving Halimatoz treatment. This risk may increase if your child's lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). · In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if your child shows symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz. Tuberculosis (TB) · As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Halimatoz. This will include a thorough medical evaluation including your child's medical history and screening tests (for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your child's Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if he / she has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has had preventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. Travel / recurrent infection · Tell your doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. · Tell your doctor if your child has a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections. Hepatitis B virus · Tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he / she has active HBV infection or if you think he / she might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test your child for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Surgery or dental procedures

- If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that your child is taking Halimatoz. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz.

## Demyelinating disease

- If your child has or develops demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he / she should receive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or continue to receive Halimatoz. Tell your doctor immediately if he / she experiences symptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body.

## Vaccine

- Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and should not be given during treatment with Halimatoz in case they cause infections. Check with your doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Halimatoz.

If your child receives Halimatoz while she is pregnant, her baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose she received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your child's Halimatoz use during herpregnancy so they can decide when her baby should receive any vaccine.

There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF α blocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNFα blocker is appropriate.

- Heart failure · It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. If he / she has mild heart failure and is being treated with Halimatoz, the heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor. If your child develops new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale · In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or help stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, or he / she bruises or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. Cancer · There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or other TNF α blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Halimatoz, the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Halimatoz. · In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Other medicines and Halimatoz

## Driving and using machines

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. Halimatoz can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Your child should not take Halimatoz with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other TNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. Pregnancy and breast-feeding · Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after the last Halimatoz treatment. · If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor for advice before taking this medicine. · Halimatoz should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. · According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not receive adalimumab. · Halimatoz can be used during breast-feeding. · If your child  receives Halimatoz during her pregnancy, the baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. · It is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care professionals about her Halimatoz use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on vaccines see the 'Warnings and precautions' section).

What Halimatoz is and what it is used for Halimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body's immune (defence) system. Halimatoz is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: · rheumatoid arthritis, · polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, · enthesitis-related arthritis, · ankylosing spondylitis, · axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, · psoriatic arthritis, · psoriasis, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- hidradenitis suppurativa,
- Crohn's disease,
- ulcerative colitis and
- non-infectious uveitis.

The active ingredient in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target in the body.

The target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF α ), which is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNFα, Halimatoz blocks its

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

action and reduces the inflammation in these diseases.

## Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.

Halimatoz is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to treat your rheumatoid arthritis.

Halimatoz can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. Halimatoz can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. Usually, Halimatoz is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, Halimatoz can be given alone. Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of the joints that usually first appear in childhood. Halimatoz is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Halimatoz to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. Halimatoz is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. Plaque psoriasis in adults and children Medicinal product no longer authorised

Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body's immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells.

Halimatoz is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Halimatoz is also used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Psoriatic arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis.

Halimatoz is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Halimatoz can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function.

## Hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents

Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful inflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.

Halimatoz is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Halimatoz can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz. Crohn's disease in adults and children Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. Halimatoz  is  used  to  treat  Crohn's  disease  in  adults  and  children  aged  6  to  17  years.  If  you  have Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. Halimatoz is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. Non-infectious uveitis in adults and children Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation leads to a decrease of vision and / or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Halimatoz works by reducing this inflammation. Halimatoz is used to treat · adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. · children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the front of the eye.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Halimatoz

## Do not use Halimatoz

- if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- if you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see 'Warnings and precautions').

- if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition (see 'Warnings and precautions').

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Halimatoz.

## Allergic reaction

- If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash, do not inject more Halimatoz and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare cases, these reactions can be life-threatening. Infection · If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example leg ulcer), consult your doctor before starting Halimatoz. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. · You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Halimatoz treatment. This risk may increase if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). · In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz. Tuberculosis (TB) · As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Halimatoz. This will include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. Travel / recurrent infection · Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. Medicinal product no longer authorised
- Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections.

## Hepatitis B virus

- Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV infection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Age over 65 years

- If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Halimatoz. You and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with Halimatoz. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems.

## Surgery or dental procedures

- If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking Halimatoz. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz.

Demyelinating disease · If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to receive Halimatoz. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. Vaccine · Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and should not be given during treatment with Halimatoz in case they cause infections. Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Halimatoz. If you receive Halimatoz while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Halimatoz use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. Heart failure · It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Halimatoz, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale · In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Cancer

- There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or other TNF α blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Halimatoz the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Halimatoz.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor.
- There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF α blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF α blocker is appropriate for you.

## Autoimmune diseases

· On rare occasions, treatment with Halimatoz could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your doctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. Children and adolescents · Do not give Halimatoz to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years. · Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric plaque psoriasis or paediatric ulcerative colitis below the age of 4 years. · Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric Crohn's disease below the age of 6 years. · Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. Other medicines and Halimatoz Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Halimatoz can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You should not take Halimatoz with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other TNFantagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. Pregnancy and breast-feeding · You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after the last Halimatoz treatment. · If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Halimatoz can be used during breast-feeding.
- If you receive Halimatoz during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Halimatoz use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on vaccines see the 'Warnings and precautions' section).

What Halimatoz is and what it is used for Halimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body's immune (defence) system. Halimatoz is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: · rheumatoid arthritis, · polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, · enthesitis-related arthritis, · ankylosing spondylitis, · axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, Medicinal product no longer authorised

- psoriatic arthritis,
- psoriasis,
- hidradenitis suppurativa,
- Crohn's disease,
- ulcerative colitis and
- non-infectious uveitis.

The active ingredient in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target in the body.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF α ), which is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNFα, Halimatoz blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these diseases.

## Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.

Halimatoz is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to treat your rheumatoid arthritis.

Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body's immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells.

Halimatoz can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous methotrexate treatment. Halimatoz can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. Usually, Halimatoz is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, Halimatoz can be given alone. Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of the joints that usually first appear in childhood. Halimatoz is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well enough, patients will be given Halimatoz to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. Halimatoz is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. Plaque psoriasis in adults and children Medicinal product no longer authorised

Halimatoz is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Halimatoz is also used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Psoriatic arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis.

Halimatoz is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Halimatoz can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function.

## Hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents

Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful inflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.

Halimatoz is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. Halimatoz can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz. Crohn's disease in adults and children Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. Halimatoz  is  used  to  treat  Crohn's  disease  in  adults  and  children  aged  6  to  17  years.  If  you  have Crohn's disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. Halimatoz is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. Non-infectious uveitis in adults and children Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation leads to a decrease of vision and / or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). Halimatoz works by reducing this inflammation. Halimatoz is used to treat · adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. · children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the front of the eye.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Halimatoz.

## Allergic reaction

- If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash, do not inject more Halimatoz and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare cases, these reactions can be life-threatening. Infection · If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example leg ulcer), consult your doctor before starting Halimatoz. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. · You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Halimatoz treatment. This risk may increase if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). · In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz. Tuberculosis (TB) · As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Halimatoz. This will include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.

## Surgery or dental procedures

- If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking Halimatoz. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz.

Demyelinating disease · If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to receive Halimatoz. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. Vaccine · Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and should not be given during treatment with Halimatoz in case they cause infections. Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Halimatoz. If you receive Halimatoz while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Halimatoz use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. Heart failure · It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with Halimatoz, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale · In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment.

## Cancer

- There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or other TNF α blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Halimatoz the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Halimatoz.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor.
- There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF α blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF α blocker is appropriate for you.

## Autoimmune diseases

- On rare occasions, treatment with Halimatoz could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your doctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur.

Children and adolescents · Do not give Halimatoz to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years. · Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric plaque psoriasis or paediatric ulcerative colitis below the age of 4 years. · Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric Crohn's disease below the age of 6 years. · Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. Other medicines and Halimatoz Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Halimatoz can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You should not take Halimatoz with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other TNFantagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. Pregnancy and breast-feeding · You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after the last Halimatoz treatment. · If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

- Halimatoz should only be used during a pregnancy if needed.
- According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not receive adalimumab.
- Halimatoz can be used during breast-feeding.
- If you receive Halimatoz during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Halimatoz use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on vaccines see the 'Warnings and precautions' section).
