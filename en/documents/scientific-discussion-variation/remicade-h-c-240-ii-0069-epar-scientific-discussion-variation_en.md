## 1. Introduction

Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine IgG1 κ monoclonal antibody, which binds to both soluble and transmembrane forms of the human tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α and inhibits the functional activity of TNF α .

Remicade (infliximab) is currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease  (CD),  ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA),  psoriasis  and  ulcerative  colitis (UC).

Infliximab  was  originally  approved  in  August  1999  for  a  2 nd -line  indication  in  CD,  i.e.  for  use  in patients  after  failure  of  corticosteroids  and/or  immunosuppressant  therapies  or  in  patients  who  are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. In 2001, further to the 2 nd annual reassessment 1 ,  the  indication  was  restricted  following  an  urgent  safety  restriction to  3 rd line  based  on considerations of the total benefit/risk profile, particularly taking the limited knowledge of the safety profile  of  infliximab  that  was  available  at  that  time.  The  safety  concerns  pertained  to  tuberculosis (TB),  other  infections  including  sepsis,  the  potential  risk  for  malignancies/lymphomas,  fatalities, infusion reactions including anaphylactic reactions, and congestive heart failure.

Based  on  data  from  clinical  trials  (ACCENT  1,  GETAID 2 ),  registry  (TREAT 3 )  and  other  postmarketing data, the MAH applied for a variation to extend the indication from 3 rd to  2 nd line  in  CD (section 4.1) and also proposed to revise the wording on strictures in patients with CD treated with infliximab (section 4.4).

## 2. Clinical aspects

To support this application the MAH referred to the data detailed below:

1)  ACCENT  I  (C0168T21):  multicentre,  randomised,  double  blind,  clinical  trial  of  maintenance infliximab  treatment  compared  with  a  single  dose  of  infliximab  in  580  patients  with  moderately  to severely active CD.

2)  GETAID:  an  investigator-initiated  randomised,  multicentre,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate the combination of azathioprine/ 6-mercaptopurine (AZA/6-MP) in combination with infliximab as an induction regimen (3 infusions at 0, 2 and 6 weeks), compared with AZA/6-MP alone, in patients with steroid-dependent CD.

3) TREAT registry: on going commitment from the MAH, evaluating the long-term clinical, economic and quality of life outcomes of various treatment regimens, including infliximab, in the management of moderate to severe CD.

4) post-marketing data as assessed in the PSURs (periodic safety update reports).

## 2.1 Clinical efficacy

## ACCENT I

The  ACCENT  I  clinical  trial  was  submitted  and  assessed  within  variation  II.25  to  support  the maintenance therapy indication in CD. This variation received commission decision on 15 May 2003.

1 The  annual  re-assessment  consists  of  the  review  of  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  the  product  based  on  the additional post-authorisation data (i.e. Specific Obligations) submitted to the EMEA.

## Summary of clinical efficacy

The study participants were adults above 18 years of age with a CDAI (Crohn´s disease activity index) of between 220 and 400 (moderately to severely active disease). The median age of the patients was 35 years, 58% were women. Duration of CD was 7.9 years, 57% had ileocolonic disease, in 24% and 19%  was  the  disease  located  in  the  ileum  and  colon,  respectively,  51%  had  previous  segmental resections  and  58%  had  extra-intestinal  manifestations.  Of  note,  patients  were  excluded  for  local manifestations of CD (e.g., strictures, abscesses, or other disease complications at screening) for which surgery might have been indicated.

The primary objective of the study was to examine whether patients responding 2 weeks after a single 5  mg/kg  infusion  of  infliximab  benefited  from  further  treatments  2  and  6  weeks  later  followed  by treatments every 8 weeks, compared with placebo treatment following the initial infusion. All patients received  an  initial  dose  of  5  mg/kg  of  infliximab  at  week  0.  At  week  2,  patients  were  randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo infusions at weeks 2 and 6, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46 (episodic strategy); 5 mg/kg infliximab infusion at the same time points (5 mg/kg scheduled maintenance strategy); or infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 2 and 6 and then 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter through week 46 (10 mg/kg scheduled maintenance strategy).

Patients  who  did  not  respond  to  the  initial  infusion  were  randomised  separately  from  those  who responded  to  the  initial  infusion.  Patients  who  responded  to  treatment  and  subsequently  lost  their response were eligible to cross over to active episodic re-treatment.

The rate of response to the initial infusion of infliximab was about 60%. In the responders, after the initial infusion of infliximab the remission rates at week 30 and 54 as well as time to loss of response were significantly higher in patients receiving maintenance treatment with infliximab compared with placebo  infusions.  However,  the  efficacy  mainly  reflected  differences  in  clinician  interventions (change in medication, mostly corticosteroids) between the groups and not decrease in CDAI score. On  the  other  hand  these  interventions  are  of  clinical  relevance  for  the  condition  and  therefore acceptable  as  measures  of  clinical  efficacy.  For  most  endpoints,  the  infliximab  10  mg/kg  group seemed to be superior to the 5 mg/kg dose, but differences did not reach statistical difference.

## GETAID

The  GETAID  study  was  submitted  as  a  manuscript  ( Lemann  et  al )  for  publication,  therefore,  no narratives, raw data, etc., were available for assessment.

## Study participants, treatment and endpoints

This  was  a  12-month  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  value  of  an  induction  regimen  of  infliximab (week 0,  2  and  6)  combined  with  AZA  or  6-MP  in  steroid  dependent  CD  patients.  The  aim  of  the study was to compare the rate of corticosteroid free remission.

The 113 study participants were randomised to treatment in two groups: group A (n=57) was treated with  AZA  at  a  daily  dosage  of  between  2  and  3  mg/kg/day  (or  with  6-MP  at  a  dose  of  1  to 1.5 mg/kg/day) combined with infliximab infusion at 0, at 2, and at 6 weeks, at the dosage of 5 mg/kg; group B (n=56) was treated with AZA at the daily dosage of between 2 and 3 mg/kg/day, (or with 6-MP at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) combined with a placebo infusion at 0, at 2, and at 6 weeks. Patients were also treated with steroids ≥ 10mg.

Two strata of patients  were  defined:  the  naïve  stratum,  consisting  of  patients  that  had  not  received AZA or 6-MP in at least 2 years; and the failure stratum consisting of patients who have failed AZA or 6-MP, despite receiving AZA/6-MP for more than 6 months at a stable and appropriate dose.

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  clinical  remission  (CDAI&lt;150)  off  steroids  at  week  24.  An additional 6-month follow-up period was included. Secondary endpoints were (a) success rate at week 12; (b) rate of steroid resistance (c); cumulative dose of prednisone at week 24; (d) steroid side effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

score at weeks 6, 12, and 24; and, (e) endoscopic improvement between inclusion and week 24, and (f) adverse events.

The patient population was between 22 and 38 years of age, and disease duration was longer in the placebo groups vs. infliximab (7 years vs. 5 years in the failure stratum, and 4 vs. 3 years in the naïve stratum), although this difference was not statistically significant.

## Results

At week 24, the percentage of clinical remission was significantly higher in the infliximab group than in the placebo group (57% vs 29%; p=0.003). At weeks 12 and 52, the corresponding remission rates were 75% vs 38% (p&lt;0.001) and 40% vs 22% (p=0.04), respectively. In each stratum (naïve or failure stratum),  superiority  of  infliximab  compared  to  placebo  was  found  at  week  12  for  both  strata,  but significance was reached only for the naïve population at the primary endpoint, although a clear trend was observed for the failure population at week 24. Remission rate at week 52 was not statistically significant for either of the groups, although a trend in favour of infliximab was observed.

Steroid resistance was less common in the infliximab group than in the placebo group (5% vs 23%, or 5.1; 95% CI 1.3-19.2; p=0.01). Also for other secondary endpoints statistically significant benefit for the infliximab-treated patients was observed.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  results  of  the  ACCENT  I  study  showed  that  infliximab  is  effective  in  maintaining  a  clinical response and clinical remission for up to 54 weeks in patients with moderately active CD who respond to a single infusion of infliximab. In addition, a corticosteroid sparing effect and improved quality of life were demonstrated. The results of the ACCENT I study did not support continued treatment with infliximab  in  patients  not  responding  to  a  single  infusion  of  infliximab.  This  finding  is  already addressed in the product information (PI) for infliximab.

The CHMP noted that the GETAID trial was designed to evaluate infliximab for achieving clinical remission  off  steroids  in  steroid-dependent  CD  patients,  and  not  design  to  assess  the  safety  of infliximab as 2 nd line treatment instead of 3 rd line. Furthermore, the study included only 3 infusions (at weeks 0, 2 and 6), therefore data from GETAID were considered of limited value for evaluating longterm benefit/risk in patients with moderately to severely active CD given maintenance treatment.

The request  for  supplementary  information  addressed  the  issue  that  data  had  not  been  presented  to demonstrate that infliximab was comparable in terms of efficacy in 2 nd line maintenance treatment of severe  or  fistulising  CD  to  that  of  2 nd line  agents  (immunosuppressants  or  steroids).  The  MAH informed  that  there  are  no  results  from  head-to-head  trials  but  presented  analysis  that  indicate  that infliximab is at least as effective as the current 2 nd line therapy, and this was accepted by the CHMP.

## 2.2 Clinical safety

## ACCENT I

## Summary of clinical safety

## Exposure

The median cumulative dose of infliximab in this study was 9.7 mg/kg in patients randomised to the episodic strategy, 40.0 mg/kg in patients randomised to the 5 mg/kg scheduled maintenance treatment, and 64.9 mg/kg in patients randomised to the 10 mg/kg scheduled maintenance treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse events (AEs), serious AE (SAEs) and deaths

The  individual  AEs  that  were  reported  in  the  highest  proportions  of  all  randomised  patients  were headache  (29%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (28%),  abdominal  pain  (28%),  nausea  (23%), arthralgia  (17%),  (worsening  of)  CD  (17%),  pain  (16%),  pharyngitis  (15%),  rash  (14%),  vomiting (14%),  dizziness  and  fever  (13%  each),  fatigue  (13%),  sinusitis  (11%),  diarrhoea  and  insomnia (10% each). All other AEs were reported in less than 10% of all randomised patients.

Approximately two-thirds of the AEs reported as infections were treated (in 33% of all randomised patients) and the most frequent treated infection was upper respiratory tract infection (7%), followed by sinusitis (5%), pharyngitis (5%), bronchitis (4%), abscess and urinary tract infection (3% each), and moniliasis  (3%).  All  other  AEs  recorded  as  a  treated  infection  occurred  in  very  small  numbers  of patients and had no discernible pattern.

Infections that were serious did not occur with any particular pattern and the only serious infection reported  in  more  than  2  randomised  patients  overall  was  abscess,  reported  in  8  patients  (4  in  the placebo maintenance group, 3 in the 5 mg/kg maintenance group and 1 in the 10 mg/kg maintenance group).  As  reported  through  30  weeks,  1  patient  had  a  diagnosis  of  TB  during  the  study.  No  other opportunistic infections for this population were identified through the end of the study.

The proportion of patients in the ACCENT I study with symptomatic intestinal obstruction, stricture, or stenosis (SSOs) was similar in all treatment groups despite a marked difference in the amount of infliximab  used  in  each  group.  Symptomatic  SSOs  were  reported  in  6%  of  patients  who  received episodic  treatment,  5%  of  patients  who  received  5 mg/kg  infliximab  scheduled  strategy,  and  6%  of patients who received 10 mg/kg infliximab scheduled strategy.

Four patients died (3 died during the study and 1 died after study completion): 1 (10 mg/kg infliximab maintenance) of septic shock, 1 (10 mg/kg infliximab maintenance) of sepsis 144 days after the last study  infusion,  1  (5  mg/kg  infliximab  maintenance)  of  myocardial  infarction  25  days  after  the  last study infusion, and 1 (placebo maintenance) of natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma (for which death occurred after study completion). The events (septic shock, sepsis, and myocardial infarction) leading to these deaths were judged to be probably not related to study agent. The event, NK-cell lymphoma, was judged to be possibly related to the study agent.

## GETAID

Since this was an investigator-initiated study that has been presented by the MAH as a manuscript for publication, safety information was only limited.

## Exposure

In the GETAID study, 57 patients of 115 patients randomised were exposed to an induction regimen (3 doses) of infliximab.

## AEs, SAEs and deaths

Frequency and severity of adverse events were not different between the two treatment groups. The percentages  of  patients  who  had  at  least  one  adverse  event  were  51%  in  the  infliximab  group  and 50% in the placebo group. The frequency of infection was similar in the two treatment groups. Five serious adverse events were considered probably or possibly related to AZA: severe vomiting (n=1, infliximab  group),  arthralgia/myalgia/diarrhoea/fever  (n=1,  placebo),  arthralgia/fever/cutaneous  rash (n=1,  placebo),  pancreatitis  (n=2,  placebo).  All  patients  discontinued  AZA  and  recovered.  One additional  case  of  pancreatitis  occurred  in  the  infliximab  group  at  week  26,  during  the  follow-up period;  AZA  was  stopped,  but  the  cause  remained  unclear,  as  biliary  stones  were  also  found.  One patient in the infliximab group had a severe reaction after the second and third infusions. The patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recovered  with  steroids  and  adrenaline.  No  malignancy  and  no  death  occurred  among  the  study patients.

## TREAT

The MAH has an on going commitment to continue the TREAT patient registry and to provide regular reports to the EMEA/CHMP. Reports are provided on a yearly basis. Exposure

Based on the data evaluated in April 2005, of the total of 6290 TREAT patients, around 51% (3235 patients) had been treated with infliximab. These patients received infliximab within 12 weeks prior to registration,  were  scheduled  to  receive  infliximab  within  30  days  of  registration,  or  received infliximab at some other point in the registry. Further to the request for supplementary information and at  the  oral  explanation  the  MAH  presented  revised  updated  figures.  Of  the  6273  adult  CD  patients enrolled as of February 2006, a total of 3300 (around 53%) were treated with infliximab.

Approximately  25,000  infliximab  infusions  have  been  collected  in  the  TREAT  registry,  with  an infusion  reaction  rate  of  4%  of  infusions  (whereof  0.11%  serious).  The  overall  rate  of  infusion reactions was consistent with the rate observed in completed clinical trials of infliximab.

Demographic characteristics  were  balanced  between  the  infliximab-treated  patients  and  the  patients who received other treatments. However, at the time of the TREAT registration, a greater percentage of  infliximab-treated  patients  had  moderate-severe  or  severe-fulminant  CD  as  compared  to  the patients in the other treatment groups. Infliximab-treated patients were also more likely to have been hospitalised in the year prior to TREAT registration, and were more likely to have undergone surgery in  the  previous  year.  A  greater  percentage  of  infliximab-treated  patients  were  taking  prednisone  at registration and infliximab-treated patients were also more likely to be taking concomitant immunomodulatory drugs (AZA, 6-MP, methotrexate, and cyclosporine). In addition, these patients reported worse overall health than CD patients enrolled in TREAT who did not receive infliximab. The mean age of infliximab patients is around 40 years.

## AEs, SAEs and deaths

From  the  data evaluated in April 2005,  the most  frequently reported  adverse  events 4 were gastrointestinal (65 vs. 43), with, abdominal pain as the most commonly reported event (16 vs. 12). Patients also frequently experienced diarrhoea (12 vs. 11) and exacerbation of CD (12 vs. 7).

Other body systems that had at least 2 events per 100 patient-years included: allergic and/or infusion reaction (8 vs. 1), cardiovascular (2 vs. 1), haematologic (8 vs. 5), resistance mechanism / infection (6 vs. 3), respiratory system (3 vs. 1), and skin and appendages (4 vs. 1).

Further to the request for supplementary information the MAH provided subgroup analysis based on duration of treatment, intervals of administration, availability of data and 2 nd line vs. 3 rd line treatment.

Without adjustment to other factors, there was a higher rate of serious infection within 3 months of infliximab infusion compared with patients who had never received infliximab or had not received it in  the  prior  3  months.  The  same  was  observed  when  comparing  intermittent  vs.  maintenance treatment.  However,  when  multivariate  adjusted  analysis  (for  age,  CD  severity  and  use  of  other medications) was carried out, infliximab was not considered as a predictor of serious infection. There were no cases of TB reported in any patient in either group in the TREAT Registry.

Based on the data provided in April 2005, a total of 74 neoplasic events were reported. The incidence of  cancer  was  similar  in  the  infliximab-treated  patients  when  compared  to  the  patients  who  had received other CD treatments only. Further to the request for supplementary information, the MAH

4 The figures are presented as infliximab treated vs. other treatments only. They are based on an analysis per 100 patient-years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

provided an updated analysis for non-melanoma skin cancer, which was not initially included in the analysis of estimation of malignancy risk. The MAH provided revised figures at the oral explanation. The incidence per 100 patient-years for all cancers was 0.74 of infliximab treated patients vs 0.82 for patients that  received  other  CD  treatments.  When  looking  at  lymphoma,  the  incidence  was 0.07 vs 0.08, respectively. At present, data from the TREAT registry do not demonstrate an increased risk  of  malignancy  with  infliximab  treatment  compared  to  other  treatments.  However,  the  CHMP noted that  the  follow-up  period  is  still  relatively  short  (approximately  2.5  years),  and  reiterated  the need  to  maintain  close  follow-up  of  these  patients.  The  potential  tumour  promoting  effect  of infliximab  cannot  be  excluded  and  malignancies  might  require  a  certain  time  and  also  a  prolonged exposure to infliximab to be triggered.

There were 101 occurrences of SSOs among infliximab-treated patients and 62 among patients in the other  treatments  only  group.  This  difference  in  the  unadjusted  rate  was  statistically  significant (p&lt;0.001, unadjusted RR 1.0 for other treatments vs. 1.75 for infliximab, 95% CI 1.284 - 2.396). Patients with refractory symptoms due to an already-existing SSOs could be more likely to be treated with infliximab.

The Lichtenstein group 5 performed  a  multivariate  analysis  on  the  data  submitted  in  April  2004  for assessment and showed that while duration of CD, the severity of CD and CD isolated to the small bowel were independently associated with the development of SSO events, the use of infliximab was not, when adjusted for these and other potentially confounding factors. Based on the data from April 2005, using multivariate analysis for adjustment for potential confounding factors, infliximab use is not an independent predictor of SSO events.

Mortality rates were similar when the comparison was made between infliximab-treated patients and those having received other CD treatments only. Examination of the causes of death did not suggest a difference between the two groups. The MAH presented revised figures at the oral explanation. Deaths per 100 patient-years throughout the entire duration of the registry were 0.50 in the infliximab group and 0.54 in the other treatments only group. No statistically significant difference was observed.

## Post-marketing experience

The PSUR 10 covered the period from 24 February 2004 to 23 August 2004. Cumulatively, 576,000 patients  have  been  exposed  to  infliximab  for  a  total  of  1,347,000  person-years  elapsed  since  first exposure.  As  the  outcome  of  the  assessment  of  this  PSUR,  the  risk/benefit  balance  of  infliximab remained positive. In general, the adverse event profile of infliximab was  considered well characterised. Infliximab adds an extra risk for serious infections, including TB. Other adverse events under surveillance were e.g. serious blood reactions, in particular peniae, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and liver failure. From the safety data submitted,  it  was  concluded,  that  these  serious  conditions  occur  mainly  in  patients  where  other significant  co-morbidities  and  significant  other  medications  are  present.  In  most  cases  the  most plausible  explanation  was  secondary  to  other  complicating  factors,  where  infections  are  the  most commonly involved. Activation/reactivation of demyelinating disease is also recognised as a possible adverse event in patients treated with infliximab. No new signals were found within this PSUR period. It  was  also  noted  that  a  possible  risk  for  the  development  of  lymphomas  or  other  malignancies  in patients treated with a TNF-blocking agent cannot be excluded.

## Discussion on clinical safety

Safety data from the above-mentioned sources were discussed by the CHMP. At the time of the 2 nd annual  reassessment  data  in  CD  were  very  limited,  and  only  short-term  treatment  was  approved.

5 Lichtenstein GR, et al ,  Assessment of infliximab and other factors as potential risks for the development of intestinal stricture, stenosis or obstruction in Crohn's disease - Data from the 6000-patient TREAT registry. Am J Gastro 2004; 99(10):S250.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following the identification of several safety concerns, the indication was revised from 2 nd line to 3 rd line treatment in severe active, CD.

In  May 2003 a type II variation for maintenance treatment in CD patients was approved. This was based mainly on the ACCENT I trial. A major limitation of the ACCENT I study in terms of safety results  was  the  lack  of  a  real  placebo  group  since  all  patients  received  at  least  1  infusion  with infliximab. Within the placebo group 50% of the patients crossed over to active treatment and the retreatment  schedule  made  any  dose  response  evaluations  difficult.  Therefore,  there  were  not  any differences in the total number of AEs and SAEs between the treatment groups. However, the safety results of the trial confirmed previous experience with infliximab and no new safety concerns were identified  with  regard  to  the  previously  known  safety  issues  (infections,  infusion  reactions,  delayed hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmunity, immunological and neurological disorders). With regard to malignancy, the incidence was 1% and this appeared high in the young patient group. However, no apparent consistency was observed in the type of malignancy. One lymphoma was reported.

For  the  present  application  the  MAH  submitted  also  the  GETAID  study.  However,  the  safety information obtained for this study related to the short-term induction therapy regimen and because it was  presented  as  a  manuscript,  some  safety  information,  e.g.  the  exact  nature  of  serious  or  severe events  (including  drug-related  events)  were  not  included.  Notwithstanding  this  fact,  no  new  safety findings were identified.

The data from the TREAT registry reflect the real-world use of the medicinal products for treatment of CD. The CHMP considered that the data presented are reassuring, as it confirmed the already known safety  profile  of  infliximab,  and  it  did  not  identify  any  new  signals  within  the  CD  population. Additionally, the MAH provided evidence of at least a similar risk profile of infliximab compared with other  medications  used  in  CD.  In  addition,  adjusted  analyses  presented  by  the  MAH  suggest  that infliximab is not associated with an increased risk of death or infections.

The CHMP reiterated the need to continue with the follow-up of the registry. The MAH will continue to present annual updates for assessment.

The CHMP raised concerns regarding the findings related to 6 cases of a rare type of hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma (HSTCL) identified in adolescent and young adult CD patients treated with infliximab and concomitant AZA or 6-MP that lead to the update of the product information in May 2006, via variation II.84. A causal relationship of HSTCL and infliximab therapy could not be excluded. The MAH  was  asked  to  address  this  issue  in  answers  to  supplementary  information  and  at  the  oral explanation. The MAH gave feedback on an expert meeting held on 21st July 2006. Hypotheses were given for the development of this type of lymphoma, but no conclusions can be reached yet. However, the MAH informed on the efforts being developed on how to proceed with HSTCL, in specific the analysis of the possible role of registries and educational programs. Furthermore, the MAH informed that all reports of lymphoma are being reviewed in depth. This was noted by the CHMP.

Regarding stricturing in CD, the data from TREAT and ACCENT I did not indicade an increased risk for  the  development  of  strictures.  Additionally,  it  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  administration  of infliximab to patients with fibrotic strictures harms the patient, while there may even be some benefit for patients with inflammatory strictures. Further to a request for supplementary information the MAH provided data regarding experience with surgery. The data on experience with surgery indicate that infliximab or immunossupressive therapy do not increase the risk for postoperative complications such as infections. Data suggests that rapid mucosal healing is not accompanied with the development of strictures,  although  the  patient  number  was  considered  low  to  draw  any  definite  conclusions.  The CHMP noted that only longer-term data from the TREAT registry might help to finally address this question.

Therefore,  the  CHMP  proposed  a  revision  of  the  initially  submitted  wording  on  strictures  and recommended that the MAH committed to perform post authorisation follow-up measures to gather as information on strictures. The MAH agreed with the CHMP recommendation and submitted a revised letter of undertaking.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3 Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment

The CHMP considered that the benefit of infliximab has been demonstrated in the intended patient population.

Furthermore, the safety concerns leading to the change in the indication from 2 nd line  to  3 rd line  in 2001  are  at  present  characterised  and  followed  through  longer-term  surveillance  of  subjects  who participated in infliximab clinical trials in CD and through analysis of data collected in the registries.

The  analysis  from  several  clinical  studies  and  registries  provided  demonstrated  that  no  new  safety concerns  were  observed  and  indicated  that  infliximab  has  comparative  safety  vs.  the  alternative treatments  in  severe  CD.  The  maintenance  of  long-term  follow  up  was  considered  important  and recommended.

The CHMP also noted that flexibility in treatment of severe active CD is important. Therefore, 2 nd line therapy  with  infliximab  might  be  justified  in  certain  clinical  situations,  e.g.  where  a  patient  with severe, active CD is not responding to high doses of steroids or as a add-on therapy initiated during the time that it may take for immunomodulators to exhibit full effect.

The CHMP expressed concern with the HSTCL cases, in particular with relevance to the paediatric population,  since  the  6  cases  reported  were  in  adolescent  and  young  adult  patients.  The  efforts developed by the MAH on how to proceed with HSTCL, in specific the investigation of the possible role of registries and educational programs for both prescribers and the patients were noted.

Given the larger experience with infliximab available now, both in terms of efficacy and safety in CD, as  well  as  the  ongoing  educational  activities  and  the  current  PI  which  reflects  the  safety  profile  of infliximab adequately, the CHMP considered that this variation was acceptable.

## CONCLUSION

On 27  July  2006  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package Leaflet.
