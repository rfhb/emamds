## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Abrysvo is indicated for:

- Passive protection against lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants from birth through 6 months of age following maternal immunisation during pregnancy. See sections 4.2 and 5.1.
- Active immunisation of individuals 18 years of age and older for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Posology

Pregnant individuals

A single dose of 0.5 mL should be administered between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

60 micrograms

60 micrograms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Individuals 18 years of age and older

A single dose of 0.5 mL should be administered.

The need for revaccination has not been established.

## Immunocompromised individuals

A single dose of 0.5 mL should be administered. The need for a second dose has not been established (see section 5.1).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Abrysvo in children (from birth to less than 18 years of age) have not yet been established. Limited data are available in pregnant adolescents and their infants (see section 5.1).

## Method of administration

Abrysvo is for intramuscular injection into the deltoid region of the upper arm.

The vaccine should not be mixed with any other vaccines or medicinal products.

For instructions on reconstitution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

Abrysvo should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder since bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration to these individuals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity have been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The efficacy of Abrysvo may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.

## Individuals less than 24 weeks of gestation

Abrysvo has not been studied in pregnant individuals less than 24 weeks of gestation. Since protection of the infant against RSV depends on transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta, Abrysvo should be administered between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited after vaccination.

## Excipients

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

Abrysvo contains polysorbate 80. Polysorbate 80 may cause hypersensitivity reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Abrysvo can be administered concomitantly with:

- COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, with or without high dose unadjuvanted influenza vaccine administered concomitantly.
- seasonal influenza vaccines, either standard dose adjuvanted or high dose unadjuvanted

A minimum interval of two weeks is recommended between administration of Abrysvo and administration of a tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). There were no safety concerns when Abrysvo was co-administered with Tdap in healthy non-pregnant women. Immune responses to RSV A, RSV B, diphtheria and tetanus on co-administration were non-inferior to those after separate administration. However, the immune responses to the pertussis components were lower on co-administration compared to separate administration and did not meet the criteria for noninferiority. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Data on pregnant women (more than 4 000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity.

Results from animal studies with Abrysvo do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

In a phase 3 study (Study 1), maternal adverse events reported within 1 month after vaccination were similar in the Abrysvo group (14%) and the placebo group (13%).

No safety signals were detected in infants up to 24 months of age. The incidences of adverse events reported within 1 month after birth in infants were similar in the Abrysvo group (38%) and the placebo group (35%). Major birth outcomes assessed in the Abrysvo group compared to placebo included premature birth (207 (6%) and 172 (5%), respectively), low birth weight (186 (5%) and 158 (4%), respectively) and congenital anomalies (205 (6%) and 245 (7%), respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Abrysvo is excreted in human milk. No adverse effects of Abrysvo have been shown in breastfed newborns of vaccinated mothers.

## Fertility

No human data on the effect of Abrysvo on fertility are available.

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Abrysvo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Pregnant individuals

In pregnant women at 24-36 weeks of gestation the most frequently reported adverse reactions were vaccination site pain (41%), headache (31%) and myalgia (27%). The majority of local and systemic reactions in maternal participants were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 2-3 days of onset.

## Individuals 18 years of age and older

In individuals 18 years of age and older the most frequently reported adverse reactions were fatigue (23%), headache (20%), vaccination site pain (19%) and myalgia (16%). The majority of reactions were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 1-2 days of onset.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety of administering a single dose of Abrysvo to pregnant women at 24-36 weeks of gestation (n=3 698) and to individuals 18 years of age and older (n=20 275) was evaluated in clinical trials.

Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( ≥ 1/10); Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1 000 to &lt;1/100); Rare ( ≥ 1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000); Very rare (&lt;1/10 000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Special populations

## Immunocompromised individuals 18 years of age and older

Reactogenicity was consistent with the known profile of Abrysvo. There were no unexpected safety findings.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdose with Abrysvo is unlikely due to its single dose presentation.

There is no specific treatment for an overdose with Abrysvo. In the event of an overdose, the individual should be monitored and provided with symptomatic treatment as appropriate.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, other viral vaccines; ATC code: J07BX05

## Mechanism of action

Abrysvo contains two recombinant stabilised RSV prefusion F antigens representing subgroups RSV-A and RSV-B. Prefusion F is the primary target of neutralising antibodies that block RSV infection. Following intramuscular administration, the prefusion F antigens elicit an immune response, which protects against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD).

In infants born to mothers who were vaccinated with Abrysvo between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation, protection against RSV-associated LRTD is due to transplacental transfer of RSV neutralising antibodies. Adults 18 years of age and older are protected by active immunisation.

## Clinical efficacy

## Infants from birth through 6 months of age by active immunisation of pregnant individuals

Study 1 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of a single dose of Abrysvo in the prevention of RSV-associated LRTD in infants born to pregnant individuals vaccinated between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation. The need for revaccination with subsequent pregnancies has not been established.

RSV-associated LRTD was defined as a medically attended visit in individuals with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmation of RSV and with one or more of the following respiratory symptoms: fast breathing, low oxygen saturation (SpO2 &lt;95%) and chest wall indrawing. Severe RSV-associated LRTD was defined as RSV-associated LRTD that additionally met at least one of the following criteria: very fast breathing, low oxygen saturation (SpO2 &lt;93%), highflow oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation, ICU admission for &gt;4 hours and/or failure to respond/unconscious.

In this study, 3 711 pregnant individuals with uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies were randomised to the Abrysvo group and 3 709 to placebo.

Vaccine efficacy (VE) was defined as the relative risk reduction of the endpoint in the Abrysvo group compared to the placebo group for infants born to pregnant individuals who received the assigned intervention. At the primary analysis, there were two primary efficacy endpoints, assessed in parallel, severe RSV-positive medically attended LRTD and RSV-positive medically attended LRTD, occurring within 90, 120, 150 or 180 days after birth.

Of the pregnant women who received Abrysvo, 65% were White, 20% were Black or African American and 29% were Hispanic/Latino. The median age was 29 years (range 16-45 years); 0.2% of participants were under 18 years of age and 4.3% were under 20 years of age. The median gestational age at vaccination was 31 weeks and 2 days (range 24 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 4 days). The median infant gestational age at birth was 39 weeks and 1 day (range 27 weeks and 3 days to 43 weeks and 6 days).

Vaccine efficacy is presented in Tables 2 and 3.

a 99.5% CI at 90 days; 97.58% CI at later intervals

A post-hoc analysis of VE by maternal gestational age was conducted. For severe medically attended LRTD occurring within 180 days, VE was 57.2% (95% CI 10.4, 80.9) for women vaccinated early in pregnancy (24 to &lt;30 weeks) and 78.1% (95% CI 52.1, 91.2) for women vaccinated later in the pregnancy eligible window (30 to 36 weeks). For medically attended LRTD occurring within 180 days, VE was 30.9% (95% CI -14.4, 58.9) for women vaccinated early in pregnancy (24 to &lt;30 weeks) and 62.4% (95% CI 41.6, 76.4) for women vaccinated later in the pregnancy eligible window (30 to 36 weeks).

## Individuals 60 years of age and older

Study 2 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of Abrysvo in the prevention of RSV-associated LRTD in individuals 60 years of age and older.

RSV-associated LRTD was defined as RT-PCR confirmed RSV disease with two or more or three or more of the following respiratory symptoms within 7 days of symptom onset and lasting more than 1 day during the same illness: new or increased cough, wheezing, sputum production, shortness of breath or tachypnoea ( ≥ 25 breaths/min or 15% increase from resting baseline).

Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive Abrysvo (n=18 487) or placebo (n=18 479). Enrollment was stratified by age 60-69 years (63%), 70-79 years (32%) and ≥ 80 years (5%). Subjects with stable chronic underlying conditions were eligible for this study and 52% of participants had at least 1 prespecified condition; 16% of participants were enrolled with stable chronic cardiopulmonary conditions such as asthma (9%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7%) or congestive heart failure (2%). Immunocompromised individuals were ineligible.

The primary objective was assessment of vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the relative risk reduction of first episode of RSV-associated LRTD in the Abrysvo group compared to the placebo group in the first RSV season.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the participants who received Abrysvo, 51% were male and 80% were White, 12% were Black or African American and 42% were Hispanic/Latino. The median age of participants was 67 years (range 59-95 years).

At the end of the first RSV season the analysis demonstrated statistically significant efficacy for Abrysvo for reduction of RSV-associated LRTD with ≥ 2 symptoms and with ≥ 3 symptoms.

Vaccine efficacy information at the end of the first RSV season (median follow-up time 7.4 months) is presented in Table 4.

N = number of participants; n = number of cases

a In an exploratory analysis in RSV subgroup A (Abrysvo n=3, placebo n=16) VE was 81.3% (CI 34.5, 96.5); and in RSV subgroup B (Abrysvo n=12, placebo n=26) VE was 53.8% (CI 5.2, 78.8).

b In an exploratory analysis in RSV subgroup A (Abrysvo n=1, placebo n=5) VE was 80.0% (CI -78.7, 99.6); and in RSV subgroup B (Abrysvo n=1, placebo n=12) VE was 91.7% (CI 43.7, 99.8).

Vaccine efficacy in the subgroup of participants 80 years of age and older (995 and 981 participants in the Abrysvo and placebo groups, respectively) cannot be concluded due to the low number of total cases accrued (7 cases of RSV-associated LRTD with ≥ 2 symptoms and 3 cases of RSV-associated LRTD with ≥ 3 symptoms).

Efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease over 2 RSV seasons in individuals 60 years of age and older

Across 2 RSV seasons with median follow-up time of 16.4 months, VE against RSV-associated LRTD with ≥ 2 symptoms was 58.8% (95% CI 43.0, 70.6; 54 cases in the Abrysvo group and 131 cases in the placebo group) and with ≥ 3 symptoms was 81.5% (95% CI 63.3, 91.6; 10 cases in the Abrysvo group and 54 cases in the placebo group). VE against RSV-associated LRTD caused by RSV-A and RSV-B was 66.3% (95% CI 47.2, 79.0) and 50.0% (95% CI 18.5, 70.0) for cases with ≥ 2 LRTD symptoms respectively, and 80.6% (95% CI 52.9, 93.4) and 86.4% (95% CI 54.6, 97.4) for cases with ≥ 3 LRTD symptoms, respectively.

Across 2 RSV seasons, subgroup analyses of VE by age and significant underlying conditions were consistent with VE at the end of the first RSV season and support consistent VE across different age and risk groups.

## Immunogenicity in individuals 18 through 59 years of age

Study 3 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Abrysvo in individuals 18 through 59 years of age considered to be at high risk of developing severe LRTD caused by RSV. Study 3 enrolled individuals who had chronic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, haematologic or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus and hyper/hypothyroidism). Participants were randomised (2:1) to receive a single dose of Abrysvo (n=437) or placebo (n=217).

Demographic characteristics in study 3 were generally similar with regard to age, race and ethnicity among participants who received Abrysvo and those who received placebo. Fifty-three percent (53%) were 18 to 49 years and 47% were 50 to 59 years. The vaccine and placebo groups were similar with regards to having at least one prespecified medical condition, which included 53% with ≥ 1 chronic pulmonary condition, 8% with ≥ 1 cardiovascular condition, 42% with diabetes and 31% ≥ 1 other disease (liver, renal, neurologic, haematologic or other metabolic disease).

Vaccine efficacy in individuals 18 through 59 years of age is inferred by immunobridging to study 2 where vaccine efficacy was demonstrated in individuals 60 years of age and older. The non-inferiority criteria were met for high risk individuals 18 through 59 years of age compared to a randomly selected immunogenicity subset (external control group) of individuals ≥ 60 years of age from study 2 for the ratio of RSV neutralising geometric mean titres (GMTs) by the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs &gt;0.667 (1.5-fold non-inferiority margin), and for the difference in seroresponse rates by the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs &gt; -10% for both RSV A and RSV B.

Immunogenicity in immunocompromised individuals 18 years of age and older

Study 4 (C3671023 Substudy B) was a Phase 3, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Abrysvo in immunocompromised individuals ≥ 18 years of age. Participants had history of a solid organ transplant (kidney, liver, lung or heart) at least 3 months prior to enrollment; end stage renal disease and on haemodialysis; autoimmune inflammatory disorders with active immunomodulator therapy; or advanced non-small cell lung cancer and receiving active immunomodulator therapy. Participants received 2 doses of Abrysvo with an interval of 1 month.

A single dose of Abrysvo was sufficient to elicit robust neutralising responses approximately 8- or 9fold above baseline against RSV A and RSV B in participants ≥ 18 years of age with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immunocompromising conditions (n=188). Responses did not further increase with a second dose of Abrysvo 1 month after the first dose.

## Step 1. Attach vial adaptor

- Peel off the top cover from the vial adaptor packaging and remove the flip off cap from the vial.
- While keeping the vial adaptor in its packaging, centre over the vial's stopper and connect with a straight downward push. Do not push the vial adaptor in at an angle as it may result in leaking. Remove the packaging.

## Step 2. Reconstitute the powder component (antigens) to form Abrysvo

- For all syringe assembly steps, hold the syringe only by the Luer lock adaptor. This will prevent the Luer lock adaptor from detaching during use.
- Twist to remove the syringe cap, then twist to connect the syringe to the vial adaptor. Stop turning when you feel resistance.
- Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the vial. Hold the plunger rod down and gently swirl the vial until the powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake.

## Step 3. Withdraw reconstituted vaccine

- Invert the vial completely and slowly withdraw the entire contents into the syringe to ensure a 0.5 mL dose of Abrysvo.
- Twist to disconnect the syringe from the vial adaptor.
- Attach a sterile needle suitable for intramuscular injection.

The prepared vaccine is a clear and colourless solution. Visually inspect the vaccine for large particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if large particulate matter or discolouration is found.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## Abrysvo powder and solvent for solution for injection

Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine (bivalent, recombinant)

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Abrysvo is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Abrysvo
3. How Abrysvo is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Abrysvo
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Abrysvo is and what it is used for

Abrysvo is a vaccine to prevent lung (respiratory tract) disease caused by a virus called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Abrysvo is given to:

- pregnant individuals to protect their infants from birth through 6 months of age
- individuals 18 years of age and older.

or

RSV is a common virus which, in most cases, causes mild, cold-like symptoms such as a sore throat, cough or a blocked nose. However, in young infants RSV can cause serious lung problems. In older adults and people with chronic medical conditions, RSV can worsen illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). RSV can lead to hospitalisation in severe cases and in some cases it can be fatal.

## How Abrysvo works

This vaccine helps the immune system (the body's natural defences) to make antibodies (substances in the blood that help the body fight infections) which protect against lung disease caused by RSV. In pregnant individuals who are vaccinated between weeks 24 and 36 of pregnancy, these antibodies are passed to the infant through the placenta before birth which protects infants when they are at most risk from RSV.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Abrysvo

## Abrysvo should not be given

- if you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this vaccine

- if you are feeling nervous about getting the vaccine or have ever fainted after any injection. Fainting can happen before or after any injection.
- if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after you received any other vaccine injection or after you were given Abrysvo in the past.
- if you have an infection with a high fever. If this is the case, then vaccination will be postponed. There is no need to delay vaccination for a minor infection, such as a cold, but talk to your doctor first.
- if you have a weakened immune system which may prevent you from getting the full benefit from Abrysvo.
- if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.
- if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Abrysvo.

As with any vaccine, Abrysvo may not fully protect all those who receive it.

## Children and adolescents

Abrysvo is not recommended in children and young people below 18 years of age except during pregnancy (see 'Pregnancy' section below).

## Other medicines and Abrysvo

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Abrysvo may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine or a COVID-19 vaccine. A gap of at least two weeks is recommended between administration of Abrysvo and administration of a vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (whooping cough).

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Pregnant individuals can be given this vaccine in the late second or third trimester (weeks 24 to 36). Talk to your doctor or nurse for advice before getting this vaccine if you are breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Abrysvo is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.

## Abrysvo contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Abrysvo contains polysorbate 80

One dose of Abrysvo contains 0.08 mg of polysorbate 80. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How Abrysvo is given

You will be given one injection of 0.5 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.

If you have any questions on the use of Abrysvo, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## Administration

Abrysvo is for intramuscular use only.

The unopened vial is stable for 5 days when stored at temperatures from 8°C to 30°C. At the end of this period Abrysvo should be used or discarded. This information is used to guide healthcare professionals in case of temporary temperature excursions only.

## Storage of reconstituted vaccine

Abrysvo should be used immediately after reconstitution or within 4 hours. Store the reconstituted vaccine between 15ºC and 30ºC. Do not freeze reconstituted vaccine.

Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours between 15°C and 30°C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.

## Preparation for administration

For use of vial of antigens for Abrysvo (powder), pre-filled syringe of solvent and vial adaptor

The powder must be reconstituted only with the solvent provided in the pre-filled syringe using the vial adaptor.

## Step 1. Attach vial adaptor

- Peel off the top cover from the vial adaptor packaging and remove the flip off cap from the vial.
- While keeping the vial adaptor in its packaging, centre over the vial's stopper and connect with a straight downward push. Do not push the vial adaptor in at an angle as it may result in leaking. Remove the packaging.

## Step 2. Reconstitute the powder component (antigens) to form Abrysvo

- For all syringe assembly steps, hold the syringe only by the Luer lock adaptor. This will prevent the Luer lock adaptor from detaching during use.
- Twist to remove the syringe cap, then twist to connect the syringe to the vial adaptor. Stop turning when you feel resistance.
- Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the vial. Hold the plunger rod down and gently swirl the vial until the powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake.

## Step 3. Withdraw reconstituted vaccine

- Invert the vial completely and slowly withdraw the entire contents into the syringe to ensure a 0.5 mL dose of Abrysvo.
- Twist to disconnect the syringe from the vial adaptor.
- Attach a sterile needle suitable for intramuscular injection.

The prepared vaccine is a clear and colourless solution. Visually inspect the vaccine for large particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if large particulate matter or discolouration is found.

## For use of vial of antigens for Abrysvo (powder) and vial of solvent

The powder must be reconstituted only with the vial of solvent provided.

1. Using a sterile needle and sterile syringe, withdraw the entire contents of the vial containing the solvent and inject the entire contents of the syringe into the vial containing the powder.
2. Gently swirl the vial in a circular motion until the powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake.
3. Withdraw 0.5 mL from the vial containing the reconstituted vaccine.

The prepared vaccine is a clear and colourless solution. Visually inspect the vaccine for large particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if large particulate matter or discolouration is found.
