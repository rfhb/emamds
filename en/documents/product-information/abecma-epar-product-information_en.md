## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Abecma 260 - 500 x 10 6 cells dispersion for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

## 2.1 General description

Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) is a genetically modified autologous cell-based product containing T cells transduced ex-vivo using a replication incompetent lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognises B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), comprising a murinederived, anti-human BCMA single chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and a CD3-zeta signalling domain.

## 2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition

Each patient-specific infusion bag of Abecma contains idecabtagene vicleucel at a batch-dependent concentration of autologous T cells genetically modified to express an anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-positive viable T cells). The medicinal product is packaged in one or more infusion bags overall containing a cell dispersion of 260 to 500 x 10 6 CAR-positive viable T cells suspended in a cryopreservative solution.

Each infusion bag contains 10-30 mL, 30-70 mL or 55-100 mL of dispersion for infusion.

The cellular composition and the final cell number varies between individual patient batches. In addition to T cells, natural killer (NK) cells may be present. The quantitative information of medicinal product, including the number of infusion bag(s) to be administered, is presented in the release for infusion certificate (RfIC) located inside the lid of the cryoshipper used for transport.

## Excipients with known effect

This medicinal product contains 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), up to 752 mg sodium and up to 274 mg potassium per dose.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Dispersion for infusion.

A colourless dispersion.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Abecma is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Abecma must be administered in a qualified treatment centre.

Abecma therapy should be initiated under the direction of and supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for the administration and management of patients treated with Abecma.

A minimum of one dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion of Abecma. The treatment centre must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. In the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, suitable alternative measures to treat CRS instead of tocilizumab must be available prior to infusion.

## Posology

Abecma is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4).

Treatment consists of a single dose for infusion containing a dispersion of CAR-positive viable T cells in one or more infusion bags. The target dose is 420 x 10 6 CAR-positive viable T cells within a range of 260 to 500 x 10 6 CAR-positive viable T cells. See the accompanying release for infusion certificate (RfIC) for additional information pertaining to dose.

## Pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy)

Lymphodepleting chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 /day intravenously (IV) and fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day IV should be administered for 3 days. See the prescribing information for cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for information on dose adjustment in renal impairment.

Abecma is to be administered 2 days after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, up to a maximum of 9 days. The availability of Abecma must be confirmed prior to starting the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. If there is a delay in Abecma infusion of more than 9 days, then the patient should be re-treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy after a minimum of 4 weeks from last lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to receiving Abecma.

## Pre-medication

It is recommended that premedication with paracetamol (500 to 1,000 mg orally) and diphenhydramine (12.5 mg IV or 25 to 50 mg orally) or another H1-antihistamine, be administered approximately 30 to 60 minutes before the infusion of Abecma to reduce the possibility of an infusion reaction.

Prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided as the use may interfere with the activity of Abecma. Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids should be avoided 72 hours prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and following Abecma infusion except for the management of CRS, neurologic toxicities and other life-threatening emergencies (see section 4.4).

## Clinical assessment prior to infusion

Abecma treatment should be delayed in some patient groups at risk (see section 4.4).

## Monitoring after infusion

- -Patients should be monitored for the first week following infusion at the qualified treatment centre for signs and symptoms of CRS, neurologic events and other toxicities.
- -After the first week following infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician's discretion.
- -Patients should be instructed to remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of the qualified treatment centre for at least 2 weeks following infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection

There is no clinical experience in patients with active HIV, HBV or HCV infection. Screening for HBV, active HIV and active HCV must be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing. Leukapheresis material from patients with active HIV or active HCV infection will not be accepted for Abecma manufacturing (see section 4.4).

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.1).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Abecma in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Abecma is for intravenous use only.

## Administration

- Do NOT use a leukodepleting filter.
- Ensure that tocilizumab or suitable alternatives, in the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period.
- Central venous access may be utilised for the infusion of Abecma and is encouraged in patients with poor peripheral access.
- Before administration, it must be confirmed that the patient's identity matches the unique patient information on the Abecma infusion bag and accompanying documentation. The total number of infusion bags to be administered must also be confirmed with the patient specific information on the release for infusion certificate (RfIC) (see section 4.4).

For detailed instructions on preparation, administration, measures to take in case of accidental exposure and disposal of Abecma, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Contraindications of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

The traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. To ensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient must be kept for a period of 30 years after expiry date of the product.

## Autologous use

Abecma is intended solely for autologous use and must not, under any circumstances, be administered to other patients. Abecma must not be administered if the information on the product labels and the release for infusion certificate (RfIC) do not match the patient's identity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapidly progressing disease

Before selecting patients for Abecma treatment, physicians should consider the impact of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) stage III, presence of extramedullary plasmacytoma or high tumour burden, particularly for patients who have rapidly progressing disease that may affect their ability to receive CAR T infusion in due time. For these patients, optimising bridging therapy may be particularly important. Some patients may not benefit from Abecma treatment due to potential increased risk of early death (see section 5.1).

## Reasons to delay treatment

Due to the risks associated with Abecma treatment, infusion should be delayed up to 7 days if a patient has any of the following conditions:

- Unresolved serious adverse events (especially pulmonary events, cardiac events or hypotension) including those after preceding chemotherapies.
- Active infections or inflammatory disorders (including pneumonitis, myocarditis or hepatitis).
- Active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

## Concomitant disease

Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary or cardiac function are likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require special attention.

## Central nervous system pathology

There is no experience of use of Abecma in patients with CNS involvement of myeloma or other preexisting, clinically relevant CNS pathologies.

## Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation

It is not recommended that patients receive Abecma within 4 months after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) because of the potential risk of Abecma worsening GVHD. Leukapheresis for Abecma manufacturing should be performed at least 12 weeks after allogeneic SCT.

## Prior treatment with an anti-BCMA therapy

There is limited experience with Abecma in patients exposed to prior BCMA directed therapy.

There is limited experience of retreating patients with a second dose of Abecma. Responses after Abecma retreatment were infrequent and less durable when compared to initial treatment. Additionally, fatal outcomes were observed in retreated patients.

## Cytokine release syndrome

CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions occurred following Abecma infusion. Nearly all patients experienced some degree of CRS. In clinical studies, the median time to onset of CRS was 1 day (range: 1 to 17) (see section 4.8).

## Monitoring and management of CRS

CRS should be identified based on clinical presentation. Patients should be evaluated and treated for other causes of fever, hypoxia and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition, and patients should be closely monitored for evidence of MAS. Treatment of MAS should be administered per institutional guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One dose of tocilizumab per patient must be on-site and available for administration prior to Abecma infusion. The treatment centre must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. In the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, the treatment centre must have access to suitable alternative measures instead of tocilizumab to treat CRS. Patients should be monitored for the first week following Abecma infusion at the qualified treatment centre for signs and symptoms of CRS. After the first week following infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician's discretion. Patients should be counselled to remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of the qualified treatment centre for at least 2 weeks following infusion. Patients and caregivers should be informed about the potential late onset of CRS and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if patients experience any signs or symptoms of CRS at any time.

At the first sign of CRS, treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids should be instituted, as indicated in Table 1. Abecma can continue to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and corticosteroids (see section 4.5).

Patients who experience CRS should be closely monitored for cardiac and organ functioning until resolution of symptoms. For severe or life-threatening CRS, intensive care unit level monitoring and supportive therapy should be considered.

If concurrent neurologic toxicity is suspected during CRS, the neurologic toxicity should be managed according to the recommendations in Table 2 and use the more aggressive intervention of the two reactions specified in Tables 1 and 2.

Earlier escalation (i.e. higher corticosteroid dose, alternative anticytokine agents, anti-T cell therapies) is recommended in patients with refractory CRS within 72 hours post Abecma infusion characterised by persistent fever, end-organ toxicity (e.g. hypoxia, hypotension) and/or HLH/MAS not improving in grade within 12 hours of first line interventions.

## Neurologic adverse reactions

Neurologic toxicities, such as aphasia, encephalopathy and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with Abecma. The median time to onset of the first event of neurotoxicity was 3 days (range: 1 to 317 days; one patient developed encephalopathy at Day 317 as a result of worsening pneumonia and Clostridium difficile colitis). Grade 3 parkinsonism has also been reported, with delayed onset. Neurologic toxicity may occur concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution or in the absence of CRS (see section 4.8).

## Monitoring and management of neurologic toxicities

Patients should be monitored for the first week following Abecma infusion at the qualified treatment centre for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities. After the first week following infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician's discretion. Patients should be counselled to remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of the qualified treatment centre for at least 2 weeks following infusion. Patients and caregivers should be informed about the potential late onset of neurologic toxicities and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if patients experience any signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities at any time.

If neurologic toxicity is suspected, manage according to the recommendations in Table 2. Other causes of neurologic symptoms should be ruled out. Intensive care supportive therapy should be provided for severe or life-threatening neurologic toxicities.

If concurrent CRS is suspected during the neurologic toxicity reaction, it should be managed according to the recommendations in Table 1 and the more aggressive intervention used for the two reactions specified in Tables 1 and 2.

*

Grading per NCI CTCAE and ICANS/ASTCT. 2019 criteria for grading Neurologic Toxicity (Lee et.al, 2019).

a Management is determined by the most severe event, not attributable to any other cause.

b If patient is arousable and able to perform ICE Assessment, assess: Orientation (oriented to year, month, city, hospital = 4 points); Naming (name 3 objects, e.g., point to clock, pen, button = 3 points); Following Commands (e.g., 'show me 2 fingers' or 'close your eyes and stick out your tongue' = 1 point); Writing (ability to write a standard sentence = 1 point); and Attention (count backwards from 100 by ten = 1 point). If patient is unarousable and unable to perform ICE Assessment (Grade 4 ICANS) = 0 points.

c Attributable to no other cause.

## Prolonged cytopenias

Patients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Abecma infusion (see section 4.8). Blood counts should be monitored prior to and after Abecma infusion. Cytopenias should be managed with myeloid growth factor and blood transfusion support according to institutional guidelines.

## Infections and febrile neutropenia

Abecma should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have occurred in patients after receiving Abecma (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection before and after Abecma infusion and treated appropriately. Prophylactic, pre-emptive and/or therapeutic antimicrobials should be administered according to institutional guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Febrile neutropenia was observed in patients after Abecma infusion (see section 4.8) and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, infection should be evaluated and managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care as medically indicated.

## Viral reactivation

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulting in pneumonia and death have occurred following Abecma administration (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored and treated for CMV infection according to clinical guidelines.

HBV reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients treated with medicinal products directed against plasma cells (see section 4.8).

Screening for CMV, HBV, active HIV and active HCV must be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing (see section 4.2).

Reactivation of John Cunningham (JC) virus, leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), has been reported in patients treated with Abecma who have also received prior treatment with other immunosuppressive medications.

## Hypogammaglobulinaemia

Plasma cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with Abecma (see section 4.8). Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with Abecma and managed per institutional guidelines including infection precautions, antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement.

## Secondary malignancies including of T cell origin

Patients treated with Abecma may develop secondary malignancies. T cell malignancies have been reported following treatment of haematological malignancies with a BCMA- or CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy, including Abecma. T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive malignancies, have been reported within weeks and up to several years following administration of a CD19- or BCMA-, directed CAR T cell therapy. There have been fatal outcomes. Patients should be monitored life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy of T cell origin occurs, the company should be contacted to obtain instructions on the collection of tumour samples for testing.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of Abecma. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), an excipient in Abecma. Patients not previously exposed to DMSO should be observed closely. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) and the occurrence of any symptom should be monitored prior to the start of the infusion, approximately every ten minutes during the infusion and every hour, for 3 hours, after the infusion.

## Transmission of an infectious agent

Although Abecma is tested for sterility and mycoplasma, a risk of transmission of infectious agents exists. Healthcare professionals administering Abecma must, therefore, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections after treatment and treat appropriately, if needed.

## Interference with virological testing

Due to limited and short spans of identical genetic information between the lentiviral vector used to create Abecma and HIV, some HIV nucleic acid tests (NAT) may give a false positive result.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation

Patients treated with Abecma must not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation.

## Long-term follow-up

Patients are expected to be enrolled in a registry in order to better understand the long-term safety and efficacy of Abecma.

## Excipients

This medicinal product contains up to 33 mmol (752 mg) sodium per dose, equivalent to 37.6% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

This medicinal product contains up to 7 mmol (274 mg) potassium per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

The co-administration of agents known to inhibit T cell function has not been formally studied. The co-administration of agents known to stimulate T cell function has not been investigated and the effects are unknown.

## Tocilizumab or siltuximab and corticosteroid use

Some patients required tocilizumab or siltuximab and/or corticosteroid for the management of CRS (see section 4.8). The use of tocilizumab or siltuximab and/or corticosteroids for CRS management was more common in patients with higher cellular expansion.

In the KarMMa-3 study, patients with CRS treated with tocilizumab or siltuximab had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured by 3.1-fold and 2.9-fold higher median Cmax (N = 156) and AUC0-28 days (N = 155), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive tocilizumab or siltuximab (N = 64 for Cmax and N = 63 for AUC0-28 days). Patients with CRS treated with corticosteroids had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured by 2.3-fold and 2.4-fold higher median Cmax (N = 60) and AUC0-28 days (N = 60), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive corticosteroids (N = 160 for Cmax and N = 158 for AUC0-28 days).

Similarly, in the KarMMa study, patients with CRS treated with tocilizumab had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured by 1.4-fold and 1.6-fold higher median Cmax (N = 66) and AUC0-28 days (N = 65), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive tocilizumab (N = 61 for Cmax and N = 60 for AUC0-28 days). Patients with CRS treated with corticosteroids had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured by 1.7-fold and 2.2-fold higher median Cmax (N = 18) and AUC0-28 days (N = 18), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive corticosteroids (N = 109 for Cmax and N = 107 for AUC0-28 days).

## Live vaccines

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following treatment with Abecma has not been studied. As a precautionary measure, vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Abecma treatment and until immune recovery following treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females

Pregnancy status for women of childbearing potential should be verified using a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Abecma.

See the prescribing information for fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for information on the need for effective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

There are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of contraception following treatment with Abecma.

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of idecabtagene vicleucel in pregnant women. No animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with idecabtagene vicleucel to assess whether it can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3).

It is not known if idecabtagene vicleucel has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. Based on the mechanism of action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including plasma cell aplasia or hypogammaglobulinaemia. Therefore, Abecma is not recommended for women who are pregnant or for women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant women should be advised on the potential risks to the foetus. Pregnancy after Abecma therapy should be discussed with the treating physician.

Assessment of immunoglobulin levels in newborn infants of mothers treated with Abecma should be considered.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether idecabtagene vicleucel cells are excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding child. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded. Women who are breastfeeding should be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effect of idecabtagene vicleucel on fertility. Effects of idecabtagene vicleucel on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Abecma may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Due to the potential for neurologic adverse reactions, including altered mental status or seizures with Abecma, patients receiving Abecma should refrain from driving or operating heavy or potentially dangerous machines for at least 4 weeks after Abecma infusion or longer until resolution of neurologic adverse reactions at the physician's discretion.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety data described in this section reflect the exposure to Abecma in the KarMMa, CRB-401 and KarMMa-3 studies in which 409 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma received Abecma. In KarMMa (N = 128) and CRB-401 (N = 56), the median duration of follow-up (from

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 3 summarises the adverse reactions observed in the clinical studies of 409 patients treated with Abecma within the allowed dose range of 150 to 540 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells (see Table 6 in section 5.1 for the corresponding dose range of CAR-positive viable T cells in KarMMa) and from post-marketing reports. Adverse reactions are presented by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Cytokine release syndrome

In the pooled studies (KarMMa, CRB-401 and KarMMa-3), CRS occurred in 84.6% of patients receiving Abecma. Grade 3 or higher CRS (Lee et al, 2014) occurred in 5.1% of patients, with fatal (Grade 5) CRS reported in 0.7% of patients. The median time-to-onset, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 to 17) and the median duration of CRS was 4 days (range: 1 to 63).

The most common manifestations of CRS (≥ 10%) included pyrexia (82.6%), hypotension (29.1%), tachycardia (24.7%), chills (18.8%), hypoxia (15.9%), headache (11.2%) and increased C-reactive protein (10.5%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be observed in association with CRS included atrial fibrillation, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia and HLH/MAS.

Of the 409 patients, 59.7% of patients received tocilizumab; 37.2% received a single dose while 22.5% received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab for treatment of CRS. Overall, 22.7% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Of the 92 patients in KarMMa and CRB-401 who received the target dose of 450 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells, 54.3% of patients received tocilizumab and 22.8% received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Of the 225 patients in KarMMa-3 who received Abecma infusion, 71.6% of patients received tocilizumab and 28.4% received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for the treatment of CRS. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.

## Neurologic adverse reactions including ICANS

In the pooled studies, of the 409 patients, independent of investigator attribution of neurotoxicity, the most frequent neurologic or psychiatric adverse reactions (≥ 5%) included headache (22.5%), dizziness (12.5%), confusional state (11.0%), insomnia (10.3%), anxiety (5.9%), tremor (5.6%), and somnolence (5.6%). Other neurological adverse reactions occurring at a lower frequency and considered clinically important included encephalopathy (3.4%) and aphasia (2.9%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neurotoxicity identified by the investigators, which was the primary method of assessing CAR T cell associated- neurotoxicity in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, occurred in 57 (16.1%) of the 353 patients receiving Abecma, including Grade 3 or 4 in 3.1% of patients (with no Grade 5 events). The median time to onset of the first event was 3 days (range: 1 to 317; one patient developed encephalopathy at Day 317 as a result of worsening pneumonia and Clostridium difficile colitis). The median duration was 3 days (range: 1 to 252; one patient developed neurotoxicity [highest Grade 3] 43 days after ide-cel infusion which resolved after 252 days). Overall, 7.1% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

In KarMMa, across the target dose levels, 7.8% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity, while at the target dose of 450 x 10 6  CARpositive T cells, 14.8% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids.

In KarMMa-3, across all patients who received Abecma infusion at the target dose range, 6.7% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

Of the 353 patients in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, the most common manifestations of investigator identified neurotoxicity (≥ 2%) included confusional state (8.5%), encephalopathy (3.4%), somnolence (2.8%), aphasia (2.5%), tremor (2.3%), disturbance in attention (2.0%) and dysgraphia (2.0%). See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.

## Febrile neutropenia and infections

In the pooled studies, infections occurred in 62.8% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 23.2% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 15.2%, viral infections in 7.6%, bacterial infections in 4.6% and fungal infections in 1.2% of patients. Fatal infections of unspecified pathogen were reported in 2.0% of patients, 0.7% of patients had fatal fungal or viral infection and 0.2% of patients had fatal bacterial infection. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.

Febrile neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) was observed in 10.8% of patients after Abecma infusion. Febrile neutropenia may be concurrent with CRS. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.

## Prolonged cytopenia

Patients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Abecma infusion. In the pooled studies, 38.2% of the 395 patients who had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 71.3% of the 230 patients who had Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia during the first month following Abecma infusion had not resolved by last assessment during the first month. Among the 151 patients with neutropenia not resolved by month 1, 88.7% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with a median time to recovery from Abecma infusion of 1.9 months. Of the 164 patients with thrombocytopenia not resolved by month 1, 79.9% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia with the median time to recovery of 2.0 months. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.

## Hypogammaglobulinaemia

Hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 13.7% of patients treated with Abecma in the pooled studies with a median time to onset of 90 days (range 1 to 326). See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.

## Immunogenicity

Abecma has the potential to induce anti-CAR antibodies. In clinical studies, humoral immunogenicity of Abecma was measured by determination of anti-CAR antibody in serum pre- and postadministration. In the pooled studies of KarMMa, CRB-401 and KarMMa-3, 3.2% of patients tested positive for pre-infusion anti-CAR antibodies and post-infusion anti-CAR antibodies were detected in 56.2% of the patients. There is no evidence that the presence of pre-existing or post-infusion anti-CAR antibodies impact the cellular expansion, safety or effectiveness of Abecma.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There are limited data regarding overdose with Abecma.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XL07.

## Mechanism of action

Abecma is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-positive T cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is expressed on the surface of normal and malignant plasma cells. The CAR construct includes an anti-BCMA scFv-targeting domain for antigen specificity, a transmembrane domain, a CD3-zeta T cell activation domain, and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. Antigen-specific activation of Abecma results in CAR-positive T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## KarMMa-3

KarMMa-3 was an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Abecma, compared to standard regimens, in adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received two to four prior antimyeloma regimens including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and daratumumab, and were refractory to the most recent prior antimyeloma regimen. A standard regimen was assigned to each patient prior to randomisation, contingent upon the patient's most recent antimyeloma treatment. The standard regimens consisted of daratumumab, pomalidomide, dexamethasone (DPd), daratumumab, bortezomib, dexamethasone (DVd), ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (IRd), carfilzomib, dexamethasone (Kd), or elotuzumab, pomalidomide, dexamethasone (EPd). In patients randomised to the Abecma arm, the assigned standard regimen was to be used as bridging therapy, if clinically indicated.

The study included patients who achieved a response (minimal response or better) to at least 1 prior treatment regimen and had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The study excluded patients with CNS involvement of myeloma, history of CNS disorders (such as seizures), prior allogeneic SCT or prior treatment with any gene therapy-based therapeutic for cancer, investigational cellular therapy for cancer or BCMA targeted therapy, ongoing treatment with immunosuppressants, serum creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45%. Patients were also excluded if absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/ μ L and platelet count &lt; 75,000/ μ L in patients in whom &lt; 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells and platelet count &lt; 50,000/ μ L in patients in whom ≥ 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells.

Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either Abecma (N = 254) or standard regimens (N = 132) for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Randomisation was stratified by age, number of prior antimyeloma regimens and high-risk cytogenetics abnormalities. Patients receiving standard regimens were allowed to receive Abecma upon confirmed disease progression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients randomised to Abecma were to receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m 2  IV infusion daily for 3 days) and fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 IV infusion daily for 3 days) starting 5 days prior to the target infusion date of Abecma. Up to 1 cycle of DPd, DVd, IRd, Kd, or EPd anticancer therapy for disease control (bridging therapy) was permitted between apheresis and until 14 days before the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

Of the 254 patients randomised to Abecma, 249 (98%) patients underwent leukapheresis, and 225 (88.6%) patients received Abecma. Of the 225 patients, 192 (85.3%) patients received bridging therapy. Twenty-nine patients did not receive Abecma due to death (n = 4), adverse event (n = 5), patient withdrawal (n = 2), physician decision (n = 7), failure to meet lymphodepleting chemotherapy treatment criteria (n = 8) or manufacturing failure (n = 3).

The allowed dose range was 150 to 540 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells. The median actual received dose was 445.3 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells (range: 174.9 to 529.0 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells). The median time from leukapheresis to product availability was 35 days (range: 24 to 102 days) and the median time from leukapheresis to infusion was 49 days (range: 34 to 117 days).

Of the 132 patients randomised to standard regimens, 126 (95.5%) patients received treatment. Six patients discontinued without receiving treatment due to disease progression (n = 1), patient withdrawal (n = 3), or physician decision (n = 2). Patients receiving standard regimens were allowed to receive Abecma at investigator's request, upon confirmed disease progression by the independent review committee (IRC) based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and confirmed eligibility. Of the eligible patients, 69 (54.8%) underwent leukapheresis and 60 (47.6%) received Abecma.

The primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma as determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). Other efficacy measures included overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and patient-reported outcomes. At a pre-specified interim analysis at 80% information fraction with a median follow up time of 18.6 months, Abecma demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to the standard regimens arm; HR = 0.493 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.65, two-sided p-value &lt; 0.0001). The results of the subsequent primary analysis (shown in Table 5 and Figure 1), with a median follow-up time of 30.9 months, were consistent with the interim analysis.

At the time of the final analysis for PFS, 74% of planned OS events were reached. Patients receiving standard regimens were allowed to receive Abecma upon confirmed disease progression; the OS data are therefore confounded by 74 (56.1%) patients from the standard regimen arm who received Abecma as a subsequent therapy. The median OS for Abecma was 41.4 months (95% CI: 30.9, NR) versus standard regimens 37.9 months (95% CI: 23.4, NR); HR = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.40). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for OS in the intent-to-treat population (not corrected for cross-over).

Compared to the standard regimens arm (9/132; 6.8%), a higher proportion of patients experienced death within 6 months after randomisation in the Abecma arm (30/254; 11.8%). Of the 30 patients with an early death event in the Abecma arm, 17 patients never received Abecma treatment, and 13 of these 17 died of disease progression. High-risk factors such as high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, RISS stage III, presence of extramedullary plasmacytoma or high tumour burden (see section 4.4 on rapidly progressing disease) are associated with higher risk of early death.

## KarMMa

KarMMa was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least 3 prior antimyeloma therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and who were refractory to the last treatment regimen. Patients with CNS involvement of myeloma, a history of other BCMA targeting therapies, allogeneic SCT or prior gene therapy based or other genetically modified T cell therapy were excluded. Patients with a history of CNS disorders (such as seizures), inadequate hepatic, renal, bone marrow function, cardiac, pulmonary function or ongoing treatment with immunosuppressants were excluded.

The study consisted of pre-treatment (screening, leukapheresis and bridging therapy [if needed]); treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Abecma infusion); and posttreatment (ongoing) for a minimum of 24 months following Abecma infusion or until documented disease progression, whichever was longer. The lymphodepleting chemotherapy period was one 3-day cycle of cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m 2  IV infusion daily for 3 days) and fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 IV infusion daily for 3 days) starting 5 days prior to the target infusion date of Abecma. Patients were hospitalised for 14 days after infusion of Abecma to monitor and manage potential CRS and neurotoxicity.

Of the 140 patients who were enrolled (i.e. underwent leukapheresis), 128 patients received the Abecma infusion. Out of the 140 patients, only one did not receive the product due to manufacturing failure. Eleven other patients were not treated with Abecma, due to physician decision (n = 3), patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

withdrawal (n = 4), adverse events (n = 1), progressive disease (n = 1) or death (n = 2) prior to receiving Abecma.

Anticancer therapy for disease control (bridging) was permitted between apheresis and lymphodepletion with the last dose being administered at least 14 days prior to initiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Of the 128 patients treated with Abecma, most patients (87.5%) received anticancer therapy for disease control at the discretion of the investigator.

The doses targeted in the clinical study were 150, 300 or 450 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells per infusion. The allowed dose range was 150 to 540 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells. Table 6 below shows the target dose levels used in the clinical study based on total CAR-positive T cells and the corresponding range of actual dose administered defined as CAR-positive viable T cells.

- a  These patients had ECOG scores of &lt; 2 at screening for eligibility but subsequently deteriorated to ECOG scores of ≥ 2 at baseline prior to start of LD chemotherapy.

b Baseline cytogenetic abnormality was based on baseline cytogenetics from central laboratory if available. If central laboratory was not available or was unknown, cytogenetics prior to screening was used.

c  High-risk defined as deletion in chromosome 17p (del[17p]), translocation involving chromosomes 4 and 14 (t[4;14]) or translocation involving chromosomes 14 and 16 (t[14;16]).

d  Revised ISS was derived using baseline ISS stage, cytogenic abnormality and serum lactate dehydrogenase.

e  Induction with or without haematopoietic stem cell transplant and with or without maintenance therapy was considered a single therapy.

f  Triple refractory is defined as refractory to an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody.

The median time from leukapheresis to product availability was 32 days (range: 24 to 55 days) and the median time from leukapheresis to infusion was 40 days (range: 33 to 79 days). The median actual dose received across all doses targeted in the clinical study was 315.3 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells (range 150.5 to 518.4).

Efficacy was assessed on the basis of overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate and duration of response (DOR), as determined by an independent review committee. Other efficacy endpoints included minimal residual disease (MRD) using next-generation sequencing (NGS).

Efficacy results across doses targeted in the clinical study (150 to 450 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cells) are shown in the Table 8. Median follow-up was 19.9 months for all Abecma treated patients.

CI = confidence interval; IMWG = International Myeloma Working Group; NE = not estimable. Two patients with 150 x 10 6 CAR-positive T cell dose, which is not part of the approved dose range, are included in Figure 3.

## Special populations

## Elderly

In the clinical trials of Abecma, 163 (39.9%) patients were 65 years of age or older and 17 (4.2%) were 75 years of age or older. No clinically important differences in the safety or effectiveness of Abecma were observed between these patients and patients younger than 65 years of age.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Abecma in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Following Abecma infusion, the CAR-positive T cells proliferate and undergo rapid multi-log expansion followed by a bi-exponential decline. The median time of maximal expansion in peripheral blood (Tmax) occurred 11 days after infusion.

Abecma can persist in peripheral blood for up to 1 year post-infusion.

Abecma transgene levels were positively associated with objective tumour response (partial response or better). In patients who received Abecma in the KarMMa-3 study, the median Cmax levels in responders (N = 180) were approximately 5.4-fold higher compared to the corresponding levels in non-responders (N = 40). Median AUC0-28 days in responders (N = 180) was approximately 5.5-fold higher than non-responders (N = 38). In patients who received Abecma in the KarMMa study, the median Cmax levels in responders (N = 93) were approximately 4.5-fold higher compared to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

corresponding levels in non-responders (N = 34). Median AUC0-28 days in responding patients (N = 93) was approximately 5.5-fold higher than non-responders (N = 32).

## Special populations

Renal and hepatic impairment

Hepatic and renal impairment studies of Abecma were not conducted.

## Effects of age, weight, gender or race

Age (range: 30 to 81 years) had no impact on Abecma expansion parameters. The pharmacokinetics of Abecma in patients less than 18 years of age have not been evaluated.

Patients with lower body weight had higher cellular expansion. Due to high variability in pharmacokinetic cellular expansion, the overall effect of weight on the expanison parameters of Abecma is considered not to be clinically relevant.

Gender had no impact on Abecma expansion parameters.

Race and ethnicity had no significant impact on Abecma expansion parameters.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Abecma comprises engineered human T cells, therefore there are no representative in vitro assays, ex vivo models, or in vivo models that can accurately address the toxicological characteristics of the human product. Hence, traditional toxicology studies used for drug development were not performed. Genotoxicity assays and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted.

In vitro expansion studies from healthy donors and patients showed no evidence for transformation and/or immortalisation and no preferential integration near genes of concern in Abecma T cells.

Given the nature of the product, non-clinical studies on fertility, reproduction and development were not conducted.

Each cryopreservation bag is individually packed in a metal cassette.

One individual treatment dose is comprised of one or more infusion bags of the same size and fill volume.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

Abecma must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers.

This medicinal product contains human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Abecma must take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases.

## Preparation prior to administration

Prior to Abecma infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient's identity matches the patient identifiers on the Abecma cassette(s), the infusion bag(s) and the release for infusion certificate (RfIC). The Abecma infusion bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. The company must be contacted immediately if there are any discrepancies between the labels and the patient identifiers.

If more than one infusion bag has been received for treatment, thaw each infusion bag one at a time. The timing of thaw of Abecma and infusion should be coordinated. The infusion start time should be confirmed in advance and adjusted for thaw so that Abecma is available for infusion when the patient is ready.

## Thawing

- Remove the Abecma infusion bag from the cassette and inspect the infusion bag for any breaches of container integrity such as breaks or cracks before thawing. If the infusion bag appears to have been damaged or to be leaking, it should not be infused and should be disposed of according to local guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material.
- Place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag.
- Thaw Abecma at approximately 37°C using an approved thaw device or water bath until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse visible clumps of cellular material. Small clumps of cellular material are expected in Abecma. Do not wash, spin down and/or resuspend Abecma in new media prior to infusion.
- Abecma infusion bag is overwrapped with a transparent plastic sleeve that is folded to the back of the infusion bag. Gently remove the infusion bag from the overwrap by unfolding the plastic sleeve at the back to expose the infusion bag. Pull the infusion bag out of the overwrap.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Administration

- Prime the tubing of the infusion set with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection prior to infusion. Infusion set with in-line filter (a non-leukodepleting filter with a pore size range of 170 to 260 μ m) should be used for thawed products.
- Infuse Abecma within 1 hour from start of thaw as quickly as tolerated by gravity flow.
- After the entire content of the infusion bag is infused, rinse the tubing, inclusive of the in-line filter, with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at the same infusion rate to ensure as many cells as possible are infused into the patient.
- Follow the same procedure for all subsequent infusion bags for the identified patient.

## Measures to take in case of accidental exposure

In case of accidental exposure, local guidelines on handling of human-derived material must be followed. Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with Abecma must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.

## Precautions to be taken for disposal of the medicinal product

Unused medicinal product and all material that has been in contact with Abecma (solid and liquid waste) must be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance with local guidelines on handling of human-derived material.

## 1. What Abecma is and what it is used for

## What Abecma is

Abecma is a type of medicine called a 'genetically modified cell therapy'. The active substance in the medicine is idecabtagene vicleucel, which is made from your own white blood cells, called T cells.

## What Abecma is used for

Abecma is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the bone marrow.

It is given when previous treatments for your cancer have not worked or the cancer has come back.

## How Abecma works

The white blood cells are taken from your blood and are genetically modified so that they can target the myeloma cells in your body.

When Abecma is infused into your blood, the modified white blood cells will kill the myeloma cells.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Abecma

## You must not be given Abecma

- if you are allergic to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice.
- if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the medicines you will be given for lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which is used to prepare your body for Abecma treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

## Before you are given Abecma you should tell your doctor if:

- you have any lung or heart problems.
- you have low blood pressure.
- you have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months.
- you have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease. This happens when transplanted cells attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody stools.
- you have an infection. The infection will be treated before you are given Abecma.
- you notice the symptoms of your cancer getting worse. In myeloma these might include fever, feeling weak, bone pain, unexplained weight loss.
- you have had cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, hepatitis B or C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
- you have had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few months.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before you are given Abecma.

Patients treated with Abecma may develop new types of cancers. There have been reports of patients developing cancer, beginning in a type of white blood cells called T cells, after treatment with Abecma and similar medicines. Talk to your doctor if you experience any new swelling of your glands (lymph nodes) or changes in your skin such as new rashes or lumps.

## Tests and checks

## Before you are given Abecma your doctor will:

- Check your lungs, heart and blood pressure.
- Look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given Abecma.
- Check if your cancer is getting worse.
- Check for CMV infection, hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection.

## After you have been given Abecma

- There are serious side effects which you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight away and which may require you to get immediate medical attention. See section 4 under 'Serious side effects'.
- Your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells may decrease.
- Stay close to the treatment centre where you had Abecma for at least 2 weeks. Your doctor may recommend you stay longer to make sure the care you get after your treatment meets your individual needs. See sections 3 and 4.
- Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation.

## Children and adolescents

Abecma should not be given to children and adolescents below 18 years of age.

## Other medicines and Abecma

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

## Medicines that affect your immune system

Before you are given Abecma, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken your immune system such as corticosteroids. This is because these medicines may interfere with the effect of Abecma.

See section 3 for information about the medicines you will be given before having Abecma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Vaccinations

You must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines:

- in the 6 weeks before you are given a short course of chemotherapy (called lympodepleting chemotherapy) to prepare your body for Abecma.
- during Abecma treatment.
- after treatment while the immune system is recovering.

Talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. This is because the effects of Abecma in pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known and it may harm your unborn baby or breast-fed child.

- If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Abecma, talk to your doctor immediately.
- You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Abecma should only be given if the results show you are not pregnant.

Discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Abecma.

## Driving and using machines

Do not drive, use machines or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 4 weeks after treatment or until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered. Abecma may make you feel sleepy, may cause confusion or fits (seizures). Based on your individual needs, your doctor may advise you to wait longer before driving.

## Abecma contains sodium, potassium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)

This medicine contains up to 752 mg sodium (main component of cooking/ table salt) per dose. This is equivalent to 37.6% of the recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult.

This medicine contains up to 274 mg potassium per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet.

If you have not been previously exposed to DMSO you should be observed closely during the first minutes of the infusion period.

## 3. How Abecma is given

## Giving blood to make Abecma from your white blood cells

- Your doctor will take some of your blood using a tube (catheter) in your vein. Some of your white blood cells will be separated from your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your body. This is called 'leukapheresis' and can take 3 to 6 hours. This process may need to be repeated.
- Your white blood cells will then be frozen and sent away to make Abecma.

## Other medicines you will be given before Abecma

- A few days before you receive Abecma, you will be given a short course of chemotherapy. This is to clear away your existing white blood cells.
- Shortly before you receive Abecma, you will be given paracetamol and an antihistamine medicine. This is to reduce the risk of infusion reactions and fever.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## How Abecma is given

- Your doctor will check that the Abecma was prepared from your own blood by checking the patient identity information on the medicine labels matches your details.
- Abecma is given as an infusion drip through a tube into your vein.

## After Abecma is given

- Stay close to the treatment centre where you received Abecma - for at least 2 weeks.
- You may be monitored daily in the treatment centre for at least 1 week to check if your treatment is working - and help you if you have any side effects. See sections 2 and 4.
- Do not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation.

## If you miss an appointment

Call your doctor or the treatment centre as soon as possible to make another appointment.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects

## This leaflet was last revised in

## Other sources of information

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: https://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

It is important that you read the entire content of this procedure prior to administering Abecma.

## Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

- Abecma must be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers.
- This medicinal product contains human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Abecma must take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases.

## Preparation prior to administration

- Prior to Abecma infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient's identity matches the patient identifiers on the Abecma cassette(s), the infusion bag(s) and the release for infusion certificate (RfIC).
- The Abecma infusion bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the intended patient. The company must be contacted immediately if there are any discrepancies between the labels and the patient identifiers.
- If more than one infusion bag has been received for treatment, thaw each infusion bag one at a time. The timing of thaw of Abecma and infusion should be coordinated. The infusion start time should be confirmed in advance and adjusted for thaw so that Abecma is available for infusion when the patient is ready.

## Thawing

- Remove the Abecma infusion bag from the cassette and inspect the infusion bag for any breaches of container integrity such as breaks or cracks before thawing. If the infusion bag appears to have been damaged or to be leaking, it should not be infused and should be disposed of according to local guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material.
- Place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag.
- Thaw Abecma at approximately 37°C using an approved thaw device or water bath until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse visible clumps of cellular material. Small clumps of cellular material are expected in Abecma. Do not wash, spin down and/or resuspend Abecma in new media prior to infusion.
- Abecma infusion bag is overwrapped with a transparent plastic sleeve that is folded to the back of the infusion bag. Gently remove the infusion bag from the overwrap by unfolding the plastic sleeve at the back to expose the infusion bag. Pull the infusion bag out of the overwrap.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Administration

- Do NOT use a leukodepleting filter.
- Intravenous infusion of Abecma should only be administered by a healthcare professional experienced with immunosuppressed patients and prepared to manage anaphylaxis.
- Ensure that tocilizumab and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period. In the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, ensure that suitable alternative measures to treat CRS instead of tocilizumab are available on-site.
- Central venous access may be utilised for the infusion of Abecma and is encouraged in patients with poor peripheral access.
- Before administration, it must be confirmed that the patient's identity matches the unique patient information on the Abecma infusion bag and accompanying documentation. The total number of infusion bags to be administered must also be confirmed with the patient specific information on the release for infusion certificate (RfIC).
- Prime the tubing of the infusion set with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection prior to infusion. Infusion set with in-line filter (a non-leukodepleting filter with a pore size range of 170 to 260 μ m) should be used for thawed products.
- Infuse Abecma within 1 hour from start of thaw as quickly as tolerated by gravity flow.
- After the entire content of the infusion bag is infused, rinse the tubing, inclusive of the in-line filter, with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at the same infusion rate to ensure as many cells as possible are infused into the patient.
- Follow the same procedure for all subsequent infusion bags for the identified patient.

## Measures to take in case of accidental exposure

- In case of accidental exposure, local guidelines on handling of human-derived material must be followed. Work surfaces and materials which have potentially been in contact with Abecma must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant.

## Precautions to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product

- Unused medicinal product and all material that has been in contact with Abecma (solid and liquid waste) must be handled and disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance with local guidelines on handling of human-derived material.
