Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 13 May 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Paxlovid, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

It has to be underlined that these data from study C4671042 are expected to be submitted and assessed as part of the post-authorisation measure MEA 19.1. This current P46 procedure will only focus on paediatric data from this study (i.e. only 1 subject).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

This study is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (European Commission [EC] No 1901/2006). The MAH is submitting the CSR under Article 46 within 6 months of completion to report paediatric data. The Marketing Authorisation Holder is not proposing any amendments to the Paxlovid EU Summary of Product Characteristics to add data from Study C4671042.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The currently approved formulation of Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablet 150 mg + ritonavir tablet 100 mg) was used in the study. An age-appropriate oral dose formulation for the treatment of COVID-19 from birth to less than 18 years of age is under investigation.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study C4671042 (An Interventional, Efficacy and Safety, Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, 2-Arm Study to Investigate a Repeat 5-Day Course of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir Compared to Placebo/Ritonavir in Participants at Least 12 Years of Age With Rebound of COVID-19 Symptoms and Rapid Antigen Test Positivity). Of the 436 participants who were assigned to treatment, 1 participant was a pediatric participant.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

C4671042, An Interventional, Efficacy and Safety, Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, 2Arm Study to Investigate a Repeat 5-Day Course of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir Compared to Placebo/Ritonavir in Participants at Least 12 Years of Age With Rebound of COVID-19 Symptoms and Rapid Antigen Test Positivity.

## Description

This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a repeat 5-day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or placebo/ritonavir for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

## Methods

## Study participants

Participants ≥12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg at screening, with rebound of COVID -19 symptoms and rapid antigen test positivity within 2 weeks (14 days) following documented completion of an initial 5-day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Participants must have had at least 1 characteristic or underlying medical condition associated with an increased risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19. However, participants who are immunocompromised were excluded from this study as they may have had prolonged viral shedding due to their immunocompromised state. Participants were eligible for enrollment irrespective of COVID-19 vaccination/boosted status (except for time course restrictions listed in the exclusion criteria).

## Treatments

The first dose of study intervention will be administered at the site.

Nirmatrelvir 150 mg tablets or placebo for nirmatrelvir will be administered with ritonavir 100 mg for 5 days.

Participants will be instructed to take:

- 2 tablets of nirmatrelvir 150 mg or placebo for nirmatrelvir q12h;
- 1 capsule of ritonavir 100 mg q12h.

Participants with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [or eCrCl ≥ 30 to &lt;60 mL/min] at screening) will receive either 1 tablet of nirmatrelvir 150 mg and placebo for nirmatrelvir or 2 tablets of placebo for nirmatrelvir. The dose for ritonavir remains unchanged (ie, participants will receive 1 capsule of ritonavir 100 mg q12h).

## Objective

Primary objective: To compare the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to placebo/ritonavir on viral RNA level in NP swabs in participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint: The change in viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA level as measured in NP swabs from baseline to Day 5.

Secondary and exploratory objectives include notably the comparison nirmatrelvir/ritonavir vs placebo/ritonavir on the duration of viral shedding, the duration and severity of signs and symptoms, the viral RNA level in NP swabs and plasma, the COVID-19-related hospitalization and all-cause mortality.

## Sample size

A sample size of approximately 315 evaluable participants (210 participants in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group and 105 participants in placebo/ritonavir group) is expected to provide 90% power to detect a difference of 0.7 log10 copies/mL in viral RNA between groups using a 2-sided 0.05 alpha level test. Assuming  approximately  10%  of  participants  will  have  a  negative  viral  RNA  result  at  baseline,  and assuming a non-evaluable rate of 15%, approximately 411 participants will be randomized in the study to achieve approximately 315 participants evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Eligible participants for this study will be randomly assigned (2:1 allocation of active to placebo) to receive:

- nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir orally q12h for 5 days; or
- placebo plus ritonavir orally q12h for 5 days.

Randomization will be stratified by geographic region.

Participants must be randomized within 48 hours from the onset of the rebound COVID-19 symptoms and must be randomized within 24 hours of a positive baseline rapid antigen test.

A decision was made to remove efficacy data from the analyses for Site 1020 due to GCP quality issues. A total of 41 participants were enrolled at Site 1020 and data from all 41 participants were excluded from efficacy analyses. No further participants were enrolled at this site after the GCP quality issues were identified. The pediatric participant was not enrolled at Site 1020.

## Results

## Participant flow

Of the 551 participants who were screened for entry into the study, 436 participants were assigned to treatment. During the treatment phase (through Day 5/6), 2 participants discontinued study intervention during the treatment period due to an AE, but none of those AEs caused the participant to be discontinued from the study. During the efficacy and safety follow-up phase (through Day 34) and long-term follow-up phase, the most frequent reason for study discontinuation was withdrawal by participant.

The one enrolled pediatric participant completed the study.

Participants from Site 1020 were excluded from efficacy analyses due to GCP quality issues.

## Baseline data

Overall, 56.7% participants were female. 90.8% of participants were White, 4.6% were Black or African American, 3.4% were Asian, 0.2% were American Indian or Alaska Native; and 0.2% were multiracial. 53.0% of participants were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 94.0% participants had a positive serology test at baseline. A total of 72.0% of participants had a baseline SARS-CoV2 RNA level ≥4 log10 copies/mL and 20.9% of participants had a baseline SARS-CoV2 RNA level ≥7 log10 copies/mL.

The paediatric participant had a medical history of chronic respiratory disease and asthma. The paediatric participant had a baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA of 4.73 log10 copies/mL.

## Efficacy results

Primary endpoint: change in viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA level as measured in NP swabs from baseline to Day 5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the mITT population who received at least 1 dose of study intervention and who had a positive viral RNA NP swab test result (≥2.0 log10 copies/mL) at baseline, on -treatment reduction in viral RNA level (ie, change from baseline in viral RNA concentration) at Day 5 was significantly (p=0.0004) larger in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment group than in the placebo/ritonavir group.

At baseline (Day 1), the pediatric participant had an NP swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA of 4.73 log10 copies/mL but had undetectable (ie, 0.0 log10 copies/mL) viral RNA from the Day 3 through Day 10 visits, which increased to 1.7 log10 copies/mL at Day 15. Viral RNA from Day 21-28 was undetectable (ie, 0.0 log10 copies/mL). Viral RNA at Day 34 was 1.7 log10 copies/mL.

There were no COVID-19 related medical visits reported for the pediatric participant (Module 5.3.3.5 C4671042 LPLV CSR V1.0 Table 16.2.6.4).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Time (days) to sustained resolution of all targeted signs and symptoms through Day 28 where sustained resolution is defined as the first of two consecutive days when all targeted COVID-19 symptoms are scored as absent. | Treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduced the median time to sustained resolution of all targeted signs and symptoms through Day 28 in the mITT analysis set. The median time to sustained resolution of all targeted signs and symptoms was 12 days in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group and 13 days in the placebo treatment group (Module 5.3.3.5 Study C4671042 LPLV CSR V1.0 Table 14.2.18.1). See Module 5.3.3.5 Study C4671042 LPLV CSR V1.0 Section 5.1.13 for more details. The pediatric participant had sustained resolution of all targeted signs and symptoms observed at baseline (ie, moderate cough, headache, low energy or tiredness, and mild muscle or body aches) by Day 8 (Module 5.3.3.5 C4671042 LPLV CSR V1.0 Table 16.2.6.2). |

due to adverse events

Overall, the proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events that started on or prior to the Day 34 was higher in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group (26.6%) compared to the placebo/ritonavir group (20.8%). When focusing on drug-related adverse events, the differential is more marked (13.1% vs 5.6%)

## Most common AEs:

As expected, the most common AEs reported in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group were dysgueusia (10% vs 1.4% in the placebo arm) and diarrhoea (2.4% vs 1.4%).  All these events were considered related to study drug by the investigator and were non serious.

AE of cough are also reported in 4 subjects in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group (1.4%) versus none in the placebo/ritonavir group but none of them were considered related to study intervention.

Mots of events are mild to moderate in severity. However, a participant older than 70 years of age in the nirmaterlvir/ritonavir group had a potentially life-threatening (Grade 4) adverse event of abdominal pain and a severe (Grade 3) AE of diarrhoea that started on Study Day 3 and resulted in discontinuation of study  intervention  and  resolved  after  that.  Both  of  these  TEAEs  were  considered  related  to  study intervention by the investigator.

## Death

There were no deaths reported during the study.

## Serious adverse events

Two  subjects  experienced  SAE  on  or  prior  to  the  Day  34:  1  subject  in  each  treatment  group (gastrointestinal haemorrhage in nirmatrelvir/ ritonavir group and hypovolemia in the placebo/ritonavir group). None of them was considered related to study intervention by the investigator:

The  SAE  of  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  reported  in  the  nirmaterlvir/ritonavir  group  concerns  a participant older than 18 years of age with medical history of obesity and cardiovascular risk factors. The event occurred at Day 27 and was related to oesophageal ulcer. The patient was treated and the event resolved.

During the long-term follow-up period, two SAEs were reported, both in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group (B-cell lymphoma at day 65 and general anxiety disorder/major depression at Day 30, both in adults).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

None  were  considered  related  to  study  intervention.  There  were  considered  related  to  pre-existing medical conditions (history of cancer in the first case and of depression/general anxiety in the second case)

## Discontinuations due to AEs:

Two subjects discontinued the study medication due to an AE and continued the study, one in each treatment group (abdominal pain/ diarrhoea in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group and one TEAE of COVID-19 in the placebo/ritonavir group)

No participant discontinued the study due to TEAEs.

## Laboratory abnormalities:

The  overall  incidence  of  laboratory  test  abnormalities  without  regard  to  baseline  abnormality  was comparable between treatment groups.

Mean changes from baseline over time for laboratory parameters (including ALT/AST and creatinine) were also generally small and similar between treatment groups.

No potential Hy's law cases were identified in either treatment group.

## Vital signs:

No  clinically  meaningful  findings  in  the  vital  signs  measurements  were  observed  in  this  study.  The assessments and observations were comparable between treatment groups.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Considering that only 1 paediatric subject was included in this study, the paediatric data are too limited to be discussed.

Overall, as regards efficacy data in patients who experiences COVID-19 rebound, the reduction in viral RNA level after 5 days of treatment with Paxlovid was significantly larger than in subjects who have received placebo. However, the clinical impact of this larger decrease in viral load (i.e. time to alleviation of symptoms, hospitalisation rates, COVID-19 related visits) was not demonstrated.

As regards safety aspects, no safety signal was raised from this study. The most commonly reported adverse  events  are  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  the  drug  and  are  listed  in  the  Product information.

As stated by MAH, the submission of safety and efficacy data from this study does not warrant any changes to the current, approved EU SmPC for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The benefit-risk profile remains unchanged for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled:

No further action required, however data from study C4671042 are expected to be assessed in the context of the PAM MEA 19.1.
