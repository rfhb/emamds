## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for agomelatine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

84 cases of confusional state/disorientation have been reported cumulatively. There are two welldocumented cases of delirium, both with positive rechallenge. Additionally, there is substantial number of events that are timely related to the initiation of treatment with agomelatine and with positive dechallenge.

Therefore, in view of available data regarding confusional state, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for agomelatine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing agomelatine is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.
