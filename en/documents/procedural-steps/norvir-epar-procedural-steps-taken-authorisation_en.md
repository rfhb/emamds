## BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 1. Submission of the dossier

The  applicant  Abbott  Laboratories  submitted  on  26  February  1996  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) for Norvir oral solution 80 mg/ml and hard capsules 100 mg, through the centralised procedure. Norvir 100 mg soft  capsules  have  further  been  developed  to  replace  the  hard  capsules. Please  refer  to  modules 'STEPS  AFTER  ASSESSMENT'  and  'SCIENTIFIC  DISCUSSION'  (Section  2). After agreement by the CPMP on 18 September 1995, this medicinal product is referred to Part B in the Annex of the Council Regulation EEC No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993; indent 7 as it contains a new active substance.

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CPMP were:

Rapporteur:

Dr. H. Van Bronswijk

## Licensing status:

Norvir  has  been  given  a  Marketing  Auorisation  in  several  countries  including  in  the  USA  on 1 March 1996.

## 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

- The procedure started on 13 March 1996.
- During  the  meeting  in  April,  the  CPMP  agreed  to  perform  a  GMP  inspection  on  the  USA manufacturing  facility  for  the  finished  medicinal  product  (Norvir  capsules)  by  the  U.K. Inspectorates.
- The company submitted additional information with regard to the correlation of the changes in viral and immunological parameters and the clinical outcomes in study M94-247 as requested by the Rapporteur. In addition subgroup analysis according to treatment regimens  in  study  M94-247  was  provided  as  requested.  These  supplementary  analyses  were distributed to all CPMP Members during the April CPMP meeting 15-18 April 1996.
- A preliminary Co-Rapporteur's pharmaceutical and preclinical assessment report was circulated to  all  CPMP  Members on 25 April 1996. A preliminary Co-Rapporteur's clinical assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 26 April 1996.
- The Rapporteur's assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 26 April 1996. The Co-Rapporteur's assessment report, partially revised, was circulated to all CPMP Members on 30 April 1996.
- The  company  submitted  to  the  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur  additional  information  in response to their objections and points for clarifications raised on 13 May 1996.
- A break-out session on Norvir was organised on 20 May 1996, between Rapporteur and CoRapporteur assessment teams and experts in AIDS field, to prepare a draft opinion for Norvir and a list of questions which were circulated during the May CPMP meeting.
- A hearing was held on 21 May 1996 with the company during the CPMP meeting to address concerns related to quality aspects (stereoselective synthesis and control of stereoisomers, bulk drug impurity limits, finished product degradate limits, control of polyoxyl 35 castor oil) and clinical  aspects  (updated  data  on  studies  M94-247  and  M94-245,  information  on  ongoing clinical trials  and  studies  planned  to  be  conducted).  The  applicant  provided  additional information, which, for most of them were considered acceptable. The remaining points were included in the list of commitments the applicant, after agreement, would have to fulfil.

- The applicant submitted on 22 May 1996 their letter of commitments for providing information on clinical aspects (submission of the finalised reports of both phase III studies, submission of detailed study programme for an expanded investigation of antiretroviral combination therapy) as part of the re-assessment of the benefit/risk profile. The applicant also committed to provide additional data on specified quality, safety and efficacy aspects.
- The assessment report on the applicant's responses was jointly prepared by the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur on 23 May 1996 and was circulated to all CPMP members on 24 May 1996.
- The CPMP in the light of the  overall  data  submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the Committee,  issued  on  23  May  1996  positive  opinions  for  granting  a  marketing  authorisation under exceptional circumstances for both presentations of Norvir.
- Following  a  rapid  alert  from  France  on  the  14  June  1996,  drawing  attention  to  reports  of spontaneous  bleedings  in  haemophiliac  patients  involved  in  the Autorisation  Temporaire d'Utilisation  (ATU) program,  the  CPMP  during  their  meeting  of  16-17  July  1996  agreed  to revise  the  opinions  adopted  on  23  May  1996.  In  the  revised  opinions  warnings  have  been introduced into the Summary of Product Characteristics and in the Package Leaflet in the light of  the  information  available.  The  wordings  proposed  by  the  CPMP  have  been  discussed between  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  and  the  companies  involved  in  the  marketing  of protease  inhibitors.  An  agreement  on  the  warnings  to  be  introduced  has  been  reached  on Monday, 22 July 1996.
- The CPMP revised opinions were forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 26 August 1996.
