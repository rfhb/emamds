## 2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

## Problem statement

Unlike  the  inflammation  that  is  produced  immediately  after  cataract  surgery  as  a  physiological response  affecting  the  eye's  anterior  chamber,  macular  oedema  (ME)  is  described  as  a  distinct complication of cataract surgery, especially in diabetic patients, characterised by swelling within the retina at the macular area. It has been reported in up 2% of patients but the incidence may be as high as 20% when the extraction is complicated by posterior capsule rupture with vitreous loss or severe iris trauma. There is an abnormal thickening of the macula associated with the accumulation of excess fluid in the extracellular space of the retina or within multiple cyst-like spaces within the macula occurs (ie,  cystoid  ME  [CME]).  ME  and  cystoid  macular  oedema  (CME)  are  common  causes  of  poor  visual outcome following uneventful cataract surgery.

Prostaglandins contribute significantly to the inflammatory processes that result in fluid leakage from perifoveal capillaries into the extracellular space of the macular region. Because topical NSAIDs block the cyclooxygenase enzymes responsible for prostaglandin production, some reports suggest NSAIDs also may reduce the incidence, duration and severity of CME. Cataract development occurs at a higher rate and an earlier age in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. Additionally, macular changes are more likely  to  occur  following  cataract  surgery  in  diabetic  patients,  especially  those  with  pre-existing retinopathies, compared to non-diabetic patients. The ME rates reported in the literature for diabetic retinopathy patients vary considerably based on the criteria used to define ME.

Optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT)  has  been  shown  to  provide  reproducible  measurements  of macular thickness and volume in normal individuals and diabetic patients with or without retinopathy but very few studies to date have evaluated ME in diabetic patients after cataract surgery using this method.

Treatment of ME is aimed at the underlying aetiology; however, several of the common treatments may help to different causes of CME. Medical treatment modalities include topical therapy consisting of Corticosteroids, and NSAIDs. They are considered as the primary treatment of CME in many instances. Some reports suggest NSAIDs also may reduce the incidence, duration and severity of cystoid macular oedema following cataract surgery. Moreover, it is well known that off label prophylactic use of topical NSAIDs  is  not  unusual  in  clinical  practice  (The  American  Academy  of  ophthalmology  Web  Site: http://www.aao.org/publications/eyenet/200701/retina.cfm).

If topical therapy fails periocular or intravitreal steroids may be considered. Surgical therapy includes pars plana vitrectomy.

## Background on the product

NEVANAC (Nevanac  1mg/ml  Eye  Drops,  Suspension),  was  approved  on  December  12,  2007  in  the European Union for the prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery.

Nevanac  is  a  member  of  the  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug  (NSAID)  class.  The  drug  is formulated as a suspension applied by the topical ocular route.

The active ingredient, Nevanac (amfenac amide) is a prodrug that rapidly penetrates the cornea and is coverted to  the active metabolite, amfenac, by intraocular hydrolases within ocular tissues including

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the ciliary body epithelium, retina and choroid. Amfenac inhibits both cyclooxygenase COX-1 and COX2  activity.  Because  bioconversion  is  targeted  to  the  iris/ciliary  body  and  (to  a  greater  extent)  the retina/choroid, Nevanac may have prolonged activity in the vascularized tissues of the eye.

In a rabbit model of concanavalin-A induced retinal inflammation, topical Nevanac penetrated to the posterior segment where it decreased vitreous protein and PGE2 concentrations, indicating stabilization of the blood-retina barrier.

## Scope

The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet.

With this application the MAH proposed to add the following indication: 'prevention of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery' with consequential changes to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

The MAH proposed also to update sections 4.8 of the SmPC in order to reflect the CCSI which was submitted with PSUR 5. The Company Core Safety Information (CCSI) was generated on the basis of the clinical  studies  which had been completed in respect of the indication macular oedema plus one additional study which was ongoing at the time of the MAA and which had been completed by the time of this variation.

Minor amendments to the SmPC were proposed by the MAH in accordance with the SmPC guideline.

The MAH submitted a request for a 1-year extension of the marketing protection according to article 14(11) of Regulation EC No 726/2004.  A separate report is attached.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1 Introduction

The  development  programme/Compliance  with  CHMP  Guidance/Scientific  Advice  There  is  not  CHMP guideline on the development of medicinal products in the treatment of the intended indication.

Alcon consulted the Danish Medicines Agency (DKMA) (August 26, 2008) and the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) (December 10, 2008) to discuss the MAA Variation.

The following is a summary of the result of these advices:

The clinical development plan was agreed. This plan would include a Phase II proof of concept study in a  broader  patient  population,  the  proposed  Phase  III  study  in  diabetic  patients  undergoing  cataract extraction,  supportive  literature,  and  the  well  established  use  of  currently  marketed  products  in  the same class that currently have the proposed indication.

The  dossier  should  provide  strong  support  for  extrapolating  the  results  of  the  Phase  III  study  in diabetic patients to the broader population studied in the Phase II proof of concept study

The proposed primary endpoint, percentage of patients who develop macular edema defined as ≥ 30% increase  from  pre-operative  baseline  in  central  subfield  macular  thickness  within  90  days  following cataract surgery was supported.

- The proposed Secondary endpoint 'percentage of patients with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) decrease of &gt; 5 ETDRS letters from the Day 7 postoperative VA assessment' will be declared a key secondary endpoint. The stabilization of vision in treated patients has to be demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Alcon also discussed the clinical development program with the FDA in 2007:

-  A  study  in  patients  with  diabetic  retinopathy  requiring  cataractextraction  was  discussed. Nevanac 1 drop administered 3-times-daily was planned to be administered in the operative eye for 180 days following surgery.
-  The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with BCVA of 20/30 or worse and macular edema. Retinal thickness will be assessed with ocular coherence tomography.
-  Two studies for new patient populations not studied in the previous one would be also required
-  The OTC was not accepted as a primary endpoint. A correlation to vision will be also required.

## General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP

According to the MAH, the clinical studies have been performed in compliance with GCP regulations.

## 2.2.2 Clinical Efficacy

## 2.2.2.1 Introduction

The MAH submitted the results of 3 studies to support the prevention of macular oedema associated with cataract surgery. Study C-07-43 formed the basis to support the efficacy of Nevanac in the applied indication ,ie ' prevention of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery'.

The other two studies were considered as supportive: Study C-05-20 was primarily a safety study, in which a higher dose of Nevanac (QID vs TID) was administered. In Study C-07-32 the efficacy of Nevanac was assessed using different methods and for a shorter period of time.

## 2.2.2.2 Main study

Main study -Study C-07-43: 'A Clinical Safety and Efficacy Comparison of NEVANAC 0.1% to Vehicle Following Cataract Surgery in Diabetic Retinopathy Patients'

## METHODS

The study was conducted in 41 centres located in United States from November 4, 2008 to July 15, 2010. This was a pivotal, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trial.

##  Study Participants

The trial recruited patients with history of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and non proliferative retinopathy (mild,  moderate,  or  severe)  as  defined  by  the  International  Clinical  Diabetic  Retinopathy  Disease Severity  Scale.  At  least  50  %  of  the  enrolled  population  should  have  moderate  to  severe  NPDR. Patients had a cataract, and were planning to undergo cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with the implantation of a posterior chamber IOL into the lens capsule. This could be considered an at risk population of developing macular edema as a consequence of cataract surgery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Objectives

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of Nevanac relative to Vehicle, based on the percentage of diabetic retinopathy patients who developed ME (defined as ≥ 30% increase from pre-operative baseline in central subfield macular thickness) within 90 days following cataract surgery.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Efficacy

Primary variable was the percentage of patients who developed ME. It was defined as an increase of 30% or more in central subfield macular thickness relative to the pre-operative baseline measurement within 90 days following cataract surgery. The primary endpoint was in agreement with literature.

## Secondary Efficacy

Key secondary variable was the percentage of patients who had a decrease of more than 5 letters in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from Day 7 to Day 90 (or Early Exit). BCVA was measured using the procedure developed for the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study.

## Other Efficacy variables

These included time to development of treatment failure and mean change in BCVA from Day 7 to Day 90 (or Early Exit).

Exploratory Variables:

- central subfield macular thickness
- central subfield macular thickness change from Baseline
- Treatment failures
- BCVA change from preoperative Baseline to Day 90/Exit

## RESULTS

##  Participant flow

A  total  of  263  patients  were  enrolled  (133  patients  in  Nevanac  group  and  130  in  Vehicle  group). The number of enrolled patients who completed the study was 118 and 102 patients, respectively.

Among all patients enrolled in the Nevanac group, the most common reason for study discontinuation was patient decision (4.5%), followed by treatment failure (2.3%) and AE (1.5%). Among all patients enrolled in the Vehicle group, the most common reason for study discontinuation was treatment failure (10.8%), followed by AE (3.8%), failure to meet the entry criteria (2.3%), consent withdrawal (1.5%), and error (1.5%); and patient decision (2.3%).

##  Outcomes and estimation

Macular Edema: ≥ 30% increase from Baseline in central subfield macular thickness

The number and percentage of patients who developed ME within 90 days following cataract surgery was also evaluated by demographic subgroup. In general, due to the small number of patients who developed ME during the specified period, no conclusions could be drawn from the subgroup analysis.

## Secondary Efficacy

The macular thickness was substantially less in patients treated with Nevanac than in patients treated with  Vehicle  (206.6  microns  vs  233.0  microns  p  &lt;  0.001),  and  the  mean  maximum  change  from Baseline in central subfield macular thickness in Nevanac group was lower than in patients treated with Vehicle (18.9% versus 40.8%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  mean  central  subfield  macular  thickness  for  patients  treated  with  Nevanac  was  lower  than  for patients treated with Vehicle at all post-operative study visits (ie, Days 14 [p =  0.001], 30 [p &lt; 0.001], 60 [p &lt; 0.001] and 90 [p &lt; 0.001]).

An exploratory analysis using a 30% change, in center point macular thickness, resulted in a greater percentage  of  patients  with  ME  in  the  Vehicle  group  than  in  the  Nevanac  group  (p  =  0.002).  The analysis of 40% change from baseline exhibits the same incidence of ME for the Vehicle treated group, 16.7%, and for the Nevanac treated patients results in a higher percentage (8.0%) and 7 additional patients.  However,  review  of  the  data  from  these  7  patients  reveals  that  none  of  these  patients exhibited  any  corresponding  clinically  relevant  changes.  None  of  these  patients  had  a  &gt;5  letter decrease in BCVA from Day 7 to exit and none developed cysts.

## b) Outcome related to BEST-CORRECTED VISUAL ACUITY

Seven (5.6%) patients treated with Nevanac had decreases in BCVA of 5 or more letters from day 7 to day 90/early exit compared with 14 (11.5%) patients treated with Vehicle (p = 0.102).

There were small improvements in the mean BCVA for both groups, from Day 7 to Day 90/Exit Visit.

A greater percentage of patients treated with Nevanac (56.8%) experienced a BCVA improvement of 15 letters or more from pre-operative Baseline to Day 90 compared with patients treated with Vehicle (41.9%) (p = 0.019).

A greater percentage of patients treated with Vehicle (27.9%) experienced a decrease in BCVA of more than  5  letters  at  any  visit  after  Day  7  compared  with  patients  treated  with  Nevanac  (10.5%) (p &lt; 0.001).

The BCVA outcome for patients in both treatment groups who were treated with steroid therapy for 2 weeks had better visual outcome than patients who received steroid therapy for longer than 2 weeks.

The change in the number of letters read from Day 7 to Day 90 was evaluated for patients with and without ME, for patients with and without ME or cysts, for patients with and without treatment failure, and  for  patients  in  each  study  drug  group  who  received  more  than  2  weeks  of  adjunctive  steroid treatment. Overall, changes in BCVA were not significantly different based on the presence or absence of ME (p = 0.429), ME or cysts (p = 0.386), or treatment failure (p = 0.386). Finally, in regard to the use of adjunctive steroid therapy, no significant treatment group differences in changes from Day 7 to Day 90 in BCVA were observed (p = 0.948).

## Supportive endpoints:

· A greater percentage of patients treated with Vehicle were considered treatment failures compared with patients treated with Nevanac (46.8% versus 28.0%, respectively; p = 0.002).

·  Patients  treated  with  Vehicle  developed  ME  in  significantly  less  time  than  patients  treated  with Nevanac (p &lt; 0.001).

## 2.2.2.3 Supportive Studies

## 1. Study C-05-20: A 3-Month Clinical Safety Comparison of Nevanac 0.1% to Acular LS 0.4% and Vehicle Following Cataract Surgery

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## METHODS

This was a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-masked, active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial.  The study was conducted from February 15, 2006 to December 20, 2006 in a number of 8 centres the USA.

This 3-armed trial was a safety study, but post hoc several explanatory efficacy analyses were added.

##  Study Participants

Patients  (male  or  female)  had  a  cataract,  and  were  planning  to  undergo  cataract  extraction  by phacoemulsification with the implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens.

A history of any form of diabetes was an exclusion criterion.

##  Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety of Nevanac compared to Ketorolac for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in non diabetic patients after cataract surgery.

Efficacy variables were not prespecified for evaluation, although certain safety variables represented accepted efficacy markers.

-  Outcomes/endpoints

The primary variable was the change from baseline in macular thickness at Day 30 as measured by OCT.

Other  exploratory  efficacy  analyses  such  as  best-corrected  visual  acuity,  and  macular  volume  were conducted.

The assessment of BCVA was initially performed with the logMAR. For comparison with other studies purposes a conversion to number of letters read has been made.

## RESULTS

##  Numbers analysed

One  hundred-sixty  patients  were  randomized  to  treatment  at  8  study  sites.  Of  the  160  patients enrolled into the study, 149 received study medication and were included in the safety analysis and 137 were included in the OCT safety analysis

Of the 149 patients randomized in this study, 14 discontinued from the study for the following reasons: adverse event (8), decision unrelated to an adverse event (4), treatment with steroids for fellow eye 'iritis' (1) and lost to follow-up (1).

-  Outcomes and estimation

## a) Outcome related to MACULAR EDEMA

The primary variable was the change from baseline in macular thickness at Day 30 as measured by OCT, however, it was not predefined to display the increase in μ m.

-  None of the Nevanac-treated patients developed CME compared with 5 Vehicle-treated patients (0% versus 10.4%, respectively) (p = 0.024).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Two patients in the Nevanac group (4.1%) and 1 patient in the Ketorolac 0.4% group (2.3%) compared with 6 Vehicle-treated patients (12.8%) developed ME, defined as a 30% change in central subfield macular thickness at any time during the study.
-  None  of  the  Nevanac-treated  patients  developed  an  increase  of ≥ 50 μ m  from  Baseline  in central  subfield  macular  thickness  at  Day  30  compared  with  5  Vehicle-treated  patients  (0% versus 10.6%, respectively) (p = 0.025).
-  The  severity  of  macular  thickening  was  less  in  Nevanac-treated  patients  compared  with Vehicle-treated patients.
-  Fewer Nevanac-treated patients developed an increase of ≥ 25 μ m from Baseline in central subfield  macular  thickness  at  Day  30  compared  with  Vehicle-treated  patients  (6.1%  versus 34.0%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.001).
-  Nevanac treated patients had a lower mean maximum change from Baseline in central subfield macular  thickness  than  Vehicle-treated  patients  (mean  values  =  17.4 μ m  and  40.9 μ m, respectively (p = 0.109).
-  The mean percent change from Baseline in macular volume was lower in patients treated with Nevanac than in patients treated with Vehicle  at  postoperative  study  visits  on  Day  14  (p  = 0.201), Day 30 (p = 0.050), Day 60 (p = 0.124), and Day 90 (p = 0.255).

· Only 4 (8.0%) of the Nevanac-treated patients had a decrease in BCVA of more than 5 letters from Day 7 to Day 90/Early Exit compared with 9 (20.5%) Vehicle-treated patients (p = 0.081).

· A greater percentage of the Nevanac-treated patients (58.8%) experienced an increase of 15 letters or  more  in  BCVA  from  pre-operative  Baseline  to  Day  90  compared  with  Vehicle-treated  patients (44.7%) (p = 0.162).

## 2. Study C-07-32: A  Preventive Effects of AL-6515 0.1% Ophthalmic Suspension on PostCataract-Surgical  Cystoid  Macular  Edema:  A  Double-Masked  Comparative  Study  With Fluorometholone 0.1% Ophthalmic Suspension

## METHODS

This was a randomized 1:1., parallel-group, active-controlled, double-masked trial to evaluate Nevanac (AL-6515 ) 0.1% versus Fluorometholone 0.1% in Japanese patients following cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation.

The study was conducted from October 30, 2007-April 28, 2008 in one centre in Japan.

##  Study Participants

Patients  scheduled  to  undergo  cataract  extraction  by  phacoemulsification  and  aspiration  (PEA)  with implantation of intraocular lens (IOL).

Among the most important exclusion criteria was diabetic retinopathy. In the list of exclusion criteria patients with diabetic retinopathy and patients with uncontrolled diabetes are mentioned.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Objectives

This  study  was  designed  to  compare  the  preventive  effect  on  cystoid  macular  oedema  (CME)  and safety after cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation between NEVANAC   (Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension) and fluorometholone 1mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension in non-diabetic patients.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  endpoint  was  the  incidence  of  CME  (percentage  of  patients  with  grade  0  in  Miyake's classification based upon Fluorescein angiography after surgery until week 5.

The  chosen  primary  endpoint  of  Miyake  was  standard  at  the  time  of  the  study  conduct  and  is  still considered  a  valuable  tool.  It  was,  though,  different  from  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  confirmatory study discussed in Scientific Advise at national level. This was considered acceptable by CHMP.

Secondary  variables  were  foveal  retinal  thickness;  aqueous  cells  score,  flare  score,  and  flare  value measured by a laser flare meter. Corrected visual acuity was assessed as an exploratory variable.

Besides they were also data related to safety: Adverse events, best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure,  slit-lamp  parameters  (bulbar  conjunctival  injection,  chemosis,  and  corneal  edema),  and dilated fundus parameters (retina, macula, choroid, and optic nerve).

The secondary parameters included inflammation variables which did not seem of obvious relevance in the scope of the evaluation of CME. Further justification and comments were requested by the CHMP.

4 patients had missing CME Week 5 data

There  was  a  significant  difference  between  the  groups  in  the  distribution  of  CME  by  severity (p  &lt;  0.0001),  with  more  severe  CME  (grade  3)  developing  more  frequently  in  the  Fluorometholone group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary Efficacy

-  Mean  foveal  retinal  thickness  was  significantly  lower  in  the  Nevanac  group  compared  to  the Fluorometholone group beginning at Week 2 (p = 0.0266 Week 2; p = 0.0055 Week 5).

The mean foveal retinal thickness between postoperative week 1 and 5 was 190.4-194.3 µm for the NEVANAC group and 193.0-220.1 µm for the fluorometholone group, demonstrating that the retina was  thinner  in  the  former  group  (p=0.005).  There  was  consistency  of  the  ITT  results  and  the  PP analyses confirm a robust effect.

- Mean aqueous cells score: no statistically significant difference between the two treatments.

- The mean flare score: no statistically significant difference was observed. This result was peculiar as both flare and aqueous cell score are expressions of inflammation.

## 4. Other additional analyses

the MAH has provided information on the potential benefit expressed in terms of responder rate. After the 12-week treatment significantly more patients on Nevanac experienced a relevant improvement in visual  acuity  (56.8%  vs  41.9%;  p=0.019)  and  significantly  less  patients  on  Nevanac  showed  a decreased in visual function than those treated with vehicle (10.5% vs 27.9%; p&lt;0.001).

## 2.2.2.4 Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  MAH  submitted  three  studies  to  support  the  claimed  indication:'prevention  of  postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery'.

The  chosen  measurements  to  assess  all  of  the  proposed  endpoints  were  standard  methods. The evaluation  of  efficacy  mainly  relies  on  the  presence  of  macular  oedema  measured  by  anatomic parameters.  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a laser-based, non-invasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution images of the retina and retinal thickness.  As a sensitive method, it would allow the detection of subclinical changes after cataract surgery in patients without a clear affection of the  visual  acuity.  In  this  context,  the  correlation  to  vision  was  considered  of  high  importance  as  a measure of the real treatment benefit for the patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main study (C-07-43) showed that after being treated with Nevanac for 12 weeks significantly less subjects (3.2%) developed macular edema compared to those receiving vehicle (16.7%). In addition, the macular thickness was substantially reduced in patients treated with Nevanac compared to vehicle. A  significantly  greater  percentage  of  patients  in  the  Vehicle  group  developed  ME  compared  with patients in the Nevanac group (p &lt; 0.001). Although the total number of patients developing ME was not large the difference was clearly in favour of Nevanac.

Relevantly, only 17% of diabetic patients not actively treated developed macular oedema according the predefined tomographic (OCT) criteria. This figure was far from the estimated 42% in the design of the study. Whether it was derived from an Applicant's optimistic expectancy or it was the consequence of a selected  recruited  population  is  a  question  to  be  clarified  by  the  MAH.  This  concern  represents  an additional limitation in order to elucidate the true effect (and the potential benefit) even in the diabetic subgroup.

The consistency between the ITT and PP analyses substantiate a robust effect. This reduction, however, was not followed by an improvement in visual acuity. No significant differences between groups were observed in the ITT population in the most relevant outcomes (mean BCVA change and percentage of patients with a decrease in BCVA of more than 5 letters). Ultimate BCVA was excellent in both groups and no relevant improvement appeared to be added beyond the first 1 or 2 weeks post surgery when Nevanac was administered. No impact in the vision-related quality of life was detected either.

The other two studies submitted (C-05-20 and C-07-32) were not considered supportive for efficacy by the CHMP.

Study  C-05-20  was  conducted  in  non-diabetic  patients  and  primarily  aimed  as  a  safety  trial. The efficacy data came from a post hoc exploratory analysis in a low number of patients. A higher dose of  Nevanac (QID vs TID) was administered. The value of efficacy data in this study in non-diabetes patients  is  limited.  No  valuable  information  had  been  provided  with  unblinded  post-hoc  analyses  of patients  who  anyway would  be  treated  with  a  steroid  to  control  the  inflammation  after  the  surgical procedure. The relevance of the findings was of limited value to support the extrapolation of the pivotal results to the general population. Moreover the outcome related to the best-corrected visual acuity for Nevanac and Ketorolac were similar and the difference towards vehicle was statistically significant. It is standard procedure to give steroid after a cataract surgery procedure to decrease the postoperative inflammation. Therefore, a less profitable intraocular condition was to be expected in the vehicle group and the above findings are therefore of less interest/value.

Study C-07-32 aimed at assessing efficacy of Nevanac in the prevention of the development of cystoid macular oedema following cataract surgery compared to fluorometholone, a topical steroid. The study was conducted in Japanese population. The difference between Nevanac and fluorometholone was statistically different with a better outcome for Nevanac.  If a more potent steroid had  been  chosen  the  result  might  have  been  less  favourable.  However,  fluorometholone  had  been chosen  because  of  its  less  IOP  increasing  properties.  The  main  limitations  referred  to  the  efficacy assessment methods chosen, that differed from those established in the other two studies, the shorter duration of the treatment (5 versus 12 weeks) and the lack of a placebo or vehicle treated arm. So, the results could not be considered as supportive for the efficacy of Nevanac.

## Clinical relevance of the effect

The observed effect in the anatomic measurement did not seem to be translated into a clinical benefit in visual function. This absence of clinical improvement could be due to the lack of power of the study to detect differences. However, since this correlation is considered as a measure of the real treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

benefit  for  the  patient,  the  results  in  macular  thickness  could  be  reflecting  changes  that  are  not clinically apparent.A responder rate analysis was subsequently provided and was considered acceptable

## Patient Population

Although the effect on anatomical parameters has been more soundly proven than in visual function outcomes the data in the latter, although rather limited, are deemed as supportive of a positive clinical effect in diabetic patients. Given that it was performed in diabetic patients the extrapolability of the results to the general (initially intended) population was questioned by the CHMP.

The main study included diabetic patients who might be relevant to treat, as they are patients at risk of developing ME after cataract surgery. On the contrary, the incidence in normal patients is very low, about 2%. In those patients, a prophylactic therapy with Nevanac would be redundant. Other patients with  an  increased  risk  of  developing  the  complication  CME,  e.g.  patients  with  previous  uveitis  or vitrectomy  might  clinically  benefit  from  a  prophylactic  treatment.  However,  patients  with  chronic  or recurrent  inflammatory  conditions  were  excluded  from  all  trials.  Whether  the  benefit  observed  in diabetic  patients  could  be  extrapolated  to  a  broader  indication  with  less  risk  of  developing  macular edema after cataract extraction was questioned as well by the CHMP. Given the seriousness of macular oedema  in  diabetic  patients  and  the  fact  that  the  absolute  risk  reduction  associated  with  Nevanac compared  to  placebo  is  limited,  the  term  'Prevention  of'  in  the  indication  text  was  considered misleading by the CHMP. Consequently, this was required to be changed for 'Reduction in risk of …' . The  proposal  for  rewording  the  new  indication  as  'reduction  in  the  risk  of  postoperative  macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in diabetic patients' was agreed by the MAH.

## Duration of treatment

The  proposed  a  90-day  treatment  regimen  was  based  on  the  time  in  which  ME  usually  occurs. However, considering the potential risks derived from the extension of the exposure (e.g. those related to a long-term use of BAK-preserved eye-drops). Further justification was provided and the data did not  show  an  additional  benefit  beyond  60  days  of  treatment  both  in  macular  oedema  and  in  vision function. In order to reduce an unnecessary exposure to Nevanac the MAH proposed a shorter duration of the treatment (60 days), which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

In  conclusion,  the  following  indication  was  recommended  by  the  CHMP  and  accepted  by  the  MAH: reduction  in  the  risk  of  postoperative  macular  oedema  associated  with  cataract  surgery  in  diabetic patients

## 2.2.3 Clinical Safety aspects

## 2.2.3.1 Introduction

As Nevanac eye drops were approved on December 12, 2007 the safety profile is well known.

The safety profile of Nevanac in the proposed new indication was based on the previously presented clinical studies of different treatment duration and dosing regimens :

-  C-05-20: patients exposed to Nevanac (51), treatment duration (92 days), dosing (QID)
-  C-07-32: patients exposed to Nevanac (30), treatment duration (5 weeks), dosing (TID)
-  C-07-43: patients exposed to Nevanac (126), treatment duration (92 days), dosing (TID)

Additional  safety  data  from  the  following  safety  supportive  studies  conducted  in  Japan  were  also submitted:

-  C-05-54: patients exposed to Nevanac (107), treatment duration (16 days), dosing (TID)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  C-07-03: patients exposed to Nevanac (235), treatment duration (16 days), dosing (TID)
-  C-07-06: patients exposed to Nevanac (112), treatment duration (up to 30 days), dosing (TID)

These 3 additional studies included an overall total of 799 patients and were performed in patients for treatment  of  post-operative  inflammation  associated  with  ophthalmic  intraocular  surgery.  As  stated above, the patients were exposed to Nevanac at dosing frequencies of three-times-daily for durations ranging from 16 days to 30 days.

As  the  complete  results  for  the  three  above  studies  conducted  in  Japan  were  not  been  previously submitted, the safety data from these additional 454 patients exposed to Nevanac were presented as additional data to support the safety of Nevanac.

Additionally, amendments to section 4.8 of the SPC had been proposed by the MAH according to the global patient exposure to Nevanac which includes 17 clinical trials with Nevanac.

## 2.2.3.3 Adverse events

##  Common Adverse Events

All  adverse  events  were  coded  using  the  MedDRA  dictionary  and  received  independent  causality assessments from the study Investigator and medical monitor.

The safety profile for ocular NSAIDs includes delayed healing, keratitis, corneal epithelial breakdown, corneal  thinning,  corneal  erosion,  corneal  ulceration  and  corneal  perforation.  In  some  cases  these events may become sight threatening. Patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal  epithelial  defects,  diabetes  mellitus,  ocular  surface  diseases  (e.g.,  dry  eye  syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for these corneal adverse events. Some of these events were reported in isolated cases during clinical development and post-market exposure to NEVANAC.

Topically  applied  NSAIDs  have  been  reported  to  increase  ocular  bleeding  (including  hyphemas) associated with ocular surgery by interfering with thrombocyte aggregation.

##  Adverse Drug Reactions in Post-Cataract Macular Oedema Studies (C05-20, C07-32, C07-43)

Adverse drug reactions reported in the post-cataract macular oedema studies were all ocular in nature with the exception of 1 patient experiencing urticaria associated with the use of Ketorolac Trometamol. All  adverse  drug  reactions  associated  with  the  use  of  Nevanac  involved  the  cornea,  which  is  not unexpected since topical ocular NSAIDs can exhibit adverse corneal effects.

Punctate keratitis was a common ADRs reported at an incidence of ≥ 1% in all studies C-05-20, C-0732, C-07-43 occurring in two patients that was assessed as related to the use of Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops,  Suspension.  There  was  one  report  of  punctate  keratitis  in  a  patient  following  exposure  to Nevanac Vehicle Eye Drops that was considered related to the use of test article.

In studies C-05-54, C-07-03, C-07-06, the most common ADRs (ADRs occurring in at least 2 patients) associated with the use of Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension were foreign body sensation in eyes and allergic conjunctivitis, each occurring in 2 patients (0.4%).

## 2.2.3.4 Serious adverse events and deaths/other significant adverse events

No deaths were reported in any of the post-cataract macular oedema studies.

Serious  adverse  events  all  assessed  as  unrelated  to  treatment  were  reported  for  4  patients  with exposure  to  Nevanac  and  10  patients  with  exposure  to  Nevanac  Vehicle  during  the  post-cataract macular edema studies. Three patients exposed to Nevanac Vehicle discontinued study participation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

due  to  serious  adverse  events.  None  of  them  were  reported  as  treatment-related  serious  adverse events. No patients exposed to Ketorolac or Fluorometholone experienced a serious adverse event.

The overall incidence of SAEs was low.  None of the SAEs were reported with Nevanac and Nevanac Vehicle were regarded as treatment-related.

## Other significant adverse events

##  Best-corrected visual acuity

A review of the data revealed a discernable trend toward an increase in mean logMAR visual acuity in the study eye over the course of the clinical trials for all treatment groups. This is not unexpected as all patients within the clinical trials had cataracts removed from their study eyes. No clinically relevant treatment group differences were observed for decreases in visual acuity from baseline to exit in the study eye. Overall, patients dosing with Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension had a slightly higher incidence of increased visual acuity over the course of the clinical trials versus patients dosing with the comparator treatment groups. No adverse events were reported for visual acuity in patients treated with Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension.

<!-- image -->

##  Contrast Sensitivity

In study C-05-20, The mean contrast scores at each visit are similar for all treatment groups across all spatial frequencies and show improvement in contrast sensitivity at all postoperative visits. This improvement is to be expected for all patients following surgery, since decreased contrast sensitivity is associated with the presence of cataracts as shown by their lower contrast sensitivity means at baseline.

The mean change from baseline at all visits and for all treatment groups was positive, indicating an improvement in contrast sensitivity during the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Ocular Signs

A  review  of  these  data  revealed  no  clinically  relevant  treatment  group  differences  for  maximum changes from baseline for the ocular sign parameters of corneal edema, bulbar conjunctival injection and chemosis. A higher incidence of aqueous cells and flare were reported in the vehicle group versus either  Nevanac  or  Ketorolac  Trometamol  4  mg/ml.  Among  the  active  treatment  groups,  patients treated  with  Nevanac  1  mg/ml  Eye  Drops,  Suspension  experienced  slightly  higher  incidence  of maximum changes for aqueous cells versus Ketorolac Tromental 4 mg/ml. No ADR was reported for a change in an ocular sign parameter in patients treated with Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension.

##  Corneal Fluorescein Staining (C-05-20 and C-07-43)

Overall,  less  total  composite  corneal  staining  and  composite  percent  area  corneal  staining  was observed in the 2 active treatment groups versus vehicle. Between the 2 active treatment groups, a slightly lower amount of composite corneal staining and composite percent area corneal staining was observed for patients dosing with Ketorolac Trometamol 4 mg/ml versus Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension. A review of these data reveal no unexpected results with changes from baseline being small in magnitude and represent a change that would not be considered clinically relevant.

Four patients treated with Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension reported ADR identified with an assessment of corneal staining. These include single reports of keratitis and corneal epithelium defect and 2 reports of punctate keratitis.

##  Intraocular Pressure (IOP)

A review of the post cataract macular oedema studies data revealed that mean intraocular pressure for the study eye was higher at Day 1 compared to any other visit for all 4 treatment groups. This increase in mean IOP at Day 1 for the study eye is not an unexpected event immediately after cataract surgery and was transient as shown by the lower mean IOP at Day 7 and later visits for each group. A review of the range of change IOP data revealed that most of patients in all treatment groups experienced maximum changes in IOP of ± 10 mmHg in their study eye. No ADRs were reported for changes in IOP in  patients  treated  with  Nevanac  1  mg/ml  Eye  Drops,  Suspension.  Two  adverse  events  assessed  as unrelated to the use of Nevanac 1 mg/ml were reported for clinically relevant increases in IOP.

##  Dilated Fundus Parameters

A review of these data revealed that patients dosing with the active treatments group experienced a lower  incidence  of  fundus  parameter  changes,  specifically  changes  in  retina/macula/choroid,  versus patients dosing with Vehicle. A review of these data revealed no clinically relevant differences between the  Nevanac  1  mg/ml  Eye  Drops,  Suspension  group  and  the  Ketorolac  Tometamol  4mg/ml  group. No ADR was reported for a change in a dilated fundus parameters in patients treated with Nevanac.

##  Cardiovascular Parameters

Out  of  6  post-MAA  clinical  trials,  cardiovascular  parameters  (pulse  rate,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood pressure) were measured in 2 supportive studies, C-05-54 and C-07-06. In summary, no safety issues were identified that would negatively impact the favourable benefit/risk profile of Nevanac 1mg/ml Eye Drops, Suspension based upon a review of pulse rate, blood pressure,  change from baseline for the overall safety population, as well as for the adult and elderly populations.

Taking into account that cardiovascular parameters had been only assessed in two of the supportive studies,  data  provided  were  not  considered  relevant  for  the  current  submission.  As  the  long-term (90 day treatment) safety database was limited, this was an issue that should be followed in PSURs.

The rest of data provided were considered as reassuring and as expected following cataract surgery.

## 2.2.3.5 Laboratory  findings

Clinical laboratory evaluations were performed in 2 supportive studies (C-05-54 and C-07-06). In the Nevanac group an increased white blood cell count (patient C0554.3756.1602), and increased alanine aminotransferase (patient C0554.4862.2501) were reported as AEs. These were assessed as unrelated to the study drug, were non-serious, mild in intensity, the first was unresolved at study completion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no safety issues identified based upon an evaluation of laboratory values through time and no clinically relevant differences were observed between treatment groups.

In the Nevanac group, adverse events related to urinalysis values were presence of urobilin , protein and  glucose.  These  adverse  events  were  assessed  as  unrelated  to  the  study  drug,  were  mild  in intensity, and non-serious in nature. These events were all resolved without treatment except for the urobilin urine present event, which was lost to follow-up.

None of the studies in which Nevanac was administered for 90 days included the clinical laboratory assessment among the safety variables. The data provided by the Applicant corresponded to results from two supportive Japanese studies in which the patients were treated up to 4 weeks. Taking into account that the proposed dose regimen prolongs the use of Nevanac and an increased risk of some ADRs (such as non-ocular disorders) could be expected this issue deserved to be better studied.  As the long-term (90 day treatment) safety database is limited, this is an issue that should be followed in PSURs.

## 2.2.3.6  Discontinuation due to Adverse Events

In the post-cataract macular oedema studies, 15 patients discontinued participation due to an adverse event. This included 3 patients with exposure to Nevanac, 3 patients with exposure to Ketorolac, and 9 patients with exposure to Nevanac Vehicle. Patients (3 patients) who discontinued study participation due  to  serious  adverse  events  were  exposed  to  Nevanac  Vehicle.The  characteristics  of  the  adverse drug reactions resulting in patient discontinuation are presented in the table below

Overall, a review of non-serious adverse events leading to patient discontinuation in the postcataract macular oedema studies did not reveal any factors that would represent a safety issue for the use of Nevanac.

Of  the  patients  exposed  to  Nevanac,  up  to  1.5%  discontinued  study  participation  due  to  adverse events; 1.0% discontinued due to ADRs. The ADRs resulting in patient discontinuation were: 1 keratitis, 1 punctate keratitis. Additionally, 1 patient who had an AE for vitreous hemorrhage also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinued.The incidence of study drug discontinuations was low and did not seem to be a source of concern.

The topical ADRs leading to withdrawal were  one case of punctuate keratitis, one case of keratitis in the Nevanac group and one case of punctate keratitis in the Nevanac Vehicle group, In addition, one case of urticaria in the ketorolac group led to withdrawal.

## 2.2.3.7  Post marketing experience

The  MAH  has  registered  Nevanac-containing  products  for  ophthalmic  use  in  a  total  of  79  countries worldwideIt is estimated that approximately 6,819,116 patients have been exposed to Nevanac during the period reviewed.

From August 2005 to 30 June 2010, a total of 314 spontaneous cases (180 medically confirmed and 134 not medically confirmed) were received and a total of 784 adverse events were reported.

Fifty-one (51) of these spontaneous cases were regarded as serious (35 medically confirmed and 16 not medically confirmed).

The majority of reactions reported during the period reviewed were ocular effects (53.8%). 30.6% of these local  events  were  included  in  cases  regarded  as  serious.  The  most  frequently  reported  ocular events (45%) within these serious cases were corneal-related disorders such as corneal disorder (not specified),  corneal  opacity  and  ulcerative  keratitis.  Ophthalmic  NSAIDs  are  known  to  produce  toxic effects on the cornea of predisposed patients. Such corneal disorders may be related to high doses, patient  comorbidities,  the  additive  effects  of  preservatives  contained  in  formulations  or  surgical procedures involving important corneal denervation.

Post-MAAstudies

The ADR data from the 10 general post-cataract population studies were pooled. Due to the pooling of these  10  studies,  the  overall  incidence  of  each  ADR  was  calculated  using  a  denominator  of  827. The frequency classification assigned to each ADR, utilizing the pooled incidence, in accordance with the current 'Guidelines on Summary of Product Characteristics, 2009.'

As a result, 2 ADR terms, eyelid disorder and dry mouth which are included in the current approved SmPC, are proposed to be removed from Section 4.8 of the new proposed SmPC.

Additionally,  as  a  result  of  the  exclusion  of  studies  C-95-91,  C-05-19  and  C-04-08,the  term  eye irritation  that  was  listed  in  the  previously  proposed  SmPC  under  the  'rare'  frequency  category,  is proposed to be classified as 'not known' in the new proposed SmPC.

Furthermore, in the previous proposal, the post-marketing term 'corneal epithelium defect/disorder' had been deleted from the spontaneous post-marketing events (not known) since the term corneal epithelium  defect  was  added  as  a  clinical  trial  ADR  term  which  was  reported  in  C-07-43.  However, since the C-07-43 clinical trial ADRs are presented in a separate table from the pooled other 10 clinical trial  ADRs  in  Section  4.8  of  the  new  proposed  SmPC,  the  spontaneous  post-marketing  events  term corneal epithelium defect/disorder remains with a frequency category of 'Not known' in the table with the pooling of the 10 studies and corneal epithelium defect is present in table of the study C-07-43 with  a  frequency  category  of  uncommon.  Although  the  term  'corneal  epithelium  defect/disorder' appears in the current approved SmPC, the MAH proposed to change this term to 'corneal epithelium defect'. This was based upon the CHMP agreement on the inclusion of the term 'corneal epithelium defect 'to encompass both 'corneal epithelial defect' and 'corneal epithelial disorder.'

These adverse drug reaction terms from the pooled-clinical trials and post marketing experience were simplified by combining similar terms as presented in the following table (1.1-6):

## 2.2.3.8 Discussion on clinical safety

A total of 177 patients had been exposed to Nevanac during 90 days, which was considered a rather limited safety database. The issue regarding the impact of the prolonged exposure to Nevanac on the safety profile of the product was a concern and a specific analysis of the data in relation to the time exposure was requested by the CHMP. The MAH provided the results of such analyses showing that the incidence of ADRs was overall low and there did not seem to be a higher incidence of ADRs in relation with  longer  exposure  to  Nevanac.  However,  some  adverse  events  such  as  keratitis  (0.6%,  1/177), punctate keratitis (1.1%, 2/177) and corneal epithelium defect (2 events in a patient/177) had been reported with a slightly higher incidence in this application in comparison to the original submission.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This information was considered important since the intended population are diabetic patients which are at risk of developing (or could be predisposed for) these mentioned eye disorders.

Four hundred and sixty two patients contributed safety data in the 3 main studies.  A number of 207 patients received Nevanac eye drops (either TID or QID). In the additional safety trials, 799 patients were included of who 454 became Nevanac eye drops (TID). The totality of the safety population is 1261 patients, which is sufficient for this application for an extension of therapeutic indication.

Overall,  few  adverse  events  were  reported.  In  the  post-cataract  macular  oedema  studies,the  most common ocular ADRs were punctate keratitis, corneal epithelium defect, keratitis, eye irritation, and ocular discomfort. None occurred in more than 2 patients. No serious treatment related adverse events were reported.

A number of 3 patients in all 6 studies discontinued the studies due to a serious event, of which none was considered related to the study drug. No new safety issues were revealed in this study programme.

A review of adverse events by organ system reported in patients treated with Nevanac in the postcataract macular oedema studies revealed that the majority of adverse events were local ocular effects coding to the system organ classification (SOC) of eye disorders.

In summary, a review of all adverse drug reactions reported among patients in the supportive studies in  Post-Cataract  Macular  Oedema  Studies  revealed  no  individual  events  that  would  represent  a previously unknown safety issue or impact negatively the overall favourable benefit/risk profile of the Nevanac 1 mg/ml Eye Drops.

From August 2005 to 30 June 2010, Systemic events were infrequently reported during the time period reviewed  and  most  of  them  were  regarded  as  non  serious  (79%).  Non  ocular  adverse  events  were classified under seventeen (17) different SOCs. The SOC that encompassed more terms was GENERAL DISORDERS  AND  ADMINISTRATION  SITE  CONDITIONS  (22.1%),  being  Impaired  healing  the  most frequently reported term within this SOC. Impaired healing usually refers to the healing of the corneal surgical incision or other lesions occurred during intervention. Healing abnormal and Impaired healing are considered identified risks associated to the use of ophthalmic NSAIDs. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and corticosteroids may increase the risk of healing problems.

The treatment duration for which this indication has been initially sought differed from the currently authorised indication for Nevanac, i.e. prevention and treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation  (treatment  duration:  2  weeks  following  the  postoperative  period)  and  prevention  of postoperative macular oedema (treatment duration: up to 90 days following the postoperative period).

The proposed regimen had not been previously tested in the studies conducted with Nevanac, so that the safety database from the authorised indications could not be considered supportive for the current application.  The  majority  of  patients  had  an  exposure  between  68  and  97  days  in  the  3  studies providing efficacy data (C-05-20, C-07-32, and C-07-43) in the present application. Most patients in the  supportive  safety  studies  were  exposed  between  10  and  30  days.  Only  two  studies  had  been conducted during 92 days (C-07-43 and C-05-20). The patients included in these two trials constituted the relevant safety database for the new indication.

Taking  the  available  safety  data  into  account,  knowing  that  continued  use  of  topical  NSAIDs  could cause corneal adverse reactions and the fact that diabetic patients are at increased risk of developing corneal adverse reactions, caution should be taken in relation with the time exposure. This issue is of high importance due to the active substance (Nevanac) as well as for the preservative, benzalkonium chloride,  which  is  known  to  cause  adverse  events  such  as  eye  irritation,  keratitis  and  other  corneal disorders. According to this, an increase of the incidence of these AEs within the time of exposure may be  expected.  As  the  administration  of  an  effective  dose  during  the  shortest  time  period  should  be desirable the MAH's proposal to restrict the treatment to 60 days was considered appropriate by the CHMP.

A global safety analysis including the patients treated with Nevanac regardless of the duration of the exposure had been provided which did not allow identifying the safety profile in patients exposed to Nevanac up to 90 days. The issue regarding the impact of the prolonged exposure to Nevanac on the safety profile of the product was a concern for the CHMP and a specific analysis of the data in relation to the time exposure was requested. The MAH provided the results of such analyses showing that the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

incidence of ADRs was overall low and there did not seem to be a higher incidence of ADRs with longer exposure  to  Nevanac.  However,  some  adverse  events  such  as  keratitis  (0.6%,  1/177),  punctate keratitis (1.1%, 2/177) and corneal epithelium defect (2 events in a patient/177) had been reported with a slightly higher incidence in this application compared to the original submission.

Moreover,  diabetic  and  other  high-risk  populations  for  development  of  ocular  adverse  events  (e.g.: uveitis,  earlier  vitrectomy),  were  not  been  properly  assessed  (limited  number  of  patients  followed during 90 days) and the MAH was requested to justify the safety of a long-term use in a predisposed patient  population.  The  MAH  had  presented  data  regarding  the  duration  of  exposure  to  Nevanac concluding that 94.4% (119 of 126) were exposed to Nevanac for at least 60 days and 57.9% (73 of 126)  were  exposed  for  90  days  or  longer.  Although  the  number  of  diabetic  patients  exposed  to Nevanac in the study C-07-43 is limited, these data confirmed that the majority of patients had been exposed for at least 60 days, which was reassuring taking into account the finally agreed posology (60 days).

The CHMP requested the information to be reflected in the SmPC, especially with regard to the fact that the intended population are diabetic patients which are at risk population of developing (or could be predisposed for) those mentioned disorders. This was agreed by the MAH.

In addition, the CHMP requested an update of section 4.8 based on pooled data from 11 clinical trials and postmarketing data. This analysis and the proposed SmPC changes were considered acceptable.

## 2.2.4 Changes to the Product Information

The important changes have been reflected in the scientific discussion above. For a complete set of changes see Attachment 1 to this report.

Considering that the changes introduced in the PI do not affect the legibility of the PIL, it was agreed that there was no need to perform a new User testing.

## 3. Risk management plan

The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan (version 05) within this variation procedure. Off label use of Nevanac has been added as a risk identified with the use of this product throughout the RMP. Drug interaction between Nevanac and topical anti-inflammatory steroids, as well as interaction of Nevanac with medicinal products which may prolong bleeding time, have been added as potential risks  throughout  the  RMP.  Long  term  use  of  Nevanac,  use  of  Nevanac  in  patients  with  concurrent ocular diseases, and use of Nevanac in patients using topical ocular medications have been added as safety concerns under important missing information.

The MAH has emphasized the increased potential risk of corneal disorders with the prolonged use/off label use of Nevanac.

Updated  clinical  and  post  marketing  data  has  been  added.  Epidemiological  data  regarding  macular oedema  associated  with  cataract  surgery,  as  well  as  with  data  for  the  interaction  of  Nevanac  with medicinal products which may prolong bleeding time has been included.

| Corneal disorders (identified): -Delayed corneal healing -Corneal melt -Corneal ulceration | • routine pharmacovigilance • no additional activity is proposed at this time | No additional risk minimisation activities beyond the appropriate identification in the product information are needed. The proposed SmPC adequately addresses this risk: Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) of the SmPC states: 'Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of NEVANAC and should be monitored closely for corneal health'. 'Topical NSAIDs may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems'. 'Post-marketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse reactions which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Prolonged use of topical NSAIDs may increase patient risk for occurrence and severity of corneal adverse reactions.'

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted for the new pharmaceutical form, was of the opinion that pharmacovigilance activities are necessary in addition to the use of routine Pharmacovigilance, in order to characterize any potential off label use of the product. To this purpose the MAH was requested to conduct a Drug Utilization Study (DUS). The MAH was requested to submit an updated version of the  RMP  within  6  months  of  the  approval  of  the  new  indication  in  order  to  provide  the  DUS  study protocol, including the geographical scope within EU of such a study, and the study milestones and dates, as applicable.

No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product information.

## 4. Conclusion on the benefit/risk balance

Nevanac  is currently indicated for the prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery.

This variation as initially applied for was an extension of this indication in order to use Nevanac for the prevention  of  postoperative  macular  edema  associated  with  that  surgery.  For  that  purpose,  an extension of the current posology from two to 12 weeks was proposed by the MAH.

Study C-07-43 showed indeed that after being treated with Nevanac for 12 weeks significantly less subjects (3.2%) developed macular edema compared to those receiving Vehicle (16.7%). The other two studies submitted could only be considered as supportive: Study C-05-20 was primarily a safety study,  in  which  a  higher  dose  of  Nevanac  (QID  vs  TID)  was  administered.  In  Study  C-07-32  the efficacy of Nevanac was assessed using different methods and for a shorter period of time.

Also, macular thickness was substantially more reduced in patients treated with Nevanac in study C07-43, this reduction was not followed by an improvement of visual acuity. BCVA was good in both groups and no relevant improvement appears to be added beyond the first 1 or 2 weeks post surgery. No impact in  the  vision-related  quality  of  life  was  reported  either.  The  observed  absence  of  clinical improvement of visual  acuity  could  be  due  to  the  lack  of  power  of  the  study  to  detect  differences. However, since the correlation to vision is considered crucial as a measure of the real treatment benefit for  the  patient,  the  results  in  macular  thickness  could  be  reflecting  changes  that  are  not  clinically apparent. The only suggestion of impact on visual function was in fact provided by the exploratory post

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hoc analysis conducted in Study C-05-20 in which Nevanac treated patients showed numerically better results  on  visual  acuity  (8%  of  patients  experienced  decrease  of  &gt;  5  letters  at  Day  90)  than  those treated with vehicle (20.5%). With this limited evidence it was uncertain that the observed anatomic changes implied a clear clinical benefit. This was considered as very important issue by the CHMP. In order to solve this concern the MAH provided information on the potential benefit expressed in terms of responder  rate.  After  the  12-week  treatment  more  patients  on  Nevanac  experienced  a  relevant improvement in visual acuity (56.8% vs 41.9%; p=0.019) and significantly less patients on Nevanac showed a decreased in visual function than those treated with vehicle (10.5% vs 27.9%; p&lt;0.001). In addition, the BCVA improvement of 15 letters or more from pre-operative baseline to exit of the study experienced by patients on Nevanac compared to those on vehicle could be considered also as clinically relevant.

Although results in anatomical parameters were better than those in visual function the data (rather limited)  were  deemed  as  supportive  of  a  positive  clinical  effect  in  diabetic  patients  by  the  CHMP. The CHMP considered indeed that diabetic patients may be relevant to treat, as they are patients at risk  of  developing  ME  after  cataract  surgery.  On  the  contrary,  the  incidence  in  normal  patients  is estimtated to be very low, around 2%. In those patients a prophylactic therapy with Nevanac would be therefore redundant. Other patients with an increased risk of developing the complication CME, e.g. patients  with  previous  uveitis  or  vitrectomy  may  clinically  profit  of  a  prophylactic  treatment.  Still, patients  with  chronic  or  recurrent  inflammatory  conditions  were  excluded  in  all  trials.  Moreover, although preventive treatment was intended initially for all patients being operated from cataracts, for practical reasons (low incidence of macular edema after uneventful cataract surgery as stated above) the pivotal trial (C-07-43) was conducted in diabetic patients with a moderate retinopathy (estimated incidence  about  22%).  The  low  prevalence  of  this  complication  in  general  population  was  another concern  for  the  CHMP  and  raised  doubts  regarding  the  approval  of  this  indication  in  a  broader population.Therefore  the  MAH  proposed  a  restricted  indication  reflecting  the  population  for  which  a more  clear  benefit  has  been  shown  (i.e,  diabetic  patients).  With  this  proposal,  this  concern  was considered solved by the CHMP. The proposal for rewording the new indication as 'reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in diabetic patients' was agreed by the MAH.

The Applicant chose initially to apply for a 90-day dose regimen based on the time in which ME usually occurs.  Different durations of treatment (from 30 to 180 days) have been tested with Nevanac and also when other anti-inflammatory drugs have been administered. Apparently, there seems not to be a clear recommendation on the treatment duration. The MAH was requested to further discuss on this issue considering the potential risks derived from longer exposure (e.g. those related to a long-term use of BAK-preserved eye-drops). The MAH provided data showing that no additional benefit seems to be  obtained  beyond  60  days  of  treatment  either  in  macular  oedema  or  visual  function.  In  order  to reduce an unnecessary exposure to Nevanac the MAH proposed a shorter duration of the treatment (60 days), which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The MAH was requested to provide data on the evolution of patients who finally developed macular oedema. Unfortunately, few data are available, in part due to the low number of total events occurred during the conduction of the study (25 ME plus 3 suspected ME in 251 patients) and partly because only  18  out  of  25  had  available  clinical  outcome.  Eleven  patients  (10  of  them  on  vehicle)  required further  topical  treatment,  9  of  them  received  also  topical  steroids  and  finally  three  patients  were treated  with  ophthalmic  anti-VEGF  injections.  Whether  this  preventive  treatment  has  an  advantage over  a  close  clinical  follow-up  and  the  subsequent  treatment  of  the  event  if  it  occurs  is  not  totally elucidated  given  that  a  study  with  a  head-to-head  comparison  was  not  performed.  However,  data provided  of  patients  who  finally  developed  ME  suggest  that  they  required  more  medical  visits  and further treatments different from topical NSAIDs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding  safety,  the  analysis  of  common  AEs,  Ocular  AEs,  SAEs  and  discontinuations  had  been focused  on  the  3  clinical  studies  in  the  prevention  of  macular  edema  following  a  cataract  surgery. Three short term studies conducted in Japan had been also presented in order to provide additional safety information.

Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  Nevanac  seemed  similar  to  that  of  other  ophthalmic  NSAIDs.  Same pharmacologic  class  adverse  events  had  being  reported  during  clinical  development  and  postmarketing exposure to Nevanac.

The data concerning ADR were reassuring as topical NSAIDs have a well-established safety profile  and  warnings  and  precautions  for  use  of  Nevanac  regarding  keratitis,  corneal epithelium defect, diabetic conditions, etc are adequately addressed in the  SmPC. Additionally,  and  given  the  nature  of  the  intervention  only  one  treatment  per  eye  is reasonably  expected  in  a  lifetime.  In  any  case,  these  risks  are  likely  to  be  lower  with  a reduced time exposure to Nevanac.  From the safety database, all ADRs reported in clinical trials and post marketing have been included in the SmPC.

In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  relevant  effect  had  been  observed  in  macular  thickness when  Nevanac  was  administered  to  diabetics  for  12  weeks  for  the  prevention  of  macular  edema. A clinical benefit expressed in terms of responder rate had been shown as well. However, this effect could not be extrapolated to a broader population for whom the risk of macular edema after cataract surgery was lower. The restriction of the indication to 'diabetic patients' solved this point. Likewise, the MAH proposed a shorter duration of the treatment (60 days) in order to reduce an unnecessary exposure  to  Nevanac,  which  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  The  overall  safety  profile  of Nevanac in the prevention of postoperative macular edema does not seem to differ from that already known.  However,  some  adverse  events  such  as  keratitis  and  corneal  epithelium  defect  have  been reported with a slightly higher incidence compared to the original submission. Relevant modifications to the SmPC were made.

The  benefit/risk  ratio  for  this  extension  of  the  indication  was  considered  positive  by  the  CHMP. In conclusion, the CHMP was of the view that the data presented supported the following indication:

'reduction  in  the  risk  of  postoperative  macular  oedema  associated  with  cataract  surgery  in  diabetic patients'.

In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should submit the following safety data in the next PSUR: safety issues related to the fact that the proposed dose regimen prolongs the use of Nevanac and an increased risk of some ADRs (such as non-ocular disorders) could be expected.  The PSUR cycle for the product follows a yearly cycle. Next DLP for PSUR-7 is 30 November 2011 and will cover one year. The following PSUR will restart the cycle with 6-monthly PSUR submission.

With regard to the request for one additional year of marketing protection in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant and did  not  consider  that  the  new  therapeutic  indication  brings  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison with existing therapies based on improved safety nor improved efficacy. A separate report is attached.

## 1. Introduction

In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation 726/2004, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has applied for an additional one year marketing protection period in the context of a group of variations (EMA/H/C/818/II/07/G).

The request was based on the MAH's position that NEVANAC represents a 'significant clinical benefit' in the  following  indication:  'prevention  of  postoperative  macular  oedema  associated  with  cataract surgery' based on improved efficacy and safety in comparison with existing therapies.

## 2. Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by the applicant

## 2.1 Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy

NEVANAC contains nepafenac, an NSAID prodrug that rapidly penetrates the cornea and is deaminated to form the active metabolite, amfenac, by intraocular hydrolases within ocular tissues. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery.

Macular  oedema  (ME)  refers  to  an  abnormal  thickening  of  the  macula  that  is  associated  with  the accumulation of excess fluid in the extracellular space of the retina or within multiple cyst-like spaces within  the  macula  (ie,  cystoid  ME  [CME])  (Johnson  2009).  Macular  oedema  and  CME  are  common causes of poor visual outcome following uneventful cataract surgery (Tranos 2004). While ME may be idiopathic, it is most often associated with inflammatory disorders, retinal vascular diseases, tractional maculopathies, choroidal vascular diseases, inherited retinal dystrophies, retinal detachments, intraocular tumours, drug reactions, and optic nerve head abnormalities.

There  is  very  little  evidence  from  randomised  controlled  clinical  studies  documenting  the  ability  of corticosteroids and NSAID treatment to reduce the risk for the development of post-surgery macular oedema; this submission provides that clinical evidence.

Several studies have shown that topical ocular NSAIDs are effective in preventing angiographic CME in pseudophakic and aphakic patients with and without concurrent steroid therapy (Flach 1992). Although many  of  these  trials  lacked  rigorous  design  (absence  of  randomization,  inadequate  control  groups, small  sample  size),  results  in  several  controlled  trials  with  NSAIDs  (indomethacin,  diclofenac  and ketorolac) for the prevention of angiographic CME show an overall benefit (Wolf, 2007). Within these studies, NSAIDs were generally dosed concurrently with topical ocular steroids.

Despite  the  evidence  that  NSAIDS  are  effective  in  preventing  angiographic  CME,  a  clear  correlation between angiographic CME and clinically meaningful visual loss has not been clearly established (Flach, 1988). To date the only studies that have demonstrated a statistically significant effect on visual acuity associated with CME have evaluated older NSAIDs (eg. indomethacin suspended in sesame seed oil and flurbiprofen) currently either not available or uncommon in clinical practice (Wolf, 2007). Further to  publication  of  the  above  mentioned studies, in a meta-analysis by Rossetti et al (Rossetti 1998), only one of 12 randomised clinical studies showed a statistically significant prophylactic effect of NSAID on reducing the incidence of clinical cystoid macular oedema (CME).

The indication of prevention of cystoid macular oedema has been granted in some European countries for  3  ocular products (indometacin 1 mg/ml, diclofenac 1 mg/ml and ketorolac 5mg/ml) despite the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lack of data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials for this indication. Diclofenac 1 mg/ml is approved for this indication in multiple countries, however, indomethacin 1 mg/ml is only approved in two  countries  (Belgium  and  Luxembourg)  ketorolac  5mg/ml  is  only  approved  in  Denmark  for  the prevention of cystoid macular oedema.

Table 1 provides a description of NSAIDs approved in Europe for prevention of development of cystoid macular oedema.

NEVANAC's active ingredient, nepafenac, is an NSAID prodrug that rapidly penetrates the cornea and is deaminated  to  form  the  active  metabolite,  amfenac,  by  intraocular  hydrolases  within  ocular  tissues including  the  ciliary  body  epithelium,  retina  and  choroid.  Because  bioconversion  is  targeted  to  the iris/ciliary body and, to a greater extent, the retina/choroid, nepafenac may have prolonged activity in the vascularized tissues of the eye (Ke 2000).

In a pre-clinical model of induced retinal inflammation, topical nepafenac penetrated to the posterior segment where it decreased vitreous protein and PGE2 concentrations, indicating stabilization of the blood-retina  barrier  (Kapin  2003).  Other  NSAIDs  including  ketorolac  and  diclofenac  failed  to  inhibit accumulation of these inflammation markers.

In  a  randomised,  controlled,  double-masked,  multicenter  study, C-05-20 ,  conducted  by  Alcon Research  Ltd, One-hundred  forty-nine  non-diabetic patients undergoing  cataract surgery  were randomised into 3 treatment arms. One arm received Vehicle and the remaining 2 arms received either NEVANAC  or  another  NSAID  (non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug),  Acular®  LS,  which  is  in  the market in Europe. The study was designed to evaluate the longterm safety of NEVANAC and to assess the  development  of  macular  oedema  within  90  days  post-cataract  surgery.  The  development  of macular oedema and cystoid macular oedema were followed by OCT. The study showed that NEVANAC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  reduced  the  risk  for  the  development  of  CME.  Additionally,  no  patients  in  the  Nepafenac group had increases in central subfield macular thickness of 50 μ m or more from Baseline at Day 30 compared with 5 patients (10.6%) in the Vehicle group This is relevant since macular edema typically peaks in normal  patients  around  30 days postoperative, and  a 50 μ m  increase represents approximately a 30% change in central subfield macular thickness.

Confirmatory  study C-07-43 was  a  randomised,  controlled,  double-masked,  multicenter  study, conducted by Alcon Research Ltd. Two-hundred sixty-three diabetic retinopathy patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomised into 2 treatment arms (Vehicle or NEVANAC).

The study was designed to assess the development of macular oedema within 90 days postcataract surgery and assess best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Patients were followed with OCT to assess the development of macular oedema and cystoid macular oedema. The study demonstrated that macular oedema  was  prevented  in  patients  treated  with  Nepafenac  compared  with  patients  treated  with Vehicle. Patients treated with Nepafenac maintained better BCVA after cataract surgery compared with patients treated with Vehicle.

This study met the planned objectives of demonstrating prevention of development of macular oedema while offering benefits in prevention of vision loss.

The benefits of NEVANAC were observed in a population with higher or lower risk to develop macular oedema after cataract surgery. This encompasses non-diabetic and diabetic patients with or without diabetic retinopathy.

In conclusion, the data provided in this MAA variation support approval for NEVANAC for the prevention of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery.

## 2.2. Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety

No new safety risks that have not been observed previously were observed during the 3 month dosing contemplated in the clinical development of NEVANAC for prevention of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery. This is of paramount importance as the dosing of NEVANAC has been extended  substantially  beyond  the  current  approved  2  week  dosing.  Current  marketed  products  for prevention  of  cystoid  macular  oedema  do  contemplate  a  higher  daily  dosing  schedule  (QID).  A  TID dosing would be more convenient for elderly patients as extended dosing schedule (90 days) is to be followed for preventing development of macular oedema.

The  study  C-05-20  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  long  term  safety  of  NEVANAC.  This  study demonstrated  that  NEVANAC  is  safe  when  administered  under  exaggerated  conditions  (QID  for  3 months).

## 2.3. Scientific advice from competent authorities on the development of a product in a new indication expected to bring significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies

As stated by the applicant, the Danish Medicines Agency -DKMA (August 26, 2008) and the Spanish Drug Agency -AEMPS/CHMP (December 10, 2008) were consulted to discuss an MAA Variation pursuing the expansion of the current NEVANAC indication to prevention of post-surgical macular oedema.

As there are no approved products in the European Union that have published, prospective, controlled, randomised  trials  clearly  demonstrating  the  efficacy  of  an  NSAID  for  the  prevention  of  macular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

oedema, both agencies  agreed  that  one  confirmatory  study  versus  Vehicle  in  patients  with  diabetic retinopathy was adequate to support the approval of NEVANAC for this indication. This diabetic patient population was selected because the incidence of post surgical macular oedema is 4 to 5-fold greater than in the general population of patients undergoing cataract surgery (Kim SJ 2007).

## 3. Assessment of the applicant's justification of significant clinical benefit

## Proposed new indication

The  data  provided  in  this  variation  were  submitted  to  add  'prevention  of  postoperative  macular oedema  associated  with  cataract  surgery'.  Following  the  CHMP  assessment  of  the  data,  the  MAH accepted to restrict the new indication to the following: 'reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in diabetic patients'.

Taking into account the provisions of the 'Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing  protection  period  (November  2007)' ,  the  CHMP  is  of  the opinion  that  the  proposed  new  indication:  'reduction  in  the  risk  of  postoperative  macular  oedema associated  with  cataract  surgery  in  diabetic  patients'. can  be  considered  as  a  new  therapeutic indication.

## Details of existing therapies related to the proposed new indication

As presented by the applicant, there are currently authorised medicinal products in the European Union to prevent cystoid macular oedema after cataract surgery.

## Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy

Considering the efficacy data presented, it is concluded that a relevant effect has been observed in macular  thickness  when  Nevanac  is  administered  to  diabetics  for  12  weeks  for  the  prevention  of macular  edema.  A  clinical  benefit  expressed  in  terms  of  responder  rate  has  been  shown  as  well  in these patients. However, this effect cannot be extrapolated to a broader population for whom the risk of macular edema after cataract surgery is lower, i.e. non-diabetic patients. Therefore, a restriction of the indication to 'diabetic patients' has been performed. Likewise, a shorter duration of the treatment (60 days) has been concluded in order to reduce an unnecessary exposure to Nevanac.

Study C-05-20 was conducted in non-diabetic patients and primarily aimed as a safety trial. A higher dose  of  Nevanac  (QID  vs  TID)  was  administered.  The  value  of  efficacy  data  in  this  study  in  nondiabetes  patients  is  limited.  No  valuable  information  had  been  provided  with  unblinded  post-hoc analyses of patients who anyway would be treated with a steroid to control the inflammation after the surgical procedure. The relevance of the findings was of limited value to support the extrapolation of the pivotal results to the general population.

It is deemed that in these circumstances this new indication has been restricted in comparison with the other existing therapies

Additionally,  since  the  main  results  supporting  the  efficacy  of  Nevanac  at  the  recommended  dosing come from the comparison versus placebo, the clinical benefit compared to existing therapies can not be determined at present. Only exploratory data of the efficacy of Nevanac versus other therapeutic options  are  available  and  they  are  insufficient  to  reach  any  valid  conclusion  on  a  potential  efficacy improvement.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, it is considered that Nevanac does not present the required significant clinical benefit based  on  improved  efficacy  and,  therefore,  does  not  deserve  'one  additional  year  of  marketing protection' for this reason.

## Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety

The justification from the applicant does not contain information on the adverse events profile of the existing therapies as compared to Nevanac. Based on safety data submitted, the overall safety profile of  nepafenac  in  the  prevention  of  postoperative  macular  oedema  does  not  seem  to  differ  from  the existing therapies.

Considering  this  new  indication  has  been  restricted  in  comparison  with  the  other  existing  therapies and the prolonged exposure to Nevanac, the treatment is expected to lead to some adverse events such as keratitis and corneal epithelium defect. In fact, these adverse events have been reported with a slightly higher incidence compared to the previously approved indication. As consequence, these new safety  data  have  been  included  in  the  product  information  (Sections  4.8  Undesirable  effects). Additionally,  the  risk  derived  from  this  prolonged  use  is  reflected  in  Section  4.4  of  the  product information (Special warnings and precautions for use).

In conclusion, it is considered that Nevanac does not present the required significant clinical benefit based  on  improved  safety  and,  therefore,  does  not  deserve  'one  additional  year  of  marketing protection' for this reason.

## Scientific advice from competent authorities

During the scientific advice meetings held with the Company general conclusions on the clinical trial design  and  the  intended  population  proposed  by  the  Applicant  was  reached  in  order  to  support  the approval of a new indication, provided that the benefit/risk balance was positive.

## 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, the overall benefit/risk ratio is deemed positive in the proposed indication

The  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  submitted  by  the  applicant  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the ' Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing protection period (November 2007) ', and did not consider that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies for the following reasons:

(i) Improved efficacy has not been established. This new indication has been restricted in comparison with the other existing therapies  and the main results supporting the efficacy of Nevanac at the recommended dosing come from the comparison versus placebo

(ii) Improved safety has not been established. This new indication has been restricted in comparison with the other existing therapies.  The prolonged exposure to Nevanac is expected to lead to new safety data.

Therefore the CHMP does not recommend one additional year of marketing protection on the basis of improved  efficacy  nor  improved  safety,  of  this  application  for  a  new  indication  in  accordance  with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
