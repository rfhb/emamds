## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on spontaneous reports, including close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent and anaphylaxis in children above the age of 5 years and adults is at least a reasonable possibility. Consequently the PRAC has updated section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction anaphylaxis with a frequency not known to the group of children above 5 years of age and adults.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) - 13 valent is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
