1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

1. To update section 4.8 of the SmPC adding Hypokalaemia to the list of adverse drug reactions of Takeda's Pantoprazole containing drugs including a food note in 4.8 that hypokalaemia may be related to the occurrence of hypomagnesaemia based on a review of the global safety database for cases containing the PT 'hypocalcaemia' in patients who were treated with Takeda PPIs (Dexlansoprazole, Lansoprazole and Pantoprazole). The existing warning regarding Hypomagnesaemia in Section 4.4. is proposed to be adapted accordingly. adding also that Hypomagnesaemia may lead to hypocalcaemia and/or hypokalaemia and that hypomagnesaemia associated hypocalcaemia and/or hypokalaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

2. To update section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) with the frequency 'unknown' based on a comprehensive review of the global safety database for all cases containing the PT 'Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms' on  all PPIs that are currently marketed by Takeda (i.e. lansoprazole, pantoprazole sodium, pantoprazole magnesium and dexlansoprazole). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the last QRD template (version 10.1), to update the list of local representatives and to implement editorial corrections to the PI. The requested grouped work-sharing procedure hypomagnesemia. The remaining 12 cases which did not report hypomagnesemia as an additional event were confounded by the patient's medical history and/or other concomitant medications. 32 cases out of 97 cases (33%) contained the event of hypokalaemia as well as hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesemia. Recovery on cessation of PPI use and recurrence of the event upon rechallenge, strengthened the causal association. 2. 69 (72 events) cases of DRESS were identified with patients on pantoprazole. The cases reported with pantoprazole amounted to 69% of cases of DRESS identified with Takeda PPIs. 67 (97%) of those cases were classified as serious, 2 (3%) were considered non-serious. There were no cases of positive rechallenge for pantoprazole. However, re-challenge tests to ascertain the link between DRESS and any drug is particularly problematic, as reintroduction of the culprit drug in patients may result in fatality. This would explain why so few cases of re-challenge for this PT have been recorded. A postulated mechanism in the literature such as hapten, prohapten, and the p- i concept may play roles in the pathogenesis of these reactions. 48% of reported DRESS events appeared within 2 to 6 weeks following treatment with pantoprazole (and/or lansoprazole), which is consistent with the recognized pathophysiology of the disease. Pantoprazole have a significant number of reports for DRESS.

DRESS is an established important identified risk documented umbrella term of SCAR in the pantoprazole RMP.

| WS/0341  | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. The Worksharing Applicant (WSA) proposed the update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add an interaction between pantoprazole and methotrexate following the assessment of cases of interaction and published literature in FUMs 13, 12, 12, 18, 13. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the WSA used this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the Medicinal product | 25/04/2013   | 27/05/2013 no | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL longer | In a cumulative review of cases of interaction between pantoprazole and methotrexate, including published literature it was shown that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. Current evidence supporting reduced methotrexate elimination in patients receiving PPIs is primarily based on studies conducted in patients receiving high dose treatment, which is usually carried out in a specialist medical setting. Nevertheless, considering the evidence available to date a mention of these facts was added to 4.5 of the SmPC of OTC pantoprazole. |
