## 1. Introduction

On 02 May 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Cystic Fibrosis patients 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating or residual function mutation, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. CTFR is a channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other anions across epithelia in multiple organs and tissues, including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the current median age at death among people with CF is approximately 30 years, and the predicted median age of survival is approximately 47 years.

The most common disease-causing mutation is F508del : approximately 84.7% of people with CF in the US and 81.1% in Europe have at least one F508del allele. At present, there is no cure for CF. CFTR modulators (CFTRm; i.e., correctors and potentiators) represent a major advancement in the treatment of CF because they are systemic therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease and have been shown to improve CF survival by modifying the course of disease. Approved treatment regimens include ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco™), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA dual combination therapy (Orkambi™), tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA dual combination therapy (Symdeko™, Symkevi™) and elexacaftor (ELX)/TEZ/IVA triple combination therapy (TrikaftaTM, KaftrioTM).

The elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) regimen previously demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with a single F508del allele, regardless of the mutation of the second allele. A pivotal Phase 3 program in subjects with CF 12 years of age or older demonstrated that ELX/TEZ/IVA provides substantial improvements in lung function, CFTR function, and nutritional status, and was generally safe and well tolerated with a low rate of treatment discontinuation.

Kaftrio obtained a marketing authorization in August 2020 and is currently indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

The MAH now submitted the results of Study VX18-445-110 ('Study 110') as per requirement of Article 46 of the 'Paediatric Regulation' (EC) 1901/2006. Study 110 is a Phase 3, multicenter, openlabel study (OLS) in subjects with CF 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes), who completed Study VX18-445-104 (Study 104). The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH stated that Study VX18-445-110 is a stand alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The following tablets were used in the study:

- -ELX/TEZ/IVA 100-mg/50-mg/75-mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet
- -IVA 150-mg tablet

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

Study VX18-445-110, a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study (OLS) in subjects with CF 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes), who completed Study VX18-445-104 (Study 104).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study VX18-445-110

## Description

Study VX18-445-110 was a Phase 3, 2-part, multicenter, OLS for subjects who completed the last Treatment Period visit in the parent study (Study 104) and met eligibility criteria (Figure 1). Subjects in certain countries who completed Part A had the opportunity to participate in Part B.

The total study duration was up to approximately 148 weeks (from the first dose of study drug in this study), including a Treatment Period of up to 144 weeks (96 weeks in Part A and 48 weeks in Part B [in certain countries]) and a 4-week Safety Follow-up Period.

The study period was from 05 December 2019 until 16 December 2022.

Note: Parent study refers to Study 104. Note that the figure is not drawn to scale.

- a Subjects whose Part B Day 1 was on the same day or within 1 calendar day as the Part A Week 96 Visit did NOT have to repeat any Part B Day 1 assessments that were specified to be performed at the Part A Week 96 Visit. Subjects whose Part B Day 1 was more than 1 calendar day after Part A Week 96 Visit completed all assessments specified for the Part A Week 96 AND Part B Day 1 Visits.

Figure 1 Study design

## CHMP comment

Part B was added at the time of version 1.2 of the Clinical Study Protocol (14 May 2021) for all countries except NL, and version 1.3 (21 December 2021) for NL (see Conduct of Study below). However, according to the clinical overview submitted by the Applicant, patients in only certain countries were offered Part B of this study (those seem to be AU, BE, FR, IT, ES, and NL). It is not completely understood why Part B was only accessible for subjects in these countries. However, considering the sufficiently long treatment period of Part A, the fact that only safety was assessed in Part B, and most patients discontinued Part B due to commercial availability of Kaftrio, this issue is not further pursued.

## Methods

## Study participants

The study included male and female CF subjects 12 years of age or older with F/G or F/RF genotypes.

Key eligibility criteria are shown in Table 1.

## CHMP comment

Key inclusion criteria of Study 104 were age 12 years and older, FEV1 value ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted, confirmed CF diagnosis, stable CF disease, and heterozygous for F508del and either a gating or residual function mutation (F/G or R/RF genotype). These inclusion criteria were previously considered acceptable. The additional exclusion criteria are also acceptable.

## Treatments

All subjects received two FDC tables of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the morning and one IVA tablet in the evening (Table 2). This is the same dosage as that evaluated in the parent study, Study 104.

Table 2 Dosages

| ELX Dosage   | TEZDosage   | IVA Dosage   |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2001 pb Su   | 100 mg qd   | 150 mg q12h  |

ELX: elexacaftor; IVA: ivacaftor; q12h: every 12 hours; :pb once daily; TEZ: tezacaftor

ELX/TEZ/IVA was administered for approximately 96 weeks in Part A and up to approximately 48 weeks in Part B.

## CHMP comment

The used dosing is in line with the parent study and the approved posology. The 96- or 144-week treatment period meets the safety assessment criteria of the EMA guideline on CF (CHMP/EWP/9147/08).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objective(s)

## Primary objective:

To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating (F/G) or residual function (F/RF) mutation.

## Secondary Objectives:

- To evaluate the long-term efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA
- To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of ELX/TEZ/IVA

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint:

Safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry.

## Secondary endpoints:

- -Absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1)
- -Absolute change in sweat chloride (SwCl)
- -Absolute change in body mass index (BMI)
- -Absolute change in BMI z-score
- -Absolute change in body weight
- -Absolute change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain (RD) score.

## Sample size

The primary and secondary objectives of the study are the evaluation of the long-term safety and tolerability, and long-term efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA. This is an open-label study that will enrol subjects who complete the last Treatment Period visit in the parent study and meet eligibility criteria. The parent study is a Phase 3 Vertex study investigating ELX/TEZ/IVA (Study 104).

Approximately 250 subjects were planned to be enrolled.

## CHMP comment

The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability after long-term treatment is appropriate for an openlabel extension study. Secondary endpoints are in line with commonly used efficacy endpoints.

A sample size of 250 subjects for Part A is also considered acceptable. In the end, 251 patients were included. It appears that no sample size intention was set for Part B, which is acceptable considering the sufficiently long treatment period of Part A to assess long-term safety and tolerability.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

N/A

## Statistical Methods

Analysis sets

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following analysis sets were defined:

- -Open-label (OL) All Subjects Set : all subjects who were enrolled (defined as subject having data in the clinical database) in the OLS.
- -OL Full Analysis Set (OL-FAS) : all enrolled subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug in the open-label study.
- -OL Safety Set (OL-SS) : all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the OLS.

## Efficacy analyses

The parent study baseline is used to calculate the change from baseline for continuous efficacy endpoints unless otherwise specified. Data of continuous endpoints at visits in the parent study are analysed using the same mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach as described in the SAP for the parent study. The resulting estimates will be identical to what is in the CSR of the parent study. Similarly, data of continuous endpoints at visits in the OL efficacy period for Part A are analysed using a separate MMRM. The results obtained from the parent study and OLE efficacy period will be displayed one followed by the other.

The focus of the efficacy analysis is to characterise the long-term treatment effects using change from baseline for each treatment group in the parent study. P values were not planned to be presented.

Efficacy analysis is only applicable to Part A.

## Safety analyses

The primary objective of the study was the evaluation of long-term safety and tolerability of the triple combination. All safety analyses for Part A and B are based on the treatment-emergent (TE) Period (i.e., time from first dose of Study 110 to 28 days after last dose or completion date of study participation) in the OL-SS. The overall long-term safety profile of study drug is assessed in terms of the following safety and tolerability endpoints:

- -Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
- -Clinical laboratory values
- -ECGs
- -Vital signs
- -Pulse oximetry

The triple combination safety baseline was planned to be used to calculate the change from baseline for continuous safety endpoints. The TC safety baseline is defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the parent study (if the subject actually received at least one dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA) or the first dose in the OLS.

Only descriptive analysis of safety and no statistical testing was planned to be performed.

## Multiplicity control

Not applicable as no hypothesis test is planned for safety analysis, unless specified otherwise.

## Interim analyses

Interim analyses (IAs) may take place at any time during the study at the discretion of the sponsor. In the event that the parent study is still ongoing, a limited Vertex team may be unblinded to the treatment assignments in the parent study for the purpose of reviewing the interim results, and will

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the parent study to protect the integrity of the parent study.

## CHMP comment

Statistical methods are agreed for this open-label extension study.

## Results

## Participant flow

Of the 251 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part A , 217 (86.5%) subjects completed study drug treatment and 215 (85.7%) subjects completed the study. A total of 84 (33.5%) subjects rolled over into Part B.

Of the 84 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B , 1 (1.2%) subject completed study drug treatment and the study; 81 (96.4%) subjects discontinued treatment and the study due to commercial drug availability.

## CHMP comment

In Part A, more patients from the control group of Study 104 prematurely discontinued the study compared to those who received treatment in Study 104 (20.7% vs 8.5%, respectively). Withdrawal of consent (not due to AE) and commercial drug available were the main reasons for this discrepancy.

In Part B, almost all patients discontinued prematurely due to availability of the commercial drug. As such, results for Part A are considered most important for this procedure.

## Recruitment

The study was conducted at 92 study sites in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia and the UK.

On 17 October 2022, the statistical analysis plan (SAP) was amended. Safety analyses for Part B were added to SAP version 2.0.

Vertex implemented safety measures to provide subjects the opportunity to continue participation in this study while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) exposure through travel. Implemented measures included, among others, shipment of study drug from site to subject's home, telephone/video call for safety assessments, in home assessments, and use of local laboratories.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Important protocol deviations (IPDs) were defined as any protocol deviation that may significantly affect the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject's rights, safety, or well-being. IPDs were reported in 6 subjects in Part A , mainly pertaining to study conduct/procedures. None of these impacted subject safety or efficacy assessments. There were no IPDs in Part B .

## Baseline data

Baseline demographics in Study 110 were the same as the parent study baseline demographics.

Parent study baseline is defined as

ofthe parent

study.

## CHMP comment

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics are nearly the same as for the parent study. It appears that 7 subjects from Study 104 did not participate in Study 110, 5 from the control arm and 2 from the treatment arm. Slight differences in baseline demographics and characteristics are likely caused by the absence of these subjects.

The mean age in Part A was 37.9 years and 36.3 year in Part B. The number of adolescents is not provided. However, in the parent study 9 adolescents were enrolled in the control group and 15 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group.

## Number analysed

The final number of subjects in each analysis set is provided in Table 10 and Table 11.

## Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1:

The analysis of absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) from baseline is presented in Table 13 and Figure 2. This analysis was conducted with the clinic spirometry data only.

For subjects who received control treatment in Study 104, after initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 110, rapid improvements in ppFEV1 were observed and sustained through OL Week 96. The least squares (LS) mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from parent study baseline at OL Week 96 was 4.1 percentage points (95% CI: 2.5, 5.7).

For subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 104, improvements in ppFEV1 were sustained through OL Week 96. The LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from parent study baseline at OL Week 96 was 3.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.2, 5.2).

A Kenward-Roger approximation was used for denominator degrees of freedom. An unstructured covariance stnucture was used to model the within-subject errors. The model was applied to CFQ-R data obtained in clinic and at home. The CFQ-R RD score from the Children Ages 12 and 13 Version and Adolescent and Adults Version were pooled for analysis.

## CHMP comment

In the current study, the absolute change in ppFEV1 for subjects who received control treatment in Study 104 was comparable to that of patients in the ELX/TEZ/IVA arm of Study 104. During the 96week study period, ppFEV1 improvements were stable in both groups. Similar results were obtained for the absolute change in SwCl. CFQ-R RD scores decreased slightly over the course of Study 110, but were nevertheless considerably higher compared to the baseline of the parent study. Subjects who received control treatment during the parent study had a slightly bigger increase in body weight (and consequently BMI) than subjects who had received ELX/TEZ/IVA during study 104. The BMI z-score did

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not seem to be maintained at the end of the study (&gt;week 60) in subjects that received control treatment during the parent study. The Applicant clarified that unlike BMI, BMI z-score was only assessed for subjects ≤ 20 years of age at parent study baseline (n=14 subjects who received control treatment in the parent study and n=18 subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study). At open-label Week 60 and all subsequent visits, there were only 6 to 7 non-missing data points for subjects who received control treatment in the parent study and 11 to 14 non-missing data points for subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study. Given such small sample sizes, variation in the mean change from baseline values is expected, and therefore BMI z-score data in Study VX18-445-110 should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, efficacy results obtained in parent study 104 could be replicated and sustained over the full 96-week study period.

## Adverse events

In Study 110 Part A , 241 (96.0%) subjects had at least 1 AE and 38 (15.1%) had at least 1 serious AE (SAE). See Table 17.

The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. Overall, 20 (8.0%) subjects had 1 or more severe AEs, 2 (0.8%) subjects had a life-threatening AE, and there was 1 death due to an AE of colon cancer that was assessed as unlikely related to study drug. Seventeen (6.8%) subjects interrupted ELX/TEZ/IVA due to AEs, and 13 (5.2%) subjects discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to AEs.

## CHMP comment

The percentage of subjects with any AE as well as Grade 3/4 AEs, related AEs and SAEs was higher in Part A of the study than in Part B. There were also more AEs related to study drug in Part A. This difference may be due to the large number of patients who discontinued treatment in Part B.

The percentage of subjects with AEs is considerably higher than in the parent study. In the parent study, 66.7% of the subjects in the treatment arm and 65.9% in the control arm had an AE, while this frequency increased to 96% in Study 110. In the treatment arm of the parent study, 3.8% of the AEs were Grade 3/4, 24.2% were considered related, and 3.8% were SAEs, compared to 8.8%, 37.8% and 15.1% respectively in Study 110. However, the parent study had a treatment period of only 8 weeks, so higher percentages of AEs in Study 110 are not unexpected. The safety pattern is comparable to that observed in other long-term safety studies.

## Common Adverse Events

Table 19 shows all AEs that occurred in at least 10% of subjects in Study 110 Part A , summarised by PT. Most common AEs were headache, infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, cough, and COVID-19.

AEs that occurred in at least 10% of subjects in Study 110 Part B were COVID-19 and infective pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF, which both occurred in 17 subjects (20.2%).

## CHMP comment

Overall, AEs were consistent with common manifestations or CF disease, common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, or the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. In general, frequencies are somewhat higher than in parent study 104, but this may be caused by the longer treatment period.

Quite a large number of subjects experienced anxiety (28 [11.2%] in Part A) during study 110. Of these 28 events, 9 (3.6%) were considered possibly related and 2 (0.8%) related. AEs of anxiety were not seen during the initial marketing authorisation, while in parent study 104, only one subject in the control arm had an AE of anxiety. In an ongoing procedure (EMEA/H/C/005269/X/0033/G), the Applicant is requested to monitor and analyse psychiatric-related AEs in the PSURs for all age groups.

## Severity of Adverse Events

In Part A , the majority of subjects had AEs that were mild (32.3%) or moderate (55.0%) in severity (Table 17). Overall, 20 (8.0%) subjects had 1 or more severe AEs, and 2 (0.8%) had a life-threatening AE. One life-threatening AE was a spontaneous pneumothorax, while the other one was colon cancer. Both were considered not to be related to ELX/TEZ/IVA by the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Part B , there was only one severe AE (1.2%), all others were either mild (31.0%) or moderate (41.7%).

## Relationship of Adverse Events

Overall, 17 (6.8%) subjects of Part A had an AE assessed by the investigator as related, and 78 (31.1%) subjects had an AE assessed by the investigator as possibly related (Table 17). AEs designated as related or possibly related that occurred in ≥3% of subjects were blood creatine phosphokinase increased (6.0%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (4.0%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (4.0%), rash (4.0%) and anxiety (4.4%).

In Part B , 1 (1.2%) subject had an AE assessed by the investigator as related.

## Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events

There was 1 AE of colon cancer leading to death in Part A . This event was considered unlikely related to study drug. There were 38 (15.1%) subjects who had at least 1 SAE. SAEs occurring in ≥2 subjects in the OLS are presented in Table 20. Two subjects had related SAEs; 1 subject had SAEs of ALT increased (0.4%) and AST increased (0.4%), and the second subject had an SAE of suicidal ideation (0.4%).

When summarizing number and percent of subjects, a subject with multiple events within a category was counted only once in that category. Table is sorted in descending order of frequency by PT.

Part B: There were no deaths. Three (3.6%) subjects had at least 1 SAE, which were pulmonary exacerbation, acute anterior chest pain with unknown aetiology, angiolipoma, neausea and vomiting, all occuring in only one subject. Of these, only the angiolipoma was considered possibly related.

## CHMP comment

Overall, related AEs and SAEs were consistent with common CF manifestations and complications, the parent study and the known safety profile for ELX/TEZ/IVA (except for the AE of anxiety, which is discussed above). It is agreed that the event of colon cancer leading to death is unlikely related to study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study Drug Discontinuation

Overall, 13 (5.2%) subjects in Part A had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in ≥2 subjects were liver -related events (including alanine transaminase ALT increased in 4 [1.6%] subjects, AST increased in 3 [1.2%] subjects, and blood bilirubin increased in 3 [1.2%] subjects), anxiety (2 [0.8%] subjects), and insomnia (2 [0.8%] subjects).

In Part B , no subjects had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation.

## Adverse Events That Led to Interruption of Study Drug

In Part A , 17 (6.8%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. AEs leading to treatment interruption occurring in at least 2 subjects were ALT increased (7 subjects), AST increased (7 subjects), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (3 subjects), gamma glutamyltransferase increased (2 subjects), and diarrhoea (2 subjects).

In Part B , no subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption.

## CHMP comment

The number of subjects who had AEs leading to drug interruption is comparable to what was seen during the initial marketing authorisation. However, there were slightly more treatment discontinuations due to AEs during study 110 (5.2%) compared with the studies of the initial procedure (where a maximum of 1.4% of subjects discontinued study drug). This difference is considered acceptable, considering the longer treatment duration and the fact that AEs leading to discontinuation were known AEs of ELX/TEZ/IVA (with the exception of anxiety, which was discussed above).

In Part A , 17 subjects (6.8%) had at least 1 elevated transaminase event. Both ALT increased and AST increased occurred in 16 subjects (6.4%) each. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity, whereas three events (1.2%) were severe. Elevated transaminases led to treatment discontinuation in 4 subjects (1.6%) and to treatment interruption in 8 subjects (3.2%).

Similar results were seen in Part B .

## Rash Events

In Part A , 29 (11.6%) subjects had a rash event. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity; one event was severe. No subject had a rash event that led to treatment discontinuation, and 2 (0.8%) subjects had a rash event that led to treatment interruption. One (0.4%) subject had a serious rash event (SAE of rash erythematous that resolved with treatment).

By sex, 18/124 female subjects (14.5%) and 11/127 male subjects (8.7%) had rash events. In female subjects, 6/42 subjects (14.3%) who used hormonal therapy and 12/82 subjects (14.6%) not using hormonal therapy had rash events.

There were no rash events in Part B .

## CHMP comment

Elevated transaminases and rash are known AEs of ELX/TEZ/IVA. During the initial marketing application, a higher incidence of rash was seen in female subjects taking hormonal therapy compared with those not taking hormonal therapy in the ELX/TEZ/IVA arm. This trend was not observed in Study

104 and is also not seen in the current study. Hence, there are no new insights in the AESIs of elevated transaminases and rash.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

## Chemistry (Part A)

Liver function tests (LFTs) are described above (see AESI elevated transaminase described above). There were no trends in mean values of other non-LFT chemistry parameters and no clinically significant trends in creatine kinase concentration levels were seen.

## Haematology (Part A)

There were no trends observed in haematology parameters. AEs related to haematology were infrequent (PTs occurred in 1 to 2 subjects each), not serious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption.

## Coagulation (Part A)

There were no trends or AEs related to coagulation assessments.

## Urinalysis (Part A)

There were no trends in urinalysis results. AEs related to urinalysis were infrequent (most PTs occurred in 1 to 2 subjects each), not serious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption.

## Vital signs (Part A)

The mean (SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased from baseline through OL Week 96 by 2.6 (13.2) and 2.5 (9.4) mm HG, respectively. The mean pulse rate was variable over time. No subjects had AEs of decreased pulse rate. There were no trends in temperature, respiratory rate or pulse oximetry.

## ECG (Part A)

The mean heart rate (HR) was variable over time, but consistent with pulse rate findings. The mean decreases in HR ranged from -0.3 to -1.7 beats per minute. No subject had AEs of HR decreased. There were no trends observed in other ECG parameters. AEs related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac disorders were infrequent (majority of PTs occurred in 1 to 2 subjects each). There were two cardiac disorder SAEs (i.e. atrial fibrillation and palpitations), but those were assessed as not related and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption.

## Ophthalmologic Examinations (Part A)

There were two mild, nonserious and possibly related AEs (one cataract and one lenticular opacities). No treatment was required.

Overall, laboratory findings in Part B were consistent with or less frequent/severe than in Part A of the study.

## CHMP comment

In general, clinical laboratory findings are in line with those observed in the parent study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Kaftrio obtained approval by the EMA on 21 August 2020. Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of CF in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The MAH now

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

submitted the results of a stand-alone study, Study VX18-445-110 ('110'), as per requirement of Article 46 of the 'Paediatric Regulation' (EC) 1901/2006. Study 110 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study (OLS) in subjects with CF 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes), who completed Study VX18-445-104 (Study 104). The study consisted of two parts: Part A (96 weeks Treatment Period) and, in certain countries, Part B (48 weeks Treatment Period), followed by a 4-week Safety Follow-up Period. During the Treatment Period, patients received standard ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment as described in the SmPC. In- and exclusion criteria were the same as for parent Study 104 and thus considered acceptable. Primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry. This endpoint is appropriate for an open-label extension study. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in efficacy measures, such as ppFEV1, SwCl, body measures and CFQ-R RD scores, which are considered relevant outcome measures for CF treatment. A total of 251 patients were included in Part A (250 subjects were planned), of these, 84 patients rolled-over to Part B. Only 1 of these 84 subjects completed the study; 81 subjects (96.4%) discontinued treatment and the study due to the availability of the commercial drug. As such, results for Part A are considered most important for this procedure. The mean age in Part A was 37.9 years (including approximately 14 adolescents) and 36.3 year in Part B. Efficacy results (only Part A) were generally in line with those observed in the parent study. Subjects who received control treatment during Study 104 had comparable changes in efficacy measures as those who received ELX/TEZ/IVA during the parent study. In addition, efficacy parameters were relatively stable during the 96-week study period. However, while the absolute change in body weight and BMI increased over the course of the study, the BMI z-score did not seem to be maintained at the end of the study (&gt;week 60) in subjects that received control treatment during the parent study. The Applicant clarified that BMI zscore was, unlike BMI, only assessed for a small subgroup of patients ≤ 20 years. From week 60 onwards there were only very few nonmissing data points available. Hence, BMI z-score data in Study 110 should be interpreted with caution. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity. There were two life-threatening AEs and one AE leading to death in Part A, but these were considered unrelated to the study drug. Most common AEs were headache, infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, cough, and COVID-19, which all occurred in more than 20% of the subjects. AEs leading to study drug interruption or discontinuation were rare and mainly liver-related events. Frequencies of AEs, Grade 3/4 AEs, related AEs and SAEs 110 (96 weeks vs. 8 weeks in the parent study). The safety profile is generally consistent with other open-label extensions studies. Quite a large number of subjects experienced anxiety (28 [11.2%] in Part A) compared to previous studies. In an ongoing procedure (EMEA/H/C/005269/X/0033/G), a request for post-approval follow-up of the AE of anxiety was already demanded. There were no new insights in the AESIs of elevated transaminases and rash. However, in general, AEs were consistent were higher compared with the parent study. This likely reflects the longer treatment duration in Study with common manifestations and complications of CF disease in subjects 12 years of age and older, or the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

## Conclusion

The benefit-risk evaluation of Kaftrio remains positive. No new safety signals have been observed in Study 110 and results for secondary efficacy endpoints are also in line with previous studies. No update of the product information is considered needed at present.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The benefit-risk evaluation of Kaftrio remains positive.  No new safety signals have been observed in CF patients aged 12 years and older with F/G and F/RF genotypes treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 110. No update of the product information is considered needed at present.

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

## Other concern

1. While the absolute change in body weight and BMI increased over the course of Study 110, the BMI z-score did not seem to be maintained at the end of the study (&gt;week 60) in subjects that received control treatment during the parent study. The Applicant is asked to give potential explanations for these results.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

Unlike BMI, which was assessed in all subjects, BMI zscore was only assessed for subjects ≤ 20 years of age at parent study baseline (N = 14 subjects who received control treatment in the parent study and N = 18 subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study). See Table 1 for details.

Notes: Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period of the parent study. For the parent study period, MMRM was the same as the parent study analysis. For the OL Efficacy Period, MMRM included data up to OL Week 96, with treatment group (as randomized in parent study), visit, and treatment*visit as fixed effects, and parent study baseline ppFEV1, TEZ/IVA comparator) as covariates. A Kenward-Roger approximation was used for denominator degrees of freedom A compound symmetry covariance structure was used to model the within-subject errors.

As shown above in Table 1, at open-label Week 60 and all subsequent visits, there were only 6 to 7 nonmissing data points for subjects who received control treatment in the parent study and 11 to 14 nonmissing data points for subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study. Given such small sample sizes, variation in the mean change from baseline values is expected, and therefore BMI zscore data in Study VX18-445-110 should be interpreted with caution. Overall, the BMI z-score data are consistent for subjects who received control treatment in the parent study, in the context of the wide and overlapping 95% CIs at all visits.

## Rapporteur's assessment

The clarification of the Applicant, i.e. that BMI z-score was analysed in a small subset of patients and that there were only few non-missing data points from week 60 onwards is acknowledged. It is agreed that BMI z-score data in Study 110 should be interpreted with caution. As such, no firm conclusions could be drawn based on the curves from week 60 onwards.

## Conclusion

Issue resolved. The assessment report is updated accordingly.
