## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 8 February 2019 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

To update sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on interim results from study KEYNOTE-051; this is an ongoing Phase I/II, single-arm study to evaluate the PK, pharmacodynamics, toxicity, safety, and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab in paediatric participants (Measure 2 of PIP01). Additionally, the results of study Study PD018 / PA-0064; evaluation of expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in archival paediatric tumour tissues, were submitted (Measure 1 of PIP01).

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The purpose of this submission is to fulfil the regulatory requirement to submit the results of all studies performed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan for pembrolizumab.

The MAH presented the results (cut-off date 03-Sep-2018) of the ongoing phase 1/2 study KEYNOTE-051 of pembrolizumab in paediatric patients aged 6 months-18 years with advanced melanoma or a PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumor or lymphoma. Overall, 154 paediatric patients were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg Q3W, which has been established as the recommended paediatric dosage. Observed PK concentrations in paediatric patients administered with 2 mg/kg Q3W were within the range of predicted concentration for adults administered with the same dose with 2 mg/kg Q3W.

Based on KEYNOTE-051 results, antitumor activity was minimal in patients with PD-L1 positive paediatric solid tumours and other lymphomas. ORR in the 136 patients with solid tumour and other lymphoma was only 5.9%, and enrolment was stopped for most solid tumours. Moreover, no PD-L1 negative cohorts were enrolled as per futility rules; therefore, analysis of association of PD-L1 status with response was not warranted.

A 50% ORR was on the contrary observed among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, for which the MAH is planning a future extension of indication. The cohort of HL is still open. Moreover, the MAH informed that data on MSI-h population will be reported separately.

No new safety signals emerged. Based on comparative safety tables of paediatric (KN-051) vs adult patients  (RSD),  the  safety  of  paediatric  patients  appeared  generally  similar  to  that  seen  in  adults according to available data. SmPC has been re-worded by the MAH accordingly. No paediatric therapeutic indication is proposed at this stage, but only SmPC has been updated to reflect the results of study KEYNOTE-051.

The changes to the SmPC are acceptable.

The benefit-risk balance of Keytruda remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I                  |

To update sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on interim results from study KEYNOTE-051; this is an ongoing Phase I/II, single-arm study to evaluate the PK, pharmacodynamics, toxicity, safety, and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab in paediatric participants (Measure 2 of PIP01). Additionally, the results of study Study PD018 / PA-0064; evaluation of expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in archival paediatric tumour tissues, were submitted (Measure 1 of PIP01).

is recommended for approval.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex I are recommended.

## 4. EPAR changes

The table in Module 8b of the EPAR will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Please refer to the Recommendations section above

## Summary

In KEYNOTE-051, 154 paediatric patients were administered pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab concentrations in these patients were comparable to those of adults at the same dose. Participants were enrolled across 28 tumour types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumour types by histology were Hodgkin lymphoma (11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), osteosarcoma (6.5%) and melanoma (5.2%). In patients with solid tumours and other lymphomas, the ORR was 5.9%, no patient had a complete response and 8 patients (5.9%) had a partial response. In the Hodgkin lymphoma population, the ORR was 50.0%, 2 patients (11.1%) had a complete response and 7 patients (38.9%) had a partial response. The safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of paediatric patients) were pyrexia (31%), vomiting (26%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), anaemia (21%) and constipation (20%).

## 5. Introduction

The purpose of this submission is to fulfil the regulatory requirement to submit the results of all studies performed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan for pembrolizumab (EMEA-001474-PIP01-13-M01  for  treatment  of  all  conditions  included  in  the  category  of  malignant neoplasms [except nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue]) by the time of the submission of the next indication for KEYTRUDA following the PIP completion due date (31 January 2019), as per Article 8 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

Number of unique subject numbers in dataset

Nos: Not otherwise specified

Data Source: [052DCX: analysis-p051pkdm0pip2018v3]

In total, there were 151 participants with evaluable PK samples.

PK samples in KN051 were scheduled as follow: Predose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained within  24 hours  prior  to  dosing  at  Cycles  1,  2,  4,  8  and  every  4  cycles  (12  weeks) thereafter. Postdose serum concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30 minutes after the end of the infusion in Cycle 1 and Cycle 8. Additional PK samples were drawn in Cycle 1 between 72 to 168 hours (4-8 days) postdose and at 264 to 408 hours (12-18 days) postdose.

Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 6.3.0.395) software was used for pharmacokinetic analysis .

## Immunogenicity Analysis

An immunogenicity evaluation has been performed using data from study KN051. The objective of the immunogenicity report 052J8M was: 1) to evaluate the immunogenicity incidence in children treated with 2  mg/kg  Q3W pembrolizumab  (MK-3475)  in  study  KN051,  which  is  a  Phase  I/II  clinical  trial  of pembrolizumab  in  children  and  2)  to  compare  the  immunogenicity  incidence  after  pembrolizumab therapy in children with the immunogenicity incidence after pembrolizumab therapy in adults.

For all of the ADA positive subjects, the pembrolizumab exposure was similar to that for other subjects treated with the same regimen.

## 6.1. Discussion

The purpose of this submission is to fulfil the regulatory requirement to submit the results of all studies performed  in  compliance  with  the  agreed  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  for  pembrolizumab  and  no pediatric therapeutic indication is proposed at this stage while SmPC section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been updated to reflect the results of  study KEYNOTE-051.

A  substantial  characterization  of  the  key  clinical  pharmacology  and  immunogenicity  findings  of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in adults has been provided in previous submissions.

Based  on  the  existing  robust  characterization  of  pembrolizumab  PK,  a  comparison  was  conducted between the observed PK of pembrolizumab in children from study KEYNOTE-051 and the predictions from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy data (KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024).

Observed PK concentrations in pediatric patients administered with 2 mg/kg Q3W were within the range of predicted concentration for adults administered with the same dose with 2 mg/kg Q3W.

Although this study's primary efficacy goals were to evaluate antitumor activity in PD-L1 positive tumors, preliminary exploration of antitumor activity was also to be conducted in a subset of PD-L1 negative solid tumors and other lymphomas based upon response observed in PD-L1 positive tumors in this study. Melanoma, MSI-H solid tumor, and rrcHL Cohort participants were evaluated regardless of PD-L1 status. As of Amendment 08, per futility rules, signals of efficacy were not met in solid tumor target cohorts, hence enrollment was stopped for most solid tumors. The melanoma, rrcHL, and MSI-H tumor cohorts continue to enroll participants regardless of PD-L1 status. Enrollment to the melanoma cohort will be limited to adolescent participants ( ≥ 12 and ≤ 18 years old).

## Methodology:

Part I: Phase 1 safety, PK, pharmacodynamic, and dose-finding and confirmation evaluation in pediatric participants. Part I utilized a modified 3+3 design (dose-finding) and dose confirmation design according to a modified Toxicity Probability Interval approach.

Part  II  (ongoing):  Phase  2  safety  and  efficacy  evaluation  in  pediatric  participants  with  advanced melanoma; PD-L1 positive advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors or other lymphoma; rrcHL, or advanced, relapsed or refractory microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) solid tumors.

The primary efficacy and safety population was the All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) population, which includes all participants who received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab.

## 7.2. Results

Patient disposition: A total of up to 310 participants was planned to be enrolled. As of the data cutoff date for this report, 155 participants were enrolled and 154 received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab. Two participants completed maximum treatment duration (35 cycles, approximately 2 years), while 22 (14.3%) were still continuing on study treatment. Of the 132 (85.7%) participants who discontinued study treatment, the majority discontinued due to progressive disease (93) or clinical progression (19).

Baseline characteristics: Median age was 13 years (range 1 to 17 years). The majority were white, non-Hispanic (79.9%), and had Stage IV cancer (about 60%), and received prior treatment (89%).

Participants were enrolled across 28 tumor types by primary diagnosis. The most common tumor types by histology were HL (11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), and melanoma (5.2%). A total of 29 patients (18.8%) have solid tumor nos, and 12 (7.8%) soft tissue neoplasm nos.

# Overall Staging not required for diagnoses lacking standard staging systems.

* Those subjects who are naïve, or who received only adjuvant or neoadjuvant prior therapies are categorized as 0. (Data Cutoff Date: 03SEP2018).

Dose Limiting Toxicities (part 1): the starting pembrolizumab dose and frequency of 2 mg/kg Q3W was maintained throughout the trial. There were no DLTs observed in the 12 participants in Part I of the study. Thus the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W dosing regimen was not changed and has been established as the recommended pediatric dosage .

Efficacy results: Efficacy analyses were based on the ASaT population. Of the 154 participants in the ASaT population, 134 were enrolled with solid tumors, 18 with HL, and 2 with other lymphomas.

- Solid Tumors and Other Lymphomas (n=134+2)

The ORR  per  RECIST  1.1  by  investigator  assessment in  the  solid  tumor  and  other  lymphoma population was 5.9% . The 8 confirmed responders (all PR) had the following tumor types (by histology): adenocarcinoma  and  mesothelioma  (2  participants  each),  and  malignant  ganglioglioma,  epithelioid sarcoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, and malignant rhabdoid tumor (1 participant each).

§ From product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data.

(Data Cutoff Date: 03SEP2018).

No death events occurred in the Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma group. Therefore, the median OS of the HL population had not been reached . OS rates at 6 and 12 months were both 100.0% by KM estimation.

Biomarker  Evaluations: Few  hotspot  mutations  were  observed  in  solid  tumor  samples  from participants in this study, therefore no correlative testing was performed.

PD-L1  Expression  Level  and  Clinical  Response: Initially,  only  participants  with  PD-L1  positive tumors could be enrolled in this study, with the exception of the melanoma cohort. Because no tumor cohort met the tumor response threshold defined by the futility rules in the study protocol, no PD-L1 negative cohorts were allowed to be enrolled. However, 5 of the 8 participants with melanoma who enrolled had PD-L1 negative tumors. Given that no responses were observed in the entire melanoma cohort, analysis of association of PD-L1 status with response was not warranted.

## 7.3. Discussion-efficacy

Within this variation, the MAH presented the results (cutoff date 03-Sep-2018) of the ongoing phase 1/2 study KEYNOTE-051 of pembrolizumab in paediatric patients aged 6 months-18 years with advanced melanoma or a PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumor or lymphoma. The number of study participants as per PIP01 was met, and all binding elements followed, the PIP was considered fulfilled  (PIP  compliance  check  EMEA-C-001474-PIP01-13- M01 started on 3 January 2019) (no new documents regarding PIP have been included in the submission). A separate specific HL cohort has not yet completed the accrual and will be presented separately. Additionally, it is reported that the participants in the MSI-H Cohort will also be analyzed in a separate report.

Overall, 154 paediatric patients were treated in KEYNOTE-051 study. Median age was 13 years (3 patients were 6 months-2 years aged). The most common tumor types by histology were Hodgkin lymphoma (11.7%), glioblastoma multiforme (9.1%), soft tissue neoplasm NOS (7.8%), neuroblastoma (6.5%), osteosarcoma  (6.5%)  and  melanoma  (5.2%),  although  it  is  noted  high  frequency  of  not  otherwise specified solid tumor (18.8%). Most tumors were stage III and IV.

Part I of this study had rate of DLTs as primary endpoint. The starting dose was pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W. As no DLTs were observed in the 12 participants of part I, pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W dosing regimen was not changed and has been established as the recommended pediatric dosage.

Of the 154 participants, 134 were enrolled with solid tumours, 18 with Hodgkin lymphoma, and 2 with other lymphomas.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The ORR in participants with solid tumors and other lymphomas was 5.9% (95%CI 2.6, 11.3), with the responders split across multiple tumor histologies. Median time to response was 1.9 months, median DOR was not reached, median PFS was 1.9 months and median OS 9 months.

Per futility rules, signals of efficacy were not met in solid tumor target cohorts, hence enrollment was stopped  for  most  solid  tumors.  The  melanoma,  rrcHL,  and  MSI-H  tumor  cohorts  continue  to  enroll participants regardless of PD-L1 status. Enrollment to the melanoma cohort was limited to adolescent participants ( ≥ 12 and ≤ 18 years old). Based on KEYNOTE-051 results, antitumor activity was minimal in patients with PD-L1 positive pediatric solid tumors and other lymphomas.

In contrast, the ORR in the Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin lymphoma population (n=18) was 50% (95%CI 26.0, 74.0). Median time to response was 1.9 months, median DOR was 17.3 months and median PFS 12.2  months.  No  deaths  event  occurred.  The  Applicant  is  considering  submitting  an  indication  for paediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma as part of a future adult filing.

No paediatric therapeutic indication is proposed with this variation, but only an update of the SmPC to reflect the results of KEYNOTE-051 to date is requested. This is accepted.

Analysis  on  PD-L1  status  was  not  performed.  Indeed,  initially,  only  participants  with  PD-L1  positive tumors could be enrolled in this study, with the exception of the melanoma cohort. Because no tumor cohort met the tumor response threshold defined by the futility rules in the study protocol, no PD-L1 negative cohorts were allowed to be enrolled. However, 5 of the 8 participants with melanoma who enrolled had PD-L1 negative tumors. Given that no responses were observed in the entire melanoma cohort, analysis of association of PD-L1 status with response was not warranted. This is acknowledged.

## 8. Clinical Safety aspects

## 8.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

KEYNOTE-051 comprised 154 pediatric participants (aged 6 months-17 years) who received at least 1 dose of study intervention (ASaT population) as of the data cutoff of 03-SEP-2018, constituting the primary safety analysis population.

## 8.2. Results

Exposure: The mean number of pembrolizumab administrations in the solid tumor and other lymphoma population was 6.1, with a median duration of exposure of 43 days (range: 1 to 720 days).

Participants with HL experienced a higher response rate, and therefore received more study treatment, than other patients. In the HL population, the mean number of administrations was 14.4, with a median duration of exposure of 212 days (range: 1 to 712 days). At the data cut-off date, 10 out of 18 subjects with HL were still on treatment.

Exposure by duration is presented below:

Two participants experienced 3 drug-related Grade 5 AEs: 1 participant had Grade 5 pulmonary edema, and 1 participant had Grade 5 pleural effusion and Grade 5 pneumonitis.

## Deaths:

Six participants had 1 or more AEs that resulted in death. Two of these deaths were reported by the investigator to be related to study drug: 1 participant had pulmonary edema and another experienced pneumonitis and pleural effusion. According to the MAH, for the participant experiencing the fatal event of  pulmonary  edema,  the  event  was  confounded  by  concomitant  sepsis,  and  for  the  participant experiencing  the  fatal  events  of  pneumonitis/pleural  effusion,  the  outcome  of  these  events  was confounded by the extensive right chest involvement of the underlying epithelioid sarcoma.

## Assessor's comment

Based on the narrative provided, one subject with solid tumor NOS (colloid carcinoma), received a total of 18 doses, however pembrolizumab was interrupted in response to worsening of anemia (Grade 3) and gastric ulcer (Grade 3), with approximately 6 weeks between Cycles 14 and 15; then discontinued in response to gastric adenocarcinoma (Grade 5). The investigator considered gastric ulcer related to study treatment (drug-related SAE), and it is reported that a biopsy on day 299 indicated a chronic gastritis with inflammatory infiltration with lymphoplasmacytoid cells. No corticosteroids were administered.

One subject with renal medullary carcinoma, who received one dose of pembrolizumab, died for a grade 5 pulmonary edema, considered by investigator related to study medication and immune related. The evaluation of the MAH that the event was confounded by sepsis is acknowledged, nevertheless a relation of the AE with study drug cannot be excluded.

One subject with sarcoma developed pneumonitis after one cycle of pembrolizumab, which was considered immune-related by investigator and classified as AEOSI by the MAH. Pneumonitis, including fatal events, is a known ADR of pembrolizumab.

## Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation and Treatment Interruption

As of the data cutoff date, a total of 7 participants (4.5%) had an AE that resulted in treatment discontinuation. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were adenocarcinoma gastric, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood creatinine increased, hypertension, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and sepsis in 1 participant each (0.6%). Of the 7 participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE, 4 participants had AEs reported as drug related by the investigator (aspartate aminotransferase increased, hypertension, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema).

As of the data cutoff date, a total of 18 participants (11.7%) experienced at least 1 AE leading to interruption of study drug. The most frequently reported AE that led to interruption of study drug was alanine aminotransferase increased, experienced by 3 participants (1.9%). Of the 18 participants with treatment interruptions due to an AE, 8 participants (5.2%) had AEs considered to be drug-related per investigator assessment.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI)

Twenty-eight participants (18.2%) experienced at least 1 AEOSI, most commonly involving the thyroid: hypothyroidism (8.4%), hyperthyroidism (3.9%), and thyroiditis (1.3%). Of 28 participants with AEOSI, 19 had AEOSI reported as drug related by the investigator and 3 had AEOSI reported as Grade 3, 4, or 5 (1 each of Grade 3 pruritus, Grade 3 colitis, and Grade 5 pneumonitis), all of which were reported as drug related. For 2 participants AEOSI (pneumonitis and pruritus) were reported by the investigator as serious and drug related. For the case of pneumonitis, it also lead to discontinuation, and ultimately was fatal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As of the data cutoff date, AEOSI resolved for 12 of 28 participants (42.9%), were resolving for 3 (10.7%) participants, and resolved with sequelae in 1 participant (3.6%). AEOSI had not resolved for 10 participants (35.7%). All events that had not resolved as of the data cutoff date were endocrinopathies that require long-term hormone replacement therapy (7 events of hypothyroidism, 2 events of hyperthyroidism, and 1 event each of thyroiditis and adrenal insufficiency). The AEOSI outcome status was unknown in 1 participant (3.6%, hypothyroidism).

The most common AEOSI reported during pembrolizumab treatment was hypothyroidism, which occurred in 13 of 154 (8.4%) participants in the ASaT population. The median time to onset was 48.0 days. All events were Grade 1 or 2, and no participant received corticosteroid treatment. Hypothyroidism resolved for 2 participants. As of the data cutoff date, hypothyroidism had not resolved for 7 participants, was resolving in 3 participants, and the status of 1 was unknown. In the 13 participants with a reported AE of hypothyroidism during treatment, a total of 4 (30.8%) had a prior history of radiation therapy to the head, craniospinal, or lung, which may have contributed to the risk of hypothyroidism.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column.

A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

MedDRA preferred terms 'Progressive Disease' and 'Malignant Neoplasm Progression' not related to the drug are excluded.

(Database Cutoff Date: 03SEP2018).

## Other Events of Special Interest

## Complications Post-allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Participants Previously Treated With Pembrolizumab

As of the data cutoff date, there was 1 participant with HL who received an allogeneic SCT after treatment with pembrolizumab. The participant was treated with pembrolizumab for approximately 12 weeks, then discontinued the study. The participant continued to receive 'immune checkpoint blockade' (name and duration unknown). Approximately 11 months after stopping pembrolizumab, the participant received an allogeneic SCT. Approximately 4 months after the allogeneic SCT, the participant was diagnosed with Grade 2 chronic GvHD. As of the data cutoff date, the participant was alive, approximately 10 months after the allogeneic SCT.

## Immune System Function Analysis

Measurements of immune system function revealed the following:

- Minimal changes were observed in the concentration of vaccinated antibodies at posttreatment Cycle 4 compared to pretreatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The total memory B- and T-cell counts showed an upward trend from pretreatment to posttreatment Cycle 4.

Taken together, according to the MAH these data indicate that treatment with pembrolizumab in pediatric patients does not seem to affect immunological competence in this patient population.

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

The most frequently reported liver laboratory abnormalities in the ASaT population were: elevated alkaline phosphatase ≥ 1.5 × ULN (15.0%) and elevated ALT ≥ 3 × ULN (12.4%). No liver function abnormalities were consistent with potential drug-induced liver injury criteria (Hy's Law).

## Comparison between pembrolizumab safety in adult and paediatric patients

Upon  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  provided  the  paediatric  data  for  adverse  events  compared  with  the pembrolizumab EU reference safety dataset (RSD), which is an internally validated dataset that includes adverse event data for the adult studies KEYNOTE-001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; KEYNOTE-002 (original phase), KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE- 012, KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 3, KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-040, KEYNOTE-045, KEYNOTE-052, KEYNOTE-054, KEYNOTE-055, and KEYNOTE-087.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column.

A bolded term or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included. MedDRA preferred terms \"Neoplasm Progression\", \"Malignant Neoplasm Progression\" and \"Disease Progression\" not related to the drug are excluded.

§ Includes all subjects who received at least one dose of MK-3475 in KN001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; KN002 (original phase), KN006, KN010, KN012 HNSCC, KN013 Cohort 3, KN024, KN040, KN045, KN052, KN054, KN055 and KN087.

## 8.3. Discussion - safety

The safety database presented included 154 participants of KEYNOTE-051 who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg Q3W. Data cut off for the analysis is 03-SEP-2018.

Median number of pembrolizumab administration was 3 for the 136 patients with solid tumor and other lymphoma, while higher exposure was observed in the 18 subjects with HL, experiencing higher response rate  (median  number  of  administration  was  11,  range  1-35).  Overall,  18  patients  were  exposed  to pembrolizumab for ≥ 12 months.

Overall, 96.8% of patients experienced one or more adverse events, most common (reported in at least 20% of paediatric patients) being pyrexia (31%), vomiting (26%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), anaemia (21%) and constipation (20%). AEs considered as drug-related by investigator occurred in 56.5% of subjects, most common being anemia and fatigue (7.8% each), lymphocyte count decreased and  pyrexia  (7.1%  each),  AST  increased  (5.8%).  Grade  3-5  AEs  were  44.8%  (anemia  9.1%  and lymphocyte count decrease 5.8% the most common), drug-related Grade 3-5 8.4% (lymphocyte count decrease 1.9% and anemia 1.3% the most common). AEs lead to treatment discontinuation in 4.5% of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the patient. The most frequent laboratory abnormalities pertain to transaminases, however the MAH stated that no liver function abnormalities were consistent with potential drug-induced liver injury criteria (Hy's Law).

SAE occurred in 36.4% of subjects, (drug-related SAE 9.1%), most common being pyrexia. A drug related  SAE  of  gastric  ulcer  grade  3  was  reported,  and  a  biopsy  revealed  'a  chronic  gastritis  with inflammatory infiltration with lymphoplasmacytoid cells.'  Inflammation of the upper gastrointestinal tract, with gastric ulcers and inflammatory infiltrate on gastric biopsy, have been described in literature in  patients  receiving  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  (see  for  example  'Inflammatory  gastrointestinal diseases associated with PD-1 blockade antibodies. M Collins et al Annals of Oncology, Volume 28, Issue 11,  November  2017,  Pages  2860-2865').  While  colitis,  including  rare  cases  of  small  intestinal perforation, is reported in the SmPC of Keytruda, gastritis and gastric ulcers are not included. The MAH has been requested to perform a revision of the cases of gastric ulcer across the whole (adult) safety database (including evaluation of biopsy report when available), and to evaluate whether appropriate wording should be included in the SmPC. The MAH provided the requested data and did not consider a change of the SmPC warranted. Based on the data provided, it is agreed that several cases with biopsy available  lack  of  sufficient  information  or  present  confounding  factors,  although  a  relation  with pembrolizumab  cannot  be  totally  excluded  in  most  of  them.  In  particular,  one  spontaneous  report described  a  case  in  which  a  gastric  biopsy  after  one  month  of  pembrolizumab  showed  lymphocytic gastritis, which was not evident from a biopsy taken before starting pembrolizumab. The issue is not further pursued in the context of this procedure. Indeed, the signal of gastrointestinal ulcer is under investigation by the PRAC, therefore a more updated and extensive evaluation of this safety issue will be however performed.

Six participants had 1 or more AEs resulting in death. Investigator considered a pulmonary edema and pneumonitis/pleural effusion as treatment-related. For the grade 5 pulmonary edema, the evaluation of the MAH that the event was confounded by sepsis is acknowledged, however a relation of the AE with study drug cannot be excluded. The event of pneumonitis was considered immune-related by investigator and  classified  as  AEOSI  by  the  MAH.  Pneumonitis,  including  fatal  events,  is  a  known  ADR  of pembrolizumab. It has been requested to mention in the SmPC that fatal events occurred in the paediatric population of KEYNOTE-051.

Twenty-eight participants (18.2%) experienced at least 1 AEOSI, most commonly involving the thyroid (hypothyroidism 8.4%, hyperthyroidism 3.9%, and thyroiditis 1.3%). AEOSI were grade ≥ 3 in 3 patients (1 each of Grade 3 pruritus, Grade 3 colitis, and Grade 5 pneumonitis).

Overall, no new safety signals have been reported in KEYNOTE-051 study.

The MAH concluded in the SmPC section 4.8 that 'the safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab'. Upon CHMP request, the MAH has provided supporting data comparing the safety of paediatric patients in KEYNOTE-051 with safety of adult from the Reference Safety Dataset. Based on the available data, taking into account the limited number of paediatric subjects (154 paediatrics vs 4,948 adults), the above statement is agreed.

## 9. Changes to the Product Information

As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to include data from KEYNOTE-051.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

2. The MAH concluded in the SmPC that 'the safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab', however no supporting data to appropriately compare the safety of paediatric to adult patients have been found. The MAH is requested to provide the paediatric safety in KEYNOTE-051 with (please use the safety tables reported in the AR and report side by side the frequencies included in the most recent RSD of pembrolizumab monotherapy in adult patients). If relevant higher frequencies in single items are found in the paediatric compared to adult population, those should be discussed and, if appropriate, reflected in the SmPC.

## Summary of the MAH's response

## Background

Immune-mediated  adverse  events  associated  with  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  (ICI)  including

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pembrolizumab,  a  PD-1  inhibitor,  have  been  well-described  in  the  literature  and  are  thought  to  be generally caused by non-specific activation of the immune system.

Pembrolizumab has been associated with immune-mediated colitis as well as other immunemediated organ disorders; the putative mechanism for gastritis or gastric ulcer associated with pembrolizumab would be immune-mediated as well. It is important to understand the differential diagnosis of gastritis and gastric ulcer and consider alternative explanations for an immune-mediated event. A cumulative review of case reports of gastritis and/or gastric ulcer is provided below.

Gastritis can be defined as an acute or chronic inflammation of the stomach resulting in epithelial damage of the mucosal lining. This term should be distinguished from 'gastropathy,' which refers to mucosal damage without inflammation resulting from epithelial cell chemical injury (such as with NSAIDs, alcohol bile reflux), vascular gastropathy primarily due to portal hypertension, or ischaemic injury, such as is seen with burn injuries, sepsis, hypovolemia, trauma or cocaine, or auto-immune, as is seen with celiac disease.  Adverse  event  reports  received  by  the  MAH  that  described  clinical  disease  consistent  with gastropathy rather than gastritis would not be considered immune-mediated, and unlikely attributable to pembrolizumab.

The etiologies of inflammatory gastritis/gastric ulcer are primarily infectious or autoimmune. Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) bacteria are the most common infectious agents and are clearly associated with peptic ulcer disease, both duodenal and gastric ulcer disease. It is estimated that 50 to 75% of the world adult population is infected with H. pylori.

Mucosal injury is induced by cytotoxic enzymes secreted by the organisms, which also produce number of antigenic substances, including heat shock protein, urease, and lipopolysaccharide, all of which can be taken up and processed by lamina propria macrophages and activated T-cells. H.pylori can be detected by non-invasive serologic or stool antigen testing, however, biopsy is necessary, especially for confirmation for patients on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) due to antimicrobial properties of PPIs [Ref. 5.4: 057M8J].

Gastritis cannot be confirmed by macroscopic observation alone: mucosal erythema seen on endoscopy is not proof of an inflammatory process. Histologically confirmed inflammation of the gastric mucosa is necessary  for  confirmation  of  an  inflammatory  pathology  [Ref.  5.4:  057MZ6].  Therefore,  the  MAH considers case reports with description of tissue biopsy as the most relevant for review.

## Review of Case Reports

The MAH's review includes the clinical trial database, which included non-serious and serious events, and the safety database, which includes serious adverse events and nonserious adverse events of interest from clinical trial as well as non-interventional and spontaneous reporting sources. The evaluation of the clinical database was performed using the pembrolizumab ongoing aggregate safety evaluation (OASE). OASE is the MAH's largest source of unblinded aggregate monotherapy clinical trial safety data. The most recent dataset contains all safety data for subjects who received pembrolizumab monotherapy in an open-label or unmasked, completed randomized trial for which there has been a database lock on or before 31-Mar-2018 (n=9118).  Comparator safety data from these trials is also included in the OASE. At present,  comparators  include  ipilimumab,  cetuximab  and  chemotherapy  (all  cytotoxic  treatments combined).

The reporting rates for gastritis in subjects who received pembrolizumab monotherapy was similar to patients who received chemotherapy or ipilimumab. There were 54 reports of gastritis in pembrolizumab, which represents 0.6% of all AEs reported for pembrolizumab monotherapy. The reporting rates gastritis in 1,324 patients exposed to chemotherapy was 0.4% (n=5), and 0.4% for 256 patients exposed to ipilimumab (n=1), with no events reported in the placebo (n=502) or cetuximab (n=71) arms. Similarly, the reporting rate of gastric ulcer for pembro monotherapy was 0.1% (n=13) compared with 0.1% in the

chemo group (n=1). No events of gastric ulcer were reported in the placebo, ipilimumab or cetuximab groups.

The MAH's adverse event reporting and review database included cumulative reports received by the MAH up to a data lock point (DLP) of 9 April 2019. Using MedDRA High Level Term (HLT) categories for 'Gastric ulcers  and  perforations'  and  'gastritis',  143  cases  were  evaluated  including  the  following  reported Preferred Terms (PTs): chronic gastritis, gastric perforation, gastric ulcer, gastric ulcer haemorrhage, gastric  ulcer  perforation,  gastritis,  gastritis  erosive,  gastritis  haemorrhagic,  haemorrhagic  erosive gastritis, necrotizing gastritis, reflux gastritis and ulcerative gastritis These reports described patients who had received at least one dose of pembrolizumab in a clinical trial, or as a marketed drug. Overall, most reports were from clinical trials (75 serious, 1 non-serious), 21 reports were from non-interventional studies (17 serious and 4 non-serious) and 46 reports were spontaneous (42 serious and 4 non-serious) cases. The median age was 65.3 years, and most (83) reports were from male subjects. The median time to onset of the event was 129 days, with a range from 3 days to 1111 days.

Melanoma was the most common indication reported with 39 reports, followed by NSCLC (36), gastric and head and neck cancers (9 each). This distribution roughly reflects the composition of the clinical development population studied,  and  currently  labelled  indications  for  Keytruda.  Review  of  the  128 reports without biopsy did not suggest features concerning for an association with pembrolizumab. Most reports did include endoscopic descriptions of erythema, but this is a non-specific finding and cannot be interpreted as evidence of an immune-mediated process. As noted above, histopathology is critical for confirming  an  inflammatory  process;  therefore,  only  reports  that  contained  biopsy  results  were considered  evaluable  for  a  possible  immune-mediated  etiology.  Of  the  15  reports  that  included  a description of histopathology of the stomach, 7 reports contained insufficient information to reasonably conclude a causal association with pembrolizumab. Three reports attributed the gastric event with other medical conditions: 2 reports described progression of metastatic disease and one report described a severe H. pylori infection. Two reports were confounded by concomitant use of NSAIDs or cytotoxic chemotherapy medications. Two reports were confounded by critical illness, and one report described a patient who recovered without corticosteroid treatment, suggesting a non-immune process. Reports with biopsy results are summarized below in Table 1. Of 11 reports which described outcomes, all subjects recovered or were recovering at the time of the report. Four subjects continued pembrolizumab treatment without interruption; three of these reports included outcome, which was recovered or recovering at the time of the report.

## Summary

In the MAH's cumulative review of adverse events of PTs reported under the MedDRA HLTs of gastritis and gastric and duodenal ulcer, the clear majority of 143 reports described gastritis or gastric ulcer based on endoscopy alone, without tissue biopsy. It is not possible to ascribe an immune-mediated etiology to these events. Of the 15 reports which included biopsy results, confounding factors, reasonable alternative explanations (such as other medications, H.pylori infection, metastatic disease or critical illness), or limited information to rule out common explanations, including H.pylori and celiac disease precluded drawing a conclusion that pembrolizumab was primarily or causally associated with the clinical events reported.

The referenced article (Collins et al., 2017) is also difficult to interpret, and does not provide satisfactory information to implicate pembrolizumab in events of immune-mediated gastritis. The paper describes upper GI tract inflammation in 4 patients exposed to PD-1 inhibitor therapy, either pembrolizumab or nivolumab, but does not specify which treatment the 2 patients with gastric biopsy results received. None of the 4 cases described information regarding prior history of GI disease, or description of testing/results for  H.pylori  or  celiac  disease.  Though  NSAID  use  was  denied  in  all  4  patients,  other  concomitant medication exposure (including chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) was not described except to note  that  ipilimumab  was  not  concurrently  given.  The  report  lacked  convincing  evidence  that  other pathologic  processes  were  excluded  before  concluding  that  the  disease  process  with  lymphocytic infiltration of the stomach was due to pembrolizumab and could not be attributed to other causes.

Therefore, upon review of the totality of currently available information the MAH asserts that there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that pembrolizumab is causally associated with events of inflammatory gastritis or gastric ulcer. Therefore, no changes to the Company Core Data Sheet, or the SmPC are warranted at this time. The MAH continues to closely monitor all serious adverse event reports, especially reports of potentially immunemediated events using a vigorous pharmacovigilance system that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

includes both individual case report review, literature review and quarterly aggregate analyses of data, and will report any confirmed safety signals to regulatory authorities as required.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

As requested, the MAH performed a revision of the cases of gastric ulcer across the whole (adult) safety database from all sources, following the observation during the assessment of this procedure of a SAE of gastric ulcer grade 3 with stomach biopsy revealing inflammatory infiltration. The MAH did not further discuss this case, which was however considered drug-related by investigator.

According to this review, made using MedDRA High Level Term (HLT) categories for 'Gastric ulcers and perforations' and 'gastritis', the reporting rate for gastritis was 0.6% (n=54) and of gastric ulcer 0.1% (n=13) for pembrolizumab monotherapy. A total of 143 cases were evaluated. Of those, 76 were from clinical  trials  (75  serious  and  1  non-serious),  21  from  non-interventional  studies  (17  serious  and  4 non-serious) and 46 from spontaneous report (42 serious and 4 non-serious). The MAH considered as evaluable for  a  possible  immune  related  aetiology  only  15  cases  which  had  biopsy  report  available. According  to  the  MAH's  assessment,  7  cases  lack  sufficient  information  to  conclude  on  a  causal relationship  with  pembrolizumab,  2  cases  described  progressive  disease,  2  were  confounded  by concomitant NSAID/cytotoxic chemotherapy and 2 confounded by critical illness, 1 was associated with H.Pylori  infection  and  1  case  recovered  without  corticosteroids.  The  MAH  concluded  that  there  is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that pembrolizumab is causally associated with events of inflammatory gastritis or gastric ulcer, and does not consider changes of the SmPC warranted.

It is agreed that several cases lack of sufficient information or present confounding factors, although a relation with pembrolizumab cannot be excluded for most of them. The spontaneous report [case number redacted] describes a case of gastritis in a subject with metastatic melanoma, who performed a gastric biopsy after one month of pembrolizumab showing lymphocytic gastritis, which was not evident from a biopsy taken two months before starting pembrolizumab. IHC for H.Pylori was negative in both biopsies. The outcome of this event is 'unknown'. The MAH stated that information on prior GI or autoimmune history was not provided, as well as further infectious or autoimmune diagnostic work-up. Based on the available data, this case is highly suggestive of a possible causal relationship of pembrolizumab with gastritis, acknowledging the lack of some information on possible concomitant alternative explanations.

Given the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, it is considered also that there is biological plausibility in the possible induction of inflammatory gastritis/gastric ulcer. Further, gastritis and duodenal ulcers are reported as ADRs for nivolumab.

It is noted that the signal of gastrointestinal ulcer is included in the PRAC agenda of June 2019 published on EMA website

(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/agenda/agenda-prac-draft-agenda-meeting-11-14-june-2 019\\_en.pdf)

Conclusion: issue not further pursued within this procedure.

## Signal of gastrointestinal ulcer is currently under discussion by the PRAC.

## Conclusion

- Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly
- No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

## Question 2

The MAH concluded in the SmPC that 'the safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab', however no supporting data to appropriately compare the safety of paediatric to adult patients have been found. The MAH is requested to provide the paediatric safety in KEYNOTE-051 with (please use the safety tables reported in the AR and report side by side the frequencies included in the most recent RSD of pembrolizumab monotherapy in adult patients). If relevant higher frequencies in single items are found in the paediatric compared to adult population, those should be discussed and, if appropriate, reflected in the SmPC. (OC)

## Summary of the MAH's response

The MAH provided the requested paediatric data for adverse events compared with the pembrolizumab EU reference safety dataset (RSD), which is an internally validated dataset that includes adverse event data for the adult studies KEYNOTE-001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; KEYNOTE-002 (original phase), KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE- 012, KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 3, KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-040, KEYNOTE-045, KEYNOTE-052, KEYNOTE-054, KEYNOTE-055, and KEYNOTE-087.

The overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, including drug-related adverse events, in the KEYNOTE-051 population was similar compared with the RSD. The most frequent drug-related adverse events in KEYNOTE-051 were anemia, fatigue, lymphocyte count decreased and pyrexia, consistent with what might be anticipated in a paediatric population or with the underlying disease conditions (See Tables 4,5 and 8). Overall, the rates of AEs and adverse events of special interest (AEOSI) in tables 10 and 11 reported in KEYNOTE-051 were comparable to those observed in the adult population treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy represented by the RSD. No new immunemediated events were identified in the paediatric population.

The Applicant is of the opinion that these data support the proposed statement in section 4.8 that 'the safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab'.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column.

A bolded term or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included. MedDRA preferred terms \"Neoplasm Progression\", \"Malignant Neoplasm Progression\" and \"Disease Progression\" not related to the drug are excluded.

§ Includes all subjects who received at least one dose of MK-3475 in KN001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3; KN002 (original phase), KN006, KN010, KN012 HNSCC, KN013 Cohort 3, KN024, KN040, KN045, KN052, KN054, KN055 and KN087.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH has provided the requested comparative tables (KN-051 in paediatrics vs RSD in adults). The overall incidence of (all causality and drug related) AEs, G3-5 AEs, SAE and AEOSI was similar in KN-051 compared to RSD. No new immune-mediated events have been reported in the paediatric population. Based on the available data, and taking into account the limited number of paediatric subjects (154 paediatrics vs 4,948 adults), the statement 'the safety profile in these paediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adults treated with pembrolizumab' proposed by the MAH for inclusion in section 4.8 of the SmPC is agreed.
