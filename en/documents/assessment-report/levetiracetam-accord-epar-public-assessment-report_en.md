## 2 Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

Levetiracetam Accord is a generic medicinal product containing levetiracetam as active substance. Four strengths  have  been  developed;  250  mg,  500  mg,  750  mg  and  1000  mg  film-coated  tablets.  The reference medicinal product Keppra has been centrally authorized on 29 September 2000 and exists as film-coated tablets of 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg and as oral solution (100 mg/ml) and as concentrate for solution for infusion (100 mg/ml).

Levetiracetam is a chemical entity related to piracetam, a nootropic drug. Initial research was directed primarily  towards  indications  where  piracetam  and  piracetam-like  compounds  had  shown  to  be  of potential benefit (cognition, anxiety disorders). When the particular antiepileptic profile of the drug was recognised, its development was oriented towards epilepsy as a new indication in 1991.

The precise mechanism of action by which levetiracetam confers seizure protection is unknown, but it appears to be unrelated to the mechanisms identified for current antiepileptic drugs.

Levetiracetam is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy.

The efficacy and safety of levetiracetam has been demonstrated in several well-controlled studies. A summary of these studies can be found in the EPAR of the reference product Keppra.

According  to  the  legislation  the  applicant  shall  not  be  required  to  provide  the  results  of  pre-clinical tests  and  clinical  trials  if  he  can  demonstrate  that  the  medicinal  product  is  a  generic  of  a  reference product, which is authorised for 6/10 years in a EU member state or in the Community. Bioequivalence to the reference product Keppra was demonstrated by a one single dose bioequivalence study under fasting conditions for the 1000 mg tablet. The study was performed in healthy volunteers.

The  indication  proposed  for  Levetiracetam  Accord  is  identical  to  the  indication  of  the  reference medicinal product.

The therapeutic indication of Levetiracetam Accord is:

Levetiracetam is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Levetiracetam is indicated as adjunctive therapy

-  in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.
-  in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.
-  in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.

Levetiracetam Accord is presented in seven pack sizes; 10, 20, 30, 50, 60, 100, and 200 film-coated tablets for each strength; 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg. At the time of the CHMP opinion, the 10 tablets pack size does not exist for the 250 mg and 750 mg strength of the reference product. Nevertheless, the proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use.

The applicant applied for a combined printed package leaflet. During its plenary meeting in November 2010, the Name Review group (NRG) agreed to that request.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## 2.2.1 Introduction

Levetiracetam Accord is presented as film-coated tablets containing the active substance levetiracetam. Four strengths have been developed: 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg. Other ingredients are defined in the SmPC, section 6.1. The different strengths can be distinguished by the tablet colour and debossing. The tablets are packed in PVC-aluminium blisters.

Levetiracetam is an established active substance of chemical origin and is described in the European Pharmacopoeia. The ASMF procedure is used and declarations from the Qualified Person have been provided to confirm the active substance is manufactured in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).

## 2.2.2 Active  Substance

This  medicinal  product  contains  as  active  substance  levetiracetam  INN,  chemical  name  (2S)-2-(2Oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)butanamide. The molecular formula is C8H14N2O2 Mol.Wt. 170.21 g/mol. Levetiracetam  appears  as  a  white  or  almost  white  powder  and  is  very  soluble  in  water,  soluble  in acetonitrile and practically insoluble in hexane.

Levetiracetam is not hygroscopic. It exhibits isomerism due to the presence of one chiral center, and does not present polymorphism.

## Manufacture

At the time of the CHMP opinion, the active substance used for Levetiracetam Accord is supplied by one active substance manufacturer. Because no Ph.Eur. certificate of suitability has been issued for the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier, detailed information about the manufacturing process, control of starting materials, reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and intermediates and process development and process validation of the active substance has been supplied in the form of  an  active  substance  master  file  (ASMF).  The  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  described. Adequate in  process  controls  are  in  place  and  appropriate  specifications  have  been  adopted  for  the starting  materials,  solvents  and  reagents.  All  relevant  impurities,  degradation  products  and  residual solvents  have  been  appropriately  characterized.  The  applicant  confirmed  the  structure  of  the levetiracetam  by 1 H  NMR, 13 C  NMR  and  MS.  The  molecular  weight  was  determined  by  elemental analysis. The consistency of crystalline form of levetiracetam is checked by XRD analysis. Statements from the Qualified Persons of the finished product manufacturers confirming that the manufacturing of the active substance is performed in compliance with current EU GMP or ICH Q7A were provided.

## Specification

There is a Ph.Eur. monograph for levetiracetam and hence the active substance is tested according to the Ph.Eur monograph, complemented with in-house tests and specifications defined by the applicant. The active substance specifications include tests as: appearance, solubility, identification (IR, optical rotation, enantiomeric purity), appearance of solution, water, sulphated ash, heavy metals, enantiomeric purity (HPLC), related substances and assay (HPLC), residual solvents, triethylamine and particle size.

The specifications and tests proposed by the applicant are compliant with the relevant ICH guidelines and  Ph.Eur.  In-house  methods  have  been  adequately  validated.  The  specifications  are  adequate  to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.

Batch analysis data (certificates of analysis) have been provided on at least two production batches of levetiracetam  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier.  All  batches  were  in  compliance  with  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

predefined  active  substance  specifications  and  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  active substance manufacture.

## Stability

The  active  substance  levetiracetam  is  packaged  in  packaging  materials  that  comply  with  Directive 2002/72/EC  and  Ph.Eur.  and  is  safe  for  use  in  contact  with  food  stuffs  and  pharmaceuticals.  The container closure system is described in sufficient detail and the packaging materials are acceptable.

Stability studies on the active substance have been performed at long term (30±2°C/65±5% RH) and accelerated (40±2°C/75±5% RH) conditions on three production scale batches as per ICH Guidelines. Up to 3 years of long term stability data, and up to 6 months of accelerated stability data has been provided,  confirming  the  stability  of  the  active  substance.  Up  to  5  years  long  term  stability  data  is available  for  several  smaller  batches.  All  batches  have  been  tested  for  conformance  with  the specifications using stability  indicating analytical methods. In all cases the batch analysis data met the predefined specifications and no significant trends were observed. The packaging used in stability trials is  representative for the one proposed for storage and distribution. Every year one production batch will be put under long-term stability program.

Forced degradation studies have been performed. Samples were exposed to NaOH, HCl and H2O2 light. From this study, it can be concluded that degradation takes place, leading to an increased amount of impurities. However, no degradation was observed during photolytic treatment (24 hours exposure to direct sun light).

The stability data provided support the proposed retest period in the proposed packaging and under the proposed storage conditions.

## 2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The  applicant's  objective  was  to  develop  a  generic  equivalent  to  the  European  reference  product Keppra film-coated tablets containing 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg levetiracetam. The aim was  to  develop  generic  film-coated  tablets  which  are  bioequivalent  with  the  reference  product  and demonstrate to be robust and stable, having a dissolution profile matching with the reference product.

Levetiracetam  Accord  film-coated  tablets  contain  partially  the  same  excipients  as  the  reference medicinal  product  Keppra.  A  compatibility  study  demonstrated  that  the  chosen  excipients  are compatible with the active substance. The core of the Keppra tablet is made of croscarmellose sodium, macrogol  6000,  silica  colloidal  anhydrous  and  magnesium  stearate.  The  core  of  the  Levetiracetam Accord  tablet  contains  povidone  K-30  instead  of  macrogol  6000.  Like  the  reference  product,  the Levetiracetam Accord tablets are film-coated, but the composition of the coating is not always exactly the  same  as  for  Keppra.  All  excipients  used  in  the  tablet  core  comply  with  the  Ph.Eur.  and  are commonly used in this type of formulation. The excipients used in the film-coating, and which are not Ph.Eur  grade,  are  of  adequate  quality.  The  generic  formulation  is  not  considered  to  be  significantly different from the originator's formulation.

During  the  development,  the  applicant  investigated  the  reference  product  Keppra  for  chemical characteristics  i.e.  assay,  related  substances  and  dissolution  profile.  The  product  development  work was  initiated  with  the  1000  mg  strength  and  the  lower  strengths  were  developed  to  be  dose proportional. The development aimed at achieving satisfactory physical tablet parameters like hardness, friability and disintegration time after film-coating.

Comparative multimedia dissolution profiles between test and reference product are presented for the 4  strengths:  the  dissolution  profiles  of  the  test  and  reference  product  are  comparable  in  all  tested media  (purified  water,  0.1  N  HCl,  pH  4.5  acetate  buffer  and  pH  6.8  phosphate  buffer).  It  can  be concluded that the Levetiracetam Accord and Keppra film-coated tablets have equivalent release of the active substance.

Levetiracetam Accord film-coated tablets were developed in four different strengths, i.e. 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg. The bioequivalence study was performed with the 1000 mg tablet. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

applicant fulfilled the requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1) and extrapolated the results of the bioequivalence study performed on the 1000 mg strength to three lower strengths; 250 mg, 500 mg and 1000 mg. Appropriate in vitro dissolution data confirmed the adequacy of waiving additional in vivo bioequivalence testing.

## Adventitious agents

A  TSE  declaration  was  submitted  to  confirm  that  magnesium  stearate  is  of  vegetable  origin.  The excipients used do not contain and are not derived from any category A or B as defined in the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and  Veterinary  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA/410/01  Rev.  2).  The  TSE/BSE  free  certification  from  the supplier of drug substances and all the excipients is provided.

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process is a standard process for film-coated tablets. All critical process parameters have  been  identified  and  controlled  by  appropriate  in  process  controls.  The  test  methods  and acceptance  criteria  are  adequately  chosen  to  ensure  that  the  drug  product  will  comply  with  the specification limits. A detailed manufacturing description and flow scheme have been provided.

Process  validation  has  been  carried  out  on  three  consecutive  commercial  scale  batches  of  each strength.  The  results  obtained  indicate  that  the  manufacturing  process  for  the  levetiracetam  filmcoated  tablets  is  capable  of  consistently  producing  tablets  that  meet  the  quality  and  release specifications as detailed in the finished product specifications

## Product Specification

The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  tests  for  description,  average  tablet  weight, identification (HPLC,  IR,  TiO2), uniformity of dosage  units, dissolution (HPLC),  assay,  related substances  and  degradation  products  (HPLC),  microbiological  tests  and  subdivision  of  tablets.  The finished product specifications are standard for film-coated tablets. The proposed test procedures and acceptance  criteria  comply  with  the  ICH  guidelines  and  the  general  requirements  of  the  Ph.Eur.  All tests  included  in  the  specification  have  been  satisfactorily  described  and  validated.  Appropriate  data have  been  presented  to  justify  the  release  specifications  for  each  quality  characteristic  that  is controlled. Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety.

Batch analysis data (certificates of analysis) are provided for three commercial scale batches of each strength, produced with active substance from the proposed supplier. The batches were manufactured according to the proposed manufacturing process and packed in the packaging material as proposed for  the  market.  Batch  analysis  results  comply  with  the  predefined  specifications  and  confirm consistency &amp; uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

## Stability of the product

Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  under  long  term  (25±2°C/60±5%RH)  and  accelerated (40±2°C/75±5% RH) conditions, on three commercial scale batches of each strength according to the ICH requirements. Up to 36 months long term and up to 6 months accelerated stability data have been provided.

The stability samples have been tested for description, related substances, assay, dissolution, microbial contamination and breakability. The specifications and test methods used were identical to those for batch release. The methods used for assay and related substances were proven as stability indicating. The stability batches have been manufactured at the proposed site of finished product manufacture, according to the proposed process and using the active substance obtained from the proposed active substance manufacturer. Stability tests have been carried out in the packaging proposed for marketing. During  accelerated  and  long  term  stability  studies,  all  the  tested  parameters  were  within  shelf  life acceptance criteria and no significant trend was observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition  to  the  above,  a  long  term  bulk  stability  study  was  performed  on  two  commercial  scale batches for each strength. The same parameters as above were tested and all were within shelf life acceptance criteria and no significant trend was observed.

Furthermore,  a  forced  degradation  study  was  carried  out  by  water,  acid  and  base  hydrolysis,  by oxidative degradation, thermal degradation and UV light degradation to proof the stability indicating capacity of the test methods.

Finally, a photostability study was carried out as per ICH guidelines on a 1000 mg tablet batch. The tablets  were  either  packed  in  PVC/Alu  blister  (immediate  pack)  or  in  PVC/Alu  blister  into  carton (marketing pack). The samples were tested after total exposure to UV and visible light and the results indicate that the product is photostable in the proposed pack.

As part of the stability commitment, the applicant committed that at least one batch of Levetiracetam Accord film-coated tablets will be placed on stability annually.

In conclusion, the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.

## 2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Levetiracetam Accord 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg film-coated tablets is a generic product for Keppra film-coated tablets, containing very similar excipients to Keppra.

The quality of the active substance is adequately controlled and all excipients comply with the Ph.Eur. or meet adequate specifications. The finished product manufacturing process shows to be capable of consistently producing tablets that meet the finished product specifications and appropriate packaging is used to ensure the product remains stable within the agreed shelf-life.

## 2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and medicinal product has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

The quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues which could have an impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product.

## 2.2.6 Recommendations for future quality development

Not applicable.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1 Introduction

A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need  to  generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

## 2.3.2 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  was  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the introduction of Levetiracetam Accord is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all levetiracetam containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. The CHMP agreed with this justification.

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## 2.4.1 Introduction

This  is  an  application  for  film-coated  tablets  containing  levetiracetam.  To  support  the  marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted one single dose bioequivalence study under fasting conditions with the 1000 mg dosage strength.  This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of levetiracetam film-coated tablets based on published literature; this was considered acceptable. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

No  formal  scientific  advice  by  the  CHMP  was  given  for  this  medicinal  product.  For  the  clinical assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is of particular relevance.

## GCP

The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  the  clinical  trial  conducted  outside  the community was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd. has been inspected by WHO and national authorities over the period between 2004 and 2009 and was found compliant with ICH GCP requirements.

## Exemption

Four different strengths of levetiracetam tablets (250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg) have been developed. All  four  strengths  are  scale-up/scale  down  formulations  with  ratio  of  active  substance  to  excipients remaining the same for all strengths.

The application of the four dosage strengths is based on the bioequivalence study with Levetiracetam 1000 mg film-coated tablets, Accord Healthcare Ltd.

This is considered acceptable, i.e. the bioequivalence can be established with only the 1000 mg dosage strength as all conditions specified in section 4.1.6 of the Note for guidance on the Investigation of Bioequivalence are fulfilled:

a) The products Levetiracetam Accord 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg &amp; 1000 mg are manufactured by the same manufacturing process and manufacturing site;

b) The qualitative composition of all the four strengths is the same;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

c) The formulation of all the four strengths is dose proportional;

d) In-vitro dissolution profiles are comparable between the strength used in BE study and additional strengths at the three pHs (1.0, 4.5 and 6.8). Release of more than 85% after 15 minutes;

e) Linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic range 1 .

## Clinical studies

To support the application, the applicant has submitted one single dose bioequivalence study under fasting conditions conducted in 2007 (study n°094-07).

## 2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics

## Methods

## Study design

The study was an open-label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, twoway cross-over, single oral dose, comparative oral BE study of Levetiracetam Accord 1000 mg filmcoated tablets in comparison with Keppra 1000 mg film-coated tablets in healthy adult human subjects aged between 18-55 years under fasting conditions.

Subjects were administered a single dose of either the test or reference study medication, as a 1 x 1000 mg tablet with 240 ml of  water. Single dose of either of the investigational medicinal products was administered orally to each subject (except for the discontinued subjects) in each period. A washout  period  of  five  days  was  maintained  between  the  successive  dosing  days.  Equal  allocation  of treatment sequence was carried out as per the randomisation schedule.

The sampling schedule was planned to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of absorption. 24 blood samples were collected from each subject during each period to analyze the pharmacokinetic profile of the test and of the reference drug.

A total of 1355 blood samples were collected during the study. 23 blood samples from each subject were  collected  during  each  period.  The  samples  were  collected  prior  to  drug  administration  and  at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1,25 1.50,  1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 36.00 and 48.00 hours following the drug administration in each period.

## Test and reference products

Levetiracetam Accord 1 x 1000 mg tablet manufactured by Intas Pharma Ltd., Matoda, India (Batch n°H2694, expiry date: March 2009, batch size: 110 000 tablets) was compared to Keppra 1 x 1000 mg tablet  manufactured  by  UCB  Pharma  S.A.,  Belgium  (Batch  n°29258/1,  expiry  date:  October  2009). Keppra 1000 mg tablets are registered via centralised procedure (EU/1/00/146).

The Certificates of analysis (test and reference products) complied with the acceptance specifications. The assayed content of the batch used as test product did not differ more than 5 % from that of the batch  used  as  reference  product  (101.9%  and  99.7%  for  Levetiracetam  Accord  and  Keppra, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Population studied

The sample size was determined based on an intra-subject variability of approximately 16% (based on in-house  estimates),  a  T/R  ratio  of  90-110%,  a  significance  level  of  5%,  a  power  of  &gt;  80%  and bioequivalence limits of 80-125%. Based on the above estimates, a sample size of 30 subjects was considered to be sufficient to establish bioequivalence with adequate power.

Healthy male volunteers, aged between 18-55 years, with BMI between 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 , having no significant  diseases  or  clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  values  during  screening,  medical history,  clinical  examination,  chest  X-ray  or  ECG  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  A  total  of  32  subjects including two additional subjects were checked in for the trial. Two additional subjects were checked in for the trial in order to account for any dropouts prior to dosing in period I. As per the protocol, 30 subjects were dosed in period I of the trial. One subject discontinued from the trial on his own accord prior to dosing in period I and was replaced by one of the two additional subjects. Two other subjects discontinued from the trial on their own accord. 27 subjects completed the clinical phase of the trial successfully. The plasma samples of these 27 subjects who completed the clinical phase of the trial and the  plasma  samples  of  one  subject,  who  was  withdrawn  from  the  trial  on  medical  grounds,  were analysed as per the requirement of the protocol.

## Analytical methods

The plasma concentrations of levetiracetam in the study samples were quantified by a validated HPLC method.  Concerning  validation  of  the  bioanalytical  method,    information  on  linearity,  accuracy  and precision,  recovery,  robustness,  selectivity,  dilution  integrity,  matrix  effect,  short  and  long  term stability was provided in the dossier. The CHMP considered that these characteristics were described correctly and within the acceptance specifications as applicable. The analytical method used was shown to  be  sensitive,  accurate  and  selective  for  the  plasma  level  determination  of  levetiracetam  in  the concentration range of 1.006-40.001 µg/ml. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.006 µg/ml of plasma. Concentrations below the lower limit of quantification were considered non-quantifiable.

The  validation  report  provided  results  of  short-  and  long-term  (storing  for  489  days  in  the  freezer maintained  at  -22  ±  5°C  and  at  -65±  5°C)  stability  data.  The  study  sample  storage  period  from collection until the completion of analysis was 26 days). Considering the long-term stability data, the maximal sample storage period was covered.

Dilution integrity for levetiracetam was  evaluated by preparing samples  with 3-4 times the concentrations  of  the  highest  standard.  A  sample  of  levetiracetam  having  concentration  of  128.035 µg/ml was prepared in plasma and this was diluted to 1/5 and 1/10 of the original concentration. The percent accuracy of the dilution integrity samples was within the acceptance criteria of 85-115% of nominal.  The  CHMP  considered  that  dilution  integrity  was  correctly  evaluated  with  an  analyte concentration well above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ).

The chromatographic system was tested in order to evaluate the possibility of carry-over. The carryover experiment was performed and no carry-over was observed at the retention time and transition of levetiracetam and zonisamide.

A  total  of  1312  samples  were  analyzed  during  the  study.  A  total  of  20  re-analyses  of  individual analyses  were  carried  out  in  duplicate  in  the  study  for  the  following  reasons:  13  samples  were reanalyzed  due  to  concentrations  above  the  highest  standard,  six  samples  were  reanalyzed  due  to elimination  of  low  calibration  curve  standard  and  one  sample  was  reanalyzed  due  to  significant variation  in  response  of  the  internal  standard.  The  criteria  for  rejection  of  individual  samples  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analytical reasons were considered acceptable, in accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1.)

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  from  the  drug-concentration-time  profile  by  noncompartmental  model  using  WinNonlin  Professional  Software-Version  5.0.1  (Pharsight  Corporation, USA) for levetiracetam.

The following standard PK parameters were calculated: peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to last measurable concentration (AUC0-t) and area extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf ).

## Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics was computed and reported for all pharmacokinetic parameters of levetiracetam.

ANOVA, two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, power and ratio analysis for un-transformed and lntransformed pharmacokinetic parameters C max ,  AUC 0-t and AUC 0-inf were computed for Levetiracetam using PROC MIXED of SAS Release 9.1.3. (SAS Institute Inc., USA).

ANOVA model included sequence, formulation and period as fixed effects and subject (sequence) as a random effect. An F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the model at a significance level of 5% (alpha=0.05).

Formulation,  period,  and  sequence  effects  for  ln-transformed  data  were  found  to  be  statistically insignificant.

The 90% parametric confidence intervals were calculated for the un-transformed and ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters, C max , AUC 0-t and AUC 0-inf of levetiracetam.

Intra-subject  variability  and  power  were  calculated  for  un-transformed  and  ln-transformed  PK parameters.

Bioequivalence  of  Test  Product-B  vs.  Reference  Product-A  was  concluded,  if  the  90%  confidence interval fell within the acceptance range of 80-125% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC 0-t for levetiracetam.

The  90%  confidence  intervals  around  the  geometric  means  ratio  T/R  for  levetiracetam  were  in  the acceptance range of 80-125% for the primary parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.

Therefore, the bioequivalence under fasting conditions between Levetiracetam Accord 1000 mg tablets and Keppra 1000 mg tablets can be considered as demonstrated.

## Safety data

All subjects except for those who discontinued were exposed to 1000 mg of levetiracetam once in each period as per the randomisation schedule with a wash-out period of five days between the successive dosing days. A total of nine adverse events were reported during the conduct of the trial. One adverse event occurred prior to dosing in Period I, two adverse events occurred during Period I, four adverse events  occurred  during  wash-out  of  period  I  and  two  adverse  events  occurred  in  Period  II.  All  the adverse events were mild in nature, except for one, which was moderate in nature. All adverse events were resolved. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported during the conduct of the trial.

## 2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics

No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this application.

## 2.4.4 Additional data

Not applicable.

## 2.4.5 Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

## 2.4.6 Discussion on Clinical aspects

To support this application the applicant submitted one bioequivalence study with a randomised, twotreatment,  two-period,  two-sequence,  single  oral  dose,  crossover  design  comparing  Levetiracetam Accord 1000 mg film-coated tablets with Keppra 1000 mg film-coated tablets in healthy adult human subjects under fasting conditions.

The bioequivalence study was conducted according to the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioequivalence,  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1.  The  study  design,  sample  size,  and  statistical methods are appropriate.  The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of geometric means are well in the  acceptance  range  of  80-125%  for  the  primary  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  for levetiracetam.  Bioequivalence can be concluded between Levetiracetam Accord 1000 mg tablets and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Keppra 1000 mg tablets with respect to rate and extent of absorption. The extrapolation to the other dosage strengths is acceptable.

A single dose bioequivalence study is considered sufficient since the application concerns an immediate release  formulation.    Steady  state  studies  are  not  indicated  as  no  accumulation  is  expected,  and bioavailability is not affected by repeated doses.

There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported during the conduct of the trial. All adverse events,  except  for  one  which  was  moderate,  were  mild  in  nature  and  resolved.  The  safety  of levetiracetam  is  well  documented  and  both  test  and  reference  products  are  expected  to  have  a comparable safety profile.

## 2.4.7 Conclusions on clinical aspects

Based on the presented bioequivalence study Levetiracetam Accord is considered bioequivalent with Keppra.

The  results  of  study  BE  study  n°094-07  with  1000  mg  formulation  can  be  extrapolated  to  other strengths  250,  500,  750  mg,  in  accordance  with  conditions  in  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, section 4.1.6.

## 3 Benefit-Risk Balance

This application concerns a generic version of levetiracetam film-coated tablets. The reference product Keppra  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Keppra is indicated as adjunctive therapy

- in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.

- in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.

- in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.

The indication of Levetiracetam Accord film-coated tablets is identical to the indication of Keppra filmcoated tablets.

From a quality perspective, Levetiracetam Accord 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg film-coated tablets  contain  very  similar  excipients  to  Keppra.  The  quality  of  the  active  substance  is  adequately controlled  and  all  excipients  comply  with  the  Ph.Eur.  or  meet  adequate  specifications.  The  finished product manufacturing process shows to be capable of consistently producing tablets that meet the finished product specifications and appropriate packaging is used to ensure the product remains stable within the agreed shelf-life.

No non-clinical studies have been provided for this generic application but an adequate summary of the available non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.

From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics or efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient.

A  bioequivalence  study  with  an  open-label,  balanced,  randomised,  two-treatment,  two-period,  twosequence, single oral dose, crossover design in healthy adult human subjects under fasting conditions constitutes the basis for this application. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of  dose,  sampling  points,  overall  sampling  time  as  well  as  the  wash-out  period  was  adequate.  The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.

The test  formulation  of  Levetiracetam  Accord  1000  mg  film-coated  tablets  met  the  protocol-defined criteria  for  bioequivalence  when  compared  with  the  Keppra  1000  mg  film-coated  tablets.  The  point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0- ,  and  C max were  all contained  within  the  protocol-defined  acceptance  range  of  80.00  to  125.00%  after  single  dose administration. Test and reference formulations can be considered as bioequivalent with respect to rate and extent of absorption.

A  single  dose  bioequivalence  study  was  considered  sufficient  since  the  application  concerns  an immediate release formulation.  Steady state studies are not indicated as no accumulation is expected, and bioavailability is not affected by repeated doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall benefit-risk assessment is considered to be positive, since no new indication or population is claimed and reference is made to the innovator product for the benefits and risks of levetiracetam. Levetiracetam is considered a safe and effective antiepileptic drug with well established use for the treatment of various forms of epilepsy, this being supported by experience with marketed levetiracetam in a large number of patients. Thus, the CHMP considered there is sufficient support for concluding on a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information. The information and warnings contained in the product information on the possible adverse effects of levetiracetam are adequate to minimise risk in  special  patient  groups  and  to  ensure  the  safe  administration  of  levetiracetam.  Clinical  evidence supports  the  use  of  levetiracetam  in  the  treatment  of  different  types  of  seizures  in  patients  with epilepsy, as listed in the SmPC.

## 4 Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Levetiracetam Accord in the following indications:
