## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The MAH submitted the immunogenicity and safety data from study 6114A1-4000-CN (B1841008): A phase 4, open-label trial to  assess  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  Prevenar  in  older infants and young children in China who are naïve to previous pneumococcal vaccination.

Immunogenicity and safety data were discussed in sufficient detail by the MAH and do not warrant further investigation.

No SmPC and PL changes are proposed. II. RECOMMENDATION 1 No further action required. III. INTRODUCTION On June 24 2013 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Prevenar and that there is no consequential regulatory action. IV. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study Suspension for injection identical to the currently approved pharmaceutical formulation. Clinical aspects 1. Introduction The MAH submitted a final report for: Study 6114A1-4000-CN (B1841008); A phase 4, open-label trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Prevenar in older infants and young children in China who are naïve to previous pneumococcal vaccination. The data in this report include the 12 month follow up following completion of vaccination. 2. Clinical study Study 6114A1-4000-CN (B1841008): A phase 4, open-label trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Prevenar in older infants and young children in China who are naïve to previous pneumococcal vaccination.  Description Prevenar  was  approved  in  China  in  May  2008  for  immunization  against  IPD  in  infants  and  young children. Based on Chinese data on pneumococcal disease and nasopharyngeal carriage, Prevenar is likely to protect Chinese infants from a large proportion of IPD. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Furthermore, as the majority of serotypes responsible for IPD are likely to be penicillin resistant, use of Prevenar may help to decrease rates of PRSP in the population. Prevenar is also approved in China for catch-up  vaccinations  in  previously  unvaccinated  older  infants  and  young  children  aged  7  months through  5  years.  The  present  study  is  being  conducted  as  part  of  the  Prevenar  post-approval commitment to provide safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data on Prevenar catch-up

vaccinations in older infants and young children in China. It also addresses requests for data on serum antibody concentrations in unvaccinated children.

##  Methods

- Objective(s)

## Primary objectives

- To  assess  the  serotype-specific  pneumococcal  immune  responses  induced  by  Prevenar when measured 1 month after the last dose of Prevenar in each age group.

Sample size estimation was based on the variation in IgG first use concentrations observed in previous Prevenar studies (D118-P16 and P18) and in the 13vPnC clinical program (Studies 6096A1-003, 004, 006,  007,  008,  009,  011,  500,  501,  3000,  3002,  3005,  3007,  and  3008).  Observed  standard deviations (SDs) on the natural logarithmic scale ranged up to 1.15 across the Prevenar serotypes. It is assumed this variability may increase with age. A responder rate of at least 94.9% was assumed for these calculations.

· To assess the pre-vaccination antibody levels to the 7 pneumococcal serotypes in Prevenar in each age group. Secondary objectives · To  assess  the  serotype-specific  pneumococcal  immune  responses  induced  by  Prevenar when measured as follows: · 1 month after the third dose of Prevenar in Group 1. · 1 month after the second dose of Prevenar in Group 2. · 1 month after the first dose of Prevenar in Group 3. · To assess the antibody levels to the 7 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes 12 months after the last dose of Prevenar in each age group. · Study design This was a phase 4, open-label, single center study. A total of 505 healthy Chinese infants and children were planned to be enrolled into 1 of 4 groups based on their age at enrollment as follows: · Group 1 (100 subjects): 121 to &lt;212 days of age and receive 4 doses of Prevenar. · Group 2 (100 subjects): 212 days to &lt;12 months of age (before the first birthday) and receive 3 doses of Prevenar. · Group 3 (125 subjects): 12 to &lt;24 months of age (before the second birthday) and receive 2 doses of Prevenar. · Group 4 (180 subjects): 24 to &lt;72 months of age (before the sixth birthday) and receive 1 dose of Prevenar. Prevenar is the investigational product that was used in this study. It is licensed in China for use in infants  aged  3  to  6  months,  usually  in  a  3-4-5  month  schedule,  and  at  12  to  15  months  of  age. Prevenar is also licensed for use in previously unvaccinated older children aged 7 months to 5 years in China. Pre-vaccination antibody levels to the 7 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes in Prevenar were assessed for each age group. Immune responses to the 7 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes were assessed approximately 1 month after the last dose of Prevenar and will be assessed again approximately 12 months after the last dose of Prevenar for each age group. Immune responses to the 7 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes were also assessed approximately 1 month after the third dose of Prevenar in Group 1, 1 month after the second dose of Prevenar in Group 2, and 1 month after the first dose of Prevenar in Group 3. The approximate duration of subject participation in the study for each age group, including follow-up of antibody persistence up to approximately 12 months after the last dose of Prevenar, was to be as follows: · Group 1 (121 to &lt;212 days of age): up to 24.5 months. · Group 2 (212 days to &lt;12 months of age): up to 23.5 months. · Group 3 (12 to &lt;24 months of age): up to 17.5 months. · Group 4 (24 to &lt;72 months of age): up to 15 months. It is planned that the study will be completed in approximately 29.5 months. The end of the study will be the last visit of the last subject. · Study population /Sample size Medicinal product no longer authorised

A sufficient number of subjects were to be enrolled to ensure approximately 80 subjects for groups 1 and  2,  100  subjects  for  group  3,  and  144  subjects  for  group  4,  provide  safety  and  evaluable immunogenicity data. These sample sizes were estimated to provide estimates of the GMC within 25%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

precision  and  responder  rates  with  5%  precision  in  each  group  separately  using  95%  confidence intervals (CIs). Assuming a dropout rate of at most 20%, 505 subjects overall (100 in groups 1 and 2, 125 in group 3, and 180 in group 4) was considered to be sufficient to ensure the required number of evaluable subjects for immunogenicity and safety analysis.

## · Treatments

Subjects  in  group  1,  group  2,  group  3,  and  group  4  received  4,  3,  2,  and  1  doses  of  Prevenar, respectively, as outlined below:

For  the  immunogenicity  data  from  the  first  three  blood  draws  for  groups  1,  2  and  3  and  the immunogenicity data from the first  two  blood  draws  for  group  4  (not  including  the  immunogenicity data from the 12-month follow-up visit blood draw visit), immunogenicity analyses were performed for 2 populations.

Immunogenicity Evaluation For  all  subjects,  blood  samples  (approximately  5  mL)  were  collected  prior  to  the  first  vaccination, approximately  1  month  after  the  last  dose  of  Prevenar,  and  approximately  12  months  (365  to  410 days) after the last dose of Prevenar. A blood sample was also collected approximately 1 month after the third dose of Prevenar for Group 1, 1 month after the second dose of Prevenar for Group 2, and 1 month after the first dose of Prevenar for Group 3. The total volume of blood collected from each subject was approximately 20 mL for Groups 1, 2, and 3, and 15 mL for Group 4. All  serum  samples  were  shipped  to  Pfizer,  Pearl  River,  New  York,  United  States  of  America.  Serum concentrations  of  anticapsular  IgG  as  measured  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  for  the  7 pneumococcal serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were to be determined in all subjects for each  blood  sample  and  expressed  as  micrograms  per  milliliter  (μg/mL).  The  assay  employs  2 absorbents: a C polysaccharide-containing cell wall extract plus serotype 22F capsular polysaccharide. Safety Evaluation The safety of 7vPnC (Prevenar) in this study was determined based on clinically important related AEs, AEs that require withdrawal, protocol-related AEs, and SAEs observed. Subjects  were  observed  for  at  least  20  minutes  after  each  vaccination  for  any  significant  acute reactions.  Observations  after  vaccination  were  to  be  performed  according  to  local  immunization practice. · Statistical Methods 1. Statistical and Analysis Plans Statistical analysis methods are described briefly here. Detailed information on statistical analyses is provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) dated 23 Apr 2010 and SAP memo dated 12 Jul 2011 in the appendix titled Statistical Analysis Report (SAP included). 2. Statistical Analysis of Demographic Data Demographic  characteristics,  including  gender,  race  and  age  at  the  time  of  first  vaccination  (in months) were summarized by group using descriptive statistics. 3. Statistical Analysis of Immunogenicity 3.1. Immunogenicity Populations Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  consisted  of  eligible  subjects  in  the  age  range  who  had received all the assigned vaccination(s), had blood drawn within required time frames, had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result for the proposed analysis, had received no prohibited vaccines, and had  no  other  major  protocol  violations.  The  all-available  immunogenicity  population  consisted  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  who  had  at  least  1  valid  and  determinate  assay  result  for  the  proposed  analysis.  Both  the evaluable  and  all-available  immunogenicity  populations  were  considered  as  primary  immunogenicity populations.

For the timings of blood draws (except the prevaccination blood draw for Vaccination 1), 1 day before and 14 days after the protocol-specified timings were permitted for determination of evaluability. 3.2. Immunogenicity Analyses

The number and percentage of subjects enrolled and included in each immunogenicity population was tabulated  for  each  group  and  the  total  sample.  The  denominator  for  the  percentages  was  the  total number of subjects in the given group, or the total sample as appropriate. Reasons for exclusion from the immunogenicity population were also summarized using the number and percentage of subjects. Subjects with no assay results for any serotype were classified under 'subjects excluded from the allavailable immunogenicity population' and not under 'no valid or determinate assay result'.



3.2.1. Geometric Means Within each group, geometric means of the pneumococcal IgG antibody concentrations (GMCs) were calculated at each visit that had a blood draw. For all groups, the geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) in antibody  concentration  (postvaccination/prevaccination)  were  summarized  by  geometric  means,  and CIs were also computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. Only subjects with both pre- and postvaccination results were included in the derivation of GMFRs. 3.2.2. Proportion of Subjects Achieving Defined Levels Within each group and for each serotype separately before and after each appropriate vaccination, the proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  antibody  concentration  at  least  as  large  as  0.35  μg/mL  was computed for each blood sample. For each serotype, exact,  unconditional,  2-sided  95%  CIs  on  the proportion were calculated. 3.2.3. Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) are presented graphically by group for each serotypespecific pneumococcal IgG antibody concentration. The RCDCs for each group were plotted pre- and postvaccination IgGs on the same graph, distinguishable by symbol and/or line style choice. 4. Statistical Analysis of Safety 4.1. Safety Population All subjects who received at least 1 dose of Prevenar were included in the safety population. 4.2. Safety Analyses The  safety  of  7vPnC  (Prevenar)  in  this  study  was  determined  based  on  findings  from  clinically important related AEs, AEs that require withdrawal, protocol-related AEs and SAEs. 4.2.1. Physical Examinations Baseline physical examination information was summarized. The number and percentage of subjects enrolled,  and  those  with  each  type  of  finding  (performed  [subcategories:  abnormal,  normal]  or  not performed) for the physical examination were tabulated for each age group or the total sample. The denominator for the percentages was the number in the group or the total sample. 4.2.2. Adverse Events Adverse events were categorized according to MedDRA (version 14.1). The relation between AEs and the study vaccine (7vPnC) was characterized as related or not related as described in the protocol. The severity of AEs was characterized as mild, moderate, or severe. Any deaths were to be included in the last category, namely, severe. In Groups 1 and 2, AEs were to be summarized during the infant series and following  the  toddler  dose  for  each  group  separately.  In  Group  3,  AEs  were  to  be  summarized during  the  2-dose  series  and  in  Group  4,  AEs  were  to  be  summarized  following  vaccination.  All summaries were to be shown, by group, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 event and the number of events. Additional summaries by AE severity and by vaccine relationship were to be produced. All safety analyses were produced for each age group separately. No comparisons were made among the four age groups. Separate  summaries  were  to  be  produced  for  clinically important  related AEs, AEs  requiring withdrawal, protocol related AEs and SAEs.

2.2. Prevaccination Antibody Levels to the 7 Pneumococcal Serotypes in Prevenar 2.2.1. Geometric Mean Concentration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pneumococcal IgG GMCs for groups 1 to 4 prior to first vaccination are presented in Table 24. For all 7 serotypes,  IgG  GMCs  were  generally  higher  in  group  4  than  in  groups  1  through  3,  which  were comparable. However, it was observed that the GMC for serotype 14 in group 1 was notably higher, than in groups 2 and 3 and the GMC for serotype 18C was also slightly higher in group 1; this may be explained by maternal antibodies.

2.3.1.2. Pneumococcal IgG GMCs  (μg/mL)  and  GMFRs  at 12-Month Follow-up Compared  to Prevaccination Pneumococcal  IgG  GMCs  and  GMFRs  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  at  the  12-month follow-up compared to before vaccination are presented in Table 12. For all serotypes, the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR was greater than 1.0, indicating that the IgG GMC was significantly higher at the 12-month follow-up than before vaccination in all groups. Prevaccination IgG GMCs for group 4 were observed higher compared to other groups for the 7 serotypes. This could be explained by prior exposure to S pneumoniae in older subjects. Across the 7 serotypes, the GMFR ranged from 10.06 to 52.86 for group 1, 8.97 to 55.55 for group 2, 7.99 to 88.27 for group 3 and 2.86 to 21.01 for group 4. GMFRs at 12-month follow-up were generally higher in groups 1, 2 and 3 for the majority of serotypes when compared to group 4 as a result of higher prevaccination IgG GMCs.

2.3.1.3. Pneumococcal IgG GMCs (μg/mL) and GMFRs at 12-Month Follow-up Compared to 1 Month after Toddler Dose/Last Vaccination Pneumococcal  IgG  GMCs  and  GMFRs  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  at  the  12-month follow-up compared to 1 month after the toddler dose/last vaccination are presented in Table 13. For all  serotypes,  GMCs  were  significantly  higher  at  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose/last  vaccination compared  to those at the 12-month follow-up, consistent with normal waning of antibody concentrations over time. Across the 7 serotypes, the GMFR ranged from 0.12 to 0.41 for group 1, 0.09 to 0.42 for group 2, 0.13 to 0.49 for group 3 and 0.13 to 0.64 for group 4. Higher prevaccination level of IgG GMCs were observed in group 4, consistent with previous exposure to S pneumoniae in older subjects. The IgG GMC's of subjects in group 4 were generally numerically higher than the ones in other groups both at 1 month after the toddler dose/last vaccination, and at 12-month follow-up. There were no formal statistical GMC comparisons planned between groups for this study. Older subjects, such as those in group 4 are expected to have a more developed immune system. Together with previous immunologic exposure, suggested by higher prevaccination IgG GMCs, this would explain a more robust immune response in older subjects following vaccination.

2.3.2. Proportion of Subjects Achieving Predefined Pneumococcal Antibody Concentration 2.3.2.1.  Subjects  Achieving  a  Pneumococcal  IgG  Antibody  Concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  at  12-Month Follow-up Medicinal product no longer authorised

The percentage of subjects in the evaluable immunogenicity population achieving a  pneumococcal IgG concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  at  the  12-month  follow-up  is  summarized  in  Table  14.  The  majority  of subjects (&gt;70%) achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the 7 serotypes at the 12month follow-up. In group 4, &gt;90% of subjects achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the 7 serotypes. Across the 7 serotypes, the proportion of subjects achieving an IgG level ≥0.35

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

μg/mL ranged from 77.8% to 97.5% for group 1, 70.9% to 97.5% for group 2, 78.9% to 98.2% for group 3 and 94.4% to 100.0% for group 4.

## 2.3.2.2. Subjects Achieving a Pneumococcal IgG Antibody Concentration ≥0.15, ≥0.20 μg/mL at 12Month Follow-up

Overall, &gt;95% of subjects achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.15 μg/mL for each of the 7 serotypes, at the 12-month follow-up. Similarly, &gt;90% of subjects achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.20 μg/mL for each of the 7 serotypes, at the 12-month follow-up, except for serotype 19F in group 2. A total of 86.8% of subjects achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.20 μg/mL for serotype 19F.

2.3.3. Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves and Antibody Response Curves To provide a descriptive means to compare distributions of the immune response elicited by 7vPnC, serotype-specific anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG concentration RCDCs and antibody response curves for each of the 7 serotypes, from before the first vaccination to the 12-month follow-up time point, are respectively displayed in Figures 3.1 to 3.28 and Figures 3.29 to 3.49 in Section 11 attachment. For all serotypes in all groups the RCDC curves showed that across the full range of responses, IgG concentrations were lower than those after the last vaccination, but remained above pre-vaccination levels. 2.3.4. Immunogenicity Conclusions for the 12 month follow up ·  Antibody  levels  as  measured  by  IgG  GMCs  to  the  7  pneumococcal  serotypes  were  increased significantly at 12-month follow-up, relative to prevaccination antibody levels, in all age groups. · Overall, &gt;95% of subjects achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.15 μg/mL, &gt;86% of subjects achieved an  IgG  concentration  ≥0.20  μg/mL  and  &gt;70%  of  subjects  in  groups  1  through  4  achieved  an  IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the 7 serotypes at 12-month follow-up. · Higher IgG GMCs were generally observed for group 4 (older subjects) compared to groups 1, 2 and 3 at prevaccination and at 1 month after the toddler dose/last vaccination, and at the 12-month followup, consistent with more developed immune system in older subjects and possible previous exposure to S pneumoniae. ·  Antibody  levels  to  the  7  pneumococcal  serotypes  were  statistically  significantly  lower  at  the  12month follow-up compared to antibody levels at 1 month after the toddler dose/last vaccination, which is consistent with normal waning of antibody levels over time. However, antibody levels at 12-month follow-up were still consistently higher when compared to prevaccination antibody levels. · Safety results 1. Adverse Events 1.1. Summary of Adverse Events Overall, a total of 13 AEs were reported in 12 subjects. Adverse events were reported for 4 subjects each in groups 1 and 2, 3 subjects in group 3 and 1 subject in group 4. One event was reported for each subject, except for one subject in group 3 for whom 2 events were reported. The most common AE was pyrexia (9 events in 8 subjects). Other AEs included 1 event each of drug eruption, enteritis, hypersensitivity  and  dermatitis  allergic.  The  majority  of  AEs  were  mild  (8  events),  4  AEs  were moderate and one event was severe. One SAE of enteritis was reported in one subject in group 1; all other AEs were non-serious. All AEs were considered related to the study vaccine, except for the one reported SAE mentioned above. No protocol-related AEs, no AEs leading to withdrawal and no deaths were reported during the study. A by-subject summary of AEs during the study is presented in Table 35.

The  primary  objectives  of  the  study  were  to  assess  the  serotype-specific  pneumococcal  immune responses induced by Prevenar when measured 1 month after the last dose of Prevenar, and to assess the  prevaccination  antibody  levels  to  the  7  pneumococcal  serotypes in  Prevenar  in  each  age  group. Additionally,  the  serotype-specific  pneumococcal  immune  responses  induced  by  Prevenar,  was assessed  1  month  after  the  third  dose  of  Prevenar  in  group  1,  1  month  after  the  second  dose  of Prevenar in group 2 and 1 month after the first dose of Prevenar in group 3.

At the 12 month follow up, 3 severe SAEs were observed for 1 subject in group 3 at the 12-month follow-up. The subject died as a result of these events, none of which were considered related to the study vaccine. No other AEs were reported at the 12-month follow-up. 2. Safety Conclusions Based on the low incidence of AEs and their general lack of severity, the study vaccine as administered in this study appears to be safe and well-tolerated. There were no AEs that required withdrawal, no protocol-related AEs, and only 4 SAE (not considered related to the study vaccine) in 2 subjects . 3. Discussion on clinical aspects This  B1841008  (6114A1-4000-CN)  study  assessed  the  safety,  tolerability  and  immunogenicity  of Prevenar  in  older  infants  and  young  children  in  China  who  are  naive  to  previous  pneumococcal vaccination. Prevenar was administered in four age groups in this study: · Group 1 (100 subjects): 121 to &lt;212 days of age; received 4 doses of Prevenar. · Group 2 (100 subjects): 212 days to &lt;12 months of age; received 3 doses of Prevenar. · Group 3 (125 subjects): 12 to &lt;24 months of age; received 2 doses of Prevenar. · Group 4 (180 subjects): 24 to &lt;72 months of age; received 1 dose of Prevenar.

Immunogenicity analysis was performed for 2 populations, the evaluable immunogenicity population and the all-available immunogenicity population. The evaluable immunogenicity population consisted of eligible subjects in the age range who had received all the assigned vaccination(s), had blood drawn

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

within  required  time  frames,  had  at  least  1  valid  and  determinate  assay  result  for  the  proposed analysis,  had  received  no  prohibited  vaccines,  and  had  no  other  major  protocol  violations.  The  allavailable immunogenicity population consisted of subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result for the proposed analysis. Both the evaluable and all-available  immunogenicity populations were considered as primary immunogenicity populations. Safety analysis was performed on the safety population, which consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of Prevenar. A total  of  506  subjects  were  enrolled  in  this  study,  505  (99.8%)  of  which  received  at least  1 dose of vaccine.  One  subject  (10011248)  was  enrolled  into  group  2,  but  was  never  vaccinated.  The  total number of  planned  doses  were  administered  in  90.0%  of  subjects  in  group  1  (4  doses),  88.1%  of subjects  in  group  2  (3  doses),  94.4%  of  subjects  in  group  3  (2  doses),  and  100.0%  of  subjects  in group 4 (1 dose), respectively. A total of 93.1% of subjects completed the study up to the time-point of  the  blood  draw  one  month  after  the  last  vaccination.  The  remaining  6.9%  of  subjects  were withdrawn before the blood draw one month after the last vaccination.

Prevaccination antibody levels of the 7 pneumococcal serotypes were low in the younger age groups, but increased with age, particularly in group 4. As subjects were at least 4 months of age at the time of enrollment in this study, we did not observe the typical decreasing curve which is attributed to the maternal antibody decay at 6 months of age in overall 7 serotypes that is seen in unvaccinated infants enrolled at 2 months of age. However, it was observed that the GMC for serotype 14 in group 1 was notably higher than in groups 2 and 3 and the GMC for serotype 18C was also slightly higher in group 1,  this  may  be  explained  by  maternal  antibodies.  Across  the  7  serotypes,  a  greater  proportion  of subjects in groups 3 and 4 had an IgG concentration of ≥0.35 μg/mL for 4 of the 7 serotypes (6B, 9V, 19F  and  23F)  than  subjects  in  groups  1  and  2  before  vaccination.  In  group  4,  &gt;70%  of  subjects achieved an IgG antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for 4 of the 7 serotypes (6B, 9V, 19F and 23F) before  vaccination.  This  could  be  explained  by  prior  exposure  to S  pneumoniae in  older  subjects (groups 3 and 4). Antibody levels were higher than prevaccination levels, 1 month after the infant series in groups 1 and 2 and 1 month after the first dose of Prevenar in group 3, across the 7 pneumococcal serotypes. For all serotypes, the lower limit of the 95% CI for GMFR was greater than 1.0, indicating that the IgG GMC was higher following the infant series for groups 1 and 2, and following the first vaccination for group 3.  The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  ranged  from  92.0  to 100.0% in group 1 and 94.3 to 100.0% in group 2 across the 7 serotypes following the infant series. The proportion of subjects achieving an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL ranged from 89.4 to 100.0% across the 7 serotypes following the first dose of study vaccine in group 3. Antibody  levels  of  the  7  pneumococcal  serotypes  increased  notably  1  month  following  the  last vaccination,  relative  to  prevaccination  levels,  in  all  age  groups.  GMCs  at  one  month  following  the toddler dose ranged from 4.05 to 12.75 μg/mL for group 1, 4.02 to 13.02 μg/mL for group 2, 4.03 to 11.98 μg/mL for group 3 and 4.53 to 9.86 μg/mL for group 4. Overall, &gt;90% of subjects in groups 1 through 4 achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for all 7 serotypes, following the last dose of study medication. In  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  Prevenar  is  approved  for  concomitant  administration  with  other  pediatric vaccines  (DTwP,  DTaP,  Hib,  IPV,  OPV,  hepatitis  B  vaccines,  MMR,  varicella  vaccine).  However, according to the current package insert for Prevenar in China, it is not recommended to administer this vaccine  simultaneously  with  other  vaccines  of  planned  or  routine  children  immunization  program. Hence,  this  study  was  designed  to  not  allow  nonstudy  vaccines  being  given  within  7  days  after Prevenar  administration,  and  administration  of  the  study  vaccine  was  to  be  delayed  if  the  subject received any non-live vaccine within the previous 7 days or live vaccine within the previous 28 days. Overall, 90 (17.8%) of all subjects received at least one dose of nonstudy vaccine within 7 days of one of  their  scheduled  doses  of  study  vaccine.  The  highest  percentage  of  subjects  receiving  nonstudy vaccine within 7 days of study vaccine was observed in group 1 (60.0% subjects) and group 2 (20.8% of subjects). The higher percentage of nonstudy vaccinations in younger patients is expected, given that  quite  a  number  of  vaccinations  are  advised  to  be  administered  at  this  age.  Although  these concomitant vaccinations were treated as protocol deviations in this report, it was judged that such deviations would not impact the safe use of Prevenar and interfere the immunogenicity response of Prevenar  based  on  the  available  safety  data  in  this  study  and  the  study  results  in  previous  clinical trials.  In  group 1, in which the highest  percentage of subjects (60.0%) was administered nonstudy vaccines  within  7  days  of  study  vaccine,  the  number  of  AEs  observed  was  very  low  (4  AEs  were observed in 4 [4.0%] subjects).

In  conclusion,  Prevenar  catch-up  vaccinations  given  to  older  infants  and  young  children  naïve  to pneumococcal vaccines resulted in a robust immune response to all serotypes. The vaccine was well tolerated in infants and children in different age groups. This study has demonstrated that Prevenar given as a catch up regimen in different age groups (121 to &lt;212 days, 212 days to &lt;12 months, 12 to &lt;24 months and 24 to &lt;72 months) was well tolerated and produces a robust immune response as

characterized  by  antibody  geometric  mean  concentrations  (GMC)  and  geometric  mean  fold  rise (GMFR).

In  addition  to  the  primary  analysis  showing  that  IgG  GMCs  of  the  7  pneumococcal  serotypes  were significantly higher 1 month after the last vaccination, relative to prevaccination antibody concentrations, in all age groups, it was shown that at the 12-month follow-up, IgG GMCs of the 7 pneumococcal  serotypes  were  still  significantly  higher  than  prevaccination  antibody  concentrations. However IgG GMCs of the 7 pneumococcal serotypes at 12-month follow-up were lower than antibody concentrations at 1 month after the toddler dose/last vaccination, consistent with natural waning of antibodies.

Overall, &gt;90% of subjects in groups 1 through 4 achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the 7 serotypes, after the last dose of study vaccine. In comparison, &gt;70% of subjects in groups 1 through 4 achieved an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the 7 serotypes at the 12-month follow-up. Higher IgG GMCs were generally observed for group 4 (older subjects) compared to groups 1, 2 and 3 at prevaccination and at 1 month after dosing, and at the 12-month follow-up, consistent with a more developed immune system in older subjects and possible previous exposure to S pneumoniae. Except for one death that was considered unrelated to the study vaccine, no other AEs were reported at 12-month follow-up. Based on this, the study vaccine as administered in this study appears to be safe and well-tolerated. V. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  Overall conclusion The MAH submitted the immunogenicity and safety data from study 6114A1-4000-CN (B1841008): A phase 4, open-label trial to  assess  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  Prevenar  in  older infants and young children in China who are naïve to previous pneumococcal vaccination. Immunogenicity and safety data were discussed in sufficient detail by the MAH and do not warrant further investigation.  Recommendation No further action required. VI.
