*Note: Follow the genotype 1a dosing recommendations in patients with an unknown genotype 1 subtype or with mixed genotype 1 infection. ** When assessing severity of liver disease using non-invasive methods, a combination of blood biomarkers or the combination of liver stiffness measurement and a blood test improves accuracy and should be undertaken prior to 8 week treatment in all patients with moderate fibrosis. Missed doses In case a dose of dasabuvir is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 6 hours. If more than 6 hours have passed since dasabuvir is usually taken, the missed dose should NOT be taken and the patient should take the next dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose. Special populations HIV-1 Co-infection The dosing recommendations in Table 1 should be followed. For dosing recommendations with HIV antiviral medicinal products, refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5. See sections 4.8 and 5.1 for additional information. Liver transplant recipients Dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin is recommended for 24 weeks in liver transplant recipients. Lower ribavirin dose at initiation may be appropriate. In the post-liver transplant study, ribavirin dosing was individualized and most subjects received 600 to 800 mg per day (see section 5.1). For dosing recommendations with calcineurin inhibitors refer to section 4.5. No dose adjustment of dasabuvir is warranted in elderly patients (see section 5.2). Renal impairment Medicinal product no longer authorised

No dose adjustment of dasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 5.2). For patients that require ribavirin, refer to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics for information regarding use in patients with renal impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment of dasabuvir is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). Dasabuvir should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see section 5.2).

Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of dasabuvir in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available. Method of administration The film-coated tablets are for oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole (i.e. patients should not chew, break or dissolve the tablet). To maximise absorption, dasabuvir tablets should be taken with food, without regard to fat and calorie content (see section 5.2). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see section 5.2). Use of ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers is expected to decrease dasabuvir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect (see section 4.5. Examples of contraindicated inducers are provided below. Enzyme inducers:  carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital  efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine  apalutamide, enzalutamide  mitotane  rifampicin  St. John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Medicinal products that are strong CYP2C8 inhibitors may increase dasabuvir plasma concentrations and must not be co-administered with dasabuvir (see section 4.5). Examples of contraindicated CYP2C8 inhibitors are provided below. CYP2C8 inhibitor:  gemfibrozil Dasabuvir is administered with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir. For contra-indications with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## General

Dasabuvir is not recommended for administration as monotherapy and must be used in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of hepatitis C infection (see section 4.2 and 5.1).

<!-- image -->

Although ALT elevations associated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir have been asymptomatic, patients should be instructed to watch for early warning signs of liver inflammation, such as fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, as well as later signs such as jaundice and discoloured faeces, and to consult a doctor without delay if such symptoms occur. Routine monitoring of liver enzymes is not necessary in patients that do not have cirrhosis (for cirrhotics, see above). Early discontinuation may result in drug resistance, but implications for future therapy are not known.

Risk of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure in patients with cirrhosis Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes, have been reported post-marketing in patients treated with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and without ribavirin. Most patients with these severe outcomes had evidence of advanced or decompensated cirrhosis prior to initiating therapy. Although causality is difficult to establish due to background advanced liver disease, a potential risk cannot be excluded. Dasabuvir should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.2). For patients with cirrhosis:  Monitoring should be performed for clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage).  Hepatic laboratory testing including direct bilirubin levels should be performed at baseline, during the first 4 weeks of starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter.  Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation. ALT elevations During clinical trials with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin, transient elevations of ALT to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 1% of subjects (35 of 3,039). ALT elevations were asymptomatic and generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, without concomitant elevations of bilirubin, and declined within approximately two weeks of onset with continued dosing of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin. These ALT elevations were significantly more frequent in the subgroup of subjects who were using ethinyloestradiol -containing medicinal products such as combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (6 of 25 subjects); (see section 4.3). In contrast, the rate of ALT elevations in subjects using other types of oestrogens as typically used in hormonal replacement therapy (i.e., oral and topical oestradiol and conjugated oestrogens) was similar to the rate observed in subjects who were not using oestrogen-containing products (approximately 1% in each group). Patients who are taking ethinyloestradiol -containing medicinal products (i.e. most combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings) must switch to an alternative method of contraception (e.g., progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) prior to initiating dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir therapy (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and concomitant use with ribavirin

Also see section 4.6.

Extreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients when dasabuvir is taken in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.6 and refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information).

Use with tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus Co-administration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with systemic tacrolimus, sirolimus or everolimus increases the concentrations of the immunosuppressant due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir (see section 4.5). Serious and/or life threatening events have been observed with co-administration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with systemic tacrolimus, and a similar risk can be expected with sirolimus and everolimus. Avoid concomitant use of tacrolimus or sirolimus with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir unless the benefits outweigh the risks. If tacrolimus or sirolimus are used together with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, caution is advised, and recommended doses and monitoring strategies can be found in section 4.5. Everolimus cannot be used due to lack of suitable dose strengths for dose adjustments. Tacrolimus or sirolimus whole blood concentrations should be monitored upon initiation and throughout co-administration with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and the dose and/or dosing frequency should be adjusted as needed. Patients should be monitored frequently for any changes in renal function or tacrolimus or sirolimus associated adverse reactions. Refer to the tacrolimus or sirolimus Summary of Product Characteristics for additional dosing and monitoring instructions. Depression or psychiatric illness Cases of depression and more rarely of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt have been reported with dasabuvir with or without ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir treatment in combination with ribavirin in the majority of the cases. Although some cases had previous history of depression, psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse, a causal relation with dasabuvir with or without ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir treatment cannot be excluded. Caution should be used in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to notify the prescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal ideation. Genotype-specific activity Concerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning genotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1. The efficacy of dasabuvir has not been established in patients with HCV genotypes other than genotype 1; dasabuvir should not be used for the treatment of patients infected with other genotypes than 1. Co-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV Medicinal product no longer authorised

Dasabuvir safety and efficacy have been established in combination with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir with or without ribavirin. Co-administration of dasabuvir with other antivirals has not been studied and, therefore, cannot be recommended.

## Retreatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The efficacy of dasabuvir in patients previously exposed to dasabuvir, or to medicinal products anticipated to be cross-resistant, has not been demonstrated.

## Use with statins

Rosuvastatin Dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is expected to increase the exposure to rosuvastatin more than 3-fold. If rosuvastatin treatment is required during the treatment period, the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin should be 5 mg (see section 4.5, Table 2). Pitavastatin and fluvastatin The interactions with pitavastatin and fluvastatin have not been investigated. Theoretically, dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is expected to increase the exposure to pitavastatin and fluvastatin. A temporary suspension of pitavastatin/fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. If statin treatment is required during the treatment period, a switch to a reduced dose of pravastatin/rosuvastatin is possible (see section 4.5, Table 2). Treatment of patients with HIV co-infection Dasabuvir is recommended in combination with paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir, and ritonavir may select for PI resistance in HIV co-infected patients without ongoing antiretroviral therapy. HIV coinfected patients without suppressive antiretroviral therapy should not be treated with dasabuvir. Drug interactions need to be carefully taken into account in the setting of HIV co-infection (for details see section 4.5, Table 2). Atazanavir can be used in combination with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir if administered at the same time. To be noted, atazanavir should be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose combination. The combination carries an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia (including ocular icterus), in particular when ribavirin is part of the hepatitis C regimen. Darunavir, dosed 800 mg once daily, if administered at the same time as ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, can be used in the absence of extensive PI resistance (darunavir exposure lowered). To be noted, darunavir should be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose combination. For the use of HIV protease inhibitors other than atazanavir and darunavir refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir. Raltegravir exposure is substantially increased (2-fold). The combination was not linked to any particular safety issues in a limited set of patients treated for 12-24 weeks. Rilpivirine exposure is substantially increased (3-fold) when rilpivirine is given in combination with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with a consequent potential for QT-prolongation. If an HIV protease inhibitor is added (atazanavir, darunavir), rilpivirine exposure may increase even further and is, therefore, not recommended. Rilpivirine should be used cautiously, in the setting of repeated ECG monitoring. Medicinal product no longer authorised

NNRTIs other than rilpivirine (efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine) are contraindicated (see section 4.3).

Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should, therefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.

Use in diabetic patients Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic patients initiating direct acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first 3 months, and their diabetic medicinal products modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is initiated. Lactose Exviera contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Dasabuvir must always be administered together with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir . When coadministered they exert mutual effects on each other (see section 5.2). Therefore, the interaction profile of the compounds must be considered as a combination. Pharmacodynamic interactions Coadministration with enzyme inducers may lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions and ALT elevations (see Table 2). Coadministration with ethinyloestradiol may lead to increased risk of ALT elevations (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3. Pharmacokinetic interactions Potential for dasabuvir to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products In vivo drug interaction studies evaluated the net effect of the combination treatment, including ritonavir. The following section describes the specific transporters and metabolizing enzymes that are affected by dasabuvir when combined with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. See Table 2 for guidance regarding potential drug interactions and dosing recommendations for dasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 Refer to the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir Summary of Product Characteristics for details. (see also Table 2). Medicinal products transported by the OATP family Refer to the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir Summary of Product Characteristics for details on OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 substrates (see also Table 2).

## Medicinal products transported by BCRP

Dasabuvir is an inhibitor of BCRP in vivo . Co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir together with medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP may increase plasma concentrations of these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose

adjustment/clinical monitoring. Such medicinal products include sulfasalazine, imatinib and some of the statins (see Table 2). See also Table 2 for specific advice on rosuvastatin which has been evaluated in a drug interaction study.

## Medicinal products transported by Pgp in the intestine

<!-- image -->

Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that inhibit CYP2C8 (e.g. teriflunomide, deferasirox) may increase dasabuvir plasma concentrations. Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors are contraindicated with dasabuvir (see section 4.3 and Table 2).

While dasabuvir is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp, no significant change was observed in the exposure of the P-gp substrate, digoxin, when administered with dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. It may not be excluded that the systemic exposure of dabigatran etexilate is increased by dasabuvir due to inhibition of P-gp in the intestine. Medicinal products metabolised by glucuronidation Dasabuvir is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 in vivo . Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that are primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 result in increased plasma concentrations of such medicinal products; routine clinical monitoring is recommended for narrow therapeutic index medicinal products (i.e. levothyroxine). See also Table 2 for specific advice on raltegravir and buprenorphine which have been evaluated in drug interaction studies. Dasabuvir has also been found to inhibit UGT1A4, 1A6 and intestinal UGT2B7 in vitro at in vivo relevant concentrations. Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 Co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir can decrease exposures of medicinal products that are metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole, esomeprazole, s- mephenytoin), which may require dose adjustment/clinical monitoring. CYP2C19 substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include omeprazole and escitalopram (Table 2). Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 Dasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin. Other CYP2C9 substrates (NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), antidiabetics (e.g. glimepiride, glipizide) are not expected to require dose adjustments. Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 Dasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6 /CYP1A2 substrate duloxetine. Exposures of cyclobenzaprine, a CYP1A2 substrate, were decreased. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed for other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. ciprofloxacin, cyclobenzaprine, theophylline and caffeine). CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine, metoprolol and dextromethorphan) are not expected to require dose adjustments. Medicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins Dasabuvir does not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo as shown by the lack of interaction with tenofovir (OAT1 substrate). In vitro studies show that dasabuvir is not an inhibitor of organic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, dasabuvir is not expected to affect medicinal products which are primarily excreted by the renal route via these transporters (see section 5.2).

Enzyme inducers

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of dasabuvir with medicinal products that are moderate or strong enzyme inducers is expected to decrease dasabuvir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3 and Table 2.

Dasabuvir is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP and its major metabolite M1 is a substrate of OCT1 in vitro . Inhibition of P-gp and BCRP is not expected to show clinically relevant increases in exposures of dasabuvir (Table 2).

Dasabuvir M1 metabolite was quantified in all the drug interaction studies. Changes in exposures of the metabolite were generally consistent with that observed with dasabuvir except for studies with CYP2C8 inhibitor, gemfibrozil, where the metabolite exposures decreased by up to 95% and CYP3A inducer, carbamazepine, where the metabolite exposures decreased by only up to 39%. Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists As liver function may change during treatment with dasabuvir administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. Drug interaction studies Recommendations for co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for a number of medicinal products are provided in Table 2. If a patient is already taking medicinal product(s) or initiating a medicinal product while receiving dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for which potential for drug interaction is expected, dose adjustment of the concomitant medicinal product(s) or appropriate clinical monitoring should be considered (Table 2). If dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, doses should be re-adjusted after administration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is completed. Table 2 provides the Least Squares Means Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and concomitant medicinal products. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the change in exposures (C max , and AUC) in the paritaprevir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir and the co-administered medicinal product (↑ = increase more than 20%, ↓ = decrease more than 20%, ↔ = no change or change less than 20% ). This is not an exclusive list. Dasabuvir is administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. For interactions with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. Table 2.

| tacrolimus is due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir.

If tacrolimus with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir are used concomitantly, tacrolimus should not be administered on the day dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir are initiated. Beginning the day after dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir are initiated; reinitiate tacrolimus at a reduced dose based on tacrolimus blood concentrations. The recommended tacrolimus dosing is 0.5 mg every 7 days. Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations should be monitored upon initiation and throughout co- administration with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir and the dose and/or dosing frequency should be adjusted as needed. Upon completion of dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir treatment, the appropriate dose and dosing frequency of tacrolimus should be guided by assessment of tacrolimus blood concentrations. authorised |

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Women of childbearing potential /contraception in males and females

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Extreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients when dasabuvir is used with ribavirin. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin; therefore, ribavirin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information.

Female patients: Women of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless they are using an effective form of contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 4 months after treatment. Male patients and their female partners: Either male patients or their female partners of childbearing potential must use a form of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 7 months after treatment. Ethinyloestradiol is contraindicated in combination with dasabuvir (see section 4.3). See additional information on specific hormonal contraceptives in sections 4.3 and 4.4. Pregnancy There are very limited data from the use of dasabuvir in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of dasabuvir during pregnancy. If ribavirin is co-administered with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, the contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during pregnancy apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin). Breast-feeding It is not known whether dasabuvir and metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of dasabuvir and metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). Because of the potential for adverse reactions from the medicinal product in breastfed infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue treatment with dasabuvir, taking into account the importance of the therapy to the mother. Patients receiving ribavirin should also refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin. Fertility No human data on the effect of dasabuvir on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects on fertility (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Dasabuvir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that fatigue has been reported during treatment with dasabuvir in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Medicinal product no longer authorised

In subjects receiving dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 20% of subjects) were fatigue and nausea. The

Tabulated list of adverse reactions The safety summary is based on pooled data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in subjects who received dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin.  The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 3 were of grade 1 severity in dasabuvir- and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir-containing regimens. The adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) or very rare (&lt;1/10,000). Table 3.

Laboratory abnormalities Changes in selected laboratory parameters are described in Table 4. A side-by-side tabulation is provided to simplify presentation; direct comparisons should not be made across trials that differ in trial designs. Table 4. Selected treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities Laboratory parameters ALT &gt;5-20 × ULN* (Grade 3) &gt;20 × ULN (Grade 4) Haemoglobin &lt;100-80 g/L (grade 2) &lt;80-65 g/L (grade 3) &lt;65 g/L (Grade 4) Total bilirubin &gt;3-10 × ULN (grade 3) &gt;10 × ULN (grade 4) *ULN: Upper Limit of Normal Serum ALT elevations In a pooled analysis of clinical trials with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and without ribavirin, 1% of subjects experienced serum ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) after starting treatment. As the incidence of such elevations was 26% among women taking a concomitant ethinyloestradiol-containing medicine, such medicinal products are contraindicated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. No increase in incidence of ALT elevations was observed with other types of systemic oestrogens commonly used for hormone replacement therapy (e.g., oestradiol and conjugated oestrogens). ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment (mean time 20 days, range 857 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. Two patients discontinued dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to elevated ALT, including one on ethinyloestradiol. Three interrupted dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for one to seven days, including one on ethinyloestradiol. The majority of these ALT elevations were transient and assessed as related to dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Elevations in ALT were generally not associated with bilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Serum bilirubin elevations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Transient elevations in serum bilirubin (predominantly indirect) were observed in subjects receiving dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, related to the inhibition of the bilirubin transporters OATP1B1/1B3 by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced haemolysis. Bilirubin elevations occurred after initiation of treatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing therapy. Bilirubin elevations were not associated with aminotransferase elevations. The frequency of indirect bilirubin elevations was lower among subjects who did not receive ribavirin.

Liver transplant recipients The overall safety profile in HCV-infected transplant recipients who were administered dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin (in addition to their immunosuppressant medicinal products) was similar to subjects treated with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin in phase 3 clinical trials, although some adverse reactions were increased in frequency. 10 subjects (29.4%) had at least one post baseline haemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL. 10 of 34 subjects (29.4%) dose modified ribavirin due to decrease in haemoglobin and 2.9% (1/34) had an interruption of ribavirin. Ribavirin dose modification did not impact SVR rates. 5 subjects required erythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to 1200 mg daily. No subject received a blood transfusion. HIV/HCV co-infected patients The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Transient elevations in total bilirubin &gt;3 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in 17 (27.0%) subjects; 15 of these subjects were receiving atazanavir. None of the subjects with hyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases. GT1-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin were assessed in 68 subjects with genotype 1 infection with or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or ESRD (see Section 5.1). The overall safety profile in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that seen in prior Phase 3 studies in subjects without severe renal impairment, except that a greater proportion of subjects required intervention due to ribavirin-associated decreases in serum haemoglobin. The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking RBV was 1.2 g/dL.  Thirty-nine of the 50 subjects who received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11 of these subjects were also treated with erythropoietin. Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level &lt; 8 g/dL.  Two subjects received a blood transfusion.  Adverse events of anaemia were not seen in the 18 GT1b-infected subjects who did not receive ribavirin. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir was also evaluated without ribavirin in 18 GT1a- and GT4-infected patients; no adverse events of anaemia were seen in these subjects. Paediatric population The safety of dasabuvir in children and adolescents aged &lt; 18 years has not yet been established. No data are available. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; direct-acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AP09 Mechanism of action Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the NS5B gene, which is essential for replication of the viral genome. Co-administration of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir combines three direct-acting antiviral medicinal products with distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for its pharmacological properties. Activity in cell culture and biochemical studies The EC50 of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays was 7.7 and 1.8 nM, respectively. The replicon activity of dasabuvir was attenuated 12- to 13fold in the presence of 40% human plasma. The mean EC50 of dasabuvir against replicons containing NS5B from a panel of treatment-naïve genotype 1a and 1b isolates in the HCV replicon cell culture assay was 0.77 nM (range 0.4 to 2.1 nM; n=11) and 0.46 nM (range 0.2 to 2 nM; n=10), respectively. In biochemical assays, dasabuvir inhibited a panel of genotype 1a and 1b polymerases with a mean IC50  value of 4.2 nM (range 2.2 to 10.7 nM; n=7). The M1 metabolite of dasabuvir had EC50 values of 39 and 8 nM against genotype 1a-H77 and 1bCon1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays, respectively, and the activity of the M1 metabolite was attenuated 3- to 4-fold in the presence of 40% human plasma. Dasabuvir had reduced activity in biochemical assays against NS5B polymerases from HCV genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a and 4a (IC50 values ranging from 900 nM to &gt;20 μM). Resistance In cell culture Resistance to dasabuvir conferred by variants in NS5B selected in cell culture or identified in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials were phenotypically characterised in the appropriate genotype 1a or 1b replicons.

In genotype 1a, substitutions C316Y, M414T, Y448H, A553T, G554S, S556G/R, and Y561H in HCV NS5B reduced susceptibility to dasabuvir. In the genotype 1a replicon, the activity of dasabuvir was reduced 21- to 32-fold by the M414T, S556G or Y561H substitutions; 152- to 261-fold by the A553T, G554S or S556R substitutions; and 1472- and 975-fold by the C316Y and Y448H substitutions, respectively. G558R and D559G/N were observed as treatment-emergent substitutions but the activity of dasabuvir against these variants could not be evaluated due to poor replication capacity. In genotype 1b, substitutions C316N, C316Y, M414T, Y448H, and S556G in HCV NS5B reduced susceptibility to dasabuvir. The activity of dasabuvir was reduced by 5- and 11-fold by C316N and S556G, respectively; 46-fold by M414T or Y448H; and 1569-fold by the C316Y substitutions in the genotype

1b replicon. Dasabuvir retained full activity against replicons containing substitutions S282T in the nucleoside binding site, M423T in the lower thumb site, and P495A/S, P496S or V499A in the upper thumb site.

## Effect of baseline HCV substitutions/polymorphisms on treatment response

<!-- image -->

A pooled analysis of subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, who were treated with dasabuvir, ombitasvir and paritaprevir with or without ribavirin in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials, was conducted to explore the association between baseline NS3/4A, NS5A or NS5B substitutions/polymorphisms and treatment outcome in these recommended regimens. In the greater than 500 genotype 1a baseline samples in this analysis, the most frequently observed resistance-associated variants were M28V (7.4%) in NS5A and S556G (2.9%) in NS5B. Q80K, although a highly prevalent polymorphism in NS3 (41.2% of samples), confers minimal resistance to paritaprevir. Resistance-associated variants at amino acid positions R155 and D168 in NS3 were rarely observed (less than 1%) at baseline. In the greater than 200 genotype 1b baseline samples in this analysis, the most frequently observed resistance-associated variants observed were Y93H (7.5%) in NS5A, and C316N (17.0%) and S556G (15%) in NS5B. Given the low virologic failure rates observed with recommended treatment regimens for HCV genotype 1a- and 1b-infected subjects, the presence of baseline variants appears to have little impact on the likelihood of achieving SVR. In clinical studies Of the 2,510 HCV genotype 1 infected subjects who were treated with regimens containing dasabuvir, ombitasvir and paritaprevir with or without ribavirin (for 8, 12 or 24 weeks) in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials, a total of 74 subjects (3%) experienced virologic failure (primarily post-treatment relapse). Treatment-emergent variants and their prevalence in these virologic failure populations are shown in Table 5. In the 67 genotype 1a infected subjects, NS3 variants were observed in 50 subjects, NS5A variants were observed in 46 subjects, NS5B variants were observed in 37 subjects, and treatmentemergent variants were seen in all 3 drug targets in 30 subjects. In the 7 genotype 1b infected subjects, treatment-emergent variants were observed in NS3 in 4 subjects, in NS5A in 2 subjects, and in both NS3 and NS5A in 1 subject. No genotype 1b infected subjects had treatment-emergent variants in all 3 drug targets. Medicinal product no longer authorised

a. Observed in at least 2 subjects of the same subtype. b. N=66 for the NS5B target. c. Substitutions were observed in combination with other emergent substitutions at NS3 position R155 or D168. d. Observed in combination in genotype 1b-infected subjects. e. Observed in combination in 6% (4/67) of the subjects. Note: The following variants were selected in cell culture but were not treatment-emergent: NS3 variants A156T in genotype 1a, and R155Q and D168H in genotype 1b; NS5A variants Y93C/H in genotype 1a, and L31F/V or Y93H in combination with L28M, L31F/V or P58S in genotype 1b; and NS5B variants Y448H in genotype 1a, and M414T and Y448H in genotype 1b. Persistence of resistance-associated substitutions The persistence of dasabuvir, ombitasvir and paritaprevir resistance-associated amino acid substitutions in NS5B, NS5A and NS3, respectively, was assessed in genotype 1a-infected subjects in Phase 2b trials. Dasabuvir treatment-emergent variants M414T, G554S, S556G, G558R or D559G/N in NS5B were observed in 34 subjects. Ombitasvir treatment-emergent variants M28T, M28V or Q30R in NS5A were observed in 32 subjects. Paritaprevir treatment-emergent variants V36A/M, R155K or D168V were observed in NS3 in 47 subjects. NS3 variants V36A/M and R155K and NS5B variants M414T and S556G remained detectable at posttreatment Week 48, whereas NS3 variant D168V and all other NS5B variants were not observed at post-treatment Week 48. All treatment-emergent variants in NS5A remained detectable at posttreatment Week 48. Due to high SVR rates in genotype 1b, trends in persistence of treatment-emergent variants in this genotype could not be established. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The lack of detection of virus containing a resistance-associated substitution does not indicate that the resistant virus is no longer present at clinically significant levels. The long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of virus containing dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir resistance-associated substitutions on future treatment is unknown.

## Cross-resistance

Cross-resistance is expected among NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, and non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors by class. The impact of prior dasabuvir, ombitasvir, or paritaprevir treatment experience on the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, or NS5B inhibitors has not been studied.

Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy and safety of dasabuvir in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and without ribavirin was evaluated in eight Phase 3 clinical trials, including two trials exclusively in subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), in over 2,360 subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection as summarised in Table 6. Table 6. Phase 3 global multicentre trials conducted with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin (RBV). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In all eight trials, the dasabuvir dose was 250 mg twice daily and the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir dose was 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily. For subjects who received ribavirin, the ribavirin dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was 1000 mg per day for subjects weighing less than 75 kg or 1200 mg per day for subjects weighing greater than or equal to 75 kg.

Sustained virologic response (SVR) was the primary endpoint to determine the HCV cure rate in the Phase 3 studies and was defined as unquantifiable or undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Treatment duration was fixed in each trial and was not guided by subjects' HCV RNA levels (no response guided algorithm). Plasma HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical trials using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System (except GARNET which used COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test v2.0). The High Pure system assay had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU per mL and the AmpliPrep assay had a LLOQ of 15 IU per mL.

Clinical trials in treatment-naïve adults SAPPHIRE-I - genotype 1, treatment-naïve, without cirrhosis Design: randomised, global multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Treatment: dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks Treated subjects (N=631) had a median age of 52 years (range: 18 to 70); 54.5% were male; 5.4% were Black; 15.2% had a history of depression or bipolar disorder; 79.1% had baseline HCV RNA levels of at least 800,000 IU/mL; 15.4% had portal fibrosis (F2) and 8.7% had bridging fibrosis (F3); 67.7% had HCV genotype 1a infection; 32.3% had HCV genotype 1b infection. Table 7. SVR12 for genotype 1-infected treatment-naïve subjects in SAPPHIRE-I a. Confirmed HCV ≥ 25 IU/mL after HCV RNA &lt; 25 IU/mL during treatment, confirmed 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir, or HCV RNA persistently ≥ 25 IU/mL with at least 6 weeks of treatment. b. Other includes early drug discontinuation not due to virologic failure and missing HCV RNA values in the SVR12 window. No subjects with HCV genotype 1b infection experienced on-treatment virologic failure and one subject with HCV genotype 1b infection experienced relapse. PEARL-III - genotype 1b, treatment-naïve, without cirrhosis Design: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treated subjects (N=419) had a median age of 50 years (range: 19 to 70); 45.8% were male; 4.8% were Black; 9.3% had a history of depression or bipolar disorder; 73.3% had baseline HCV RNA of at least 800,000 IU/mL; 20.3% had portal fibrosis (F2) and 10.0% had bridging fibrosis (F3).

Table 15. Main demographics in TURQUOISE-III Pooled analyses of clinical trials Durability of response Overall, 660 subjects in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials had HCV RNA results for both the SVR12 and SVR24 time points. Among these subjects, the positive predictive value of SVR12 on SVR24 was 99.8%. Pooled efficacy analysis In Phase 3 clinical trials, 1075 subjects (including 181 with compensated cirrhosis) received the recommended regimen (see section 4.2). Table 16 shows SVR rates for these subjects. In subjects who received the recommended regimen, 97% achieved SVR overall (among which 181 subjects with compensated cirrhosis achieved 97% SVR), while 0.5% experienced virologic breakthrough and 1.2% experienced post-treatment relapse.

+Other types of pegIFN/RBV failure include less well documented non-response, relapse/breakthrough or other pegIFN failure. Impact of ribavirin dose adjustment on probability of SVR In Phase 3 clinical trials, 91.5% of subjects did not require ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy. In the 8.5% of subjects who had ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy, the SVR rate (98.5%) was comparable to subjects who maintained their starting ribavirin dose throughout treatment. TURQUOISE-I: treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced with HCV GT1 or GT4/HIV-1 coinfection, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis Design: randomised, global multicentre, open-label Treatment: ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir coadminstered with or without weight-based ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks See section 4.2 for dosing recommendations in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients. Subjects were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen that included ritonavir-boosted atazanavir or raltegravir, dolutegravir (Part 2 only), or darunavir (Part 1b and Part 2 GT4 only)-, co-administered with a backbone of tenofovir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine. Part 1 of the study was a Phase 2 pilot cohort consisting of 2 parts, Part 1a (63 subjects) and Part 1b (22 subjects). Part 2 was a Phase 3 cohort consisting of 233 subjects. In Part 1a, all subjects received dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks.  Treated subjects (N = 63) had a median age of 51 years (range: 31 to 69); 24% were Black; 19% had compensated cirrhosis; 67% were treatment-naïve; 33% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; 89% had HCV genotype 1a infection.

In subjects with liver transplant, no cirrhosis and GT1 infection, patients were dosed with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for 12-24 weeks, with and without RBV. Liver transplant subjects with cirrhosis were dosed with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with RBV (GT1a for 24 weeks [n=4], GT1b for 12 weeks [n=2]). Subjects with renal transplant and no cirrhosis were dosed for 12 weeks (with RBV for GT1a [n=9], without RBV for GT1b [n=3]). Subjects with liver transplant and GT4 infection were dosed with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with RBV (noncirrhotic for 12 weeks [n=2] and cirrhotic for 24 weeks [n=1]. The dose of ribavirin was individualized at the discretion of the investigator, with most subjects receiving 600 to 800 mg as a starting dose, and most subjects also receiving 600 to 800 mg per day at the end of treatment.

Includes subjects who discontinued due to adverse event, lost to follow-up or subject withdrawal, and subjects with reinfection Efficacy analyses performed on other parts of the study demonstrated similarly high SVR12 rates. In Part 1a, SVR12 was achieved by 29/31 (93.5%) subjects on the 12-week arm (95% CI: 79.3% 98.2%) and by 29/32 (90.6%) subjects on the 24-week arm (95% CI: 75.8% - 96.8%). There was 1 relapse in the 12-week arm and 1 on-treatment virologic failure in the 24-week arm. In Part 1b, SVR12 was achieved by 22/22 (100%) subjects (95% CI: 85.1%, 100%). In Part 2, SVR12 was achieved by 27/28 (96.4%) subjects with HCV GT4/HIV-1 coinfection (95% CI: 82.3%, 99.4%) with no virologic failures. The SVR12 rates in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects were thus consistent with SVR12 rates in the phase 3 trials of HCV mono-infected subjects. CORAL-I: treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced, GT 1 or GT4 infected, at least 3 months post liver transplant or 12 months post renal transplant Design: randomised, global multicentre, open-label Treatment: dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for 12 or 24 weeks with or without ribavirin (investigator chosen dose) for GT1 and GT4 infection Medicinal product no longer authorised

A total of 129 subjects were treated, 84 with GT1a, 41 with GT1b, 1 with GT1 other, 3 with GT4 infection. Overall, 61% had fibrosis stage F0-F1, 26% F2, 9% F3, and 4% F4.  61% had prior HCV treatment experience before transplant. For immunosuppressive medication, most subjects were taking tacrolimus (81%), with the remainder taking cyclosporine.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in one or more subsets of the paediatric populations in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

Among all GT1 subjects who were post liver transplant, 111/114 (97.4%) achieved SVR12; with 2 relapsing post treatment and 1 breakthrough on treatment.  Among the GT1 subjects who were post renal transplant, 9/12 (75%) achieved SVR12; however, there were no virologic failures.  All 3 (100%) subjects with GT 4 infection who were post liver transplant achieved SVR12 Clinical Trial in patients receiving chronic opioid substitution therapy In a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single arm study, 38 treatment-naïve or pegIFN/RBV treatment experienced, non-cirrhotic subjects with genotype 1 infection who were on stable doses of methadone (N=19) or buprenorphine with or without naloxone (N=19) received 12 weeks of dasabuvir in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin. Treated subjects had a median age of 51 years (range: 26 to 64); 65.8% were male and 5.3% were Black. A majority (86.8%) had baseline HCV RNA levels of at least 800,000 IU/mL and a majority (84.2%) had genotype 1a infection; 15.8% had portal fibrosis (F2) and 5.3% had bridging fibrosis (F3); and 94.7% were naïve to prior HCV treatment. Overall, 37 (97.4%) of 38 subjects achieved SVR12. No subjects experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. RUBY-I; treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV experienced with or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD) Design: multicentre, open-label Treatment: dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without RBV for 12 or 24 weeks Severe renal impairment or ESRD includes CKD Stage 4 defined as eGFR &lt;30-15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or CKD Stage 5 defined as &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or requiring haemodialysis. Treated subjects (N=68) had a median age of 58 years (range: 32-77 years); 83.8% were male; 58.8% were Black; 73.5% of subjects were infected with HCV GT1a; 75.0%% had Stage 5 CKD and 69.1% were on haemodialysis. Sixty four of 68 (94.1%) subjects achieved SVR12. One subject experienced relapse at Post-Treatment Week 4, 2 subjects prematurely discontinued study drug and 1 subject had missing SVR12 data. See also Section 4.8 for discussion of safety information for RUBY-I. In another open-label phase 3b study evaluating 12 weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir and without RBV in non-cirrhotic, treatment-naive GT1a and GT4 patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 (Ruby II), the SVR12 rate was 94.4% (17/18), with no subjects experiencing ontreatment virologic failure or relapse.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic properties of the combination of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. Table 18 shows mean Cmax and AUC of dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily following multiple doses with food in healthy volunteers.

|           | Cmax (ng/ml) (CV%)   | AUC (ng*hr/ml) (CV%)   |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Dasabuvir | 1030 (31)            | 6840 (32)              |

Dasabuvir is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A. Following a 400 mg  14 C-dasabuvir dose in humans, unchanged dasabuvir was the major component (approximately 60%) of drug related radioactivity in plasma. Seven metabolites were identified in plasma. The most abundant plasma metabolite was M1, which represented 21% of drug-related radioactivity (AUC) in circulation following single dose; it's formed via oxidative metabolism predominantly by CYP2C8.

Table 18. Geometric mean Cmax, AUC of multiple doses of dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily with food in healthy volunteers Dasabuvir Absorption Dasabuvir was absorbed after oral administration with mean Tmax of approximately 4 to 5 hours. Dasabuvir exposures increased in a dose proportional manner and accumulation is minimal. Pharmacokinetic steady state for dasabuvir when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is achieved after approximately 12 days of dosing. Effects of food Dasabuvir should be administered with food. All clinical trials with dasabuvir have been conducted following administration with food. Food increased the exposure (AUC) of dasabuvir by up to 30% relative to the fasting state. The increase in exposure was similar regardless of meal type (e.g., high-fat versus moderate-fat) or calorie content (approximately 600 kcal versus approximately 1000 kcal). To maximise absorption, dasabuvir should be taken with food without regard to fat or calorie content. Distribution Dasabuvir is highly bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 indicating that dasabuvir was preferentially distributed in the plasma compartment of whole blood. Dasabuvir was greater than 99.5%, and M1 major metabolite of dasabuvir was 94.5% bound to human plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.05 to 5  g/mL. At steady-state the exposures ratio of M1 to dasabuvir is approximately 0.6. Taking into account the protein binding and in vitro activity of M1 against HCV genotype 1, its contribution to efficacy is expected to be similar to that of dasabuvir. In addition, M1 is a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP family and OCT1 and thus, the hepatocyte concentration and thereby contribution to efficacy, may be larger than dasabuvir.

## Elimination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following dosing of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/ paritaprevir /ritonavir, mean plasma half-life of dasabuvir was approximately 6 hours. Following a 400 mg  14 C-dasabuvir dose, approximately 94% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces with limited radioactivity (approximately 2%) in urine. Unchanged dasabuvir accounted for 26.2% and M1 for 31.5% of the total dose in faeces. M1 is mainly cleared through direct biliary excretion with the contribution of UGT-mediated glucuronidation and, to a small extent, oxidative metabolism.

Dasabuvir does not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo and is not expected to inhibit organic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations; therefore, dasabuvir does not affect medicinal product transport by these proteins. Special populations Elderly Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, a 10 year increase or decrease in age from 54 years (median age in the Phase 3 studies) would results in &lt;10% change in dasabuvir exposures. There is no pharmacokinetic information in patients &gt;75 years. Sex or body weight Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, female subjects would have approximately 14 to 30% higher dasabuvir exposures than male subjects. A 10 kg change in body weight from 76 kg (median weight in the Phase 3 studies) would result in &lt;10% change in dasabuvir exposures. Race or ethnicity Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, Asian subjects had 29% to 39% higher dasabuvir exposures than non-Asian subjects. Renal impairment Pharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 150 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, with dasabuvir 400 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (CrCl: 60 to 89 ml/min), moderate (CrCl: 30 to 59 ml/min) and severe (CrCl: 15 to 29 ml/min) renal impairment, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, dasabuvir mean AUC values were 21% higher, 37% higher and 50% higher, respectively. Dasabuvir M1 AUC values were 6% lower, 10% lower, and 13% lower, respectively. The changes in dasabuvir exposures in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment are not considered to be clinically significant. Limited data in patients with end-stage renal disease indicate no clinically significant changes in exposure also in this patient group. No dose adjustment of dasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 4.2). Hepatic impairment Pharmacokinetics of the combination of dasabuvir 400 mg, with ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (ChildPugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, dasabuvir AUC values were 17% higher, 16% lower and 325% higher, respectively. The AUC values of dasabuvir M1 metabolite were unchanged, 57% lower, and 77% higher, respectively. Plasma protein binding of dasabuvir and its M1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolite were not meaningfully different in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to normal control subjects (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of dasabuvir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in paediatric patients has not been investigated (see section 4.2).

5.3 Preclinical safety data Dasabuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat micronucleus assays. Dasabuvir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study up to the highest dosage tested (2 g/kg/day), resulting in dasabuvir AUC exposures approximately 19-fold higher than those in humans at the recommended dose of 500 mg (250 mg twice daily). Similarly, dasabuvir was not carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study up to the highest dose tested (800 mg/kg/day), resulting in dasabuvir exposures approximately 19-fold higher than those in humans at 500 mg. Dasabuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rodents and were not teratogenic in two species. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of offspring were reported. The highest dasabuvir dose tested produced exposures equal to 16 to 24-fold (rat) or 6-fold (rabbit) the exposures in humans at the maximum recommended clinical dose. Dasabuvir was the predominant component observed in the milk of lactating rats, without effect on nursing pups. Elimination half-life in rat milk was slightly shorter than in plasma, AUC was about 2 fold of that in plasma. Since dasabuvir is a BCRP substrate, distribution to the milk may change if this transporter is inhibited or induced by co-administration of other medicinal products. Dasabuvirderived material was minimally transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats. 6.

What Exviera is and what it is used for Exviera contains the active substance dasabuvir. Exviera is an antiviral medicine used to treat adults with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus). Exviera works by stopping the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and infecting new cells, thus clearing the virus from your blood over a period of time. Exviera tablets do not work on their own. They are always taken with another antiviral medicine containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Some patients may also take an antiviral medicine called ribavirin. Your doctor will talk with you about which of these medicines to take with Exviera. It is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other antiviral medicines that you take with Exviera. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. 2. What you need to know before you take Exviera Do not take Exviera:  If you are allergic to dasabuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  If you have moderate to severe liver problems other than hepatitis C.

-  You or your partner must use an effective method of contraception during treatment. Contraceptive medicines that contains ethinyloestradiol cannot be used in combination with Exviera. Ask your doctor about the best contraception for you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Extra precautions are needed if Exviera is taken together with ribavirin. Ribavirin may cause severe birth defects. Ribavirin stays for a long time in the body after treatment is stopped, and effective contraception is therefore needed both during treatment and for some time afterwards.

-  There is a risk for birth defects when ribavirin is given to a female patient that becomes pregnant.

You will take Exviera for 8, 12 or 24 weeks. Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last. Do not stop taking Exviera unless your doctor tells you to. It is very important that you complete the full course of treatment. This will give the medicines the best chance to clear the hepatitis C virus infection.

 There may also be a risk for birth defects if ribavirin is taken by a male patient, whose female partner becomes pregnant.  Read the 'Contraception' section of the package leaflet for ribavirin very carefully. It is important that both men and women read the information.  If you or your partner becomes pregnant during treatment with Exviera and ribavirin or in the months that follow, you must contact your doctor immediately. Breastfeeding You should not breastfeed during treatment with Exviera. It is not known whether the active substance in Exviera (dasabuvir), passes into breast milk. Driving and using machines Some patients  have  reported  feeling  very  tired  when  taking  Exviera  with  other  medicines  for  their hepatitis C infection. If you feel tired, do not drive or use any machines. Exviera contains lactose If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 3.

How much to take The recommended dose is one tablet, twice a day. Take one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening. How to take  Take the tablets with food. The type of food is not important.  Swallow the tablets whole with water.  Do not chew, crush or break the tablets as they may have a bitter taste.
