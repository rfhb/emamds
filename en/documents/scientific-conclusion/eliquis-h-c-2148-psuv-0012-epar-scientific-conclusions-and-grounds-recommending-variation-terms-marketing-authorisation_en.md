## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for apixaban, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

The contraindication in lesion or condition at significant risk for major bleeding which is now in place for Eliquis does not allow for medical judgement, especially with regard to the prevention of VTE in surgery indications where, for example, an AV malformation or an aneurysm should not necessarily exclude a patient from receiving one of the new anticoagulants. This concern was viewed in perspective of safety profile of Eliquis during PSUR period and was acknowledged by PRAC. Therefore, it is requested that the contraindication about lesions and conditions is revised slightly allowing the prescribing physician some more room for clinical judgment on when to consider the listed lesions and conditions as absolute contraindications.

The potential consultation of a coagulation expert may be an obvious consideration for most emergency ward physicians treating a major bleeding complication to an overdose with an anticoagulant. However, a specific recommendation in the SmPC could be helpful to younger physicians and having a recommendation in the Pradaxa SmPC and not in the SmPCs for Xarelto and Eliquis may lead to misunderstandings.

Therefore, it is suggested to update of SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.9 to update information related to bleeding risk and management of bleeding.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Eliquis the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance apixaban is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
