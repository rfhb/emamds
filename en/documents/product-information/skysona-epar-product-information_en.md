## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Skysona is indicated for the treatment of early cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy in patients less than 18 years of age, with an ABCD1 genetic mutation, and for whom a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not available (see section 5.1).

4.2 Posology and method of administration Skysona must be administered in a qualified treatment centre by a physician(s) with experience in HSC transplantation and in the treatment of patients with neurological disorders. Posology Treatment consists of a single dose for infusion containing a dispersion of CD34 + cells in one or more infusion bags. The minimum recommended dose of Skysona is 5 × 10 6  CD34 +  cells/kg. In clinical studies doses up to 38.2 × 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg have been administered. Mobilisation and apheresis Patients are required to undergo HSC mobilisation followed by apheresis to obtain CD34 + stem cells which will be used for medicinal product manufacturing (see section 5.1 for description of the mobilisation regimen used in clinical studies). The patient's weight at first apheresis collection should be used to calculate the final dose. The minimum target number of CD34 +  cells to be collected is 12 × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg. If the minimum dose of Skysona 5 × 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg is not met after initial medicinal product manufacturing, the patient may undergo one or more additional cycles of mobilisation and apheresis, separated by at least 14 days, in order to obtain more cells for additional manufacture. A back-up collection of CD34 + stem cells of ≥ 1.5 × 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg is required. These cells must be collected from the patient and be cryopreserved prior to initiating conditioning and infusion with Skysona. The back-up collection may be needed for rescue treatment if there is: 1) compromise of Skysona after initiation of conditioning and before Skysona infusion, 2) primary engraftment failure, or 3) loss of engraftment after infusion with Skysona (see section 4.4). Pre-treatment conditioning The treating physician should confirm that Skysona therapy is appropriate for the patient before conditioning is initiated (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Myeloablative conditioning must be administered before infusion of Skysona (see section 5.1 for a description of the conditioning regimens used in clinical studies).

Conditioning should not begin until the complete set of infusion bag(s) constituting the dose of Skysona has been received at the administration site, and the availability of the back-up collection is confirmed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Skysona administration

See Method of Administration below and section 6.6 for details on Skysona administration and handling.

## After Skysona administration

Any blood products required within the first 3 months after Skysona infusion should be irradiated.

Special populations Previous gene therapy administration Skysona has not been studied in patients previously treated with a gene therapy medicinal product. There is no experience treating a patient more than once with Skysona. Renal impairment Skysona has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Patients should be assessed for renal impairment to ensure Skysona therapy is appropriate. No dose adjustment is required. Hepatic impairment Skysona has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients should be assessed for hepatic impairment to ensure Skysona therapy is appropriate. No dose adjustment is required . Female patients The safety and efficacy of Skysona in female patients have not been established. No data are available. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Skysona in children aged up to 3 years have not been established. No data are available. Patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Skysona has not been studied in patients with HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1, and HTLV-2. A negative serology test for HIV is necessary to ensure acceptance of apheresis material for Skysona manufacturing. Apheresis material from patients with a positive test for HIV will not be accepted for Skysona manufacturing. Method of administration Skysona is for intravenous use only. For detailed instructions on preparation, administration, accidental exposure and disposal of Skysona, see section 6.6. After completion of the conditioning, there must be a minimum of 48 hours of washout before Skysona infusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Before infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient's identity matches the unique patient information on the Skysona infusion bag(s). The total number of infusion bags to be administered should also be confirmed with the Lot Information Sheet (see section 4.4).

Skysona infusion should be completed as soon as possible and no more than 4 hours after thawing. Each infusion bag should be administered in less than 60 minutes. In the event that more than one infusion bag

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is provided, all infusion bags must be administered consecutively. The entire volume of each infusion bag should be infused.

Standard procedures for patient management in line with HSC transplantation should be followed after Skysona infusion.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Contraindications to the mobilisation agents and the conditioning agents must be considered. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability The traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. To ensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient should be kept for a period of 30 years after expiry date of the product. Autologous use Skysona is intended solely for autologous use and should under no circumstances be administered to other patients. Skysona must not be infused if the information on the patient-specific label on the infusion bag(s), Lot Information Sheet and metal cassette(s) do not match the intended patient. Mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning medicinal products Warnings and precautions of the mobilisation agents and the conditioning agents must be considered. Hypersensitivity reactions The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in Skysona may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Engraftment failure as measured by neutrophil engraftment Treatment with Skysona involves the infusion and engraftment of CD34 + HSCs that have been genetically modified ex vivo with a Lentiviral vector (LVV). Failure of neutrophil engraftment is a short-term but potentially severe risk, defined as failure to achieve 3 consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥ 500 cells/µL obtained on different days by Day 43 after infusion of Skysona (see section 5.1). Patients who experience neutrophil engraftment failure should receive rescue treatment with the back-up collection (see section 4.2). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Prolonged cytopenias

Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several months following conditioning and Skysona infusion and cases of pancytopenia have been reported. In clinical studies with Skysona, Grade 3 or higher cytopenias after Day 60 following infusion occurred in 26% of patients and included decreased platelet count (13%), decreased neutrophil count (17%), and decreased hemoglobin (2%). After 100 days following infusion, 16% of patients had any Grade 3 or higher cytopenia, including decreased platelet count (9%), decreased

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neutrophil count (11%); no patient had Grade 3 or higher decreased haemoglobin (0%). Blood counts should be monitored after Skysona infusion and patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of bleeding and infection.

## Risk of insertional oncogenesis

There are no reports of LVV-mediated insertional mutagenesis resulting in oncogenesis, including myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma, associated with Skysona. Nevertheless, there is a theoretical risk after treatment with Skysona. Clonal expansion resulting in clonal predominance without clinical evidence of malignancy has been detected in some patients treated with Skysona.

There are no data showing an effect of Skysona treatment on the adrenal insufficiency related to ALD. Replacement therapy should be continued.

Patients should be monitored at least annually for myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma (including with a complete blood count) for 15 years post treatment with Skysona. If myelodysplasia, leukaemia, or lymphoma is detected in a patient who received Skysona, blood samples should be collected for integration site analysis. Serological testing All patients should be tested for HIV-1/-2 prior to mobilisation and apheresis to ensure acceptance of the apheresis material for Skysona manufacturing (see section 4.2). Anti-retroviral use Patients should not take anti-retroviral medicinal products from at least one month prior to mobilisation (see section 4.5). If a patient requires anti-retrovirals for HIV prophylaxis, Skysona treatment, including mobilisation and apheresis of CD34 + cells through Skysona infusion, should be delayed until an HIV infection could be adequately ruled out according to local guidance for HIV testing. Interference with serology testing It is important to note that patients who have received Skysona are likely to test positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV due to LVV provirus insertion, resulting in a false positive test for HIV. Therefore, patients who have received Skysona should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay. Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation Patients treated with Skysona should not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation at any time in the future. This information is provided in the Patient Information Leaflet and also in the Patient Alert Card which must be given to the patient. After Skysona administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients are expected to enrol in a registry-based study and will be followed in the registry in order to better understand the long-term safety and efficacy of Skysona.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains 391-1564 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 20-78% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Patients should not take anti-retroviral medicinal products from at least one month prior to mobilisation until at least apheresis is completed (see section 4.4).

There is no opportunity for germline transmission of the LVV that encodes an ABCD1 cDNA for human ALDP after treatment with Skysona, therefore the likelihood that an offspring would have general somatic expression of the lentiviral vector that encodes an ABCD1 cDNA for human ALDP is considered negligible.

No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Skysona is not expected to interact with the hepatic cytochrome P-450 family of enzymes or drug transporters. Live vaccines The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Skysona treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended during the 6 weeks preceding the start of myeloablative conditioning, and until haematological recovery following treatment with Skysona. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females There are insufficient exposure data to provide a precise recommendation on duration of contraception following treatment with Skysona. Women of childbearing potential and men capable of fathering a child and their female partners must use an effective method of contraception (intrauterine device or combination of hormonal and barrier contraception) from start of mobilisation through at least 6 months after administration of Skysona. The SmPC of the conditioning agents should be consulted for information on the need for effective contraception in patients who undergo conditioning. A negative serum pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilisation and re-confirmed prior to conditioning procedures and before medicinal product administration. Pregnancy No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with Skysona were not performed. Skysona must not be used during pregnancy because of conditioning (see section 4.3). It is unknown whether Skysona transduced cells have the potential to be transferred in utero to a foetus. Pregnancy after treatment with Skysona should be discussed with the treating physician. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Skysona is excreted in human milk. The effect of administration of Skysona to mothers on their breast-fed children has not been studied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Skysona must not be administered to women who are breast-feeding.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of Skysona on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.

Data are available on the risk of infertility with conditioning. It is therefore advised to consider cryopreservation of semen or ova before treatment. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Skysona has no influence on the ability to drive or use machines. The effect of the mobilisation agents and the conditioning agents on the ability to drive or use machines, or engage in activities such as cycling or skateboarding, must be considered. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety of Skysona was evaluated in 51 patients with CALD in Studies ALD-102, ALD-104, and LTF-304 (see section 5.1). The most serious adverse reaction attributed to Skysona was pancytopenia (3.9%). Given the small patient population and size of cohorts, adverse reactions in the table below do not provide a complete perspective on the nature and frequency of these events. Information related to safety endpoints used in the studies is provided in section 5.1. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10) and common (≥1/100 and &lt;1/10). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. Tables 1, 2, and 3 are lists of adverse reactions attributed to mobilisation/apheresis, conditioning, and Skysona, respectively, experienced by patients with CALD in clinical studies with Skysona.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

Table 3 Adverse reactions attributed to Skysona Description of selected adverse reactions Haematopoietic reconstitution Two serious reactions of pancytopenia occurred in two patients, with onset following neutrophil engraftment. Both patients had delayed hematopoietic reconstitution requiring prolonged support with blood and platelet transfusions as well as growth factors (G-CSF and eltrombopag). One patient had intercurrent parvovirus. Both events were ongoing at least 18 months after Skysona infusion. Infusion-related reactions Vomiting occurred in two patients on the day of infusion, potentially related to the cryopreservation agent. Premedication may be utilized at physician discretion.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: not yet assigned

## Mechanism of action

Skysona adds functional copies of the ABCD1 cDNA into patients' HSCs through transduction of autologous CD34 +  cells with Lenti-D LVV. After Skysona infusion, transduced CD34 + HSCs engraft in the bone marrow and differentiate into various cell types, including monocytes (CD14 + ) that migrate to the brain where they are believed to further differentiate into macrophages and cerebral microglia that can produce functional ALDP. The functional ALDP can then enable the local degradation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the brain, which in turn can stabilise the disease by preventing further inflammation and demyelination. However, it is not anticipated that Skysona treatment will affect other manifestations of ALD including adrenal insufficiency. Impact of Skysona treatment on adrenomyeloneuropathy has not been studied. Following successful engraftment with genetically modified cells, the expression of ALDP is expected to be life-long. Pharmacodynamic effects One month after Skysona treatment, all evaluable patients in Study ALD-102 (N = 25) produced ALDP in CD14 +  peripheral blood cells with a median (min, max) CD14 +  ALDP+ of 29.50% (8.20%, 49.65%) demonstrating early expression of the transgene. For patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, CD14 + ALDP+ cells generally declined slightly after Skysona infusion and stabilized by approximately Month 6. Patients had a Month 6 median (min, max) CD14 +  %ALDP+ of 22.20% (2.00%, 71.40%) in Study ALD-102 (N = 27). The percentage of ALDP+ cells remained generally stable in CD14 + peripheral blood cells through Month 24 with a median (min, max) of 16.90% (5.80%, 44.60%) in Study ALD-102 (N = 26). The percentage of CD14 + ALDP+ cells continued to be stable at last follow-up through Month 60, demonstrating long-term expression of transgenic ALDP in the progeny of haematopoietic stem cells. Clinical efficacy and safety The safety and efficacy of Skysona were assessed in an open-label, single-arm study in patients with CALD (ALD-102; N = 32) and compared to the efficacy and safety of allo-HSCT in patients with CALD in a contemporaneous comparator study (ALD-103; N = 59). All patients who completed or discontinued Study ALD-102 were asked to participate in a long-term follow-up study, LTF-304. Enrolment in Study ALD-102 is complete with 32 patients enrolled and treated; 30 patients are evaluable for the Month 24 primary efficacy endpoint. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition, a second open-label, single-arm study (ALD-104; N = 19) is ongoing; no patients have reached the Month 24 evaluation timepoint and thus are not included in any efficacy analyses.

## Mobilisation and apheresis

All patients were administered a median dose of 10 µg/kg of G-CSF for a minimum of 4 days to mobilise stem cells prior to the apheresis procedure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Study ALD-102, patients were assessed on the morning after the 4 th G-CSF dose. If the peripheral blood CD34 +  count on that morning was &lt;50 cells/µL, a 5 th  dose of G-CSF was administered and plerixafor was administered at a dose of 0.24 mg/kg of body weight approximately 10 hours prior to the next day's apheresis collection. Plerixafor could be given daily for up to 4 days. Eleven of the 32 (34.4%) patients in Study ALD-102 received plerixafor.

For all patients, 1 cycle of mobilisation and apheresis was sufficient to collect the minimum number of CD34 +  cells to manufacture Skysona.

Study ALD-102 was an open-label, single-arm, 24-month study that included a total of 32 patients with CALD treated with Skysona. In study ALD-102, early CALD was defined as: a Loes score between 0.5 and 9 (inclusive), gadolinium enhancement on MRI of demyelinating lesions and a neurologic function score (NFS) of ≤ 1, indicating limited changes in neurologic function. Patients were excluded from Study ALD-102 if they had a willing and available HLA-matched sibling HSC donor. The median (min, max) age at Skysona infusion was 6.0 (4, 14) years, 100% of patients were males, and 46.9% were White/Caucasian. The median (min, max) Loes score at baseline was 2.00 (1.0, 9.0). Of the 32 patients, 31 had an NFS of 0 and one had an NFS of 1 at baseline. All patients that completed ALD-102 enrolled

Pre-treatment conditioning In Study ALD-102, 32 patients received pharmacokinetically-dosed busulfan in conjunction with cyclophosphamide prior to treatment with Skysona. Busulfan was administered with a recommended cumulative AUC of 17,000 to 21,000 µmol*min/L over four days of conditioning. For patients ≤ 12 kg, busulfan was dosed at 1.1 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours and for patients &gt; 12 kg busulfan was dosed at 0.8 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 4 days. Busulfan dose adjustments were made as needed based on pharmacokinetic monitoring. Patients received anti-seizure, anti-fungal, and antibiotic prophylaxis in accordance with institutional guidelines. The recommended dose of cyclophosphamide was 50 mg/kg/day. The median (min, max) daily average busulfan dose was 3.5 (2.8, 4.2) mg/kg/day (N = 31) and the median (min, max) estimated average daily AUC was 4729 (4039, 5041) µmol*min/L/day (N = 31). In Study ALD-104, 19 patients received pharmacokinetically-dosed busulfan in conjunction with fludarabine prior to treatment with Skysona. Skysona administration All patients were administered Skysona as an intravenous infusion with a median (min, max) dose of 11.78 (5.0, 38.2) × 10 6 CD34 +  cells/kg (N = 51). After Skysona administration In Study ALD-102, patients received G-CSF at the investigator's discretion per institutional practice following treatment with Skysona. Of the 32 treated patients, 24 received G-CSF following treatment with Skysona. In Study ALD-104, patients were to receive G-CSF beginning on Day 5 following treatment with Skysona.

for long-term follow-up in the LTF-304 study. The median (min, max) duration of follow-up was 38.59 (13.4, 82.7) months.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who had none of the 6 Major Functional Disabilities (MFDs), were alive, did not receive a second allo-HSCT or rescue cell administration, and had not withdrawn or been lost to follow-up at Month 24 (i.e., Month 24 MFD-free survival). The 6 MFDs are: loss of communication, cortical blindness, tube feeding, total incontinence, wheelchair dependence, or complete loss of voluntary movement.

An analysis was conducted after 30 patients were evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint, Month 24 MFD-free survival. Twenty-seven out of 30 patients (90%, 95% CI: 73.5, 97.9) achieved Month 24 MFDfree survival, with the lower bound of 95% CI above the clinically meaningful benchmark (Month 24 MFD-free survival rate of 50%) indicating that treatment with Skysona provides clinically meaningful benefits by preserving motor function and communication ability and improves survival when compared to untreated patients at an early stage of cerebral disease. A contemporaneous comparator study was conducted in 59 patients with CALD treated with allo-HSCT (ALD-103 Safety Population). A subset of 27 patients (ALD-103 Efficacy Population) was matched to the ALD-102 population for baseline Loes score, presence of contrast enhancement and NFS score. This population was further divided into those who received an allo-HSCT from a matched sibling donor (N = 10; ALD-103 Efficacy Population with MSD) and those who received an allo-HSCT from an alternative donor source, i.e., not a matched sibling donor (N = 17; ALD-103 Efficacy Population without MSD). MFD-free survival over time and overall survival were analysed in 32 patients in ALD-102 and compared to 17 patients treated with allo-HSCT in the ALD-103 Efficacy Population (without MSD), which are presented in Table 4 and Figure 1. Skysona showed a durable effect on MFD-free survival, with most patients (26/27, 96.3%) that enrolled in LTF-304 remaining alive and maintaining their MFD-free status through their last follow-up on study, including 14 patients with 5 or more years of follow-up. One patient refused further follow-up. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

The neurologic function score (NFS) was used as a secondary endpoint to evaluate 15 domains of neurological function; it has a total maximum score of 25. A score of 0 denotes no abnormality in the assessed areas of neurological function. At baseline, patients were required to have an NFS ≤ 1. In ALD-102, 26 of 28 evaluable patients maintained an NFS less than or equal to 1 through Month 24 and 24 of those patients had no change in their NFS, which showed maintenance of neurological function in the majority of patients. The majority of patients in ALD-102 maintained cognitive function (IQ, including performance IQ sub-measures) within the normal range (100 ± 15 points), with minimal decline and with stabilization by Month 24. A small subgroup of patients who had higher Loes scores at baseline tended to have a less favourable outcome. The primary safety endpoint, the proportion of evaluable patients who experienced either acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) in ALD-102 vs. ALD-103 by Month 24, was 0 vs. 52%. The proportion of all patients who experienced either acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD in ALD102/ALD-104 vs. ALD-103 is summarized in Table 5. Medicinal product no longer authorised

a  For censored observations in the ALD-103 Safety Population, it was assumed that no GVHD was observed in any category Neutrophil engraftment was monitored as a secondary endpoint and was defined as achieving 3 consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥ 500 cells/µL obtained on different days by Day 43 after Skysona infusion. In clinical studies neutrophil engraftment occurred on median (min, max) Day 13 (11, 41) after Skysona infusion (see section 4.4) (N = 32, ALD-102; N = 17, ALD-104) compared to Day 17 (12, 36) in ALD-103 (N = 53). No primary or secondary neutrophil engraftment failure was observed in subjects in ALD-102/ALD-104 (N=51), compared to 10/59 (16.9%) subjects in ALD-103. Platelet engraftment was monitored as a secondary endpoint and was defined as achieving 3 consecutive unsupported platelet counts of ≥ 20 × 10 9 cells/L obtained on different days after Skysona infusion, with no platelet transfusions administered for 7 days immediately preceding and during the evaluation period. In clinical studies, platelet engraftment occurred on median (min, max) Day 32 (14, 108) after Skysona infusion (N = 32, ALD-102; N = 15, ALD-104) compared to Day 26 (13, 67) in ALD-103 (N = 47). No patients experienced transplant-related mortality (TRM), a secondary endpoint, at 100 days or 365 days after transplant in ALD-102 and ALD-104. In contrast, 2/59 (3.4%) patients experienced TRM at 100 days and 8/59 (13.6%) patients experienced TRM at 365 days after transplant in the ALD-103 Safety Population. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Medicinal product no longer authorised

Skysona is an autologous gene therapy medicinal product consisting of autologous cells that have been genetically modified ex vivo . The nature of Skysona is such that conventional studies on pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are not applicable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Conventional mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted.

The pharmacology, toxicology and genotoxicity of the Lenti-D LVV used for transduction were evaluated in vitro and in vivo . In an in vitro immortalization assay, Lenti-D LVV-transduced mouse bone marrow cells showed strongly reduced mutagenic potential as compared to positive control vectors. Integration site analysis of pre-transplantation Lenti-D LVV-transduced human CD34 +  HSCs demonstrated the expected self-inactivating LVV integration profile, with no enrichment for insertion in or near cancerrelated genes.

Do not re-freeze after thawing.

A pivotal GLP-compliant combined toxicity, genotoxicity and biodistribution study of Lenti-D LVV-transduced mobilized peripheral blood CD34 +  HSCs was conducted in myeloablated immunodeficient mice. There was no evidence of toxicity, genotoxicity (insertional mutagenesis resulting in oncogenic mutations) or oncogenesis (tumorigenicity) related to Lenti-D LVV integration. Integration site analysis of post-transplantation bone marrow cells demonstrated no preferred integration in the proximity of or within cancer-related genes. An additional study with Lenti-D LVV-transduced human CD34 +  HSCs administered to myeloablated, immunodeficient mice demonstrated engraftment of humanorigin microglial cells within brain tissues with no toxicity or tumorigenicity. 6.

The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Skysona is marketed, a system aimed to control distribution to Skysona is ensured as a routine risk minimisation measure. The following requirements need to be fulfilled before the product is prescribed, manufactured, dispensed and used:

-  Skysona will only be available through bluebird bio-qualified treatment centres (QTCs) that have demonstrable procedures and a quality agreement to ensure traceability of the patient`s cells and manufactured drug product between the treating hospital and manufacturing site. The traceability system, i.e. the Service Portal, will be initiated prior to apheresis collection of donor cells with a set of identifier numbers specific for the individual patient. These numbers will be documented by the QTC in the site records and patient medical records. All identifier numbers will additionally be documented and tracked by bluebird bio and the drug product manufacturer in records that accompany the autologous cells and the systems used to track the workflow.
-  The treatment centre qualification process includes mandatory training of the healthcare professionals of the hospital, including on ordering, management and handling of Skysona as well as on its Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). The process of enrolling patients for treatment with Skysona will be supported by the Service Portal and includes a selection of the indication in accordance with the SmPC or 'other use', which will alert of intended off-label use.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient or carer

## Skysona 2-30 × 10 6  cells/mL dispersion for infusion

elivaldogene autotemcel (autologous CD34 + cells encoding ABCD1 gene)

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you or your child may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

Skysona is a type of medicine called gene therapy. It is made specifically for each patient, using the patient's own blood stem cells.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you/your child is given this medicine because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask the doctor or nurse. -If you get any side effects, talk to the doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. -The doctor or nurse will give you a Patient Alert Card which contains important safety information about the treatment with Skysona. Read it carefully and follow the instructions on it. -Carry the Patient Alert Card with you at all times and always show it to any doctor or nurse who sees you or if you go to the hospital. What is in this leaflet 1. What Skysona is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you or your child is given Skysona 3. How Skysona is made and given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Skysona 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Skysona is and what it is used for Skysona is used to treat a serious genetic disease called cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) in children and adolescents younger than 18 years old. People with CALD have an alteration in the gene that makes a protein called adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). People with CALD either cannot make this protein or have a protein that does not work well. This leads to the build-up of very long chain fatty acids in the body, particularly in the brain. These fatty acids cause severe damage to brain cells. If untreated, this damage will lead to problems with vision, hearing, talking, walking and/or thinking, and will likely lead to death. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cells called stem cells are collected from the patient's blood. They are then modified in a laboratory to insert a working gene for making ALDP. When you/your child is given Skysona, which is made up of these modified cells, the cells will start making ALDP, which will then break down the very long chain fatty acids. This is expected to slow down the progression of the disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Skysona is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein (intravenously). For more information on what happens before and during treatment, see section 3, How Skysona is made and given.

## 2. What you need to know before you or your child is given Skysona

## You or your child must not be given Skysona if you or your child:

- -are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

-are allergic to any of the ingredients in the medicines your child will be given before treatment with Skysona (see section 3). Warnings and precautions  Information about cell-based medicinal products, like Skysona, must be kept for 30 years at the hospital. The information kept about you or your child will be your name and the batch number of Skysona received.  Skysona is made from your or your child's own stem cells and should only be given to you or your child.  An ingredient of Skysona called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may cause an allergic reaction, so the doctor or nurse should watch closely during and following the infusion for any signs or symptoms of a reaction. Before the treatment with Skysona the doctor will  check the kidneys and liver;  check for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV);  discuss possible impacts of the conditioning medicine on fertility (see below under ' Fertility in men and women ');  prepare for stem cells to be taken (mobilisation) and then clear the cells from your child's bone marrow ready for Skysona to be given (conditioning). For more information on this, including possible side effects of the medicines used, see sections 3 and 4. After the treatment with Skysona  Blood counts may remain low for more than 2 months after conditioning and treatment with Skysona. During that time, there may be a risk for bleeding and infection. The doctor will monitor this using blood tests and will tell you when blood counts have returned to safe levels.  If you require a blood transfusion within the first 3 months after having received Skysona, blood products should be irradiated. This will reduce the white blood cells, called lymphocytes, and minimise the risk of a reaction to the transfusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  After treatment with Skysona, you will not be able to donate blood, organs, tissues or cells. This is because Skysona is a gene therapy medicine.
-  Adding a new gene into the stem cells could theoretically cause blood cancers (myelodysplasia, leukaemia, and lymphoma). After the treatment, the doctor will monitor you at least every year, which will include a blood test, for at least 15 years and the doctor will check for any signs of cancer of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blood. Contact the doctor if you have fever, you are more tired than usual, are losing weight without trying, or if you have frequent nosebleeds, bleeding, or bruising.

-  Skysona is prepared using parts of HIV, which have been altered so that they cannot cause HIV infection. The virus is used to insert a working gene into your child's blood stem cells.
-  Although this medicine will not give an HIV infection, having Skysona in the blood may cause a false positive HIV test result because some HIV tests recognise a piece of HIV that is used to make Skysona. If the patient tests positive for HIV following treatment, please contact the doctor or nurse.

Women who could become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before starting mobilisation, before given conditioning medicine, and before Skysona treatment in order to confirm that she is not pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant after treatment with Skysona, she should contact her treating physician.

When Skysona treatment cannot be completed or fails Before receiving Skysona you or your child will be given conditioning medicine in order to remove cells from the existing bone marrow. If Skysona cannot be given after having the conditioning medicine or if the modified stem cells do not take hold (engraft) in the  body, the doctor may give you an infusion of your own original blood stem cells that were collected and stored before the treatment started (see also section 3, How Skysona is made and given) . If you or your child get your original cells back, you or your child will not have any treatment benefit. Other medicines and Skysona Tell your doctor if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. Your child should not take any medicines for HIV infection from at least one month before having the mobilisation medicines (see also section 3, How Skysona is made and given). If such medicines are needed, the procedure will be postponed. It is not recommended that live vaccines be given within 6 weeks before receiving the conditioning medicine to prepare for Skysona treatment, nor after treatment while the immune system (the body's defence system) is recovering.  Talk to the doctor if there is a need to have any vaccinations. Contraception, pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility Contraception in men and women Women who could become pregnant and men capable of fathering a child must start using an effective method of contraception from before the blood stem cells are collected and continue until at least 6 months after receiving Skysona. Effective methods of contraception include intra-uterine device or a combination of oral contraceptive (also known as the pill) and condoms. Also read the package leaflet for the conditioning medicine for information regarding contraception. Pregnancy Skysona must not be given during pregnancy because of the conditioning medicine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The added gene from Skysona will not be passed on to the foetus in case of a pregnancy and the unborn child is still at risk of inheriting the original ABCD1 gene, which, when absent or does not work, causes adrenoleukodystrophy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

Skysona must not be given when breast-feeding. It is not known whether the ingredients of Skysona can pass into breast milk.

## Fertility in men and women

It may no longer be possible to become pregnant or father a child after receiving conditioning medicine. If you are concerned, you should discuss this with the doctor before treatment.

Driving and using machines Skysona has no effect on the ability to drive or use machines. However, the mobilisation and conditioning medicines may cause dizziness and tiredness. You or your child should avoid activities requiring balance (for example, cycling or skateboarding) and driving or using machines if you or your child feel dizzy, tired, or unwell. Skysona contains sodium This medicine contains 391-1564 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This is equivalent to 20 - 78% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 3. How Skysona is made and given About 2 months before treatment with Skysona, you or your child will be given medicines that will move blood stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream (mobilisation). The blood stem cells can then be collected by a machine that separates blood components (apheresis machine). It may take more than 1 session to collect enough blood stem cells both to make Skysona and to store as replacement cells if Skysona cannot be given or does not work. How you or your child is given Skysona Skysona is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein, this is often through a central venous catheter. It can only be given in a specialised hospital by doctors who are experienced in treating patients with CALD, transplanting bone marrow, and using gene therapy medicines. Skysona is a one-time treatment. It will not be given again. If Skysona does not work, you will come back to the treatment center and you will receive a transfusion of your original replacement stem cells. These cells do not contain the medicine and therefore your CALD will not be treated. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product

 This medicinal product contains genetically modified human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Skysona should take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves, protective clothing and eye protection) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases.  Keep the infusion bag(s) in the metal cassette(s) and store in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen at ≤ -140 °C until ready for thaw and administration. Preparation for infusion  Skysona is shipped from the manufacturing facility to the infusion centre storage facility in a cryoshipper, which may contain multiple metal cassettes intended for a single patient. Each metal cassette contains one infusion bag with Skysona. A patient may have multiple infusion bags.  Remove each metal cassette from liquid nitrogen storage and remove each infusion bag from the metal cassette.  Confirm that Skysona is printed on the infusion bag(s).  Confirm that patient identity matches the unique patient identification information located on the Skysona infusion bag(s) and on the Lot Information Sheet. Skysona is intended solely for autologous use. Do not infuse Skysona if the information on the patient-specific label on the infusion bag does not match the intended patient.  Ensure that you have the correct number of infusion bags and confirm each infusion bag is within the expiry date using the accompanying Lot Information Sheet.  Each infusion bag should be inspected for any breaches of integrity before thawing and infusion. If an infusion bag is compromised, follow the local guidelines for handling of waste of human-derived material and contact bluebird bio immediately. Thawing  If more than one infusion bag is provided, thaw and administer each infusion bag completely before proceeding to thaw the next infusion bag.  Do not sample, alter, irradiate, or refreeze the medicinal product.  Thaw Skysona at 37 °C in a water bath or dry bath. Thawing of each infusion bag takes approximately 2 to 4 minutes. Do not over thaw the medicinal product. Do not leave the medicinal product unattended and do not submerge the infusion ports in a water bath. Medicinal product no longer authorised
