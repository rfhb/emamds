In view of available data on pancreatitis, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between durvalumab and pancreatitis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing durvalumab should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
