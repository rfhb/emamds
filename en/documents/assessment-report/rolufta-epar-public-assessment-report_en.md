## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Rolufta (umeclidinium bromide) inhalation powder predispensed, 55 micrograms has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with the Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC.

The initial marketing authorisation application (MAA) for umeclidinium bromide was approved on 28th April 2014 under the trademark Incruse (EMEA/H/C/002809). The application for Rolufta concerns the strength of 55 micrograms inhalation powder predispensed and consists only of Module 1 information.

As a consequence, quality, efficacy and safety of Rolufta medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, efficacy and safety profile of Incruse.

The Rolufta informed consent application concerns the following presentations:

- Inhaler containing 7 doses (the inhaler contains one aluminium foil laminate blister of 7 doses)
- Inhaler containing 30 doses (the inhaler contains one aluminium foil laminate blister of 30 doses)
- Multipack of 3 inhalers containing 30 doses each.

The benefit-risk of Rolufta is considered to be positive, as it is a duplicate of Incruse, in the following indication:

- Rolufta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Umeclidinium bromide is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist administrated by inhalation. It is competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic cholinergic receptors on airway smooth muscle, exerting a bronchodilatory activity. Therefore, Rolufta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Incruse application, the quality data in support of the Rolufta application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Incruse dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Since Rolufta application is an informed consent of Incruse application, the non-clinical data in support of the Rolufta application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of Incruse dossier, which have been assessed and authorised (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Umeclidinium PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L and is not a persistent, bioaccummulative, and toxic (PBT) substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore umeclidinium is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Some environmental effects studies were additionally conducted with umeclidinium and the results and associated study reports were provided in the non-clinical dossier of Incruse. For this application no additional studies, neither for the Activated Sludge, Respiration Inhibition Test (OECD 209) are required.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted since this application is an informed consent of the Incruse application.

Umeclidinium is exempt from a full ERA as the PECSURFACEWATER does not exceed the action limit of 0.01 µg/L; therefore, the Activated Sludge, Respiration Inhibition Test (OECD 209) is not required.

## 2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The CHMP considered there were no non-clinical objections to the granting of the authorisation of this informed consent application for Rolufta.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

Since Rolufta application is an informed consent of Incruse application, the clinical data in support of the Rolufta application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of Incruse dossier, which have been assessed and authorised (including all post-marketing procedures).

|                                     | Pregnancy There are no data from the use of umeclidinium bromide in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Umeclidinium bromide should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether umeclidinium bromide is excreted in human milk. A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue INCRUSE/ Rolufta therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Conclusion

The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 7 above described has been revised as recommended by the PRAC to take in account the changes requested in the PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010263/201604 and is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. PSUR submission

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c (7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## 2.8. Product information

## 2.8.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

The MAH has included the results from the Relvar Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta user testing process as well as providing a User Bridging Report for the originator product. There are no significant changes for the proposed patient leaflet.

## Additional monitoring

Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rolufta (Umeclidinium) is included in the additional monitoring list as a Post Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) has been imposed at the time of authorisation for Incruse (Umeclidinium) furthermore it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

Rolufta is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. The CHMP has previously reviewed data on quality, safety and efficacy of the original dossier (Incruse) and considered the benefit / risk balance favourable.

The benefit-risk of Rolufta is considered to be positive, as it is a duplicate of Incruse, in the following indication:

- Rolufta is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
