## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. submitted on 24 November 2017 an application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Trydonis, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 10 November 2016. The eligibility to the centralised procedure under Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was based on demonstration of  interest of patients at Community level.

The applicant applied for the following indication:

Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC - relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder for an authorised medicinal product.

The application submitted is composed of administrative information with a letter from the MAH of Trimbow, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A, allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data.

This application is submitted as a multiple of Trimbow authorised on 17 July 2017 in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision CW/0001/2015 on the granting of a class waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific Advice

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 February 2013 and 10 April 2013. The Scientific Advice pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the development and on the Phase III studies' design

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as part of the dossier.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Problem statement

## 2.1.1. Disease or condition

COPD is strongly linked to tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking and is a male predominant condition, in COPD clinical trials in developed countries generally about two thirds of included patients are male and for both males and females the average age tends to be in the early sixties. In poor countries the male predominance is not as marked as women may develop COPD as a result of cooking over open fires. The prevalence is quite variable on a local basis with higher prevalence linked to lower affluence and social status. Screening would be possible by mass measurement of lung function which is cheap, easy, and noninvasive, but is not done in practice. There have been no substantial trials of the value of screening for COPD. Tobacco smoking cessation or non/never smoking is an effective measure and societal efforts have been made in that direction rather than into screening programmes.

## 2.1.2. Biologic features

COPD is characterised by cough, excess sputum production, airways narrowing leading to air trapping and hyperinflation of the chest, and loss of lung tissue (emphysema). In its more advanced stages it causes strain and eventually failure, of the cardiac right ventricle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.1.3. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis

Clinical presentation tends to be as cough and breathlessness in a heavy cigarette smoker and is unusual before approximately the age of forty.

Exacerbations in COPD are driven by episodes of acute inflammation, usually following a viral or bacterial infection. While current maintenance therapies prevent exacerbations in many COPD patients, exacerbation events in others remain poorly controlled, resulting in frequent use of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics and, in many cases, recurrent hospital admissions. This is particularly exemplified in a sub-population of patients termed frequent exacerbators. Despite treatment, some patients do not regain their baseline lung function following an exacerbation and repeated events can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function, resulting in a worsening overall quality of life for patients and a significant burden on healthcare resources.

The prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality is directly linked to the extent of lung damage.

## 2.1.4. Management

Management is through smoking cessation, pharmacological intervention with bronchodilators and antiinflammatory agents and, when necessary treatment of respiratory infections, physical rehabilitation is aimed primarily at muscle strengthening, and in advanced cases long term domiciliary oxygen administration is helpful and has a proven benefit on lung function. Some patients are suitable for lung volume reduction surgery to reduce non-gas exchanging thoracic space. Once developed the condition is only partly reversible so more treatment options are always welcome.

## About the product

This is an informed consent application in accordance with article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC.

The product of this application is a duplicate with identical composition and documentation as Trimbow 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation, authorized on 17 July 2017, marketingauthorisation holder, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A.

Approval was granted for the following indication:

Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).

## Type of Application and aspects on development

Trydonis 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation, the medicinal product of this marketing authorisation application, is a duplicate of Trimbow 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation. Trydonis 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substance, and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product Trimbow 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation.

The MAH for the authorised medicinal product and for the product applied for in the informed consent application is the same, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A letter of consent to grant full and permanent access to the dossier (module 1 to 5) of the reference product Trimbow to fulfil its obligations as MAH as described in Directive 2001/83/EC has been provided with this submission.

## 2.2. Compliance with GLP, GMP, GCP

## GLP

All pivotal non-clinical studies were performed to GLP

## GMP inspection(s)

No GMP inspection is requested based on this application.

## GCP

With respect to GCP compliance the Applicant stated within the MAA that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with local regulation and guidance, with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations. Study subjects/patients were accorded all rights granted by the Declaration of Helsinki.

## 2.3. Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Trimbow application, the quality data in support of the Beclometasone / Formoterol / Glycopyrronium bromide Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Trimbow dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.4. Non Clinical aspects

Trydonis is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Reference is made to TRIMBOW (EMEA/H/C/004257, EU/1/17/1208). The applicant refers to module 4 of the TRIMBOW MA.  Therefore,  the  non-clinical  data  in  support  of  the  Trydonis  MAA  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  nonclinical  data  of  TRIMBOW  dossier,  which  have  been  assessed  and  authorised  by  the  CHMP.  No  new  nonclinical data has been submitted.

The  Applicant  provided  an  environmental  risk  assessment  in  accordance  with  the  'Guideline  on  the environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use'  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2). The PEC values in Phase I for all active ingredients (beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), formoterol fumarate dehydrate (FF), and glycopyrronium bromide (GB)) are below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. For the active substances  FF  and  GB  no  assessment  in  Phase  II  Tier  A  is  required.  BDP  and  its  active  metabolite beclometasone monopropionate (B17MP) are glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids play a role in many physiological  processes  and  act  as  endocrine  disruptors.  Therefore,  according  to  the  EMA  guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  a  tailored  environmental  risk  assessment  strategy  should  be  followed  to address its specific mechanism of action irrespective of the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.

The  Applicant  provided  acceptable  experimental  values  on  log  KOW  of  -0.02  and  -1.35  for  FF  and  GB, respectively. No further PBT assessment is required. For B17MP an experimental value of 3.49 is available

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and accepted by the assessor. The potential to bioaccumulate should be considered in Phase II Tier B for this active ingredient.

## 3. Overall conclusion and benefit risk assessment

Trydonis  87  micrograms  /5  micrograms  /9  micrograms  pressurised  inhalation,  solution  (beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate  dihydrate/glycopyrronium) is submitted  under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC.

The  reference  product  for  this  application  is  TRIMBOW  87  micrograms  /5  micrograms  /9  micrograms pressurised inhalation, solution (EMEA/H/C/004257, EU/1/17/1208).

Trydonis and TRIMBOW have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substances and the same pharmaceutical form. Therefore, the benefit-risk of Trydonis is considered to be positive in the following indication:

Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease (COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1)

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Trydonis is favourable in the following indication:

Trydonis is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).
