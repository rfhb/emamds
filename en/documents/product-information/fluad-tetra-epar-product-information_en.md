For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension for injection (injection). Milky-white suspension.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Prophylaxis of influenza in adults 50 years of age and older.

Fluad Tetra should be used in accordance with official recommendations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

One 0.5 ml dose.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Fluad Tetra in children from birth to less than 18 years has not been established. Currently available safety and immunogenicity data in children from 6 months to less than 6 years of age are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on posology can be made.

## Method of administration

For intramuscular injection only.

The preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.

The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

For instructions for preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the components of the adjuvant, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible trace residues such as ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).

A severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in patients with febrile illness until the fever is resolved.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with all injectable vaccines, Fluad Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Anxiety-related reactions

Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to prevent influenza.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## Potassium

This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No clinical data on concomitant administration of Fluad Tetra with other vaccines are available. If this vaccine is to be used at the same time as another vaccine, it should be administered at separate injection sites and preferably on different limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified by any co-administration.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

This medicine is not indicated in women of childbearing potential (see section 4.1). It is not to be used in women who are, or may be, pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of Fluad Tetra in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.

## Fertility

No human fertility data are available. Animal data have not shown effects on female fertility. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Fluad Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, avoid driving or using machines if your ability to react is reduced due to some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8, such as fatigue, which may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Adults 50 years of age and older

The safety of Fluad Tetra has been evaluated in three clinical studies in which 1 027 adults 50 to less than 65 years of age (Study V118\\_23) and 4 269 elderly subjects 65 years of age and older (Studies V118\\_20 and V118\\_18) received Fluad Tetra.

Commonly reported (≥10%) adverse reactions in adults 50 to less than 65 years of age were injection site pain (47.1%), fatigue (29.5%), headache (22.2%), arthralgia (13.7%) and myalgia (13.0%) (V118\\_23).

Commonly reported (≥10%) adverse reactions across both studies in elderly subjects 65 years of age and older were injection site pain (16.3% and 31.9%), fatigue (10.5% and 16.0%) and headache (10.8% and 12.0%) (for V118\\_18 and V118\\_20, respectively).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 -&lt;1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1 000 &lt;1/100); Frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Paediatric population

Fluad Tetra is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2. Safety information in the paediatric population is presented in section 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are no post-marketing data available for Fluad Tetra and limited data for adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV, trivalent formulation) in the paediatric population.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdose is unlikely to have any untoward effect.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02

## Mechanism of action

Fluad Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and two B types) contained in the vaccine. This vaccine induces humoral antibodies against the haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. Specific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus, but the HI antibody titres have been used as a measure of vaccine efficacy. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Fluad Tetra contains the adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59), which is designed to increase and broaden the antigen-specific immune response and to extend the duration of the immune response.

Annual revaccination with influenza vaccines is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus may change from year to year.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Immunogenicity in the adult population 50 to less than 65 years of age

Immunogenicity of Fluad Tetra in adults 50 to less than 65 years of age was evaluated in Study V118\\_23. This was a randomised, observer-blind, controlled, multi-centre clinical trial conducted in the United States (US), Germany and Estonia, during the 2021-22 Northern Hemisphere season. In this study, adults 50 to less than 65 years of age who were healthy or had comorbidities that increased their risk of hospitalisation for influenza-associated complications, were enrolled to receive one dose of either Fluad Tetra (Number of subjects (N)=1 027) or a non-adjuvanted quadrivalent comparator influenza vaccine (N=1 017). The mean age of subjects enrolled in the Fluad Tetra group was 57.8 years and females represented 62% of subjects.

The immunogenicity endpoints assessed 3 weeks after vaccination were HI Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) and HI seroconversion rate (pre-vaccination HI titre &lt;1:10 and postvaccination HI titre ≥ 1:40 or at least a 4-fold increase in HI from prevaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10).  As was seen in studies in older adults with adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV, trivalent formulation) (see below study V70\\_27), Fluad Tetra elicited higher immune responses compared to a non-adjuvanted quadrivalent comparator influenza vaccine although superiority of Fluad Tetra versus non-adjuvanted vaccine was not achieved for all four homologous strains. The HI GMT ratios (comparator/Fluad Tetra) ranged

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from 0.80 to 0.99 with the highest limit of the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 1.07 and differences in HI seroconversion rates (comparator - Fluad Tetra) ranged from 4.5% to -1.8% with the highest limit of the 95% CI of 2.5%.

Immunogenicity in the elderly population (65 years and older )

The immunogenicity of Fluad Tetra was evaluated in clinical study V118\\_20, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, comparator controlled study conducted during the 2017-2018 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Elderly subjects 65 years of age and older were randomised (2:1:1) to receive Fluad Tetra, the licensed adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluad, aTIV-1) or an adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine containing the alternate B strain (aTIV-2).

Eligible subjects were men or women ≥65 years of age who were healthy or had comorbidities that increased their risk of influenza complications. The mean age of subjects at enrolment who received Fluad Tetra was 72.4 years. Female subjects represented 58.2 % of the study population.

The immunogenicity endpoints assessed 3 weeks after vaccination were HI GMT and HI seroconversion rate (pre-vaccination HI titre &lt;1:10 and postvaccination HI titre ≥ 1:40 or at least a 4-fold increase in HI from prevaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10). Fluad Tetra met non-inferiority for all 4 influenza strains and superiority to the alternate B strain not included in the aTIV comparators. The non-inferiority data are summarised in Table 2.

Immunogenicity of adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV, trivalent formulation)

The immunogenicity of aTIV is relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

Study V70\\_27 was a large Phase 3, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the immunogenicity and the safety of aTIV in comparison to non-adjuvanted vaccine and it was conducted in 2010-2011. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 0.5 ml dose of aTIV or a single dose of a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. All subjects were followed for approximately one year post-vaccination.

A total of 7 082 subjects were randomised and vaccinated, including 3 541 subjects in each of the pooled aTIV and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. A total of 2 573 subjects (1 300 in aTIV and 1 273 in non-adjuvanted vaccine group) were regarded as 'high risk' subjects (underlying chronic diseases including congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hepatic disease, renal insufficiency and/or neurological/neuromuscular or metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus).

The primary objective of a superiority of aTIV versus non-adjuvanted vaccine was not achieved for all homologous strains. GMT ratios ranged from 1.15 to 1.61 with the lowest limit of the 95% CI of 1.08 and differences in seroconversion rates ranged from 3.2% -13.9% with the lowest limit of the 95% CI of 1.1%.

aTIV elicited higher antibody titres for A/H3N2 that persisted up to 12 months post-vaccination. The results were similar for high-risk subjects with predefined comorbidities.

## Effectiveness

No effectiveness studies have been performed with Fluad Tetra. The observational effectiveness studies performed with aTIV are relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

## Paediatric Population (6 months to less than 6 years)

Fluad Tetra is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2.

Efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Fluad Tetra was evaluated in clinical study V118\\_05, a multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, controlled study conducted in the 2013-14 (season 1) and 2014-15 (season 2) Northern Hemisphere seasons in children of 6 months to less than 6 years. Children less than 3 years of age received 0.25 ml vaccine, older children received 0.5 ml vaccine. Children naïve to prior influenza vaccination received two doses of vaccine, at least 4 weeks apart. 10 644 children were enrolled and randomised to receive Fluad Tetra or the non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine in a 1:1 ratio: 5 352 children were enrolled in the Fluad Tetra group and 5 292 children in the non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity in the paediatric population

A subset of children enrolled in this study was evaluated for their immunological response to Fluad Tetra and the non-adjuvanted comparator. Immunogenicity assessments were performed prior to (each) vaccination and 3 weeks after the last vaccination. A total of 2 886 children were included in the subset for immunogenicity evaluation (Fluad Tetra: N=1 481; non -adjuvanted comparator vaccine: N=1 405).

Fluad Tetra demonstrated a higher immune response compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine. In addition, in children naïve to influenza vaccination antibody titres 4 weeks after the first vaccination as well as 3 weeks after the second vaccination were greater in subjects who received Fluad Tetra.

At 12 months post-vaccination, persistence of the immune response was higher in the Fluad Tetra group compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator group.

## Efficacy in the paediatric population

Vaccine efficacy was assessed for the prevention of first-occurrence laboratory confirmed influenza associated with symptomatic influenza-like illness (ILI). Influenza-like illness was defined as fever of 37.8°C or above along with any of the following: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or runny nose occurring at ≥ 21 days and ≤ 180 days after the last vaccination or until the end of the influenza season, whichever was longer. Subjects with ILI had nasopharyngeal swabs collected and tested for influenza A (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and B (both lineages) by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 508 cases of first-occurrence RT-PCR confirmed influenza occurred during the study; 10 during season one and 498 during season two. The maj ority of influenza cases were A/H3N2. Based on antigenic typing, more than ninety percent of A/H3N2 strains from season two were determined to be antigenically distinct from egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012, the H3N2 vaccine strain.

Vaccine efficacy compared to the non-adjuvanted influenza comparator vaccine was assessed. The relative vaccine (rVE) efficacy between Fluad Tetra and the comparator vaccine group in subjects ≥6 to &lt;72 months of age was 0.67 [95% CI: -19.81; 15.41]), whic h did not meet the primary objective of the study.

## Safety

Safety data were collected up to 12 months after receipt of the last vaccination. A higher incidence of local and systemic reactions was reported in subjects who received Fluad Tetra compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator influenza vaccine.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (&gt; 10%) were tenderness (43.2%), irritability (27.1%), sleepiness (26.3%), change in eating habits (22.5%), fever (19.1%), diarrhoea (12.3%) and vomiting (10.3%).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Fluad Tetra in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of influenza infection. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 1. What Fluad Tetra is and what it is used for

Fluad Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza).

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

Fluad Tetra is used to prevent flu in adults 50 years of age and older.

The vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World Health Organisation for the 2024/2025 Season.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Fluad Tetra

## You should not receive Fluad Tetra

## BEFORE receiving the vaccine

- Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration. This reaction may occur with Fluad Tetra as with all vaccines that are injected.
- You should tell your doctor if you have an illness associated with fever. Your doctor may decide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see Section 'Other medicines and Fluad Tetra').
- You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.
- Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.
