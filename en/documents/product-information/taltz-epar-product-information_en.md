## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

This medicinal product is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which it is indicated.

## Posology

## Plaque psoriasis in adults

The recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection at week 0, followed by 80 mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W).

## Paediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above)

Efficacy and safety data is not available in children below the age of 6 years (see section 5.1). Available data do not support a posology below a body weight of 25 kg.

The recommended dose given by subcutaneous injection in children is based on the following weight categories:

| Children's body weight   | Recommended starting dose (week 0)   | Recommended dose every 4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Greater than 50 kg       | 160 mg (two 80 mg injections)        | 80 mg                                             |
| 25 to 50 kg              | 80 mg                                | 40 mg                                             |

For children prescribed 80 mg, Taltz can be used directly from the pre-filled syringe.

If the 40 mg pre-filled syringe is not available, doses less than 80 mg must be prepared by a healthcare professional. For instructions on preparation of ixekizumab doses of 40 mg, see section 6.6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Taltz is not recommended for use in children with a body weight below 25 kg. Paediatric body weights must be recorded and regularly re-checked prior to dosing.

## Psoriatic arthritis

The recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection at week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks thereafter. For psoriatic arthritis patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dosing regimen is the same as for plaque psoriasis.

## Axial spondyloarthritis (radiographic and non-radiographic)

The recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection at week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (see section 5.1 for further information).

## Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (age 6 years and above)

Juvenile psoriatic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis

Efficacy and safety data is not available in children below the age of 6 years (see section 5.1). Available data do not support a posology below a body weight of 25 kg.

The recommended dose given by subcutaneous injection in children is based on the following weight categories:

| Children's body weight   | Recommended starting dose (week 0)   | Recommended dose every 4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Greater than 50 kg       | 160 mg (two 80 mg injections)        | 80 mg                                             |
| 25 to 50 kg              | 80 mg                                | 40 mg                                             |

For children prescribed 80 mg, Taltz can be used directly from the pre-filled syringe.

If the 40 mg pre-filled syringe is not available, doses less than 80 mg must be prepared by a healthcare professional. For instructions on preparation of Taltz 40 mg, see section 6.6.

Taltz is not recommended for use in children with a body weight below 25 kg. Paediatric body weights must be recorded and regularly re checked prior to dosing.

For all indications (plaque psoriasis in adults and children, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis including juvenile psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initially partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 20 weeks.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in subjects aged ≥ 65 years (see section 5.2). There is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 75 years.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Taltz has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

## Paediatric plaque psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile psoriatic arthritis or enthesitisrelated arthritis) (below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of 6 years)

There is no relevant use of Taltz in children below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of 6 years in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis including juvenile psoriatic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.

## Method of administration

Subcutaneous use.

Taltz is for subcutaneous injection. Injection sites may be alternated. If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The solution/the syringe must not be shaken.

After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Taltz if a healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate follow-up of patients. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet and the user manual.

If the 40 mg pre-filled syringe is not available, doses less than 80 mg which require dose preparation should only be administered by a healthcare professional.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Serious hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Treatment with Taltz is associated with an increased rate of infections such as upper respiratory tract infection, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis, and tinea infections (see section 4.8).

Taltz should be used with caution in patients with clinically important chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If an infection develops, patients should be carefully monitored and Taltz discontinued if the patient is not responding to standard therapy or if the infection becomes serious. Taltz should not be resumed until the infection resolves.

Taltz must not be given to patients with active tuberculosis (TB). Anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of Taltz in patients with latent TB should be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypersensitivity

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including some cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria and, rarely, late (10-14 days following injection) serious hypersensitivity reactions including widespread urticaria, dyspnea and high antibody titres have been reported. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Taltz should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

## Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)

Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with ixekizumab (see section 4.8). Ixekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, ixekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.

## Immunisations

Taltz should not be used with live vaccines. No data are available on the response to live vaccines; there are insufficient data on response to inactive vaccines (see section 5.1).

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 40 mg dose and per 80 mg dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Polysorbate

This medicinal product contains 0.15 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 40 mg pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 0.30 mg/mL. This medicinal product contains 0.3 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 80 mg pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 0.30 mg/mL. . Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In plaque psoriasis studies, the safety of Taltz in combination with other immunomodulatory agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated.

In population pharmacokinetic analyses, clearance of ixekizumab was not affected by concomitant administration of oral corticosteroids, NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, or methotrexate.

## Cytochrome P450 substrates

Results from an interaction study in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis determined that 12 weeks of administration of ixekizumab with substances metabolised by CYP3A4 (i.e., midazolam), CYP2C9 (i.e., warfarin), CYP2C19 (i.e., omeprazole), CYP1A2 (i.e., caffeine) or CYP2D6 (i.e., dextromethorphan) does not have a clinically significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of these substances.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 10 weeks after treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

There is a limited amount of data from the use of ixekizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Taltz during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether ixekizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. However, ixekizumab is excreted at low levels in the milk of cynomolgus monkeys. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Taltz taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

The effect of ixekizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Taltz has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions (15.5 %) and upper respiratory tract infections (16.4 %) (most frequently nasopharyngitis).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing reports (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/1 00); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000).

A total of 8 956 patients have been treated with Taltz in blinded and open-label clinical studies in plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and other autoimmune conditions. Of these, 6 385 patients were exposed to Taltz for at least one year, cumulatively representing 19 833 adult patient years of exposure and 196 children cumulatively representing 207 patient years of exposure.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Injection site reactions

The most frequent injection site reactions observed were erythema and pain. These reactions were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of Taltz. In the adult plaque psoriasis studies, injection site reactions were more common in subjects with a body weight &lt; 60 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 60 kg (25 % vs. 14 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). In the psoriatic arthritis studies, injection site reactions were more common in subjects with a body weight &lt; 100 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 100 kg (24 % vs. 13 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). In the axial spondyloarthritis studies, injection site reactions were similar in subjects with a body weight &lt; 100 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 100 kg (14 % vs. 9 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). The increased frequency of injection site reactions in the combined Q2W and Q4W groups did not result in an increase in discontinuations in either the plaque psoriasis, the psoriatic arthritis or the axial spondyloarthritis studies.

The results described above are obtained with the original formulation of Taltz. In a single-blinded, randomised cross-over study in 45 healthy subjects comparing the original formulation with the revised, citrate-free formulation, statistically significantly lower Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores were obtained with the citrate-free vs. the original formulation during injection (difference in LS Mean VAS score -21.69) and 10 min after injection (difference in LS Mean VAS score -4.47).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infections

In the placebo-controlled period of the phase III clinical studies in plaque psoriasis in adults, infections were reported in 27.2 % of patients treated with Taltz for up to 12 weeks compared with 22.9 % of patients treated with placebo.

The majority of infections were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity, most of which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 13 (0.6 %) of patients treated with Taltz and in 3 (0.4 %) of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). Over the entire treatment period infections were reported in 52.8 % of patients treated with Taltz (46.9 per 100 patient years). Serious infections were reported in 1.6 % of patients treated with Taltz (1.5 per 100 patient years).

Infection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis clinical studies were similar to those observed in the plaque psoriasis studies with the exception of the frequencies of the adverse reactions of influenza and conjunctivitis which were common in patients with psoriatic arthritis.

## Laboratory assessment of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia

In plaque psoriasis studies, 9% of patients receiving Taltz developed neutropenia. In most cases, the blood neutrophil count was ≥1 000 cells/mm 3 . Such levels of neutropenia may persist, fluctuate or be transient. 0.1% of patients receiving Taltz developed a neutrophil count &lt;1 000 cells/mm 3 . In general, neutropenia did not require discontinuation of Taltz. 3% of patients exposed to Taltz had a shift from a normal baseline platelet value to &lt;150 000 platelet cells/mm 3 to ≥75 000 cells/mm 3 . Thrombocytopenia may persist, fluctuate or be transient.

The frequency of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis clinical studies is similar to that observed in the plaque psoriasis studies.

## Immunogenicity

Approximately 9-17% of adult plaque psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titres and not associated with reduced clinical response up to 60 weeks of treatment. However, approximately 1% of patients treated with Taltz had confirmed neutralising antibodies associated with low drug concentrations and reduced clinical response.

In psoriatic arthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 52 weeks, approximately 11% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titre, and approximately 8% had confirmed neutralising antibodies. No apparent association between the presence of neutralising antibodies and impact on drug concentration or efficacy was observed.

In paediatric psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 12 weeks, 21 patients (18%) developed anti-drug antibodies, approximately half were low titer and 5 patients (4%) had confirmed neutralizing antibodies associated with low drug concentrations. There was no association with clinical response or adverse events.

In radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 16 weeks, 5.2% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titer, and 1.5% (3 patients) had neutralising antibodies (NAb). In these 3 patients, NAb-positive samples had low ixekizumab concentrations and none of these patients achieved an ASAS40 response. In non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen for up to 52 weeks, 8.9% developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low titer; no patient had neutralising antibodies; and no apparent association between the presence of anti-drug antibodies and drug concentration, efficacy, or safety was observed.

In juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) patients treated with ixekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen up to 104 weeks, 18 patients (22.8 %) developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low to moderate titer. No apparent association between the presence of anti-drug antibodies and drug concentration, efficacy, or safety was observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Across all indications, an association between immunogenicity and treatment emergent adverse events has not been clearly established.

## Paediatric population

The safety profile observed in children with plaque psoriasis treated with Taltz every 4 weeks is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria which were common. Inflammatory bowel disease was also more frequent in paediatric patients, although it was still uncommon. In the paediatric clinical study, Crohn's disease occurred in 0.9% of patients in the Taltz group and 0% of patients in the placebo group during the 12-week, placebo -controlled period. Crohn's disease occurred in a total of 4 Taltz treated subjects (2.0%) during the combined placebo -controlled and maintenance periods of the paediatric clinical study.

Adverse drug reactions in paediatric patients treated with the recommended dose of ixekizumab by subcutaneous injection in the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile psoriatic arthritis or enthesitisrelated arthritis) open-label clinical trial were consistent with the known safety profile of ixekizumab in the integrated safety dataset for paediatric plaque psoriasis indication as well as the adult indications of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis with the exception of frequencies for influenza (common), rhinitis (common) and conjunctivitis (common).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Doses up to 180 mg have been administered subcutaneously in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. Overdoses up to 240 mg, subcutaneously, as a single administration in clinical trials, have been reported without any serious adverse events.

In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC13

## Mechanism of action

Ixekizumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity (&lt; 3 pM) and specificity to interleukin 17A (both IL-17A and IL-17A/F). Elevated concentrations of IL-17A have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and activation, as well as in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis by driving inflammation leading to erosive bone damage and pathological new bone formation. Neutralisation of IL-17A by ixekizumab inhibits these actions. Ixekizumab does not bind to ligands IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E or IL-17F.

In vitro binding assays confirmed that ixekizumab does not bind to human Fc γ receptors I, IIa, and IIIa or to complement component C1q.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Ixekizumab modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by IL-17A. Based on psoriatic skin biopsy data from a phase I study, there was a dose-related trend towards decreased epidermal thickness, number of proliferating keratinocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells, as well as reductions in local inflammatory markers from baseline to day 43. As a direct consequence treatment with ixekizumab reduces erythema, induration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions.

Ixekizumab has been shown to lower (within 1 week of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Adult plaque psoriasis

The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in adult patients (N=3 866) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3). The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab were also evaluated versus etanercept (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3). Patients randomised to ixekizumab who were sPGA (0,1) responders (static Physicians Global Assessment) at week 12 were re-randomised to receive placebo or ixekizumab for an additional 48 weeks (UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2); patients randomised to placebo, etanercept or ixekizumab who were sPGA (0,1) non-responders received ixekizumab for up to 48 weeks. In addition, long-term efficacy and safety were evaluated in all three studies for up to a total of 5 years in patients who participated through the entire study.

64 % of patients had received prior systemic therapy (biologic, conventional systemic or psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA)), 43.5 % prior phototherapy, 49.3 % prior conventional systemic therapy, and 26.4 % prior biologic therapy. 14.9 % had received at least one anti-TNF alpha agent, and 8.7 % an anti-IL-12/IL-23. 23.4 % of patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis at baseline.

In all three studies, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and an sPGA of '0' ('clear') or '1' ('minimal') response at week 12 versus placebo. The median baseline PASI score ranged from 17.4 to 18.3; 48.3 % to 51.2 % of patients had a baseline sPGA score of severe or very severe, and mean baseline itch Numeric Rating Scale (itch NRS) ranged from 6.3 to 7.1.

Ixekizumab was associated with a fast onset of efficacy with &gt; 50 % reduction in mean PASI by week 2 (Figure 1). The percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 was significantly greater for ixekizumab compared with placebo and etanercept as early as week 1. Approximately 25 % of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a PASI score &lt; 5 by week 2, more than 55 % achieved the PASI score &lt; 5 by week 4, and increased to 85 % by week 12 (compared to 3 %, 14 % and 50 % for etanercept). Significant improvements in itch severity were seen at week 1 in patients treated with ixekizumab.

The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, body weight, PASI baseline severity, plaques location, concurrent psoriatic arthritis, and previous treatment with a biologic. ixekizumab was efficacious in systemic treatment-naive, biologic-naive, biologic/anti-TNF-exposed and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients.

For patients identified as an sPGA (0,1) non-responder to etanercept at week 12 in UNCOVER-2 (N = 200) and who were switched to ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W after a 4 week washout period, 73 % and 83.5 % of patients achieved sPGA (0,1) and PASI 75, respectively, after 12 weeks of treatment with ixekizumab.

In the 2 clinical studies that included an active comparator (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3), the rate of serious adverse events was 1.9 % for both etanercept and for ixekizumab, and the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 1.2 % for etanercept and 2.0 % for ixekizumab. The rate of infections was 21.5 % for etanercept and 26.0 % for ixekizumab, with 0.4 % being serious for etanercept and 0.5 % for ixekizumab.

## Maintenance of response at week 60 and up to 5 years

Patients originally randomised to ixekizumab and who were responders at week 12 (i.e., sPGA score of 0,1) in UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2 were re-randomised to an additional 48 weeks of treatment with placebo or ixekizumab (80 mg every four or twelve weeks [Q4W or Q12W]).

For sPGA (0,1) responders at week 12 re-randomised to treatment withdrawal (i.e., placebo), the median time to relapse (sPGA ≥ 3) was 164 days in integrated UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2 studies. Among these patients, 71.5 % regained at least an sPGA (0,1) response within 12 weeks of restarting treatment with ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W.

Ixekizumab was efficacious in the maintenance of response in systemic treatment-naive, biologic-naive, biologic/anti-TNF-exposed and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients.

Significantly greater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo and etanercept were demonstrated in nail psoriasis (as measured by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI]), in scalp psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI]) and in palmoplantar psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Palmoplantar Severity Index [PPASI]) and were maintained at week 60 in patients treated with ixekizumab who were sPGA (0,1) responders at week 12.

Of 591 subjects who received ixekizumab Q2W during the Induction Period then Q4W afterward in study UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3, 427 subjects completed 5 years of ixekizumab treatment, among those 101 patients required a dose escalation. Among the patients who completed the week 264 assessment (N=427), 295 patients (69%), 289 patients (68%) and 205 patients (48%) were observed to have sPGA (0,1), PASI 90 and PASI 100 response, respectively, at week 264. DLQI were collected after Induction Period in UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2, 113 patients (66%) were observed to have DLQI (0,1) response.

## Quality of life/patient -reported outcomes

At week 12 and across studies, ixekizumab was associated with statistically significant improvement in Health-related Quality of Life as assessed by mean decrease ranges from baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W from -10.2 to -11.1, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W from -9.4 to -10.7, etanercept from -7.7 to -8.0 and placebo -1.0 to -2.0). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a DLQI 0 or 1. Across studies a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a reduction of Itch NRS ≥ 4 points at week 12 (84.6% for ixekizumab Q2W, 79.2% for ixekizumab Q4W and 16.5% for placebo) and the benefit was sustained over time up to week 60 in patients treated with ixekizumab

who were sPGA (0 or 1) responders at week 12. There was not any evidence of worsening of depression up to 60 weeks treatment with ixekizumab as assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report.

## Post-marketing direct comparative studies

IXORA-S: In a double -blind study ixekizumab was superior against ustekinumab on the primary study objective PASI 90 response at week 12 (Table 6). Onset of response was superior on PASI 75 as early as week 2 (p &lt; 0.001) and on PASI 90 and PASI 100 by week 4 (p &lt; 0.001). Superiority of ixekizumab versus ustekinumab was also demonstrated in the subgroups stratified by weight.

## Efficacy in genital psoriasis

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (IXORA-Q) was conducted in 149 adult subjects (24% females) with moderate to severe genital psoriasis (sPGA of Genitalia score of ≥3), a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of 1% ( 60.4% had a BSA ≥ 10%) and previous failure of or intolerance to at least one topical therapy for genital psoriasis. Patients had at least moderate plaque psoriasis (defined as sPGA score of ≥ 3 and being candidates for phototherapy and/or systemic therapy) for at least 6 months.

Subjects randomised to ixekizumab received an initial dose of 160 mg followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved at least a \"0\" (clear) or \"1\" (minimal) response on the sPGA of Genitalia (sPGA of Genitalia 0/1). At week 12, significantly more subjects in the ixekizumab group than placebo group achieved a sPGA of Genitalia 0/1 and a sPGA 0/1 independent of baseline BSA (baseline BSA 1% - &lt;10% resp. ≥ 10%: sPGA of Genitalia ''0' or '1': Ixekizumab 71%, resp. 75%; placebo: 0%, resp. 13%). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a reduction in the PROs of severity of genital pain, genital itch, impact of genital psoriasis on sexual activity, and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI).

## Paediatric plaque psoriasis

A randomised, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (IXORA-Peds) enrolled 201 children 6 to less than 18 years of age, with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by a sPGA score ≥3, involving ≥10% of the body surface area, and a PASI score ≥12) who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. Patients were randomised to placebo (n=56), etanercept (n=30) or ixekizumab (n=115) with dosing stratified by weight:

&lt;25 kg: 40 mg at week 0 followed by 20 mg Q4W (n=4)

25 kg to 50 kg: 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg Q4W (n=50)

&gt;50 kg: 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg Q4W (n=147)

Patients randomised to etanercept (patients with severe psoriasis) received 0.8 mg/kg, not exceeding 50 mg per dose, every week from week 0 through week 11.

Response to treatment was assessed after 12 weeks and defined by the proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoint of an sPGA score of '0' (clear) or '1' (almost clear) with at least a 2 point improvement from baseline and the proportion of patients that achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline.

Other evaluated outcomes at week 12 included the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 90, PASI 100, sPGA of '0' and an improvement of itch severity as measured by a reduction of at least 4 points on an 11-point itch Numeric Rating Scale.

Patients had a median baseline PASI of 17 score ranging from 12-49. Baseline sPGA score was severe or very severe in 49%. Of all patients, 22% had received prior phototherapy and 32% had received prior conventional systemic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis.

25% of patients (n=43) were below 12 years (14% of patients [n=24] were 6-9 years and 11% of patients [n=19] were 10-11 years); 75% (n=128) were 12 years or above.

Patients in the ixekizumab treatment group had clinically meaningful higher CDLQI/DLQI (0,1) responses at week 12 (NRI) compared with placebo. The difference between treatment groups was apparent from as early as week 4.

There were greater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo in nail psoriasis (as measured by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI=0: ixekizumab 18% (6/34), placebo 0% (0/12)]), in scalp psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI=0: ixekizumab 69% (70/102), placebo 16% (8/50)]) and in palmoplantar psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Palmoplantar Severity Index [PPASI 75: ixekizumab 53% (9/17), placebo 11% (1/9)]).

## Psoriatic arthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in 780 patients with active psoriatic arthritis (≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender  joints). Patients had a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis [CASPAR] criteria) for a median of 5.33 years and had current plaque psoriasis skin lesions (94.0%) or a documented history of plaque psoriasis, with 12.1% of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at baseline. Over  58.9% and 22.3% of the psoriatic arthritis patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. Primary endpoint of both  studies was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24, followed by a long-term extension period from week 24 to week 156 (3 years).

In Psoriatic Arthritis Study 1 (SPIRIT-P1), patients naive to biologic therapy with active psoriatic arthritis were randomised to placebo, adalimumab 40 mg once every 2 weeks (active control reference arm), ixekizumab 80 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W). Both ixekizumab regimens included a 160 mg starting dose. 85.3% of patients in this study had received prior treatment with ≥1 conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (cDMARD). 53% of patients had concomitant use of MTX at a mean weekly dose of 15.8 mg. 67% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg or greater. Patients with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue therapy (modification to background therapy). Patients on ixekizumab Q2W

or Q4W remained on their originally assigned dose of ixekizumab. Patients receiving adalimumab or placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W at week 16 or 24 based on responder status. 243 patients completed the extension period of 3 years on ixekizumab.

Psoriatic Arthritis Study 2 (SPIRIT-P2) enrolled patients who were previously treated with an anti-TNF agent and discontinued the  anti-TNF agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNF-IR patients). Patients were randomised to placebo, ixekizumab 80 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W). Both ixekizumab regimens included a 160 mg starting dose. 56% and 35% of patients were inadequate responders to 1 anti-TNF or 2 anti-TNF, respectively. SPIRIT-P2 evaluated 363 patients, of whom 41% had concomitant use of MTX at a mean weekly dose of 16.1 mg. 73.2% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg or greater. Patients with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue therapy (modification to background therapy). Patients in ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W remained on their originally assigned dose of ixekizumab. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W at week 16 or 24 based on responder status. 168 patients completed the extension period of 3 years on ixekizumab.

## Signs and symptoms

Treatment with ixekizumab resulted in significant improvement in measures of disease activity compared to placebo at week 24 (see Table 10).

In patients with pre-existing dactylitis or enthesitis, treatment with ixekizumab Q4W resulted in improvement in dactylitis and enthesitis at week 24 compared to placebo (resolution: 78% vs. 24%; p&lt;0.001, and 39% vs. 21%; p&lt;0.01, respectively).

In patients with ≥3% BSA , the improvement in skin clearance at week 12 as measured by 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 75), was 67% (94/141) for those treated with the Q4W dosing regimen, and 9% (12/134) for those treated with placebo (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of patients achieving a PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response at week 24 was greater with ixekizumab Q4W compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001). In patients with concomitant moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ixekizumab Q2W dose regimen showed significantly higher response rate for PASI75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001) and demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit over the Q4W dose regimen.

Treatment responses on ixekizumab were significantly greater than those on placebo as early as week 1 for ACR 20, week 4 for ACR 50 and week 8 for ACR 70 and persisted through week 24; effects were maintained through 3 years for patients who remained in the study.

In SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2, similar responses for ACR 20/50/70 were seen in patients with psoriatic arthritis regardless of  whether they were on concomitant cDMARDs, including MTX treatment, or not.

In SPIRIT-P1and SPIRIT-P2, improvements were shown in all components of the ACR scores including patient assessment of pain.  At week 24 the proportion of patients achieving a modified Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) response was greater  in the ixekizumab -treated patients compared to placebo.

In SPIRIT-P1, efficacy was maintained up to week 52 as assessed by ACR 20/50/70, MDA, enthesitis resolution, dactylitis resolution, and PASI 75/90/100 response rates.

The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, disease duration, baseline body weight, baseline psoriasis involvement, baseline CRP, baseline DAS28-CRP, concomitant corticosteroid use, and previous treatment with a biologic. Ixekizumab was efficacious in biologic-naive, biologic-exposed and biologic-failure patients.

In SPIRIT-P1, 63 patients completed 3 years of Q4W ixekizumab treatment. Among the 107 patients who were randomised to ixekizumab Q4W (NRI analysis in ITT population), 54 patients (50%), 41 patients (38%), 29 patients (27%), and 36 patients (34%) were observed to have ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and MDA response, respectively, at week 156.

In SPIRIT-P2, 70 patients completed 3 years of Q4W ixekizumab treatment. Among the 122 patients who were randomised to ixekizumab Q4W (NRI analysis in ITT population), 56 patients (46%), 39 patients (32%), 24 patients (20%) and 33 (27%) were observed to have ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and MDA response, respectively, at week 156.

## Radiographic response

In SPIRIT-P1, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as the change in modified total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score  (ES) and the Joint Space Narrowing score (JSN) at weeks 24 and 52, compared to baseline. week 24  data are presented in Table 11.

Radiographic joint damage progression was inhibited by ixekizumab (Table 11) at week 24, and the percentage of patients with no radiographic joint damage progression (defined as a change from baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5) from randomisation to week 24 was 94.8% for ixekizumab Q2W (p&lt;0.001), 89.0% for ixekizumab Q4W (p=0.026), 95.8% for adalimumab (p&lt;0.001), all compared to 77.4% for placebo. At week 52, the mean change from baseline in mTSS was 0.27 for placebo/ ixekizumab Q4W, 0.54 for ixekizumab Q4W/ ixekizumab Q4W, and 0.32 for adalimumab/ ixekizumab Q4W. The percentage of patients with no radiographic joint damage progression from randomisation to week 52 was 90.9% for placebo/ ixekizumab Q4W, 85.6% for ixekizumab Q4W/ ixekizumab Q4W, and 89.4% for adalimumab/ ixekizumab Q4W. Patients had no structural progression from baseline (defined as mTSS≤0.5) in the treatment arms as follows: Placebo/ ixekizumab Q4W 81.5% (N=22/27), ixekizumab Q4W/ ixekizumab Q4W 73.6% (N=53/72), and adalimumab/ ixekizumab Q4W 88.2% (N=30/34).

## Physical function and health-related quality of life

In both SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2, patients treated with ixekizumab Q2W (p&lt;0.001) and Q4W (p&lt;0.001) showed significant improvement in physical function compared to patients treated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo as assessed by Health  Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at week 24, and maintained at week 52 in SPIRIT-P1.

Ixekizumab -treated patients reported improvements in health-related quality of life as  measured by the Physical Component Summary of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36 PCS) score (p&lt;0.001). There were also improvements demonstrated in fatigue as assessed by Fatigue severity NRS  scores (p&lt;0.001).

## Post-marketing phase 4, direct comparative study

Efficacy and safety of ixekizumab was investigated in a multicenter, randomised, open-label, rater-blinded, parallel-group study (SPIRIT-H2H) compared to adalimumab (ADA) in 566 patients with PsA who were naïve to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD). Patients were stratified at baseline based on concomitant cDMARD use and presence of moderate-to-severe psoriasis (PASI≥12, BSA≥10 and sPGA≥3).

Ixekizumab was superior to ADA on the primary study objective: simultaneous achievement of ACR 50 and PASI 100 response at week 24 (ixekizumab 36.0% vs ADA 27.9%; p=0.036; 95% confidence interval [0.5%, 15.8%]). Ixekizumab also showed non-inferiority (pre-specified margin of 12%) to ADA on ACR 50 (ITT analysis: ixekizumab 50.5% vs ADA 46.6%; 3.9% difference vs. ADA; 95% confidence interval [-4.3%; 12.1%]; PPS analysis ixekizumab: 52.3%, ADA: 53.1%, difference: -0.8% [CI: -10.3%; 8.7%]) and superiority on PASI 100 at week 24 (60.1 % with ixekizumab vs 46.6% with ADA, p=0.001), which were the major secondary endpoints in the study. At week 52 a higher proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab versus ADA simultaneously achieved ACR50 and PASI 100 [39% (111/283) versus 26% (74/283)] and PASI 100 [64% (182/283) versus 41% (117/283)]. Ixekizumab and ADA treatment resulted in similar responses for ACR50 [49.8% (141/283) versus 49.8% (141/283)]. Responses to ixekizumab were consistent when used as monotherapy or with concomitant use of methotrexate.

## Axial spondyloarthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in a total of 960 adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis in three randomised placebo-controlled studies (two in radiographic and one in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis).

## Radiographic axial spondyloarthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in a total of 657 patients in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (COAST-V and COAST-W) in adult patients who had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 and total back pain ≥4 on a numeric rating scale despite non -steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Across both studies at baseline, patients had symptoms for a mean of 17 years (median of 16 years). At baseline, approximately 32% of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD.

COAST-V evaluated 341 biologic-naive patients treated with either ixekizumab 80 mg or 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 4 weeks (Q4W), adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks, or with placebo. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised at week 16 to receive ixekizumab (160 mg starting dose, followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W). Patients receiving adalimumab were re-randomised at week 16 to receive ixekizumab (80 mg Q2W or Q4W).

COAST-W evaluated 316 patients who had prior experience with 1 or 2 TNF-inhibitors (90% were inadequate responders and 10% were intolerant to TNF inhibitors). All patients were treated with ixekizumab 80 or 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W, or with placebo. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised at week 16 to receive ixekizumab (160 mg initial dose, followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W).

The primary endpoint in both studies was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at week 16.

## Clinical response

In both studies, patients treated with ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W demonstrated greater improvements in ASAS40 and ASAS20 responses compared to placebo at week 16 (Table 12). Responses were similar in patients regardless of concomitant therapies. In COAST-W, responses were seen regardless of the number of prior TNF inhibitors.

* p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01; *** p&lt;0.001 compared with placebo.

Similar response in ASAS40 was seen in patients regardless of baseline CRP levels, baseline ASDAS scores and MRI spine SPARCC scores. The ASAS40 response was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, disease duration, baseline body weight, baseline BASDAI score and prior biologic treatment.

In COAST-V and COAST-W efficacy was maintained up to week 52 as assessed by the endpoints presented in Table 12, including ASAS20, ASAS40, ASDAS, BASDAI, and ASAS HI response rates.

## Health-related outcomes

Spinal pain showed improvements versus placebo as early as week 1, maintained through week 16 [ixekizumab vs placebo: COAST-V -3.2 vs -1.7; COAST-W -2.4 vs -1.0]; fatigue and spinal mobility showed improvements versus placebo at week 16. Improvements in spinal pain, fatigue and spinal mobility were maintained through week 52.

## Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind study with a 52-week placebo-controlled period (COAST-X) in 303 adult patients with active axial spondyloarthritis for at least 3 months. Patients must have had objective signs of inflammation indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and no definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on sacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity In dex (BASDAI) ≥4, and spinal pain ≥4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Patients were treated with either ixekizumab 80 mg or 160 mg at week 0, followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or with placebo. Dose adjustment and/or initiation of concomitant medications (NSAIDs, cDMARDs, corticosteroids, analgesics) were permitted starting at week 16.

At baseline, patients had symptoms of non-radiographic axSpA for an average of 11 years. Approximately 39% of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at week 16.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical response

Higher proportions of patients treated with ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W achieved ASAS40 response compared to placebo at week 16 (Table 13). Responses were similar regardless of concomitant therapies.

Efficacy was maintained up to week 52 as assessed by the endpoints presented in Table 13.

## Health-related outcomes

Spinal pain showed improvements versus placebo as early as week 1 and was maintained through week 16 [ixekizumab vs placebo: COAST-X: -2.4 vs -1.5]. In addition, more patients on ixekizumab compared with placebo achieved good health status (ASAS HI ≤5) at week 16 and week 52.

## Long-term outcomes Axial Spondyloarthritis

Patients who completed one of the three pivotal studies COAST-V/W/X (52 weeks) were offered participation in a long-term extension and randomised withdrawal study (COAST-Y, with 350 and 423 patients enrolled on ixekizumab Q4W and Q2W, respectively). Among those who achieved remission 157/773 (20.3%) (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score [ASDAS] &lt;1.3 at least once, and no ASDAS score ≥2.1, at weeks 16 and 20), 155 patients exposed to ixekizumab up to 76 weeks were randomised at week 24 of the COAST-Y study (Placebo, N=53; ixekizumab Q4W, N=48; and ixekizumab Q2W, N=54); of these, 148 (95.5%) completed the week 64 visit (Placebo, N=50; ixekizumab Q4W, N=47; ixekizumab Q2W, N=51). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in the randomised withdrawal population who did not experience a flare during weeks 24-64 (combined ixekizumab Q2W and ixekizumab Q4W groups versus placebo). A significantly larger proportion of patients (NRI) in the combined ixekizumab groups (83.3% (85/102), p&lt;0.001) and ixekizumab Q4W (83.3 % (40/48), p=0.003) had no flare during weeks 24-64 compared with those who withdrew from ixekizumab to placebo (54.7 % (29/53)). ixekizumab (in both combined ixekizumab groups and ixekizumab Q4W group) significantly delayed the time to flare (Log-Rank Test p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) compared to Placebo.

In patients who received ixekizumab Q4W continuously (N=157), the ASAS40, ASDAS &lt;2.1 and BASDAI50 responses were maintained to week 116.

## Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

## Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA)and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)

A multicenter, open-label, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study (COSPIRIT-JIA) of subcutaneous ixekizumab with adalimumab reference arm, in children from 2 to less than 18 years of age with JPsA or ERA was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab for 16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weeks after treatment initiation. The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the percentage of patients meeting the JIA ACR 30 (30 % improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria) response criteria at week 16.

Twenty patients were randomly assigned to ixekizumab and 20 patients to adalimumab. Randomisation was stratified based on the category of JIA (JPsA or ERA). The remaining patients who were bDMARD-naive or bDMARD-experienced were assigned to ixekizumab. Patients entering the study were not required to have a documented inadequate response to prior treatment.

In the ixekizumab group (N = 81), the JIA patient subtypes at study entry were: 33.3% JPsA and 66.7% ERA; with 74.1% (60/81) patients bDMARD naïve, and 33.3% (27/81) cDMARD naïve. Overall, 72.8% of ixekizumab treated patients received at least 1 concomitant JIA therapy during the Open Label Treatment (OLT) period. Baseline concomitant methotrexate use was reported for 40.7% of patients, baseline concomitant sulfasalazine use reported for 4.9%, baseline concomitant NSAIDs use reported for 49.4% and baseline concomitant glucocorticoids use reported for 11.1%.

Patients assigned to ixekizumab (N = 81) received dosing stratified by weight as follows: 10 to &lt; 25 kg: 40 mg at week 0 followed by 20 mg Q4W (n = 6) 25 kg to 50 kg: 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg Q4W (n = 20) &gt; 50 kg: 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg Q4W (n = 55)

For the randomized  bDMARD naïve patients, JIA ACR 30 response rate at week 16 was 18/20 (90%) for the ixekizumab group and 19/20 (95%) in the adalimumab group. In the overall ixekizumab population (n=81) the JIA ACR 30 response rate was 54/60 (90%) in the bDMARD naïve group and 18/21 (85.7%) in the bDMARD experienced group.

JIA ACR 30 response rates at week 16 were also consistent across JPsA (24/27, 88.9 %) and ERA (48/54, 88.9 %) subtypes.

In addition, the percentage of patients meeting the JIA ACR 30/50/70/90/100 response criteria were evaluated at week 16. The clinical response data are presented in Figure 8.

## Immunisations

In a study in healthy subjects, no safety concerns were identified of two inactivated vaccines (tetanus and pneumococcal), received after two doses of ixekizumab (160 mg followed by a second dose of 80 mg two weeks later). However, the data concerning immunisation were insufficient to conclude on an adequate immune response to these vaccines following administration of ixekizumab.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with ixekizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis/axial spondyloarthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following a single subcutaneous dose of ixekizumab in patients with psoriasis, mean peak concentrations were achieved within 4 to 7 days, across a dose range of 5 to 160 mg. The mean (SD)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ixekizumab, after the 160 mg starting dose, was 19.9 (8.15) µg/mL.

After the 160 mg starting dose, steady state was achieved by week 8 with the 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and C trough,ss estimates are 21.5 (9.16) µg/mL, and 5.23 (3.19) µg/mL.

After switching from the 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen to the 80 mg Q4W dosing regimen at week 12, steady state would be achieved after approximately 10 weeks. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss estimates are 14.6 (6.04) µg/mL, and 1.87 (1.30) µg/mL.

The average bioavailability of ixekizumab after subcutaneous administration was 54 % to 90 % across analyses.

## Distribution

From population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean total volume of distribution at steady state was 7.11 L.

## Biotransformation

Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulins.

## Elimination

In the population PK analysis, mean serum clearance was 0.0161 L/hr. Clearance is independent of dose. The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, is 13 days in patients with plaque psoriasis.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Exposure (Area Under the Curve or AUC) increased proportionally over a dose range of 5 to 160 mg given as a subcutaneous injection.

## Pharmacokinetic properties across indications

The pharmacokinetic properties of ixekizumab were similar across the plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis indications.

## Elderly

Of the 4 204 plaque psoriasis patients exposed to ixekizumab in clinical studies, a total of 301 were 65 years of age or older and 36 patients were 75 years of age or older. Of the 1 118 psoriatic arthritis patients exposed to ixekizumab in clinical studies, a total of 122 patients were 65 years of age or older and 6 patients were 75 years of age or older.

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n = 94 for age ≥ 65 years and n = 12 for age ≥ 75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than 65 years of age was similar.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on the PK of ixekizumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of intact ixekizumab, an IgG MAb, is expected to be low and of minor importance; similarly, IgG MAbs are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of ixekizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

Paediatric psoriasis patients (age 6 to less than 18 years) were administered ixekizumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen for 12 weeks. Patients weighing &gt;50 kg and 25 to 50 kg had a mean ±SD steady-state trough concentration of 3.8 ±2.2 µg/mL and 3.9 ±2.4 µg/mL, respectively, at week 12.

Paediatric juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients (age 6 to less than 18 years) were administered ixekizumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen for 16 weeks. Patients weighing &gt; 50 kg, and 25 to 50 kg had a mean ± SD steadystate trough concentration of 3.9 ± 1.8 and 3.5 ± 1.3 μg/m L, respectively, at week 16. There were limited PK data in patients weighing &lt; 25 kg.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology evaluations, and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies.

Ixekizumab administration to cynomolgus monkeys for 39 weeks at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mg/kg weekly produced no organ toxicity or undesirable effects on immune function (e.g. T-cell dependent antibody response and NK cell activity). A weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg to monkeys is approximately 19 times the 160 mg starting dose of ixekizumab and in monkeys results in exposure (AUC) that is at least 61-fold higher than the predicted mean steady-state exposure in humans administered the recommended dose regimen.

Non-clinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of ixekizumab.

No effects on reproductive organs, menstrual cycles or sperm were observed in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys that received ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg.

In developmental toxicity studies, ixekizumab was shown to cross the placenta and was present in the blood of offspring for up to 6 months of age. A higher incidence of postnatal mortality occurred in the offspring of monkeys given ixekizumab compared to concurrent controls. This was related primarily to early delivery or maternal neglect of offspring, common findings in nonhuman primate studies, and considered clinically irrelevant.

.

In case no 40 mg presentation is available, ixekizumab doses of 40 mg must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare professional using the commercial Taltz 80 mg pre-filled syringe.

Use the Taltz 80 mg pre-filled pen only in those children that require a dose of 80 mg and do not require dose preparation.

Taltz is not recommended for use in children with a body weight below 25 kg. Paediatric body weights must be recorded and regularly re checked prior to dosing.

For all indications (plaque psoriasis in adults and children, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis including juvenile psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initially partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 20 weeks.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in subjects aged ≥

There is limited information in subjects aged ≥

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Taltz has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made.

## Paediatric population

Paediatric plaque psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile psoriatic arthritis or enthesitisrelated arthritis) (below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of 6 years)

There is no relevant use of Taltz in children below a body weight of 25 kg and below the age of 6 years in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis including juvenile psoriatic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.

## Method of administration

## Subcutaneous use.

Taltz is for subcutaneous injection. Injection sites may be alternated. If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The solution/the pen must not be shaken.

65 years (see section 5.2). 75 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Taltz if a healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate follow-up of patients. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet and the user manual.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Serious hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Treatment with Taltz is associated with an increased rate of infections such as upper respiratory tract infection, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis, and tinea infections (see section 4.8).

Taltz should be used with caution in patients with clinically important chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If an infection develops, patients should be carefully monitored and Taltz discontinued if the patient is not responding to standard therapy or if the infection becomes serious. Taltz should not be resumed until the infection resolves.

Taltz must not be given to patients with active tuberculosis (TB). Anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of Taltz in patients with latent TB should be considered.

## Hypersensitivity

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including some cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria and, rarely, late (10-14 days following injection) serious hypersensitivity reactions including widespread urticaria, dyspnea and high antibody titres have been reported. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Taltz should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

## Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)

Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with ixekizumab (see section 4.8). Ixekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, ixekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.

## Immunisations

Taltz should not be used with live vaccines. No data are available on the response to live vaccines; there are insufficient data on response to inactive vaccines (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 80 mg dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Polysorbate

This medicinal product contains 0.30 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 80 mg pre-filled pen which is equivalent to 0.30 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In plaque psoriasis studies, the safety of Taltz in combination with other immunomodulatory agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated.

In population pharmacokinetic analyses, clearance of ixekizumab was not affected by concomitant administration of oral corticosteroids, NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, or methotrexate.

## Cytochrome P450 substrates

Results from an interaction study in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis determined that 12 weeks of administration of ixekizumab with substances metabolised by CYP3A4 (i.e., midazolam), CYP2C9 (i.e., warfarin), CYP2C19 (i.e., omeprazole), CYP1A2 (i.e., caffeine) or CYP2D6 (i.e., dextromethorphan) does not have a clinically significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of these substances.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 10 weeks after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There is a limited amount of data from the use of ixekizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Taltz during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether ixekizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. However, ixekizumab is excreted at low levels in the milk of cynomolgus monkeys. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Taltz taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

The effect of ixekizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Taltz has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions (15.5 %) and upper respiratory tract infections (16.4 %) (most frequently nasopharyngitis).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing reports (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000).

A total of 8 956 patients have been treated with Taltz in blinded and open-label clinical studies in plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and other autoimmune conditions. Of these, 6 385 patients were exposed to Taltz for at least one year, cumulatively representing 19 833 adult patient years of exposure and 196 children cumulatively representing 207 patient years of exposure.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Injection site reactions

The most frequent injection site reactions observed were erythema and pain. These reactions were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of Taltz. In the adult plaque psoriasis studies, injection site reactions were more common in subjects with a body weight &lt; 60 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 60 kg (25 % vs. 14 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). In the psoriatic arthritis studies, injection site reactions were more common in subjects with a body weight &lt; 100 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 100 kg (24 % vs. 13 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). In the axial spondyloarthritis studies, injection site reactions were similar in subjects with a body weight &lt; 100 kg compared with the group with a body weight ≥ 100 kg (14 % vs. 9 % for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). The increased frequency of injection site reactions in the combined Q2W and Q4W groups did not result in an increase in discontinuations in either the plaque psoriasis, the psoriatic arthritis or the axial spondyloarthritis studies.

The results described above are obtained with the original formulation of Taltz. In a single-blinded, randomised cross-over study in 45 healthy subjects comparing the original formulation with the revised, citrate-free formulation, statistically significantly lower Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores were obtained with the citrate-free vs. the original formulation during injection (difference in LS Mean VAS score -21.69) and 10 min after injection (difference in LS Mean VAS score -4.47).

## Infections

In the placebo-controlled period of the phase III clinical studies in plaque psoriasis in adults, infections were reported in 27.2 % of patients treated with Taltz for up to 12 weeks compared with 22.9 % of patients treated with placebo.

The majority of infections were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity, most of which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 13 (0.6 %) of patients treated with Taltz and in 3 (0.4 %) of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). Over the entire treatment period infections were reported in 52.8 % of patients treated with Taltz (46.9 per 100 patient years). Serious infections were reported in 1.6 % of patients treated with Taltz (1.5 per 100 patient years).

Infection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis clinical studies were similar to those observed in the plaque psoriasis studies with the exception of the frequencies of the adverse reactions of influenza and conjunctivitis which were common in patients with psoriatic arthritis.

## Laboratory assessment of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia

In plaque psoriasis studies, 9% of patients receiving Taltz developed neutropenia. In most cases, the blood neutrophil count was ≥1 000 cells/mm 3 . Such levels of neutropenia may persist, fluctuate or be transient. 0.1% of patients receiving Taltz developed a neutrophil count &lt;1 000 cells/mm 3 . In general, neutropenia did not require discontinuation of Taltz. 3% of patients exposed to Taltz had a shift from a normal baseline platelet value to &lt;150 000 platelet cells/mm 3 to ≥75 000 cells/mm 3 .

Thrombocytopenia may persist, fluctuate or be transient.

The frequency of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis clinical studies is similar to that observed in the plaque psoriasis studies.

## Immunogenicity

Approximately 9-17% of adult plaque psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titres and not associated with reduced clinical response up to 60 weeks of treatment. However, approximately 1% of patients treated with Taltz had confirmed neutralising antibodies associated with low drug concentrations and reduced clinical response.

In psoriatic arthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 52 weeks, approximately 11% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titre, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 8% had confirmed neutralising antibodies. No apparent association between the presence of neutralising antibodies and impact on drug concentration or efficacy was observed.

In paediatric psoriasis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 12 weeks, 21 patients (18%) developed anti-drug antibodies, approximately half were low titer and 5 patients (4%) had confirmed neutralizing antibodies associated with low drug concentrations. There was no association with clinical response or adverse events.

In radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen up to 16 weeks, 5.2% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titer, and 1.5% (3 patients) had neutralising antibodies (NAb). In these 3 patients, NAb-positive samples had low ixekizumab concentrations and none of these patients achieved an ASAS40 response. In non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients treated with Taltz at the recommended dosing regimen for up to 52 weeks, 8.9% developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low titer; no patient had neutralising antibodies; and no apparent association between the presence of anti-drug antibodies and drug concentration, efficacy, or safety was observed.

In juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) patients treated with ixekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen up to 104 weeks, 18 patients (22.8 %) developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low to moderate titer. No apparent association between the presence of anti-drug antibodies and drug concentration, efficacy, or safety was observed.

Across all indications, an association between immunogenicity and treatment emergent adverse events has not been clearly established.

## Paediatric population

The safety profile observed in children with plaque psoriasis treated with Taltz every 4 weeks is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of conjunctivitis, influenza, and urticaria which were common. Inflammatory bowel disease was also more frequent in paediatric patients, although it was still uncommon. In the paediatric clinical study, Crohn's disease occurred in 0.9% of patients in the Taltz group and 0% of patients in the placebo group during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period. Crohn's disease occurred in a total of 4 Taltz treated subjects (2.0%) during the combined placebo-controlled and maintenance periods of the paediatric clinical study.

Adverse drug reactions in paediatric patients treated with the recommended dose of ixekizumab by subcutaneous injection in the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile psoriatic arthritis or enthesitisrelated arthritis) open-label clinical trial were consistent with the known safety profile of ixekizumab in the integrated safety dataset for paediatric plaque psoriasis indication as well as the adult indications of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis with the exception of frequencies for influenza (common), rhinitis (common) and conjunctivitis (common).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Doses up to 180 mg have been administered subcutaneously in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. Overdoses up to 240 mg, subcutaneously, as a single administration in clinical trials, have been reported without any serious adverse events. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC13

## Mechanism of action

Ixekizumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity (&lt; 3 pM) and specificity to interleukin 17A (both IL-17A and IL-17A/F). Elevated concentrations of IL-17A have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and activation, as well as in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis by driving inflammation leading to erosive bone damage and pathological new bone formation. Neutralisation of IL-17A by ixekizumab inhibits these actions. Ixekizumab does not bind to ligands IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E or IL-17F.

In vitro binding assays confirmed that ixekizumab does not bind to human Fc γ receptors I, IIa, and IIIa or to complement component C1q.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Ixekizumab modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by IL-17A. Based on psoriatic skin biopsy data from a phase I study, there was a dose-related trend towards decreased epidermal thickness, number of proliferating keratinocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells, as well as reductions in local inflammatory markers from baseline to day 43. As a direct consequence treatment with ixekizumab reduces erythema, induration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions.

Ixekizumab has been shown to lower (within 1 week of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Adult plaque psoriasis

The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in adult patients (N=3 866) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3). The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab were also evaluated versus etanercept (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3). Patients randomised to ixekizumab who were sPGA (0,1) responders (static Physicians Global Assessment) at week 12 were re-randomised to receive placebo or ixekizumab for an additional 48 weeks (UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2); patients randomised to placebo, etanercept or ixekizumab who were sPGA (0,1) non-responders received ixekizumab for up to 48 weeks. In addition, long-term efficacy and safety were evaluated in all three studies for up to a total of 5 years in patients who participated through the entire study.

64 % of patients had received prior systemic therapy (biologic, conventional systemic or psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA)), 43.5 % prior phototherapy, 49.3 % prior conventional systemic therapy, and 26.4 % prior biologic therapy. 14.9 % had received at least one anti-TNF alpha agent, and 8.7 % an anti-IL-12/IL-23. 23.4 % of patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis at baseline.

In all three studies, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and an sPGA of '0' ('clear') or '1' ('minimal') response at week 12 versus placebo. The median baseline PASI score ranged from 17.4 to 18.3;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

48.3 % to 51.2 % of patients had a baseline sPGA score of severe or very severe, and mean baseline itch Numeric Rating Scale (itch NRS) ranged from 6.3 to 7.1.

## Clinical response at 12 weeks

UNCOVER-1 randomised 1 296 patients (1:1:1) to receive either placebo or ixekizumab (80 mg every two or four weeks [Q2W or Q4W] following a 160 mg starting dose) for 12 weeks.

Ixekizumab was associated with a fast onset of efficacy with &gt; 50 % reduction in mean PASI by week 2 (Figure 1). The percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 was significantly greater for ixekizumab compared with placebo and etanercept as early as week 1. Approximately 25 % of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a PASI score &lt; 5 by week 2, more than 55 % achieved the PASI score &lt; 5 by week 4, and increased to 85 % by week 12 (compared to 3 %, 14 % and 50 % for etanercept). Significant improvements in itch severity were seen at week 1 in patients treated with ixekizumab.

The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, body weight, PASI baseline severity, plaques location, concurrent psoriatic arthritis, and previous treatment with a biologic. Ixekizumab was efficacious in systemic treatment-naive, biologic-naive, biologic/anti-TNF-exposed and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients.

For patients identified as an sPGA (0,1) non-responder to etanercept at week 12 in UNCOVER-2 (N = 200) and who were switched to ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W after a 4 week washout period, 73 % and 83.5 % of patients achieved sPGA (0,1) and PASI 75, respectively, after 12 weeks of treatment with ixekizumab.

In the 2 clinical studies that included an active comparator (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3), the rate of serious adverse events was 1.9 % for both etanercept and for ixekizumab, and the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 1.2 % for etanercept and 2.0 % for ixekizumab. The rate of infections was 21.5 % for etanercept and 26.0 % for ixekizumab, with 0.4 % being serious for etanercept and 0.5 % for ixekizumab.

## Maintenance of response at week 60 and up to 5 years

Patients originally randomised to ixekizumab and who were responders at week 12 (i.e., sPGA score of 0,1) in UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2 were re-randomised to an additional 48 weeks of treatment with placebo or ixekizumab (80 mg every four or twelve weeks [Q4W or Q12W]).

For sPGA (0,1) responders at week 12 re-randomised to treatment withdrawal (i.e., placebo), the median time to relapse (sPGA ≥ 3) was 164 days in integrated UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2 studies. Among these patients, 71.5 % regained at least an sPGA (0,1) response within 12 weeks of restarting treatment with ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W.

Ixekizumab was efficacious in the maintenance of response in systemic treatment-naive, biologic-naive, biologic/anti-TNF-exposed and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients.

Significantly greater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo and etanercept were demonstrated in nail psoriasis (as measured by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI]), in scalp psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI]) and in palmoplantar psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Palmoplantar Severity Index [PPASI]) and were maintained at week 60 in patients treated with ixekizumab who were sPGA (0,1) responders at week 12.

Of 591 subjects who received ixekizumab Q2W during the Induction Period then Q4W afterward in study UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3, 427 subjects completed 5 years of ixekizumab treatment, among those 101 patients required a dose escalation. Among the patients who completed the week 264 assessment (N=427), 295 patients (69%), 289 patients (68%) and 205 patients (48%) were observed to have sPGA (0,1), PASI 90 and PASI 100 response, respectively, at week 264. DLQI were collected after Induction Period in UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2, 113 patients (66%) were observed to have DLQI (0,1) response.

## Quality of life/patient-reported outcomes

At week 12 and across studies, ixekizumab was associated with statistically significant improvement in Health-related Quality of Life as assessed by mean decrease ranges from baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W from -10.2 to -11.1, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W from -9.4 to -10.7, etanercept from -7.7 to -8.0 and placebo -1.0 to -2.0). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a DLQI 0 or 1. Across studies a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a reduction of Itch NRS ≥ 4 points at week 12 (84.6% for ixekizumab Q2W, 79.2% for ixekizumab Q4W and 16.5% for placebo) and the benefit was sustained over time up to week 60 in patients treated with ixekizumab

who were sPGA (0 or 1) responders at week 12. There was not any evidence of worsening of depression up to 60 weeks treatment with ixekizumab as assessed by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report.

## Post-marketing direct comparative studies

IXORA-S: In a double-blind study ixekizumabwas superior against ustekinumab on the primary study objective PASI 90 response at week 12 (Table 6). Onset of response was superior on PASI 75 as early as week 2 (p &lt; 0.001) and on PASI 90 and PASI 100 by week 4 (p &lt; 0.001). Superiority of ixekizumab versus ustekinumab was also demonstrated in the subgroups stratified by weight.

## Efficacy in genital psoriasis

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (IXORA-Q) was conducted in 149 adult subjects (24% females) with moderate to severe genital psoriasis (sPGA of Genitalia score of ≥3), a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of 1% (60.4% had a BSA ≥ 10%) and previous failure of or intolerance to at least one topical therapy for genital psoriasis. Patients had at least moderate plaque psoriasis (defined as sPGA score of ≥ 3 and being candidates for phototherapy and/or systemic therapy) for at least 6 months.

Subjects randomised to ixekizumab received an initial dose of 160 mg followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved at least a \"0\" (clear) or \"1\" (minimal) response on the sPGA of Genitalia (sPGA of Genitalia 0/1). At week 12, significantly more subjects in the ixekizumab group than placebo group achieved a sPGA of Genitalia 0/1 and a sPGA 0/1 independent of baseline BSA (baseline BSA 1% - &lt;10% resp. ≥ 10%: sPGA of Genitalia ''0' or '1': ixekizumab 71%, resp. 75%; placebo: 0%, resp. 13%). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab achieved a reduction in the PROs of severity of genital pain, genital itch, impact of genital psoriasis on sexual activity, and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI).

## Paediatric plaque psoriasis

A randomised, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (IXORA-Peds) enrolled 201 children 6 to less than 18 years of age, with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by a sPGA score ≥3, involving ≥10% of the body surface area, and a PASI score ≥12) who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy.

Patients were randomised to placebo (n=56), etanercept (n=30) or ixekizumab (n=115) with dosing stratified by weight:

&lt;25 kg: 40 mg at week 0 followed by 20 mg Q4W (n=4)

25 kg to 50 kg: 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg Q4W (n=50)

- &gt;50 kg: 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg Q4W (n=147)

Patients randomised to etanercept (patients with severe psoriasis) received 0.8 mg/kg, not exceeding 50 mg per dose, every week from week 0 through week 11.

Response to treatment was assessed after 12 weeks and defined by the proportion of patients who achieved the co-primary endpoint of an sPGA score of '0' (clear) or '1' (almost clear) with at least a 2 point improvement from baseline and the proportion of patients that achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline.

Other evaluated outcomes at week 12 included the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 90, PASI 100, sPGA of '0' and an improvement of itch severity as measured by a reduction of at least 4 points on an 11-point itch Numeric Rating Scale.

Patients had a median baseline PASI of 17 score ranging from 12-49. Baseline sPGA score was severe or very severe in 49%. Of all patients, 22% had received prior phototherapy and 32% had received prior conventional systemic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis.

25% of patients (n=43) were below 12 years (14% of patients [n=24] were 6-9 years and 11% of patients [n=19] were 10-11 years); 75% (n=128) were 12 years or above.

The clinical response data are presented in Table 9.

Patients in the ixekizumab treatment group had clinically meaningful higher CDLQI/DLQI (0,1) responses at week 12 (NRI) compared with placebo. The difference between treatment groups was apparent from as early as week 4.

There were greater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo in nail psoriasis (as measured by the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index [NAPSI=0: ixekizumab 18% (6/34), placebo 0% (0/12)]), in scalp psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI=0: ixekizumab 69% (70/102), placebo 16% (8/50)]) and in palmoplantar psoriasis (as measured by Psoriasis Palmoplantar Severity Index [PPASI 75: ixekizumab 53% (9/17), placebo 11% (1/9)]).

## Psoriatic arthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in 780 patients with active psoriatic arthritis (≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender  joints). Patients had a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis [CASPAR] criteria) for a median of 5.33 years and had current plaque psoriasis skin lesions (94.0%) or a documented history of plaque psoriasis, with 12.1% of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at baseline. Over  58.9% and 22.3% of the psoriatic arthritis patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. Primary endpoint of both  studies was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24, followed by a long-term extension period from week 24 to week 156 (3 years).

In Psoriatic Arthritis Study 1 (SPIRIT-P1), patients naive to biologic therapy with active psoriatic arthritis were randomised to placebo, adalimumab 40 mg once every 2 weeks (active control reference arm), ixekizumab 80 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W). Both ixekizumab regimens included a 160 mg starting dose. 85.3% of patients in this study had received prior treatment with ≥1 conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (cDMARD). 53% of patients had concomitant use of MTX at a mean weekly dose of 15.8 mg. 67% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg or greater. Patients with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue therapy (modification to background therapy). Patients on ixekizumab Q2W or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Q4W remained on their originally assigned dose of ixekizumab. Patients receiving adalimumab or placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W at week 16 or 24 based on responder status. 243 patients completed the extension period of 3 years on ixekizumab.

Psoriatic Arthritis Study 2 (SPIRIT-P2) enrolled patients who were previously treated with an anti-TNF agent and discontinued the  anti-TNF agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti-TNF-IR patients). Patients were randomised to placebo, ixekizumab 80 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), or 80 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W). Both ixekizumab regimens included a 160 mg starting dose. 56% and 35% of patients were inadequate responders to 1 anti-TNF or 2 anti-TNF, respectively. SPIRIT-P2 evaluated 363 patients, of whom 41% had concomitant use of MTX at a mean weekly dose of 16.1 mg. 73.2% of patients who had concomitant use of MTX had a dose of 15 mg or greater. Patients with an inadequate response at week 16 received rescue therapy (modification to background therapy). Patients in ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W remained on their originally assigned dose of ixekizumab. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised 1:1 to ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W at week 16 or 24 based on responder status. 168 patients completed the extension period of 3 years on ixekizumab.

## Signs and symptoms

Treatment with ixekizumab resulted in significant improvement in measures of disease activity compared to placebo at week 24 (see Table 10).

In patients with pre-existing dactylitis or enthesitis, treatment with ixekizumab Q4W resulted in improvement in dactylitis and enthesitis at week 24 compared to placebo (resolution: 78% vs. 24%; p&lt;0.001, and 39% vs. 21%; p&lt;0.01, respectively).

In patients with ≥3% BSA , the improvement in skin clearance at week 12 as measured by 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 75), was 67% (94/141) for those treated with the Q4W dosing regimen, and 9% (12/134) for those treated with placebo (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of patients achieving a PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response at week 24 was greater with ixekizumab Q4W compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001). In patients with concomitant moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ixekizumab Q2W dose regimen showed significantly higher response rate for PASI75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001) and demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit over the Q4W dose regimen.

Treatment responses on ixekizumab were significantly greater than those on placebo as early as week 1 for ACR 20, week 4 for ACR 50 and week 8 for ACR 70 and persisted through week 24; effects were maintained through 3 years for patients who remained in the study.

In SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2, similar responses for ACR 20/50/70 were seen in patients with psoriatic arthritis regardless of  whether they were on concomitant cDMARDs, including MTX treatment, or not.

In SPIRIT-P1and SPIRIT-P2, improvements were shown in all components of the ACR scores including patient assessment of pain.  At week 24 the proportion of patients achieving a modified Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) response was greater  in the ixekizumab -treated patients compared to placebo.

In SPIRIT-P1, efficacy was maintained up to week 52 as assessed by ACR 20/50/70, MDA, enthesitis resolution, dactylitis resolution, and PASI 75/90/100 response rates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, disease duration, baseline body weight, baseline psoriasis involvement, baseline CRP, baseline DAS28-CRP, concomitant corticosteroid use, and previous treatment with a biologic. Ixekizumab was efficacious in biologic-naive, biologic-exposed and biologic-failure patients.

In SPIRIT-P1, 63 patients completed 3 years of Q4W ixekizumab treatment. Among the 107 patients who were randomised to ixekizumab Q4W (NRI analysis in ITT population), 54 patients (50%), 41 patients (38%), 29 patients (27%), and 36 patients (34%) were observed to have ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and MDA response, respectively, at week 156.

In SPIRIT-P2, 70 patients completed 3 years of Q4W ixekizumab treatment. Among the 122 patients who were randomised to ixekizumab Q4W (NRI analysis in ITT population), 56 patients (46%), 39 patients (32%), 24 patients (20%) and 33 (27%) were observed to have ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and MDA response, respectively, at week 156.

## Radiographic response

In SPIRIT-P1, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as the change in modified total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score  (ES) and the Joint Space Narrowing score (JSN) at weeks 24 and 52, compared to baseline. week 24  data are presented in Table 11.

Radiographic joint damage progression was inhibited by ixekizumab (Table 11) at week 24, and the percentage of patients with no radiographic joint damage progression (defined as a change from baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5) from randomisation to week 24 was 94.8% for ixekizumab Q2W (p&lt;0.001), 89.0% for ixekizumab Q4W (p=0.026), 95.8% for adalimumab (p&lt;0.001), all compared to 77.4% for placebo. At week 52, the mean change from baseline in mTSS was 0.27 for placebo/ixekizumab Q4W, 0.54 for ixekizumab Q4W/ixekizumab Q4W, and 0.32 for adalimumab/ixekizumab Q4W. The percentage of patients with no radiographic joint damage progression from randomisation to week 52 was 90.9% for placebo/ixekizumab Q4W, 85.6% for ixekizumab Q4W/ixekizumab Q4W, and 89.4% for adalimumab/ixekizumab Q4W. Patients had no structural progression from baseline (defined as mTSS≤0.5) in the treatment arms as follows: Placebo/ixekizumab Q4W 81.5% (N=22/27), ixekizumab Q4W/ixekizumab Q4W 73.6% (N=53/72), and adalimumab/ixekizumab Q4W 88.2% (N=30/34).

## Physical function and health-related quality of life

In both SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2, patients treated with ixekizumab Q2W (p&lt;0.001) and Q4W (p&lt;0.001) showed significant improvement in physical function compared to patients treated with placebo as assessed by Health  Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at week 24, and maintained at week 52 in SPIRIT-P1.

Ixekizumab-treated patients reported improvements in health-related quality of life as  measured by the Physical Component Summary of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36 PCS) score

(p&lt;0.001). There were also improvements demonstrated in fatigue as assessed by Fatigue severity NRS  scores (p&lt;0.001).

## Post-marketing phase 4, direct comparative study

Efficacy and safety of ixekizumab was investigated in a multicenter, randomised, open-label, rater-blinded, parallel-group study (SPIRIT-H2H) compared to adalimumab (ADA) in 566 patients with PsA who were naïve to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD). Patients were stratified at baseline based on concomitant cDMARD use and presence of moderate-to-severe psoriasis (PASI≥12, BSA≥10 and sPGA≥3).

Ixekizumab was superior to ADA on the primary study objective: simultaneous achievement of ACR 50 and PASI 100 response at week 24 (ixekizumab 36.0% vs ADA 27.9%; p=0.036; 95% confidence interval [0.5%, 15.8%]). Ixekizumab also showed non-inferiority (pre-specified margin of 12%) to ADA on ACR 50 (ITT analysis: ixekizumab 50.5% vs ADA 46.6%; 3.9% difference vs. ADA; 95% confidence interval [-4.3%; 12.1%]; PPS analysis ixekizumab: 52.3%, ADA: 53.1%, difference: -0.8% [CI: -10.3%; 8.7%]) and superiority on PASI 100 at week 24 (60.1 % with ixekizumab vs 46.6% with ADA, p=0.001), which were the major secondary endpoints in the study. At week 52 a higher proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab versus ADA simultaneously achieved ACR50 and PASI 100 [39% (111/283) versus 26% (74/283)] and PASI 100 [64% (182/283) versus 41% (117/283)]. Ixekizumab and ADA treatment resulted in similar responses for ACR50 [49.8% (141/283) versus 49.8% (141/283)]. Responses to ixekizumab were consistent when used as monotherapy or with concomitant use of methotrexate.

## Axial spondyloarthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in a total of 960 adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis in three randomised placebo-controlled studies (two in radiographic and one in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis).

## Radiographic axial spondyloarthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in a total of 657 patients in two randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies (COAST-V and COAST-W) in adult patients who had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4 and total back pain ≥4 on a numeric rating scale despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Across both studies at baseline, patients had symptoms for a mean of 17 years (median of 16 years). At baseline, approximately 32% of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD.

COAST-V evaluated 341 biologic-naive patients treated with either ixekizumab 80 mg or 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 4 weeks (Q4W), adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks, or with placebo. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised at week 16 to receive ixekizumab (160 mg starting dose, followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W). Patients receiving adalimumab were re-randomised at week 16 to receive ixekizumab (80 mg Q2W or Q4W).

COAST-W evaluated 316 patients who had prior experience with 1 or 2 TNF-inhibitors (90% were inadequate responders and 10% were intolerant to TNF inhibitors). All patients were treated with ixekizumab 80 or 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W, or with placebo. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised at week 16 to receive ixekizumab (160 mg initial dose, followed by 80 mg Q2W or Q4W).

The primary endpoint in both studies was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at week 16.

## Clinical response

In both studies, patients treated with ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W demonstrated greater improvements in ASAS40 and ASAS20 responses compared to placebo at week 16 (Table 12). Responses were similar in patients regardless of concomitant therapies. In COAST-W, responses were seen regardless of the number of prior TNF inhibitors.

* p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01; *** p&lt;0.001 compared with placebo.

Similar response in ASAS40 was seen in patients regardless of baseline CRP levels, baseline ASDAS scores and MRI spine SPARCC scores. The ASAS40 response was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, disease duration, baseline body weight, baseline BASDAI score and prior biologic treatment.

In COAST-V and COAST-W efficacy was maintained up to week 52 as assessed by the endpoints presented in Table 12, including ASAS20, ASAS40, ASDAS, BASDAI, and ASAS HI response rates.

## Health-related outcomes

Spinal pain showed improvements versus placebo as early as week 1, maintained through week 16 [ixekizumab vs placebo: COAST-V -3.2 vs -1.7; COAST-W -2.4 vs -1.0]; fatigue and spinal mobility showed improvements versus placebo at week 16. Improvements in spinal pain, fatigue and spinal mobility were maintained through week 52.

## Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis

Ixekizumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind study with a 52-week placebo-controlled period (COAST-X) in 303 adult patients with active axial spondyloarthritis for at least 3 months. Patients must have had objective signs of inflammation indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and no definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on sacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4, and spinal pain ≥4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Patients were treated with either ixekizumab 80 mg or 160 mg at week 0, followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or with placebo. Dose adjustment and/or initiation of concomitant medications (NSAIDs, cDMARDs, corticosteroids, analgesics) were permitted starting at week 16.

At baseline, patients had symptoms of non-radiographic axSpA for an average of 11 years. Approximately 39% of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at week 16.

## Clinical response

Higher proportions of patients treated with ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W achieved ASAS40 response compared to placebo at week 16 (Table 13). Responses were similar regardless of concomitant therapies.

Efficacy was maintained up to week 52 as assessed by the endpoints presented in Table 13.

## Health-related outcomes

Spinal pain showed improvements versus placebo as early as week 1 and was maintained through week 16 [ixekizumab vs placebo: COAST-X: -2.4 vs -1.5]. In addition, more patients on ixekizumab compared with placebo achieved good health status (ASAS HI ≤5) at week 16 and week 52.

## Long-term outcomes Axial Spondyloarthritis

Patients who completed one of the three pivotal studies COAST-V/W/X (52 weeks) were offered participation in a long-term extension and randomised withdrawal study (COAST-Y, with 350 and 423 patients enrolled on ixekizumab Q4W and Q2W, respectively). Among those who achieved remission 157/773 (20.3%) (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score [ASDAS] &lt;1.3 at least once, and no ASDAS score ≥2.1, at weeks 16 and 20), 155 patients exposed to ixekizumab up to 76 weeks were randomised at week 24 of the COAST-Y study (Placebo, N=53; ixekizumab Q4W, N=48; and ixekizumab Q2W, N=54); of these, 148 (95.5%) completed the week 64 visit (Placebo, N=50; ixekizumab Q4W, N=47; ixekizumab Q2W, N=51). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in the randomised withdrawal population who did not experience a flare during weeks 24-64 (combined ixekizumab Q2W and ixekizumab Q4W groups versus placebo). A significantly larger proportion of patients (NRI) in the combined ixekizumab groups (83.3% (85/102), p&lt;0.001) and ixekizumab Q4W (83.3 % (40/48), p=0.003) had no flare during weeks 24-64 compared with those who withdrew from ixekizumab to placebo (54.7 % (29/53)). Ixekizumab (in both combined ixekizumab groups and ixekizumab Q4W group) significantly delayed the time to flare (Log-Rank Test p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) compared to Placebo.

In patients who received ixekizumab Q4W continuously (N=157), the ASAS40, ASDAS &lt;2.1 and BASDAI50 responses were maintained to week 116.

## Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

## Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA)and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)

A multicenter, open-label, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study (COSPIRIT-JIA) of subcutaneous ixekizumab with adalimumab reference arm, in children from 2 to less than 18 years of age with JPsA or ERA was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab for 16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weeks after treatment initiation. The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the percentage of patients meeting the JIA ACR 30 (30 % improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria) response criteria at week 16.

Twenty patients were randomly assigned to ixekizumab and 20 patients to adalimumab. Randomisation was stratified based on the category of JIA (JPsA or ERA). The remaining patients who were bDMARD-naive or bDMARD-experienced were assigned to ixekizumab. Patients entering the study were not required to have a documented inadequate response to prior treatment.

In the ixekizumab group (N = 81), the JIA patient subtypes at study entry were: 33.3% JPsA and 66.7% ERA; with 74.1% (60/81) patients bDMARD naïve, and 33.3% (27/81) cDMARD naïve. Overall, 72.8% of ixekizumab treated patients received at least 1 concomitant JIA therapy during the Open Label Treatment (OLT) period. Baseline concomitant methotrexate use was reported for 40.7% of patients, baseline concomitant sulfasalazine use reported for 4.9%, baseline concomitant NSAIDs use reported for 49.4% and baseline concomitant glucocorticoids use reported for 11.1%.

Patients assigned to ixekizumab (N = 81) received dosing stratified by weight as follows: 10 to &lt; 25 kg: 40 mg at week 0 followed by 20 mg Q4W (n = 6) 25 kg to 50 kg: 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg Q4W (n = 20) &gt; 50 kg: 160 mg at week 0 followed by 80 mg Q4W (n = 55)

For the randomized  bDMARD naïve patients, JIA ACR 30 response rate at week 16 was 18/20 (90%) for the ixekizumab group and 19/20 (95%) in the adalimumab group. In the overall ixekizumab population (n=81) the JIA ACR 30 response rate was 54/60 (90%) in the bDMARD naïve group and 18/21 (85.7%) in the bDMARD experienced group.

JIA ACR 30 response rates at week 16 were also consistent across JPsA (24/27, 88.9 %) and ERA (48/54, 88.9 %) subtypes.

In addition, the percentage of patients meeting the JIA ACR 30/50/70/90/100 response criteria were evaluated at week 16. The clinical response data are presented in Figure 8.

## Immunisations

In a study in healthy subjects, no safety concerns were identified of two inactivated vaccines (tetanus and pneumococcal), received after two doses of ixekizumab (160 mg followed by a second dose of 80 mg two weeks later). However, the data concerning immunisation were insufficient to conclude on an adequate immune response to these vaccines following administration of ixekizumab.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with ixekizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis/axial spondyloarthritis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following a single subcutaneous dose of ixekizumab in patients with psoriasis, mean peak concentrations were achieved within 4 to 7 days, across a dose range of 5 to 160 mg. The mean (SD)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ixekizumab, after the 160 mg starting dose, was 19.9 (8.15) µg/mL.

After the 160 mg starting dose, steady state was achieved by week 8 with the 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and C trough,ss estimates are 21.5 (9.16) µg/mL, and 5.23 (3.19) µg/mL.

After switching from the 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen to the 80 mg Q4W dosing regimen at week 12, steady state would be achieved after approximately 10 weeks. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss, and Ctrough,ss estimates are 14.6 (6.04) µg/mL, and 1.87 (1.30) µg/mL.

The average bioavailability of ixekizumab after subcutaneous administration was 54 % to 90 % across analyses.

## Distribution

From population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean total volume of distribution at steady state was 7.11 L.

## Biotransformation

Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulins.

## Elimination

In the population PK analysis, mean serum clearance was 0.0161 L/hr. Clearance is independent of dose. The mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, is 13 days in patients with plaque psoriasis.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Exposure (Area Under the Curve or AUC) increased proportionally over a dose range of 5 to 160 mg given as a subcutaneous injection.

## Pharmacokinetic properties across indications

The pharmacokinetic properties of ixekizumab were similar across the plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis indications.

## Elderly

Of the 4,204 plaque psoriasis patients exposed to ixekizumab in clinical studies, a total of 301 were 65 years of age or older and 36 patients were 75 years of age or older. Of the 1 118 psoriatic arthritis patients exposed to ixekizumab in clinical studies, a total of 122 patients were 65 years of age or older and 6 patients were 75 years of age or older.

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n = 94 for age ≥ 65 years and n = 12 for age ≥ 75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than 65 years of age was similar.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on the PK of ixekizumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of intact ixekizumab, an IgG MAb, is expected to be low and of minor importance; similarly, IgG MAbs are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of ixekizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

Paediatric psoriasis patients (age 6 to less than 18 years) were administered ixekizumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen for 12 weeks. Patients weighing &gt;50 kg and 25 to 50 kg had a mean ±SD steady-state trough concentration of 3.8 ±2.2 µg/mL and 3.9 ±2.4 µg/mL, respectively, at week 12.

Paediatric juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients (age 6 to less than 18 years) were administered ixekizumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen for 16 weeks. Patients weighing &gt; 50 kg, and 25 to 50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentra tion of 3.9 ± 1.8 and 3.5 ± 1.3 μg/m L, respectively, at week 16. There were limited PK data in patients weighing &lt; 25 kg.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology evaluations, and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies.

Ixekizumab administration to cynomolgus monkeys for 39 weeks at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mg/kg weekly produced no organ toxicity or undesirable effects on immune function (e.g. T-cell dependent antibody response and NK cell activity). A weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg to monkeys is approximately 19 times the 160 mg starting dose of ixekizumab and in monkeys results in exposure (AUC) that is at least 61-fold higher than the predicted mean steady-state exposure in humans administered the recommended dose regimen.

Non-clinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of ixekizumab.

No effects on reproductive organs, menstrual cycles or sperm were observed in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys that received ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg.

In developmental toxicity studies, ixekizumab was shown to cross the placenta and was present in the blood of offspring for up to 6 months of age. A higher incidence of postnatal mortality occurred in the offspring of monkeys given ixekizumab compared to concurrent controls. This was related primarily to early delivery or maternal neglect of offspring, common findings in nonhuman primate studies, and considered clinically irrelevant.

## 1. What Taltz is and what it is used for

Taltz contains the active substance ixekizumab.

Taltz is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below:

- Plaque psoriasis in adults
- Plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents
- Psoriatic arthritis in adults
- Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis in adults
- Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis in adults
- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis, in patients from the age of 6 years and older and with a body weight of at least 25 kg

Ixekizumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which promotes psoriasis and inflammatory disease of the joints and the spine.

## Plaque psoriasis

Taltz is used to treat a skin condition called 'plaque psoriasis' in adults and in children from the age of 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents with moderate to severe disease. Taltz reduces the signs and symptoms of the disease.

Using Taltz will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Taltz is used to treat a condition called 'psoriatic arthritis' in adults, an inflammatory disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines or in case of intolerance, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease. Taltz can be used alone or with another medicine named methotrexate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Using Taltz will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the disease, improving physical function (ability to do normal daily activities), and slowing down the damage to the joints.

## Axial spondyloarthritis

Taltz is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which causes inflammation of the spinal joints, called axial spondyloarthritis. If the condition is visible using X-rays, it is referred to as 'radiographic axial spondyloarthritis'; if it occurs in patients with no visible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as 'non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis'. If you have axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce inflammation and improve your physical function.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis Taltz is used in patients from the age of 6 years of age and older and with a body weight of at least 25 kg to treat the conditions of juvenile idiopathic arthritis called 'juvenile psoriatic arthritis' and 'enthesitis-related arthritis'. These conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone.

Using Taltz will benefit you by reducing the symptoms of the disease and improving your physical function.

## 1. What Taltz is and what it is used for

Taltz contains the active substance ixekizumab.

Taltz is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below:

- Plaque psoriasis in adults
- Plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents
- Psoriatic arthritis in adults
- Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis in adults
- Non-radiographic Axial S pondyloarthritis in adults
- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis, in patients from the age of 6 years and older and with a body weight of at least 25 kg

Ixekizumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which promotes psoriasis and inflammatory disease of the joints and the spine.

## Plaque psoriasis

Taltz is used to treat a skin condition called 'plaque psoriasis' in adults and in children from the age of 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents with moderate to severe disease. Taltz reduces the signs and symptoms of the disease.

Using Taltz will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Taltz is used to treat a condition called 'psoriatic arthritis' in adults, an inflammatory disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines or in case of intolerance, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease. Taltz can be used alone or with another medicine named methotrexate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Using Taltz will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the disease, improving physical function (ability to do normal daily activities), and slowing down the damage to the joints.

## Axial spondyloarthritis

Taltz is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which causes inflammation of the spinal joints, called axial spondyloarthritis. If the condition is visible using X-rays, it is referred to as 'radiographic axial spondyloarthritis'; if it occurs in patients with no visible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as 'non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis'. If you have axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce inflammation and improve your physical function.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis Taltz is used in patients from the age of 6 years of age and older and with a body weight of at least 25 kg to treat the conditions of juvenile idiopathic arthritis called 'juvenile psoriatic arthritis' and 'enthesitis-related arthritis'. These conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone.

Using Taltz will benefit you by reducing the symptoms of the disease and improving your physical function.

## 1. What Taltz is and what it is used for

Taltz contains the active substance ixekizumab.

Taltz is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below:

- Plaque psoriasis in adults
- Plaque psoriasis in children from the age of 6 and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents
- Psoriatic arthritis in adults
- Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis in adults
- Non-radiographic Axial S pondyloarthritis in adults
- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis, in patients from the age of 6 years and older and with a body weight of at least 25 kg

Ixekizumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-17A, which promotes psoriasis and inflammatory disease of the joints and the spine.

## Plaque psoriasis

Taltz is used to treat a skin condition called 'plaque psoriasis' in adults and in children from the age of 6 years and with a body weight of at least 25 kg and in adolescents with moderate to severe disease. Taltz reduces the signs and symptoms of the disease.

Using Taltz will benefit you by improvements of skin clearance and reducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain.

## Psoriatic arthritis

Taltz is used to treat a condition called 'psoriatic arthritis' in adults, an inflammatory disease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines or in case of intolerance, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease. Taltz can be used alone or with another medicine named methotrexate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Using Taltz will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the disease, improving physical function (ability to do normal daily activities), and slowing down the damage to the joints.

## Axial spondyloarthritis

Taltz is used to treat adults with an inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine which causes inflammation of the spinal joints, called axial spondyloarthritis. If the condition is visible using X-rays, it is referred to as 'radiographic axial spondyloarthritis'; if it occurs in patients with no visible signs on X-rays, it is referred to as 'non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis'. If you have axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Taltz to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce inflammation and improve your physical function.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including enthesitis-related arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis Taltz is used in patients from the age of 6 years of age and older and with a body weight of at least 25 kg to treat the conditions of juvenile idiopathic arthritis called 'juvenile psoriatic arthritis' and 'enthesitis-related arthritis'. These conditions are inflammatory diseases affecting the joints and the places where tendons join the bone.

Using Taltz will benefit you by reducing the symptoms of the disease and improving your physical function.

Taltz is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines.

## Taltz contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 80 mg dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Taltz contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.30 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 80 mg pre-filled pen, which is equivalent to 0.30 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How to use Taltz

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Taltz is given by injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection). You and your doctor or nurse should decide if you should inject Taltz yourself.

For use in children with a body weight of 25-50 kg ixekizumab doses of 40 mg must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare professional.

Use the Taltz 80 mg pre-filled pen only in those children that require a dose of 80 mg and do not require dose preparation.

It is important not to try to inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or nurse. A caregiver may also give you your Taltz injection after proper training.

Use a reminder method such as notes in a calendar or diary to help you remember your next dose so that you avoid missing or repeating doses.

Taltz is for long-term treatment. Your doctor or nurse will regularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each pen contains one dose of Taltz (80 mg). Each pen delivers only one dose. The pen must not be shaken.

Read the 'Instructions for use' for the pen carefully before using Taltz.

## How much Taltz is given and for how long

Your doctor will explain to you how much Taltz you need and for how long.

## Plaque psoriasis in adults

- -The first dose is 160 mg (2 pens with 80 mg each) by subcutaneous injection. This may be given by your doctor or nurse.
- -After the first dose, you will use an 80 mg dose (1 pen) at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. From week 12, you will use an 80 mg dose (1 pen ) every 4 weeks.

Plaque psoriasis in patients age 6 years and above and at least 25 kg body weight.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients age 6 years and above and at least 25 kg body weight.

The recommended dose given by subcutaneous injection in children is based on the following weight categories:

| Children's body weight   | Recommended starting dose (week 0)   | Recommended dose every 4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

If the 40 mg pre-filled syringe is not available, ixekizumab doses of 40 mg must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare professional using the commercial Taltz 80 mg pre-filled syringe.

Use the Taltz 80 mg pre-filled pen only in those children that require a dose of 80 mg. Do not use the Taltz 80 mg pre-filled pen for the preparation of the 40 mg dose.

Taltz is not recommended for use in children with a body weight below 25 kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Guide to the parts

## 1 GET READY

- 1a Take the pre-filled pen from the refrigerator. Leave the base cap on until you are ready to inject. Wait 30 minutes to let the pre-filled pen warm to room temperature before you use it.

DO NOT use any heat sources to warm the medicine, for example: a microwave, hot water, or direct sunlight.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Inspect the pre-filled pen. Check the label. Make sure the name Taltz appears on the label.

The medicine inside should be clear. Its colour may vary from colourless to slightly yellow.

If you see any of the following, DO NOT USE the pre-filled pen, and dispose of it as directed:

- It is past the expiry date.
- It looks damaged.
- The medicine is cloudy, is distinctly brown, or has small particles.

## 1d Wash your hands before you inject your medicine.

<!-- image -->

## Choose your injection site.

You may inject in your abdomen (stomach area), in your thigh, or in the back of your arm. To inject in your arm, you will need someone to help you.

DO NOT inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks. DO NOT inject within 2.5 centimetres of the navel (belly button).

Alternate your injection sites. DO NOT inject in the exact same spot every time. For example, if your last injection was in your left thigh, your next injection should be in your right thigh, your abdomen, or the back of either arm.

- 1f Prepare your skin. Clean your skin with an alcohol wipe. Let the injection site dry naturally before you inject your medicine.

## Make sure the lock ring is in the lock position.

Leave the base cap on until you are ready to inject. DO NOT touch the needle.

## Twist off the base cap.

Throw the base cap in the bin. You will not need to put the base cap back on-doing so could damage the needle or cause you to injure yourself by accident.

Place the clear base flat and firmly against your skin.

Keep the base on your skin, and then turn the lock ring to the unlock position. You are now ready to inject.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3 FINISH

3a

<!-- image -->

Press the green injection button. There will be a loud click.

Keep holding the clear base firmly against your skin. You will hear a second loud click in about 5 to 10 seconds after the first one. The second loud click tells you that your injection is complete.

You will also see the grey plunger at the top of the clear base.

Remove the pre-filled pen from your skin.

Press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site. DO NOT rub the injection site, as this may cause bruising. You may have slight bleeding. This is normal.

## Dispose of the pre-filled pen.

DO NOT put the base cap back on. Dispose of the pre-filled pen in a sharps container or as directed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## When you dispose of the pre-filled pen and the sharps container:

- Dispose of the pen in a sharps container or as directed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- Do not recycle the filled sharps container.
- Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about how to dispose of medicines you no longer use.

## Safety tips

- If you do not have a sharps container, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse where you can get one.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Commonly asked questions

## Q. What if I see air bubbles in the pre-filled pen?

- A. It is normal to have air bubbles in the pre-filled pen. Taltz is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Air bubbles are not a problem in this type of injection. They will not harm you or affect your dose.
- Q. What if there is a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle when I remove the base cap?
- A. It is okay to see a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle. This will not harm you or affect your dose.
- Q. What if I unlocked the pre-filled pen and pressed the green injection button before I twisted off the base cap?
- A. Do not remove the base cap. Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- Q. Do I need to hold the injection button down until the injection is complete?
- A. This is not necessary, but it may help you keep the pre-filled pen steady and firm against your skin.
- Q. What if the needle did not retract after my injection?
- A. Do not touch the needle or replace the base cap. Dispose of the pre-filled pen in a closable, puncture-resistant sharps container. Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- Q. What if I heard more than 2 clicks during my injection-2 loud clicks and a soft one. Did I get my complete injection?
- A. Some patients may hear a soft click right before the second loud click. That is normal. Do not remove the pre-filled pen from your skin until you hear the second loud click.
- Q. How can I tell if my injection is complete?
- A. After you press the green injection button, you will hear 2 loud clicks. The second click tells you that your injection is complete. You will also see the grey plunger at the top of the clear base.
- Q. What if the pre-filled pen is left at room temperature for longer than 30 minutes?
- A. If needed, the pre-filled pen may be left out of the fridge at temperature not above 30 °C for up to 5 days if protected from direct sunlight. Taltz should be discarded if not used within the 5 day period at room temperature.
