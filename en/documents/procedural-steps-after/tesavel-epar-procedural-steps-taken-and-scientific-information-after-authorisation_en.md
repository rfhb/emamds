| WS/1727   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, to include the data from paediatric study P083 (EMEA-000470-PIP01-08-M11), and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the Annexes in line with the latest QRD template.

Patients were randomised to sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo for 20 weeks. Mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%. Treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg did not provide significant improvement in HbA1c at 20 weeks. The reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=95) was 0.0% compared to 0.2% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.2% (95% CI: -0.7, 0.3). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin (single dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg) were investigated. In this population, the dose-adjusted AUC of sitagliptin in plasma was approximately 18% lower compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes for a 100 mg dose. This is not considered to be a clinically meaningful difference compared to adult patients based on the flat PK/PD relationship between the |

No studies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients with age <10 years. In clinical trials with sitagliptin in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to17 years, the profile of adverse reactions was comparable to that observed in adults. Sitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of insufficient efficacy. Sitagliptin has not been studied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age.   |

The study included patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, as well as patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal impairment on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (including ESRD) were assessed using population pharmacokinetic analyses. Compared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased by approximately 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (GFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min) and patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min), respectively. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased approximately 2 fold in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min), and approximately 4 fold in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), including in   |

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with the results of study MK-0431 PN260 which examined the insulin- sparing effect of sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily compared with placebo over 24 weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on insulin alone or in combination with metformin. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

Baseline HbA1c was 8.74% and baseline insulin dose was 37 IU/day. Patients were instructed to titrate their insulin glargine dose based on fingerstick fasting glucose values. At Week 24, the increase in daily insulin dose was 19 IU/day in patients treated with sitagliptin and 24 IU/day in patients treated with placebo. The reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) was 1.31% compared to 0.87% in patients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without metformin), a difference of 0.45% [95% CI: -0.60, - 0.29].

Some specific adverse events occurred at a slightly higher incidence in the sitagliptin group relative to the placebo group. The adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. There was a low incidence of hypoglycaemia with no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences between groups; this is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The few events reported in the sitagliptin group were mild, none required assistance for treatment, and none caused interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Numerically lower incidences of peripheral oedema were reported in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. The table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the results of study P128. The adverse drug reactions associated with the combination of sitagliptin and rosiglitazone which were previously included in the SmPC have been deleted. Section 5.1 of the SmPC has also been updated to reflect the results of study P128, and results of the study of sitagliptin in combination with rosiglitazone have been deleted.   |

| WS/0179 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to remove the restrictions on the use of sitagliptin in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency or end stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/11/2011 | 19/12/2011 | SmPC and PL | The initial marketing authorisation was for use of sitagliptin for the treatment of patients with T2DM and normal or mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min). At that time the CHMP considered the clinical experience with sitagliptin in patients with T2DM and moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min) to be too limited and the use of sitagliptin in these patients was therefore not recommended. There were in particular, concerns about the cardiovascular safety in these patients, as in study P028 (a study in renally impaired patients) more patients died in the sitagliptin group compared to the placebo/glipizide group (5 vs. 1). The difference was higher than expected on the basis of the randomisation ratio. In the sitagliptin group, 4 of the 5 patients died due to cardiac adverse experiences, while there was no cardiac death in the glipizide group. As a result of this the MAH agreed to a post approval commitment to further assess the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in these patients in a study of at least 24 weeks duration. In support of the application two studies were submitted, one (P063) in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and one study in patients with ESRD on dialysis (study P073). Treatment naive patients, patients on a single oral AHA or on low dose dual combination treatment could participate in the study. Patients were randomised to receive sitagliptin or glipizide. Study duration was 54 weeks. The doses of sitagliptin used in the two new studies supporting this Type 2 variation were 50 mg q.d. for |

| patients with moderate renal insufficiency and 25 mg q.d.  for patients with severe renal insufficiency or ESRD on  dialysis.  In both studies a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c was  seen after 54 weeks of treatment, both in the sitagliptin  group (-0.76 and -0.72 in study P063 and P073  respectively) and the glipizide group (-0.62 and -0.87,  respectively). The criteria for non-inferiority were met in  study P063. Secondary endpoints were in line with these  results.  In general sitagliptin was well tolerated, and the incidences  of adverse events were not meaningfully different between  treatment groups.  There was a difference in the Metabolism and Nutrition  disorders SOC and Investigations SOC, but the difference  was in favour of sitagliptin. Differences were primarily due  to a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia or blood glucose  decreased in the glipizide group.  Incidences of cardiovascular serious adverse events were  generally similar in both treatment groups in both  populations (moderate to severe renal impairment, and  ESRD). In addition, a second analysis, including serious and  non-serious events, did not reveal differences between  treatment groups.  Renal function was not affected by sitagliptin, and  laboratory measurements and vital signs did not show  meaningful changes or differences.  There was a higher incidence of adverse experiences in the  Neoplasms Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified (incl. cysts  and polyps) SOC, with 8 cases in the sitagliptin group and  none in the glipizide group. All cases occurred in the first  six months of therapy and represent different type of   |

The overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the sitagliptin group compared to the glipizide group. Although a finger stick was not required, a value was reported for most (92-94%) of the patients with adverse events of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. This does not necessarily mean that there was a value for every event. However, in nearly all cases the blood glucose value was below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). The conclusion of the assessment is that the benefit/risk for treatment of patients with renal impairment is positive.   |

| II/0007   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet to include the side effects pancreatitis and cutaneous vasculitis. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 23/07/2009   | 20/08/2009   | SmPC and PL     | The MAH has provided a cumulative review of cases reporting pancreatitis and cutaneous vasculitus while on sitagliptin therapy. In clinical trials the number of pancreatitis cases is very low. However, since market introduction, 108 cases of (acute) pancreatitis were reported. For 38 of the cases, the lack of information did not allow full assessment. Two fatalities were reported, but the cases are confounded by several serious co-morbidities and concomitantly used medication. Based on the provided data, a causal relation between the use of sitagliptin and the occurrence of pancreatitis cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the inclusion of pancreatitis to section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) is acceptable. A total of 15 cases of cutaneous vasculitis were reported spontaneously and in clinical trials. In the majority of these cases, patients were suffering from multiple co-morbidities and using many drugs concomitantly. Taking into account the fact that hypersensitivity reactions are known for sitagliptin-containing products (labeled in the current SPC) and the positive de- and rechallenge in an extensively documented case report, a causal relation between the use of sitagliptin and the occurrence of vasculitis is considered to be likely. The addition of cutaneous vasculitis to section 4.8 is therefore acceptable.   |
