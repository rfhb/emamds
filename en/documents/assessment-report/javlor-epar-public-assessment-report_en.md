## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 3.1 Introduction

## Transitional cell carcinoma urothelium (TCCU)

TCCU comprises of bladder cancer (90%), renal pelvis (9%) and ureteral carcinoma (1%). Radical cystectomy  is  the  recommended  treatment  in  most  cases  of  infiltrating,  non-metastatic  bladder carcinoma. External beam irradiation, with elective salvage cystectomy for residual local recurrence is preferred in some centres. Despite standard treatment, up to 30-40% of patients will develop distant metastases and approximately 15% of patients will be found to have regional or distant metastasis at diagnosis. Metastatic TCCU represents an aggressive disease that is associated with a median survival that rarely exceeds 3 - 6 months if left untreated.

Transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium is considered to be a chemosensitive tumour. However, chemotherapy  confers  only  a  modest  survival  benefit  and  metastatic  disease  remains  essentially incurable, with only a small number  of  patients achieving long-term disease control. Both Performance Status (PS) and visceral involvement are prognostic factors predictive of overall survival after 1st line treatment of patients with metastatic TCCU. A number of chemotherapeutic agents have single  agent  activity  against  urothelial  cancer,  achieving  mainly  partial  responses  of  short  duration. Combination  therapy  may  yield  response  rates  of  30-35%.  M-VAC  (methotrexate  +  vinblastine  + doxorubicin  +  cisplatin  combination)  or  GC  (gemcitabine  +  cisplatin)  are  regimens  for  metastatic TCCU.

There is currently no standard therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, whose disease has  progressed  after  or  during  a  prior  platinum-containing  regimen.  These  patients  have  a  median survival of approximately 4 months and a poor prognosis. No randomised studies have been conducted in  this  patient  group  for  single  agent  treatment  of  second  line  TCCU.  Phase  II  studies  have  been conducted  in  small  populations  of  patients  (&lt;  60)  that  show  response  rates  ranging  from  0%  with bortezomib to 29% with gemcitabine.

## The Medicinal Product

Javlor  25 mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  belongs  to  the  pharmacotherapeutic  group  of Vinca alkaloids  and  analogues,  ATC  code:  L01CA05.  1 ml  of  concentrate  contains  25 mg  of vinflunine (as ditartrate). Vinflunine (Javlor) is a microtubule inhibitor. Microtubules are involved in the maintenance of cell shape, mobility, adhesion and intracellular integrity as well as having a role in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the formation of the mitotic spindle during proliferation. Vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca  binding  sites  inhibiting  its  polymerisation  into  microtubules,  which  results  in  treadmilling suppression,  disruption  of  microtubule  dynamic,  mitotic  arrestand  apoptosis. In  vivo vinflunine displays a significant antitumor activity against a broad spectrum of human xenografts in mice both in terms  of  survival  prolongation  and  tumour  growth  inhibition.In  common  with  other  Vinca  agents, vinflunine blocks cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and induces cell death via apoptosis.

Javlor  is  indicated  in  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen. The efficacy and safety of vinflunine has not been studied in patients with a Performance Status ≥ 2. Vinflunine treatment should be initiated under the responsibility of a physician qualified in the use of anticancer chemotherapy.  Before each cycle, adequate monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted to verify the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) as neutopenia is a frequent adverse reaction of vinflunine.

The recommended posology is 320 mg/m² as a 20-minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. In case of    WHO/ECOG Performance Status  (PS)  of  1  or    of  0  and  prior  pelvic  irradiation,  the  treatment should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m². In the absence of any  haematological toxicity during the first cycle causing treatment delay or dose reduction, the dose will be increased to 320 mg/m² every 3 weeks for the subsequent cycles.

## 3.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

## 3.3 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Javlor is concentrate for solution for infusion and contains 25 mg/ml of vinflunine base as active substance (corresponding to 34.175 mg/ml of vinflunine ditartate). The finished product is available in 50 mg/2 ml, 100 mg/4 ml and 250 mg/10 ml single-use vials. The container closure system is a type I colourless glass vial with a chlorobutyl or a laminated butyl rubber stopper and an aluminium flip-off seal.

The other ingredients are water for injections and nitrogen (low oxygen).

Javlor  is  diluted  with  a  suitable  parenteral  fluid,  sodium  chloride  0.9  %  solution  or  glucose  5% solution  to  obtain  a  solution  ranging  from  3  mg/ml  to  7  mg/ml  prior  to  intravenous  infusion. Compatible admixture fluids and administration sets have been qualified and use-times and storage conditions for diluted solutions for infusion have been established.

## Active Substance

Its  chemical  name  is  ((2 β ,3 β ,4 β ,5 α ,12 R ,19 α )-4-(acetyloxy)-6,7-didehydro-15-[(2 R ,4 R ,6 S ,8 S )-4-(1,1difluoroethyl)-1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-octahydro-8-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,6-methano-2-Hazecino[4,3-b]indol-8yl]-3-hydroxy-16-methoxy-1-methyl-aspidospermidine-3-carboxylic  acid  methyl  ester,  (2 R ,3 R )-2,3dihydroxybutanedioate (1:2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Vinflunine ditartate is white to off-white powder, very hygroscopic and it is an amorphous substance. It  is  freely  soluble  in  water,  soluble  in  ethanol  and  practically  insoluble  in  dichloromethane.  It  is important to underline that this active substance has a strong buffering power.

The  active substance  has  9  chiral centres and  its  absolute  stereochemical  configuration  was established. In this context, the active substance will be used as single enantiomer (2R, 3S, 4R, 5R, 12R, 19R, 2'S, 4'R, 18'S).

## · Manufacture

Vinflunine  ditartate  is  synthesised  in  nine  reactions  steps.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been adequately  described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified  and  adequate  in-process  controls included. Specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control  of  critical  steps  and  intermediates  has  been  presented.  The  active  substance  is  purified  by filtration and then undergoes lyophilisation allowing the isolation of the dried active substance.

Structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  elemental  analysis,  mass  spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR  spectroscopy, 19 F-NMR  spectroscopy,  ultraviolet  spectroscopy,  infrared absorption spectroscopy and circular dichroïsm.

The molecular weight was determined by elemental analysis which is in agreement with the expected molecular weight. The proposed molecular structure was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction and  the  absolute  stereochemistry  was  confirmed  with  data  from  NMR  spectroscopy  and  circular dichroïsm.

## · Specification

Vinflunine ditartate specifications include tests for appearance (white to off-white powder), solubility, Identification (IR, HPLC, TLC, Identification of tartrates), appearance of solution S (Ph.Eur), pH of solution S (Ph.Eur), absorbance of solution S (Ph.Eur), water content (Ph.Eur), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur), tartaric acid content (Ph.Eur), assay residual solvents (Ph.Eur), impurities (Ph.Eur) and microbiological limit tests (Ph.Eur).

All specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were carried out according to the general methods described in the Ph.Eur.

Impurities were described, classified as process related impurities and possible degradation products, and qualified. Residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance according to the relevant  ICH requirements. Certificates of analyses for the active substances were provided and all batch analysis results of 26 batches comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.

## · Stability

The  stability  results  from  long-term  (-20°C  ±  3°C)  and  accelerated  studies  (5  °C  ±  3°C)  were completed  according  to  ICH  guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  active  substance. During the stability studies the following parameters were controlled: appearance (white to off-white powder),  appearance  of  solution  S  (Ph.Eur),  pH  of  solution  S  (Ph.Eur),  absorbance  of  solution  S (Ph.Eur), water content (Ph.Eur), tartaric acid content (Ph.Eur), impurities, microbial contamination,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

assay and LC assay. It was noticed that the test methods applied are those used for release of the drug substance  with  exception  of  LC  assay.  All  the  validation  parameters  have  been  submitted  for  this analytical  method  (LC  assay).  It  was  confirmed  that  the  active  substance  remained  within  the specifications for up to 48 months after long term storage at -20°C. Moreover, no major unexpected changes were observed in the active substance after storage under accelerated stress studies, which were performed under heat, humidity, light, oxidation conditions and in solutions with different pH. Following the results from stress studies it was concluded that the active substance was sensitive to temperature, humidity and oxidation.

The photosability study that was performed in accordance with the note for guidance on photostability testing  of  new  active  substances  and  medicinal  products  (CPMP/ICH/279/95)  confirmed  that  the active substance is photosensitive.

Based  on  the  stability  results  it  was  concluded  that  the  active  substance  can  be  stored  48  months protected  from  light  in  the  proposed  container  closure  system  at  a  temperature  at  or  below  -15°C before being retested.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The  main  objective  was  to  develop  a  stable,  sterile,  aqueous  solution  of  vinflunine  ditartrate  for intravenous administration. Based on the properties of the active substance an aqueous solution was selected for development.

The concentration, which was used during the clinical trials, was changed to 25mg/ml in order to adapt the formulae to the recommended dose in human and reduce wastage of the medicinal product, which is  not  used.  The  final  formulation  contains  the  active  substance  at  a  concentration  of  25  mg/ml expressed as vinflunine base. The vehicle of this pharmaceutical form is water for injections and an inert gas (nitrogen low oxygen), which is used to protect the oxidation of the active substance. Good stability has been shown in unbuffered aqueous solution. Adjustment of the isotonicity of the finished product is not necessary since the administration is done by infusion after dilution in sodium chloride 0.9 % solution or glucose 5% solution. Taking into account that Javlor is presented in single-use vials, which have been sterilised, no antimicrobial preservatives have been used

Compatibility studies show that the finished product is stable with the proposed rubber stoppers and that there is no container-content incompatibility between the product diluted in sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5% solution at a concentration range between 3 mg/ml and 7 mg/ml and polyvinylchloride bag or polyethylene bag. This is accepted. The container closure system integrity is demonstrated by sampling 50 vials from the media fill test for each presentation vials and the results show negative microbial growth for all samples tested.

## · Manufacture of the Product

This  Manufacturing  process  consists  of  the  following  steps: mixing,  sterilisation, filling  and packaging.  The  vials  are  washed  and  sterilised  by  dry  heat;  stoppers  and  flip-off  seals  are  steam sterilised using a validated cycle. The critical steps of this particular manufacturing process have been identified.

Satisfactory process validation data have been provided for the major steps of the manufacturing process. All process validation batches are of maximum production scale size and all data are within specifications.

The in process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. The batch analysis results show that the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the  agreed  finished  product specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Product Specification

The finished product specifications were established according the ICH guidelines and include the following tests: appearance, particulate contamination (Ph.Eur), identification (LC and UV), extractable volume (Ph.Eur), absorbance value at 420 nm (Ph.Eur), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur), related substances (LC), impurities (LC) and assay (Ph.Eur). It was noted that the impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies

All relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications.

## · Stability of the Product

The  stability  results  from  long-term  (5°C  ±  3°C)  and  accelerated  studies  (25  °C  60%  RH)  were completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of the finished product. All stress studies, which were preformed under stressing conditions (40 °C 75% RH), low temperatures, cold chain failure conditions, artificial lightning (photostability studies in accordance with the note for guidance on photostability testing - CPMP/ICH/279/95), have been performed, which are the extreme dosages. It was noticed that a detail justification for performing bracketing has been provided.

Based on the results of the available stability data it can be concluded that the finished product must be protected from light. However, it was demonstrated that it can be exposed directly to ambient lighting not more than 1 day at room temperature. Javlor can undergo 1 or 2 freeze-thaw cycles from a freezing temperature  between -15°C and -25°C to a thawing between +2°C and + 8°C. It was verified that the authorised cold chain failure is limited to 14 days up to +30°C protected from light. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Javlor diluted at 3 to 7 mg of the active substance per ml of sodium chloride 0.9 % or glucose 5 % solution can be stored: in a polyethylene or polyvinylchloride bag for 1 day at room temperature protected from light, 6 days in the refrigerator (+2°C and + 8°C) protected from light or in a  polyethylene  or  polyvinylchloride  infusion  set  for  1  hour  at  room  temperature  (25°C)  exposed to ambient  lighting.  From  a  microbiological  point  of  view,  the  finished  product  should  be  used immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

Finally it can be concluded that the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on  development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was an unresolved quality issue, which will not have  an  impact  on  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  the  medicinal  product.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the finished product and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 3.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical development programme of vinflunine consisted of pharmacology studies (primary pharmacodynamics, secondary pharmacodynamics, and safety pharmacology), pharmacokinetic studies, toxicology studies (single dose toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and local tolerance studies) and an environmental risk assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

In vitro studies showed that VFL inhibits tubulin polymerisation, induces mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell  death.  These  studies  demonstrated  that  along  with  other  microtubule  inhibitors,  tubulin  was  a common intracellular target. VFL appears to suppress the rate and extent of microtubule growth and also suppresses microtubule treadmilling, but with a weaker potency than the other Vinca alkaloids. Microtubule treadmilling is necessary for normal chromosome progression through mitosis, so these data suggest that VFL might have subtly different effects from the other Vinca alkaloids on certain mitotic events.

Antitumour activity  was  identified  in  three  other  murine  'solid'  tumour  models,  the  orthotopicallyimplanted MB-49 bladder tumour and the MAC15A and MAC29 transplantable colon adenocarcinomas. Definite activity (defined by optimal T/C ranging from &gt;135 to 179%) was reported with VFL against the sc-implanted M109 lung carcinoma using various multidose schedules. Overall antitumour activity with VFL was documented in five of the seven murine 'solid' tumours tested.

| In vitro sensitivity of L1210 murine lymphocytic leukaemia cells to VFL                                                                                                                   | VFL induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of L1210 murine leukaemia cell growth, with a dose- response curve suggestive of a narrow dose-range of cytotoxicity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Modulation by verapamil of the in vitro drug-induced cytotoxicity of VFL on the P388 sensitive murine leukaemia cell line, a doxorubicin resistant subline                                | Using this method, after a 48-hour drug exposure, the IC50 value obtained was 72 nM. Comparable results were obtained to the previous study (L0070-17492)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Differential in vitro cytotoxic effects of the compound F12158 against a panel of solid tumour cell lines quantitated by colourimetic metabolic dye-basedMTT assay                        | VFL resulted in a similar pattern of cytotoxicity, versus the nine tumour cell lines to that of vinblastine and vinorelbine. The response induced by VFL was dose- dependent, showing a plateau-shaped cytotoxic dose effect, observed with other tubulin-interacting agents.                                                                                                                                                           |

| Effects of F 12158 on murine L1210 leukaemia cell division in vitro                                                                                                                       | Exposure to VFL resulted in an accumulation of these cells in mitosis and that the proportion of these mitotic cells within the total population increased with increasing concentrations of VFL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Effects of F 12158 on the interphase microtublar cytoskeletion of a rat aortic smooth muscle cell line, A-10, in vitro : an anti-tubulin immunoflurescence study                          | VFL induced a concentration-dependent reduction of the microtubular network of interphase cells, with complete loss occurring at 1 µM. At higher levels (> 10 µM), VFL caused aggregation of microtubules with the formation of paracrystals.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Effects of F 12158 on the proteolysis of purified tubulin with chymotrypsin or trypsin/ Effects of VFL on the GTPase activity of purified tubulin                                         | VFL induced an increase of proteolysis by chymotrypsin, without the appearance of a new proteolytic band known to form in the presence of bound colchicine and podophyllotoxin. VFL also inhibited proteoloysis by trypsin, an effect noted in the presence of bound Vinca alkaloids. The binding of VFL to tubulin appears to induce structural changes in tubulin consistent with its interaction at or near the Vinca binding domain |
| Characterisation of the effects of F 12158 on the binding of 3H-vinorelbine or 3H- colchicine to tubulin                                                                                  | VFL did not appear to inhibit significantly the binding of either tritiated colchicine or -vinorelbine to unpolymerised tubulin in vitro. When comparing the capacity of unlabeled Vinca alkaloids to VFL to inhibit the binding of 3H-vinorelbine to tubulin, the compounds tested could be classified (in terms of their competitive efficiencies, tubulin-binding affinities) as vincristine> vinblasine> VFL.                       |

The data show that the in vivo activity of VFL against both murine and human tumour experimental models  was  achieved  at  considerably  higher  doses  than  those  of  vinorelbine.  Activity  of  VFL  was achieved in the absence of any significant body weight loss (i.e. ≤ 15%) or early deaths, in tumourbearing animals.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

The affinity of VFL ditartrate for various receptors was assessed in radioligand binding assays. At a concentration  of  1x10 -5 M,  4-O  deacetyl  VFL  did  not  cause  any  significant  inhibition  of  specific radioligand  binding  at  the  receptors  studied,  which  indicates  that  it  is  devoid  of  affinity  for  these receptors at this concentration.  However, the study showed a micromolar affinity of VFL for opiate non selective receptors and µ receptors with a Ki value of 1120 nM. This was nearly 1000-fold higher than that of the reference agonist opioid peptide.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  iv  route  of  administration  was  used  exclusively  for  all  studies  described  (mouse,  rat  ,dog, monkey).  Rats  and  monkeys  were  the  principal  species  selected  for  the  safety  evaluation  of  VFL. Additional pharmacokinetic studies were conducted using 4-O-deacetyl VFL (DVFL) to document the contribution of this active metabolite to the toxicological profile of VFL.

Single dose pharmacokinetic studies with blood and plasma samples, were performed with radiolabelled  VFL  ([3H]-VFL),  while  toxicokinetic  studies  were  performed  after  both  single  or repeated doses with non-radiolabelled drugs.

Overall, (in all species) exposure (AUC) was dose-proportional and was generally linear. In all four species, the pharmacokinetics of VFL in blood was characterised by a decrease in concentration over the first hours post i.v. bolus followed by slower distribution and elimination phases. The elimination half-life of total radioactivity was close to 100 h while T½z of unchanged VFL varied from 4 to 20 hours.  Tissue  distribution  was  large  (volume  of  distribution  between  12  and  36  L/kg).  No  drug accumulation was noticed after repeated administrations over 26 weeks in monkeys whereas a trend to accumulation  was  suggested  in  rats  after  4-week  and  26-week  administration.  A  high  volume  of distribution suggests extensive tissue uptake.

In vitro studies performed with human liver microsomes showed that VFL had neither inducing effects on  CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 activity nor inhibition effects on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (see SPC section 4.5).

In vitro pharmacodynamic studies showed that vinflunine is a Pgp-substrate as the other vinca alkaloids, but with a lower affinity. Therefore, risks of clinically significant interactions should be unlikely.

DVFL was found to be a major metabolite in man. DVFL was observed in blood, urine and faeces from all species. Single doses of DVFL were investigated in rats and monkeys (1 mg/kg in rats and 6 mg/kg  in  monkeys).  Pharmacokinetics  of  DVFL  was  characterised  by  a  slow  distribution  and elimination phase. The terminal elimination half-life was about 34 h and 45 h in rats and monkeys, respectively.

## · Repeat dose toxicity

Repeated-dose i.v.  toxicity  studies  completed  with  VFL  included  a  5-day  study  in  mice,  pivotal  1month studies in rats and monkeys, a 3-month study in rats and 6-month studies in rats and monkeys. Dosing in the rat and monkey studies was intermittent and occurred twice weekly. The main signs of toxicity in the subchronic and chronic toxicology studies of VFL are weight loss, haematological and clinical chemistry  changes,  mainly  neutropaenia.  These  toxicities are expected  based  on  the pharmacological  effects  of  VFL  and  have  been  demonstrated  to  be  either  partially  or  completely reversible. The bone-marrow and liver were also target organs.

## · Genotoxicity

The genotoxic potential  of  VFL  was  evaluated  in  a  battery  of in  vitro and in  vivo studies.  VFL  is positive  in  mutagenicity  and  genotoxicity  assays.  The  table  below  summarizes  the  results  of  these studies.

## · Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies were submitted. The carcinogenic potential of VFL has not been studied according to ICH S1A and CPMP/SWP/99796.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  VFL  (IV)  include  assessment  of potential effects on fertility and reproductive function in male and female rats, evaluations of embryofetal  development  in  rats  and  rabbits  and  effects  on  pre-  and  post-natal  development  in  rats. Preliminary, dose range-finding studies in rats and rabbits were conducted to assist in dose selection for  the  pivotal  reproductive  toxicity  studies.  Exposure  assessments  were  conducted  in  the  rabbit embryo-fetal development study.

In the rat embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity were noted, characterized by increased number of dams with no  viable  fetuses,  increased  early  resorptions,  postimplantation  loss  and  reduced  fetal  weights  at higher doses. In the rabbit,  higher  doses  of  VFL  were  embryotoxic  and  teratogenic  (malformations included  cleft  palates,  exophthalmia,  microtia,  anotia,  dome-shaped  head,  cranioschisis,  misshapen head  or  vertebral  bones,  hemivertebrae,  fused  or  divided  ribs,  and  reduced  ossification  of  head, vertebrae  or  talus).  In  the  rat  ppn  study,  maternal  toxicity  was  evident  in  F0  generation  dams.  In addition, decrease in body weight gain and decreases in food consumption were seen in the undosed F1 adult females. At higher doses, malformations of the uterus and vagina and a reduced number of conceptuses were observed in F1 generation females.

A number of  malformations  were  noted  in  the  rat  embryo  toxicity  study.  These  findings  might  be considered  to  indicative  of  teratogenicity.  Therefore,  both  male  and  female  patients  should  take adequate contraceptive measures up to three months after the discontinuation of the therapy. Advice on conservation of sperm should be sought prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with vinflunine. (see section 4.6 of the SPC).

Due  to  the  possible  very  harmful  effects  on  the  infants,  breast-feeding  during  the  treatment  with vinflunine is contraindicated (see section 4.3 of the SPC).

## · Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic  evaluations  were  conducted  in  rats  and  monkeys  as  part  of  the  repeat  dose i.v. toxicology studies with VFL. There were not gender differences neither drug accumulation based on AUC observed in the different studies (Tables 8 and 9).

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant submitted  an  ERA. The  Log  Kow  for  vinflunine  was  below  4.5.    The  calculation  of PECsw using this Fpen and a maximum daily dose of 320 mg/m2 would be equal to 0.000726 µg/L, i.e. a value far below the threshold of concern for environment, that is 0.01 µg/L .

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The CHMP considered that the applicant had conducted an extensive programme of pharmacology studies,  indicating  that  VFL  has  a  relevant  pharmacodynamic  effect.  The  applicant  also  conducted adequate  safety  pharmacology  and  pharmacokinetics  programmes.  Rats  and  monkeys  were  the principal  species  selected  for  the  safety  evaluation  of  VFL.  A  small  number  of  pharmacokinetic studies were conducted using 4-O-deacetyl VFL (DVFL) to document the contribution of this active metabolite to the toxicological profile of VFL.  The single-dose studies were adequate and no further studies were required. The intravenous infusion studies provided sufficient information on toxicity at higher doses. The duration of repeat-dose studies was also considered adequate and the absence of carcinogenicity  studies  was  adequately  justified.  An  acceptable  programme  of  genotoxicity  studies was conducted.  VFL is positive in mutagenicity and genotoxicity assays. Given the pharmacology of the compound and the proposed indication, this was considered acceptable. The carcinogenic potential of  VFL was not studied, according to ICH S1A or CPMP/SWP/99796. In the reproductive toxicity studies performed, embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity were noted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the evaluation of the non-clinical data submitted as part of this dossier, the following concerns were identified.

1. The applicant was requested to modify the wording of section 4.4 and 5.3 of the SPC regarding the cardiac  safety  of  vinflunine.  The  safety  margins  provided  from  the  Purkinje  assay  along  with  no adverse  cardiac  events  in  the  monkey  up  to  16  mg/kg,  provided  some  reassurance  regarding vinflunine's  potential  to  alter  ventricular  repolarization,  however  given  that  there  were  other  test article-related  cardiovascular  findings  in  some  other  non-clinical  studies  and    agents  that  disrupt normal microtubules function have shown to affect essential cardiac activities, the statement in section 5.3 of the SPC (''Vinflunine did not induce peripheral neuropathy nor cardiotoxicity in animals'') was modified to delete the reference to cardiotoxicity. Section 4.4 of the SPC was also amended to include a  statement  for  the  management  of  patients  with  prior  history  of  myocardial  infarction/ischemia  or angina pectoris.

2.  A  number  of  malformations  that  may  be  considered  indicative  of  developmental  toxicity (teratogenicity) were noted in the pregnant rat. In addition, malformed fetuses from 2 litters containing 1 or 2 viable fetuses were noted. The resorption rate in these litters was high, possibly suggesting that this finding might have been due to possible malformations in the resorbed fetuses. Malformations of the uterus and vagina (2 females has closed vaginas) were noted in the rabbit; these were not reported in the rat. The applicant was therefore asked to discuss further information on the precise nature of the skeletal observations noted, whether the malformations are considered species specific, and to address their clinical relevance. In response to this concern, Section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC were amended as follows.

## SPC Section 4.6 Pregnancy:

There is no data available about the use of vinflunine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown embryotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 5.3). On the basis of the results of animal studies and  the  pharmacological  action  of  the  product,  there  is  a  potential  risk  of  embryonic  and  foetal abnormalities.

Vinflunine should therefore not be used during pregnancy, unless it is strictly necessary. If pregnancy occurs  during  treatment,  the  patient  should  be  informed  about  the  risk  for  the  unborn  child  and  be monitored carefully. The possibility of genetic counselling should be considered. Genetic counselling is also recommended for patients wishing to have children after therapy.

## SPC Section 5.3 Preclinical safety data:

In  the  reproduction  studies,  vinflunine  appeared  to  be  embryolethal  and  teratogenic  in  rabbits  and teratogenic  in  rats.  During  the  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  in  rat,  vinflunine  induced malformations  of  the  uterus  and  vagina  in  2  females,  and  adversely  affected  mating  and/or  ovule implantation and markedly lowered the number of concepti.

## Section 4.3 of the SPC reflects the following:

Hypersensitivity to the active substance, other vinca alkaloids. Recent (within 2 weeks) or current severe infection. Baseline ANC &lt; 1,500/mm 3 or platelets &lt; 100,000/mm 3 Lactation (see section 4.6)

## 3.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical development programme of vinflunine consisted of pharmacokinetic studies (distribution, excretion, metabolism, dose proportionality, special populations, drug-drug interactions and safety/interaction studies), pharmacodynamic studies, and main clinical studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical development program for solid malignancies included the following studies as a single agent:

- -5 completed Phase I studies
- -4 ongoing Phase I studies
- -10 completed Phase II studies (variety of tumour types including melanoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, advanced ovarian cancer)
- -1 completed Phase III study (NSCLC)
- -1 ongoing Phase II study (metastatic breast)
- -1 Phase II study in gastric cancer (premature termination)

Studies in combination therapy were:

- 4 completed Phase I/II studies
- 4 ongoing Phase I/II studies
- 1 Phase I/II (early termination)
- 1 ongoing Phase III study, in HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer
- 1 Phase III study in first line treatment of TCCU

For the proposed indication, the clinical program for vinflunine in second-line treatment in patients with TCCU after platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens includes:

- 3 phase I trials (VFL 981, VFL 991, VFL 992)
- 2 phase II studies (VFL202, CA 001)
- 1 randomised Phase III study (VFL 302)

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  clinical  pharmacokinetics  were  evaluated  in  cancer  patients.  The  tumours  of  the  patients  who participated in the phase I/II clinical trials included all types of solid cancer, such as bladder cancer (Urothelial Transitional Cell Carcinoma of Urothelium, TCCU), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer.

Vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  is  linear  in  the  range  of  administered  doses  (from  30 mg/m²  to 400 mg/m2) in cancer patients.

Blood exposure to vinflunine (AUC), significantly correlated with severity of leucopenia, neutropenia and fatigue.

## · Methods

Two  types  of  bioanalytical  methods  were  used  to  quantify  VFL  and  its  metabolites  in  human biological samples:

- -Methods  dealing  with  radiolabelled  detection  and  measurement, used  to  explore  the in  vitro plasma proteins and blood cells binding and the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of VFL (Study L0070 99  IN103  Q0).  These  methods  consisted  of  liquid  scintillation  counting  of β particles  emitted  by tritium from 3 H-VFL and 3 H-metabolites. HPLC methods were generally used for controls.
- -Methods for non-radiolabelled detection, used to quantize of unchanged VFL and its metabolites in biological fluids.

HPLC/UV: The HPLC/UV technique was the method employed in most of the clinical studies, in order to measure VFL and 4-O-deacetylvinflunine (DVFL) in blood and VFL in urine. In blood, the method is linear from 2-200 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 2 ng/mL (coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  &lt;  7%)  and  in  urine,  from  20  and  2000  ng/mL  with  LLOQ  at  20 ng/mL (CV &lt; (3%). The intraday and interday precision and accuracy values were evaluated on 6 replicates  of  quality  control  (QC)  samples  processed  over  3  days  and  they  were  within  usual acceptance limits of QC samples for daily run (15% at each concentration level: low, middle, and high).

Most of the bioanalyses were performed in a single laboratory however a few ones (studies L00070 IN108 J1, L00070 IN110 B0, L00070 IN111 B0, L00070 IN208 E2 and L00070 IN210 J3) were completed in another facilityA cross-validation of the HPLC method was performed comparing the results from the two laboratories and before analysis of the biological samples obtained from the concerned studies. The mean bias between the two laboratories was 6.3% for VFL and 13.7% for DVFL. The individual deviations of 8 out of 10 samples were within the acceptability limits ( i.e. ≤ ± 15%). VFL and DVFL chemical stability in stored samples from clinical trials was demonstrated to be sufficient for easy routine use of the bioanalytical methods.

LC/MS-MS: A HPLC method followed by tandem mass spectrometry detection. This method was used for metabolites identification from human biological samples (blood, urine and faeces) by ATC laboratories (Study M821 and Study 20968) and for assessing the mass-balance distribution of VFL and its metabolites after 3 H-VFL administration (Study 9 L0070 99 IN 103 Q0). In addition, it was used for evaluating in vivo the potential PK drug-drug interaction (DDI) with ketoconazole (Study CA183009).

The method was linear over the range: 0.25-1.000 ng/mL for VFL en blood, 0.25-200 ng/mL for DVFL in blood, 205000  ng/mL  in  urine  and  2-1000  µg/g  in  faeces  for  both  compounds.  The intraday and interday precision (CV %) calculated on QC samples were less than 6.9% and 15.9% for VFL and 7.1% and 5.2% for DVFL in blood while the accuracy (mean bias, %) was lower than 9.1% and 7.1% for VFL and DVFL, respectively.  In  urine  and  faeces,  the  precision  (CV  %)  was lower than 5.6% in urine and 8.2% in faeces. The accuracy (mean bias, %) was lower than 7% in both media for both compounds.

Both HPLC/UV and LC/MS-MS methods were developed and validated according to GLP.

- Absorption

No absorption studies were submitted.

- Distribution

Vinflunine is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (67.2 ± 1.1%) with a  ratio between plasma and  whole  blood  concentrations  of  0.80 ± 0.12. Protein binding mainly  involves  high density lipoproteins  and  serum  albumin  and  is  non-saturable  on  the  range  of  vinflunine  concentrations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed in patients. Binding to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and to platelets is negligible ( &lt; 5%). The terminal volume  of distribution is large,  2422 ± 676 litres (about 35 l/kg) suggesting extensive distribution  into tissues.

## · Elimination

The PK of vinflunine and its metabolites were studied after a 15-min infusion of 3H-VFL at a single dose of 250 mg/m². Blood samples were collected over 7 days, while urine and faeces were collected over  14  days.  Total  radioactivity  in  blood,  urine  and  faeces  was  measured  by  liquid  scintillation counting (LSC) and vinflunine and metabolites were quantified according to LC/MS-MS method.

The table below summarizes the population PK parameters obtained.

The metabolism of vinflunine was examined in both in vitro and in vivo studies. From in vitro studies (hepatic  microsomes,  hepatocytes  cultures,  insect  transfected  cells).  A  total  of  11  metabolites  are detected in blood, urine and faeces.

7 metabolites were directly formed from vinflunine in one step reaction:

- DVFL (M1 - the only active metabolite); VFL 3,6 ether (M2); desmethyl-VFL (M4); VFL 6'oxide  (M9);  2  isomers  of  hydroxy-VFL  (M3,  M6/7)  and  one  unidentified  structure  named 815d (M13)

Sequential metabolism is presumed for 4 other structures:

- Di-hydroxy-VFL  (M10),  desmethyl-VFL  3,6  ether  (M15),  desmethyl-815d  (M16)  and hydroxy VFL 3,6 ether (M18)

Major metabolites were:

- DVFL (M1), VFL 3,6 ether (M2), desmethyl VFL (M4) and VFL 6'-oxide (M9). All other metabolites were either minor or detected at trace levels

Vinflunine is eliminated following a multi-exponential concentration decay, with a terminal half-life (t ½)    close  to  40 h.  DVFL  is  slowly  formed  and  more  slowly  eliminated  than  vinflunine  (t  ½of approximately 120 h).The excretion of vinflunine and its metabolites occurs through faeces (2/3) and urine (1/3). In a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 372 patients (656 pharmacokinetic profiles),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  total  blood  clearance  was  40 l/h  with  low  inter  and  intra-individual  variability  (25%  and  8%, respectively, expressed as coefficient of variation).

All metabolites identified are formed by the cytochrome CYP3A4  isoenzyme,  except  for 4Odeacetylvinflunine  (DVFL),  the  only  active  metabolite  and  main  metabolite  in  blood  which  is formed by multiple esterases.  The characterisation of human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in  vinflunine  metabolism  shows  that  other  isoenzymes  studied  were  either  not  or  weakly  involved (CYP1A2,  CYP2D6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6  and  CYP2E1  were  not involved).  DVFL was not generated by CYP but formed through multiple esterases. The metabolic pathway of vinflunine involves both the nor 7' velbanamine and vindoline parts of the molecule. All structures went through phase I reactions. Phase II enzymes are not involved in vinflunine metabolism. No conjugated metabolite was observed.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

A phase I and PK study of vinflunine given as a 10-minute infusion every 3 weeks was carried out to explore the PK profile of vinflunine. Ten dose levels of vinflunine from 30 mg/m² up to 400 mg/m² were administered and PK assessment was performed in 30 patients.

Vinflunine blood concentrations vs. time profiles were characterized by a sharp concentration decrease over the first 30 minutes following the end of infusion and then demonstrated a slower distribution /elimination phase (data not shown).

The mean VFL total clearance was high (Cltot = 41.4 ± 12.9 L/h or 0.63 ± 0.23 L/h/kg) and its interindividual  variability  (calculated  by  coefficient  of  variation  from  the  30  patients)  was  31%.. Vinflunine terminal volume of distribution was large (Vdz = 1517 ± 503 L or 22.8 ± 8.3 L/kg) and terminal  half-life  (calculated  over  a  96-hour  period)  was  25.5 ± 3.9  h.  The  table  below  shows  that vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  is  linear  in  the  range  of  administered  doses  (from  30 mg/m²  to 400 mg/m2) in cancer patients.

## · Special populations

## Impaired renal function

A pharmacokinetic phase I study in patients with renal impairment is ongoing. An interim analysis on 13 patients with moderate impairment (40 ml/min ≤ CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min) and on 9 patients with severe impairment (20 ml/min ≤ CrCl &lt; 40 ml/min) indicated a decreased elimination of both vinflunine and DVFL when CrCl is decreased. This is further confirmed by the population pharmacokinetic analysis (56  patients  with  CrCl  between  20 ml/min  and  60 ml/min),  showing  that  vinflunine  clearance  is influenced  by  the  creatinine  clearance  value  (Cockcroft  and  Gault  formula).  Dose  adjustments  are recommended in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment(see section 4.2 of the SPC).

Two doses are proposed in the SPC: Moderate renal impairment 280 mg/m² (a 12.5% dose decrease), Severe renal impairment 250 mg/m² (a 22% dose decrease)

## Impaired hepatic function

A  phase  I  PK  dose  adjusted  study  of  IV  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  with  liver  dysfunction  was carried out to determine the recommended dose of vinflunine and to investigate the PK and tolerability of  IV  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  with  chronic  liver  dysfunction.  Three  groups  were  scheduled according to the liver dysfunction and the patients received 320 mg/m² (groups 1 and 2), 250 mg/m² (groups 2 and 3) or 200 mg/m² (group 3) on day 1 every 3 weeks depending on tolerance.

No modification of vinflunine and DVFL pharmacokinetics was observed in 25 patients presenting varying  degrees  of  hepatic  impairment,  compared  to  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function.  This  is further  confirmed  by  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (absence  of  relationship  between vinflunine  clearance  and  biology  markers  of  hepatic  impairment).  However,  dose  adjustments  are recommended in patients with level 2 or 3 liver impairment (see section 4.2 of the SPC).

According  to  pharmacokinetic  analysis  and  safety  data  the  recommended  doses  in  this  specific population are as follows:

- In  patients  with  mild  liver  dysfunction  the  recommended  dose  of  vinflunine  is  320  mg/m² given on day 1 every 3 weeks.
- For patients with moderate chronic liver dysfunction the recommended dose of vinflunine is 250 mg/m² once every 3 weeks
- In patients with severe chronic liver dysfunction the recommended dose of VFL is 200 mg/m² once every 3 weeks.

## Gender, race, weight, elderly, children

No  specific  studies  were  submitted  with  regards  to  gender,  race  or  weight.  No  specific  studies  in children were submitted either. According to the population pharmacokinetic analysis, neither gender nor  Performance  Status  (ECOG  score)  had  an  impact  on  vinflunine  clearance  which  is  directly proportional to body surface area.A study in elderly patients is ongoing.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## In vitro

Studies  using  human  biomaterials  (microsomes,  hepatocytes)  or  human  biological  samples  (e.g.: blood,  plasma,  urine  and  faeces)  were  performed  to  determine  the  binding  characteristics  of vinflunine,  its  metabolism  and  potential  in  vitro  drug-drug  interaction.  CYP  3A4  is  the  major cytochrome enzyme involved in vinflunine metabolism and therefore strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 are likely to affect the metabolism of vinflunine. An in vitro drug-drug interaction (DDI) study was carried out with selected drugs.

A pharmacokinetic interaction between vinflunine and pegylated/liposomal doxorubicin was observed, resulting in a 15% to 30% apparent increase in vinflunine exposure and a 2 to 3-fold apparent decrease of doxorubicin AUC, whereas doxorubicinol metabolite concentrations were not affected. According

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to an in vitro study, such changes could be related to an adsorption of vinflunine on the liposomes and a modified blood distribution of both compounds. Therefore, caution should be excercised when this type of combination is used.

Twenty-five drugs were screened to assess the risk of DDI on vinflunine metabolism (Anastrozole, Cyclophosphamide, Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, Epirubicin, Imatinib, Gefitinib, Paclitaxel, Aminoglutethimide,  Fluconazole,  Fluoxetine,  Itraconazole,  Morphine,  Norfluoxetine,  Omeprazole, Ondansetron,  Acenocoumarol,  Ketoconazole,  Methadone,  Metoclopramide,  Midazolam,  Nifedipine, Phenprocoumon,  Ritonavir,  Testosterone).  The  risk  of  drug-drug  interaction  was  evaluated  on Weaver's algorithm. The results showed that: Ketoconazole, Itraconazole and Ritonavir may inhibit vinflunine metabolism, DDI may be suspected for paclitaxel and docetaxel, and DDI was unlikely for the other 20 drugs.

Thus, A possible interaction with paclitaxel and docetaxel (CYP3 substrates) has been suggested from an in vitro study (slight inhibition of vinflunine metabolism). No specific clinical studies of vinflunine in combination with these compounds have been carried out yet.

## In vivo

A  phase  I  study  evaluating  the  effect  of  ketoconazole  treatment  (a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor)  on vinflunine  pharmacokinetics  indicated  that  co-administration  of  ketoconazole  (400 mg  orally  once daily  for  8  days)  resulted  in  a  30%  and  50%  increase  of  blood  exposures  to  vinflunine  and  its metabolite 4Odeacetyl-vinflunine (DVFL), respectively.

Therefore  the  concomitant  use  of  vinflunine  and  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (such  as  ritonavir, ketoconazole,  itraconazole  and  grapefruit  juice)  or  inducers  (such  as  rifampicine  and Hypericum perforatum (St  John's wort)) should be avoided since they may increase or decrease vinflunine and DVFL concentrations (see section 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC). Based on these data and safety results, the recommended  dose  of  vinflunine  is  defined  as  160  mg/m²  when  co-administered  with  400  mg  of ketoconazole.

Risk  of  DDI  was  assessed  in  vinflunine  combined  chemotherapy  with  cisplatin  (CDDP),  with carboplatin  (CBDCA),  with  liposomal  doxorubicin,  with  doxorubicin,  with  capecitabine,  and  with gemcitabine. The last 3 studies are still ongoing while the first 3 are completed. A pharmacokinetic interaction between vinflunine and pegylated/liposomal doxorubicin was observed, resulting in a 15% to 30% apparent increase in vinflunine exposure and a 2 to 3-fold apparent decrease of doxorubicin AUC, whereas doxorubicinol metabolite concentrations were not affected. According to an in  vitro study, such changes could be related to an adsorption of vinflunine on the liposomes and a modified blood  distribution  of  both  compounds.  Therefore,  caution  should  be  excercised  when  this  type  of combination is used..

Overall, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in patients when vinflunine was combined with either cisplatin, carboplatin, capecitabine, doxorubicin or gemcitabine.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Primary pharmacology

Three phase I trials were conducted (VFL 981, VFL 991 and VFL 992) with the main objective of determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Dose (RD). MTD and the RD were determined for each schedule of vinflunine administration: once every 3 weeks (on day1), weekly administration (on day 1), and twice every 3 weeks (on days 1 and 8).

## VFL 981

This was a phase I study, assessing the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine given as a 10 minute infusion once every 3 weeks. The study was a dose escalating phase I multi-centre (3 centres in France), open label, non-randomised trial. The study was carried out between 1st December 1998 and 23rd March 2000.  The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  MTD  of  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  (several tumour types). Secondary objectives were to determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of vinflunine, their duration and reversibility, to determine the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine, to search for relationships between the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine and clinical toxicities and to assess antitumour  activity  in  patients  with  measurable  and  or  evaluable  disease.  Vinflunine  was  given intravenously as a 10  minute infusion at a fixed dose and repeated every 21 days according to the observed toxicities.

31  patients  were  evaluable.  The  MTD  of  vinflunine  administered  in  a  10  minute  infusion  every  3 weeks is 400 mg/m². The RD for further trials is 350 mg/m² every 3 weeks. This dose was evaluated in 6 patients for a total of 11 cycles, having an acceptable safety profile. Three responses were seen: 2 at 400 mg/m² and 1 at 350 mg/m². The pharmacokinetics of vinflunine was shown to be linear with the administered  doses.  Inter-individual  variability  was  moderate.  Leucopenia  and  neutropenia  were correlated to vinflunine exposure.

## VFL 991

This was a phase I study, assessing the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine given as a 10-minute infusion on  a  weekly  schedule.  The  study  was  a  dose  escalating  phase  I  multi-centre  (3  centres  -  France, Switzerland, Belgium), open label, non-randomised trial. The study was carried out between the 4th October 1999 and the 18th June 2003. The primary objective was to determine the MTD of vinflunine in cancer patients (several tumour types). Following amendment 3 (April 12th, 2000) it was decided to determine  separately  MTD  of  weekly  vinflunine  when  administered  to  either  pre-treated  patients (Group  A)  or  previously  untreated  patients  (chemonaive  patients,  Group  B).  Secondary  objectives included  determination  of  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  toxicities  of  vinflunine,  to  define  their duration and reversibility, to determine the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine, to explore the reproducibility  over  administrations  after  repeated  administration,  to  document  intra  and  inter-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

individual  variability  and  to  search  for  relationship  between  the  pharmacokinetics  of  vinflunine  to clinical toxicities observed and to assess anti-tumour activity.

In Group A, 14 patients were evaluated in 3 dose levels of weekly vinflunine. The MTD was reached at 190 mg/m²/week and the RD established at 120 mg/m²/week. In Group B, 26 chemonaive patients, the  MTD  was  not  determined  even  if  high  doses  (250  mg/m²)  were  investigated;  the  RD  was established at 150 mg/m²/weekly. In both groups, dose limiting toxicities consisted of haematological related toxicities,  infection,  severe  neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. A single patient in group A presented  with  a  transient  increase  in  liver  enzymes  (declared  as  a  DLT).  No  other  significant modification  in  liver  enzymes  was  seen.  The  recommended  doses  were  associated  with  a  good tolerance  profile,  mainly  consisting  of  mild  nausea  and  vomiting,  no  severe  neutropenia,  no thrombocytopenia or anaemia. Leucopenia and neutropenia were correlated to vinflunine exposure.

## VFL 992

This was a phase I study, assessing the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine given as a 10-minute infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks a weekly schedule. The study was a dose escalating phase I multicentre  (France,  UK),  open  label,  non-randomised  trial.  The  study  was  carried  out  between  21st October 1999 and 1st September 2000. The primary objective was to determine the MTD of vinflunine in cancer patients (several tumour types). Secondary objectives included determining the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of vinflunine given, to define their duration and reversibility, to explore the pharmacokinetics reproducibility over cycles of vinflunine after repeated administrations, to document intra  and  inter-individual  variability  at  different  dose  levels,  to  search  for  relationship  between  the pharmacokinetics of vinflunine and the observed clinical toxicities and to assess anti-tumour activity.

The MTD of vinflunine administered in a 10-minute infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks is 190 mg/m². RD for further trials is  170  mg/m².  This  dose  was  evaluated  in  6  patients  for  a  total  of  10 cycles  with  an  acceptable  safety  profile.  Leucopenia  and  neutropenia  were  correlated  to  vinflunine blood exposure.

## Secondary pharmacology

No data was submitted concerning genetic determinants of drug response.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology aspects

The  CHMP considered that  the  pharmacokinetic  data  submitted  was  satisfactory  and  the  main  PK characteristics had been adequately determined. The analytical methods were fully validated and were considered satisfactory. Satisfactory studies were performed to assess the distribution of vinflunine in the  blood,  its  binding  properties  to  blood  components/plasma  proteins  and  elimination.  Metabolic pathways were appropriately identified, and the drug interactions studies were considered adequate.

No healthy subject pharmacodynamic study reports were submitted. The pharmacodynamic properties of  vinflunine  were  studied  in  cancer  patient  populations.  The  approach  to  determine  the  optimally tolerated  dose  of  vinflunine  was  satisfactory  and  allowed  for  the  exploration  of  several  different posologies in numerous patients. Based on the analysis of the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity from the 3 dose schedules evaluated at Phase I, vinflunine treatment once every 3 weeks was considered optimal. The recommended dose was established at 350 mg/m² every 3 weeks. This dose was carried forward for further phase II evaluation.

## Posology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  recommended  posology  is  320 mg/m²  vinflunine  as  a  20minute  intravenous  infusion  every  3 weeks.

In  case  of    WHO/ECOG  Performance  Status  (PS)  of  1  or    of  0  and  prior  pelvic  irradiation,  the treatment should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m². In the absence of any  haematological toxicity during  the  first  cycle  causing  treatment  delay  or  dose  reduction,  the  dose  will  be  increased  to 320 mg/m² every 3 weeks for the subsequent cycles.

In patient with ANC &lt; 1,000/mm 3 or platelets &lt; 100,000/mm 3 at the day of administration, the treatment should be delayed until recovery (ANC ≥ 1,000/mm 3 and platelets ≥ 100,000/mm 3 ). If recovery has not occurred within 2 weeks, the treatment will be definitively discontinued.

In case of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500/mm 3 ) for more than 7 days or febrile neutropenia, dose adjustment is recommended (see table above).

The  day  of  infusion,  in  case  of  Grade ≥ 2  organ  toxicity,  the  treatment  should  be  delayed  until recovery to Grades 0, 1 or  initial baseline status.

## Special populations

## Hepatic impairment

Vinflunine pharmacokinetics is not modified in patients with three levels of impaired liver function (see  table  below  and  section  5.2),  however  based  on  hepatic  biologic  parameter  modifications following vinflunine administration (gamma glutamyl transferases (GGT), transaminases, bilirubin), the dose recommendations are as follows:

Table 2: Dose adjustments due to hepatic impairment

NV: Normal Value

ULN: Upper Limit of Normal

Vinflunine  was  evaluated  neither  in  patients  with  Child-Pugh  grade  C,  nor  in  patients  with prothrombin time&lt;50%NV or with bilirubin &gt;5xULN or with transaminases &gt;6xULN or with Gamma Glutamyl Transferases (GGT)&gt;15xULN.

## Renal impairment

In the clinical studies, patients with CrCl (creatinine clearance) &gt; 60 ml/min were included and treated at the recommended dose.

In patients with moderate renal impairment (40 ml/min ≤ CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min), the recommended dose is 280 mg/m² given once every 3 weeks.

In  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (20 ml/min ≤ CrCl &lt; 40 ml/min)  the  recommended  dose  is 250 mg/m² every 3 weeks. (see section 5.2).

## Elderly ( &gt; 65 years)

In  the  clinical  studies,  103  patients ≥ 75  years  old  and  374  patients ≥ 65  and &lt; 75  years  old  were treated at the recommended dose of vinflunine. No significant differences in safety were observed in these two age groups. No specific dose recommendation is necessary in the elderly.

## Paediatric use

Use in children - there is no relevant indication for use of Javlor in children

## Method of administration

Javlor must be diluted prior to administration. Javlor is for single use only.

For instructions on dilution before administration, see section 6.6 of the SPC

Javlor MUST ONLY be administered intravenously. Intrathecal administration of Javlor may be fatal. Javlor  must  be  administered  by  a  20minute  intravenous  infusion  and  NOT  be  given  by  rapid intravenous bolus.

Either peripheral lines or a central catheter can be used for vinflunine administration. When infused through a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce venous irritation (see section 4.4). In case of small or sclerosed veins, lymphoedema, recent venipuncture at the same vein, the use of a central catheter may be preferred. To avoid extravasations it is important to be sure that the needle is correctly introduced before starting the infusion.

In order to flush the vein, administration of Javlor concentrate for solution for infusion should always be followed by at least an equal volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion or of glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for infusion.

For detailed instructions on administration, see section 6.6 of the SPC.

## Recommended comedication

In  order  to  prevent  constipation,  laxatives  and  dietary  measures  including  oral  hydration  are recommended from day 1 to day 5 or 7 after each vinflunine administration (see section 4.4 of the SPC).

In  addition,  the  following  concerns  were  identified  with  regards  to  the  clinical  pharmacology  data submitted as part of this dossier.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1.  The  CHMP  requested  that  inter-individual  differences  in  the  activity  and  expression  of  the metabolising  enzymes  should  be discussed (CYP3A4 polymorphism). Given that all metabolites  of VFL  formed  through  CYP3A4  are  inactive,  any  modification  of  CYP3A4  activity  from  a  genetic mutation would impact VFL by either decreasing efficacy (lower VFL blood exposure) or increasing toxicity (higher VFL blood exposure). According to the reflection paper (CHMP/EMEA/1285717/2006),  the  most  important  polymorphic  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  are CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. This is in accordance with the figure provided by the applicant which shows that the estimated known-genetic fraction to CYP3A4 variability in vivo is lower than the  other  polymorphic  CYPs.  No  specific  in  vivo  study  was  carried  out  to  investigate  the  genetic polymorphism  impact  of  CYP3A4  on  the  PK  of  VFL,  however,  no  putative  relationships  between CYP3A4 polymorphism and the PK of vinca alkaloids is reported in the literature, suggesting that none of the known allelic variants of CYP3A4 accounted for variability in CYP3A4 activity.

2. The CHMP requested that the role of biliary excretion be further discussed. The results from the PK and safety study in patients with mild to severe liver dysfunction supported the Applicant's position that  a  decrease  in  biliary  excretion  should  have  relatively  little  impact  on  VFL  and  DVFL  PK  (the active moieties).

3. The applicant was requested to commit to providing the results of the ongoing drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies, as follow-up measures. Further discussion on the implications of the suspected DDI for paclitaxel  and  docetaxel  were  also  requested  by  the  CHMP,  including  additional  wording  to  the product literature. According to Weaver's algorithm and the FDA Guidance, the potential DDI risk when  combined  with  VFL  was  likely  for  ketoconazole,  itraconazole  and  Ritonavir,  which  may significantly inhibit VFL metabolism in the clinical setting. An in vitro study also suggested a possible DDI for paclitaxel and docetaxel. Therefore, although vinflunine is not intended for combination with either docetaxel or paclitaxel, the applicant amended section 4.5 of the SPC  with additional wording: ' A possible interaction with paclitaxel and docetaxel (CYP3 substrates) has been suggested from an in vitro study (slight inhibition of vinflunine metabolism). No specific clinical studies of vinflunine in combination with these compounds have been carried out yet'.

4. The applicant was requested to provide further information on the linearity of VFL pharmacokinetics (Study L0070 98 IN 101 Q0) over range of VFL dose from 30 mg/m2 up to 400 mg/m2, by for example providing a table and its graphic representation of AUClast versus Cmax for different doses and adjusted to the dose 320 mg/m2. From the applicant's responses, the PK linearity of VFL was investigated through different approaches and PK parameters calculations. Dose-adjusted PK parameters were consistent across strata of doses and they are supported by  graphical displays. Furthermore, the analyses based on the empirical Bayes confirmed the results of the first evaluation of pooled data from early phase I studies and based on non-compartmental AUC calculations. The SPC was amended accordingly.

5. The applicant was requested to provide updated results for both studies L00070 IN 113 (patients with renal impairment) and L00070 IN 114 (elderly patients) as follow-up measures.

6. The applicant was asked to comment on any plan for a paediatric development. The CHMP agreed that TCCU is predominantly present in adults, in fact, the incidence of bladder cancer increases with age; and that carcinoma of the bladder is extremely rare in children so that it was included in the list of class  condition  waivers  for  paediatric  requirements  by  the  PDCO.  However,  bladder  cancer  in adolescents  may  develop  as  a  consequence  of  alkylating-agent  chemotherapy  given  for  other childhood tumours or leukaemia. In its responses, the applicant will request a waiver to the EMEA for the  TCCU  indication,  which  will  be  evaluated  by  the  Paediatric  Committee.  However,  the  CHMP considered  that  the  potential  off-label  use  in  children  still  justified  a  paediatric  development  for relevant conditions, where there is a paediatric need. As a result of this discussion, the lack of data in children and adolescent was reflected in section 4.2 of SPC as follow:  'Use in children - there is no relevant indication for use of Javlor in children'.

7.  The  applicant  was  requested  to  submit  the  final  results  of  study  BMS  CA183009  (effect  of ketoconazole on the VFL PK). The CHMP considered that the final results were in accordance with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  preliminary  results  of  the  interim  analysis  performed  on  10  patients.  Though  no  precise  dose adjustments are propose in the SPC, adequate warnings were included to discourage the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in section 4.5 of SPC.

8. VFL is apparently a P-glycoprotein substrate as it displays the classic MDR profile. Therefore the CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  discuss  the  risk  for  clinically  significant  interactions  with  Pglycoprotein  inhibitors/inducers,  and  to  address  whether  information  on  P-glycoprotein  should  be added to section 4.5 of the SPC.

The Applicant provided preclinical data to suggest that vinflunine, as with other vinca alkaloids, is a Pgp  substrate.  VFL  has  lower  affinity  than  either  Vincristine  or  Vinorelbine  and  inter-patient variability  between  an  oral  preparation  and  IV  formulation  was  minimal,  suggesting  that  clinically significant interactions are unlikely. However, no specific PK study on vinflunine and P-glycoprotein (Pgp)  were  conducted  to  rule  out  a  clinically  meaningful  interaction.  To  reflect  this  unlikely interaction, the following statement was included in section 4.5 of the SPC.

'In vitro studies showed that vinflunine is a Pgp substrate as the other vinca alkaloids, but with a lower affinity. Therefore, risks of clinically significant interactions should be unlikely.'

9.    In  section  4.2  it  has  been  clarified  that  there  is  no  data  in  Child  Pugh  C  patients.  However,  in section 4.4 and 5.2, still the term 'severe hepatic impairment' refers to Child Pugh B patients, as this was  the  definition  used  in  the  Sponsor's  specific  study.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this might be misleading, as in SPCs it is more common to use the term 'severe hepatic impairment' for Child Pugh C patients, while Child Pugh B is denoted 'moderate hepatic impairment'. Therefore, to clarify the information included in the SPC relative to the dosage in the hepatic impaired patients, the following amendments were made.

## Section 4.4:

## 'Hepatic impairment

The recommended dose should be reduced in patients with level 2 or 3 of hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).'

## Section 5.2

## 'Pharmacokinetic in special populations

## Hepatic impairment

No modification of  vinflunine  and  DVFL  pharmacokinetics  was  observed  in  25  patients  presenting varying  degrees of hepatic  impairment,  compared  to  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function.  This  is further  confirmed  by  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (absence  of  relationship  between vinflunine  clearance  and  biology  markers  of  hepatic  impairment)  However,  dose  adjustments  are recommended in patients with level 2 or 3 liver impairment (see section 4.2).'

## Section 4.2:

## 'Special populations

## Hepatic impairment

Vinflunine pharmacokinetics is not modified in patients with three levels of impaired liver function (see  table  below  and  section  5.2),  but  mainly  based  on  hepatic  biologic  parameter  modifications (gamma glutamyl  transferases  (GGT),  transaminases,  bilirubin),  the  dose  recommendations  are  as follows:

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical development programme for vinflunine in second-line treatment in patients with TCCU after platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens included 3 phase I trials (VFL 981, 991 and 992), 2 phase II studies (VFL 202 and CA001) and 1 randomised Phase III study (VFL 302). The table below summarises the phase II/III studies.

## · Dose response study(ies)

Three  phase  I  trials  with  vinflunine  monotherapy  have  been  conducted  exploring  3  different administration schedules: (1) day 1 every 3 weeks, 2) day 1 every week, and 3) days 1&amp;8 every 3 weeks. Based on safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity, the schedule of vinflunine administered on day 1 every 3 weeks was selected for further clinical development (VFL 981). Dose limiting  toxicities  were  neutropenia,  constipation and  mucositis  and the recommended  dose for  this schedule  was  350  mg/m2  iv  q3w.  A  strong  correlation  between  vinflunine  AUC  and  maximum neutrophil  count  decrease  from  baseline  were  demonstrated.  Preliminary  evidence  of  antineoplastic activity was documented (tumour responses were observed in 1 renal and 2 breast cancer patients).

Starting in October 2000, an international program of Phase II studies with vinflunine as a single agent was undertaken in a wide range of solid tumours. In these early studies, vinflunine was administered at a  dose  of  350 mg/m²  every  3  weeks  according  to  the  phase  I  clinical  trial  recommendation.  A preliminary safety analysis performed after the enrolment of 60 patients in different trials, however, showed  an  exceedingly  high  rate  of  myelotoxicity  (64%  of  patients  had  Grade  3/4  events,  15% developed febrile neutropenia). Twenty-two patients (36.6%) out of the 60 patients who were exposed to 350 mg/m², experienced at least 1 study treatment related SAE, including 4 (6.7%) study treatment related  deaths  within  the  30  days  following  the  last  vinflunine  administration.  These  findings prompted  a  reduction  of  the  recommended  dose  to  320  mg/m²  every  3  weeks  for  all  patients subsequently included in clinical trials. This dose recommendation was later further reduced to 280 mg/m2 in patients at higher risk of myelosuppression (PS &gt; 1, prior pelvic radiotherapy).

Subjects  had  histologically  proven  TCCU.  All  patients  had  received  first-line  platinum-containing chemotherapy, mainly for metastatic disease, except 3 patients in the vinflunine + BSC group and 6 patients in the BSC group who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant prior treatment. Gemcitabine/platinum  containing  regimens  were  the  most  common  (75%  in  the  VFL+BSC  group, 70% in the BSC group). Of the platinum agents, cisplatin was the most commonly used, given in 65% of  the  vinflunine  +  BSC  group  and  73%  of  the  BSC  group,  then  carboplatin,  given  in  30%  of  the vinflunine + BSC group and 20% of the BSC group.

Patients were withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:

VFL+BSC Group

• disease progression at any time,

· symptomatic deterioration - patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression,

• patient refusal of further treatment,

• adverse events (AEs)/toxicity,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- patient non-compliance,
- investigator non-compliance,
- other reason (to be documented).

## BSC Group

Centres from the following countries participated in the trial: Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia Montenegro, Slovakia, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom

## Treatments

The study had two treatment arms: vinflunine (VFL) and Best Standard of Care (BSC) or BSC alone. In the vinflunine + BSC group, treatment was administered until documented progression. All lesions were regularly assessed every 42 days. In the BSC group, visits were recorded until completion of the 18-week.

## Arm A - vinflunine + BSC

VFL was administered every 21 days as a 20-minute infusion. Each 21-day period was defined as a cycle of treatment. There were 2 different starting doses of VFL used in this study tailored according to the patient: 320 mg/m² and 280 mg/m².Treatment was discontinued following progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent illness  or  other  reactions  which  would  require  discontinuation  of the drug and request by the patient to withdraw. The follow-up period was the time from 30 days after the last study treatment administration.

## Arm B - BSC

BSC  was  given  according  to  institutional  standards  (including  palliative  radiotherapy,  antibiotics, analgesics, steroids, transfusion). Treatment  was  discontinued following completion of the 18-week period  counting  from  the  day  of  randomisation,  receiving  a  systemic  anticancer  therapy  due  to documented progressive disease compared to baseline, request by the patient to withdraw and patient inability to meet the every 3-week schedule.

Patient accrual was planned to be completed within 24 months from the beginning of the study (May 21 st 2003). The study duration phase was planned to continue until the last patients withdrew from the treatment  (November  6 th 2006)  After  withdrawal  from  the  study  treatment,  each  patient  will  be followed until death.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare overall survival (defined as the interval between randomisation and  death  or  last  follow  up)  in  patients  with  advanced  TCCU  previously  treated  with  a  platinumcontaining chemotherapy as first line treatment. The main objective was to show survival superiority in the vinflunine arm compared to best supportive care (BSC) alone, based on the statistical hypothesis that the median survival time for the vinflunine + BSC arm would be 6 months compared to a median survival time for the BSC only patients of 4 months.

## The secondary objectives were :

- to compare patient benefit through a quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and clinical benefit parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- to compare the safety profile in both study arms

- to assess response rate, time to response, response duration and progression-free survival in patients treated with vinflunine +BSC.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, response rate, disease control/rate, quality of life and clinical benefit.

## Sample size

A  total  of  330  randomised  evaluable  patients  were  enrolled.  The  vinflunine  +  BSC  arm  had  220 randomised  evaluable  patients  and  the  BSC  only  arm  had  110  randomised  evaluable  patients.  To accommodate  an  anticipated  10%  loss  of  patients  to  follow-up,  364  patients  should  have  been included.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomised 2:1 to vinflunine + BSC or BSC alone. Patient randomisation was limited to stratification  by  study  site  and  whether  a  patient  was  refractory  to  prior  chemotherapy  (defined  as progression  within  the  first  2  cycles  of  a  prior  platinum-containing  regimen).  Randomisation  was performed by the Biometric department of IRPF.

## Blinding (masking)

The phase III study was an open label study.

## Statistical methods

The objective of the protocol was to show a significant survival superiority in the vinflunine + BSC arm versus the BSC only arm. The sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy parameter included: - overall survival analysed in the per protocol population.

-  overall  survival  censored  at  the  time  (start  date)  of  further  chemotherapy  in  the  randomised population and in the statistical analysis plan per protocol population.

For patients who had not died, survival duration was censored at the date of last news if the patient was  lost  to  follow-up  or  reached  the  time  point  of  analysis  without  a  known  record  of  death.  For patients who received secondary chemotherapy, survival duration was censored at the start date of the secondary chemotherapy.

The estimation of the number of events was based on the following clinical hypotheses:

- the median survival time for vinflunine + BSC arm is 6 months.

- the median survival time for  BSC arm is 4 months.

A  total  of  290  events  were  assumed  to  be  needed  to  allow  the  detection  of  a  survival  superiority between both arms. The primary analysis was based upon the stratified log rank test performed at 0.05 level.  The  primary  analysis  set  was  the  intent  to  treat  population.  A  Cox  multivariate  analysis  on survival  was  performed  in  order  to  take  into  account  prognostic  factors  (treatment  group,  alkaline phosphatase (&lt; median, ≥ median), haemoglobin (&lt; median, ≥ median), visceral metastases (yes, no), WHO PS (0, ≥ 1), radiotherapy of the pelvis (yes, no), and the presence of lymph nodes (yes, no)). Survival information was collected approximately every 6 weeks during the first 6 months and then every 2 months until death.

Secondary objectives were to compare patient benefit through a quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and clinical benefit parameters, to compare the safety profile in both arms and to assess response  rate  (according  to  RECIST,  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC)  reviewed  tumour assessments with CR and PR), time to response, response duration and progression free survival.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Statistical  methods  for  categorical  variables :  the  x2  test  was  performed  to  compare  proportions  or replaced by Fisher exact test if the expected frequency in one cell of the contingency table was less than 5. The 95% CI for proportions was computing following the exact method.

Statistical method for ordinal variables : comparison between treatment arms was provided for ordinal data using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test.

Statistical method for continuous variables : the distribution of quantitative data was examined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test  in  order  to  test  for  normality.  In  case  of  Gaussian  distribution,  the comparison  between  treatment  arms  was  made  with  a  Student  t-test.  In  case  of  non-Gaussian distribution, a non-parametric Wilcoxon test was performed.

Statistical methods for time to event data : Kaplan-Meier curves and life tables by treatment arm were used  to  describe  time  dependent  paramenters.  Confidence  intervals  on  the  median  were  calculated using  the  reflection  method.  Stratified  Logrank  tests  were  performed  to  compare  the  two  arms  for overall survival. Multivariate analyses were performed to take into account the prognostic factors. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model was applied to the data.

Statistical methods for Quality of Life data : data was analysed with a mixed effect model with change from  baseline  as  the  response.  The  most  suitable  covariance  structure  was  chosen  according  to Akaike's  Information  Criterion  and  Schwartz  Bayesian  Criterion  between  unstructured,  compound symmetric and autoregressive of order 1.

## Populations analysed

1. Intent to treat population: all randomised patients whether treated or not were analysed in the group they were assigned by randomization.
2. Per  protocol  population:  patients  that  were  eligible  and  treated  in  the  arm  assigned  by randomization.

Eligible patients were defined as those who had no major protocol deviations from inclusion and  exclusion  criteria.  These  included  the  following:  1)  no  locally  advanced  or  metastatic histologically proven TCC at study entry, 2) no progression after 1st line platinum-containing chemotherapy for advanced disease, 3) having received a neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy,  4)  more  than  1  line  of  chemotherapy,  and  5)  did  not  have  a  prohibited chemotherapy on study.

3. Evaluable for response: patients that were eligible, evaluable and treated in the arm assigned by randomization.

To be evaluable for response patients must had received a minimum of two cycles/42 days of treatment as required by the protocol unless progression was documented before (in that case patient was considered evaluable with an early progression) and must have all baseline lesions assessed  at  least  once  after  the  second  cycle  with  the  same  method  of  measurement  as baseline.

4. Evaluable for safety: included all treated patients, in the treatment arm they actually received.
5. Evaluable for quality of life: included patients who completed (more than two thirds of the questions)  one  questionnaire  within  14  days  prior  to  randomisation  and  at  least  one questionnaire during study period at least 21 days after the beginning of study treatment or first visit for patients in BSC group. Patients were analysed in the group they were assigned by randomisation.

Efficacy Analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary and secondary efficacy analyses for overall survival were performed on the whole randomised population and on the pre-planned per protocol populations. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses for  the  other  efficacy  endpoints  were  performed  on  the  whole  randomised  population  and  on  the response evaluable population.

Additional efficacy analysis were performed based on blinded assessment by an Independent Review Panel  (IRP)  of  patients  with  partial  or  complete  responses  or  long  stabilizations  (lasting  at  least  4 cycles). Also, an Independent Review Committee (IRC) evaluated study-related images and a subset of selected, prospectively defined clinical information for all patients who were randomized.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recruitment

The date of first enrolment was 21 st May 2003. The study data cut off was 30 th November 2006 with a final data update on the 31 st of May, 2007.

## Conduct of the study

A total  of  8  protocol  amendments  were carried  out. Of  importance,  on May  21st  2003,  all  patients randomised to vinflunine + BSC were treated at 320 mg/m² every 21 days as a 20-minute infusion. On November  19 th 2003,  an  amendment  (amendment  1)  was  drawn  up  after  a  safety  assessment  was carried out on the first 10 treated patients. This amendment led to a tailored vinflunine administration as follows:

- Patients  with  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)/World  Health  Organization (WHO) Performance  Status  (PS)  0  and  without  any  previous  irradiation  of  the  pelvic  area should receive VFL 320 mg/m² plus BSC



- Patients with PS 1 and patients with PS 0 with previous irradiation of the pelvic area should receive VFL as follows:

At 1st cycle: VFL 280 mg/m² plus BSC

At  2nd  cycle:  patients  without  haematological  toxicities  causing  treatment  delay should start VFL at 320 mg/m² plus BSC.

- Patients with haematological toxicities causing a treatment delay should receive VFL at 280 mg/m² plus BSC. These patients were not allowed to further dose escalate.

Thirty one protocol deviations were established, among these items 4 were considered as significant protocol deviations. A total of 116 (31%) patients had 1 or more protocol deviations: 73 (29%) in the VFL+BSC group and 43 (37%) in the BSC group. The 116 patients collectively  had  26  of  the  31 major protocol deviations that were pre-specified. Nine percent of bone scintigraphy and X-rays were not performed within 42 days before randomisation. The performance of bone scanning was the most common major protocol deviation (9% in both groups).

## Numbers analysed

## ITT

Efficacy analyses for overall survival were performed on the whole randomised population (n=370, 100%),  on  the  eligible  population  (n=357,  96.5%)  and  on  the  pre-planned  per  protocol  population (n=351). Other efficacy analysis were performed on the whole randomised population (n=370, 100%) and on the response evaluable population (n=270, 72.9%).

The table below summarizes the number of participants in each group included in the analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Eligible patients

The  eligible  patient  population  corresponds  to  the  whole  randomised  population  minus  ineligible patients,  those  with  clinically  significant  protocol  violations  at  baseline  (i.e.  violating  the  inclusion criteria).  The  eligible  patient  population  represents  the  actual  TCCU  population  targeted  by  the protocol  (all  randomised  patients  excluding  non  eligible  patients:  VFL+BSC:  4  patients,  BSC:  9 patients: not pre-specified in the protocol).

| Total number of patients with clinically significant protocol deviations       |           |     9 |

## Per protocol

Per protocol population corresponds to the randomised population minus non eligible patients.  Per protocol  population  excludes  13  patients  who  had  1  or  more  significant  deviations  at  baseline, deviations  during  the  study  and  non-treated  patients.  Per  protocol  population  (according  to  the statistical analysis plan was 244 subjects in the vinflunine + BSC arm and 107 subjects in the BSC. This population corresponds to all those randomised patients except:

- Deviations to the protocol at baseline (13 patients)

Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Endpoint

## Overall Survival (OS) All randomised patients

81% patients died in the vinflunine and BSC and 88% patients died in the BSC only arm. Median OS for all randomised patients was 6.9 months in the vinflunine arm and 4.6 months in the BSC arm. The risk of death is reduced by 12% in the vinflunine + BSC arm compared to the BSC arm: HR of 0.88 (95%  CI:  0.69  -  1.12),  but  the  OS  difference  between  the  2  arms  is  not  statistically  significant (p=0.2868).

Overall survival data was updated 6 months after the first analysis in November, 2006. OS in the all randomised population showed a 2 months advantage favouring vinflunine + BSC (6.9 month versus

## Overall Survival (OS) - Per protocol population

Median OS for per protocol analysis was 6.9 months in the vinflunine arm and 4.3 months in the BSC arm. The risk of death is reduced by 25% in the vinflunine + BSC arm compared to the BSC arm: HR of  0.75  (95%  CI:  0.59;  0.96  p=0.0197).    In  a  subsequent  update,  OS  in  the  per  protocol  patient population showed a 2 months advantage favouring vinflunine + BSC (6.9 month versus 4.3 months), with  a  reduction  of  risk  of  death  by  26%  HR  0.74  (95%  CI:  0.59,  0.94).  This  difference  was statistically significant (p = 0.0130).

## Overall Survival (OS) - Eligible patients

Median OS in the eligible population was 6.9 months in the vinflunine arm and 4.3 months in the BSC arm. The risk of death is reduced by 22% in the vinflunine + BSC arm compared to the BSC arm: HR of  0.78  (95%CI:  0.61,  0.99  p=0.0403).  The  OS  difference  between  the  2  arms  is  now  statistically significant.

In a subsequent analysis, OS in the eligible patient population showed a 2 months advantage favouring vinflunine + BSC (6.9 month versus 4.3 months), with a reduction of risk of death by 23% HR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.98). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0320).

## Tumour Response rate

The  IRC  evaluated  study-related  images  and  a  subset  of  selected,  prospectively  defined  clinical information for all patients who were randomised. The reviewers conducted response determination using RECIST for each patient. The on-study best overall response was calculated to 30 th November, 2006 and to 31 st May, 2007. IRC information was also used to compare the response rate, to compare disease control rate, duration of response, time to response and duration of disease control.

The response rate (RR) in all 253 randomised patients, as assessed by IRC was 6.3% (95% CI: 3.7 10.1)  and  the  RR  as  assessed  by  investigators  was  11.1%  (95%  CI:  7.5  -  15.6).  Based  on  IRC assessment, the response rate in evaluable patients was 8.6% (95% CI: 5.0 - 13.7) in the vinflunine + BSC  and  0%  in  the  BSC  arms.  The  median  time  from  randomisation  to  first  response  in  the randomised population for the vinflunine + BSC group was 2.1 months and the median duration of response was 7.4 months. The median duration of stabilisation in the randomised population was 5.4 months in the vinflunine + BSC group and 4.2 months in the BSC group.

## Disease Control/Rate (DC/R)

Disease control is defined as: DC = PR + SD. Based on IRC assessment, the disease control rate for all randomised patients was 41.1% in the vinflunine + BSC group versus 24.8% in the BSC group [p = 0.0024]. Duration of DC, in all randomised patients was 5.7 months in the vinflunine + BSC group versus 4.2 months in the BSC only arm. The disease control rate in evaluable patients was 55.1% in the vinflunine + BSC group versus 27.1% in the BSC group [p &lt; 0.0001].

## Quality of life

The EORTC QLQ-C30 was completed at baseline, at the end of cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 for the vinflunine + BSC arm and at baseline, Days 21, 42, 84 and 126 for the BSC arm. Compliance at baseline was 91.3% in the vinflunine + BSC arm and 90.6% in the BSC arm. Compliance at the end of cycle 6/Day 126 was 58.4% in the vinflunine + BSC arm and 53.7% in the BSC arm. There was no statistically significant  difference  between  the  groups in  change  from  baseline of the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  global health status score (p=0.658).

## Clinical Benefit

The  clinical  benefit  parameter  is  a  composite  endpoint  taking  into  account  the  following  clinical parameters assessed at the time of randomisation and every cycle/21 days: PS (WHO Scale), weight and pain intensity (measured by the McGill-Merlzack Pain Questionnaire) and incidence of palliative radiotherapy.

The clinical benefit response rate in the evaluable population was 9.4% in the vinflunine + BSC arm and 7.6% in the BSC arm (p = 0.6066).  There was no statistically significant difference between the two arms in terms of clinical benefit response rate.

## Palliative Radiotherapy

Administration of at least one course of palliative radiotherapy was statistically significantly higher in the BSC arm (23.9%) compared to the vinflunine + BSC arm (4.0%).

## Ancillary analyses

## Multivariate Analysis of OS using a Cox proportional hazard model

Baseline  patient  characteristics  were  imbalanced  between  the  2  treatment  arms  for  WHO  PS ≥ 1 (vinflunine + BSC arm (71.5%) BSC arm (61.5%). The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were  performed  on  the  whole  randomised  population,  using  the  Cox  proportional  hazard  model adjusted for the stepwise selected covariates pre-specified in the protocol and the Statistical Analysis Plan (treatment  group,  alkaline  phosphatase,  haemoglobin,  visceral  metastases,  ECOG  Performance Status, and pelvic irradiation). In the multivariate analysis of OS, including pre-specified prognostic factors, Performance Status (PS 0 versus 1) was the most important prognostic factor with a HR of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.48  (p&lt;0.0001).  Based  on  the  results  of  this  model,  vinflunine  reduced  the  risk  of  death  by  23% compared with BSC only, with a hazard ratio HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61 - 0.98, p = 0.0360).

b: Wald Chi square test

The  results  observed  in  the  ITT  population  were  confirmed  by  those  observed  in  the  eligible population.

The  Cox  model  proportional  hazards  assumption  was  investigated  with  the  test  of  Grambsch  and Therneau  as  performed  for  the  Cox  model  in  the  ITT  population.  The  global  test  did  not  show  a deviance from the proportional hazards assumption (p=0.273). Taken  individually, only the Performance  Status showed  evidence  of  deviation from  the proportional  hazards  assumption (p=0.028).  Thus,  the  Cox  model  was  performed  stratifying  by  Performance  Status.  The  results  are given in the table below.

a: This analysis used the following prognostic factors (at baseline): treatment group, alkaline phosphatase (&lt; median, ≥ median), haemoglobin (&lt; median, ≥ median), visceral metastases (yes, no), Refractory status (Refractory, non refractory), radiotherapy of the pelvis (yes, no).

b: Wald Chi square test

The  proportional  hazards  assumption  was  tested  in  the  model  stratified  on  the  PS,  and  neither  the global test (p=0.731) nor the individual tests (all p-values above 0.05) showed a deviance from the assumption.

No effect  of  prior  cisplatin  (p=0.4626)  nor  interaction  with  the  treatment  group  (p=0.5825)  can  be evidenced with the multivariate Cox analysis (Table 27) leading to the conclusion that the multivariate model  to  be  analyzed  in  the  eligible  population  is  the  one  without  the  cisplatin  covariate.  In  this analysis (Table 28), it is found that VFL improves significantly the Overall Survival of the patients (HR: 0.686 (0.536, 0.877), p-value: 0. 0027).

This leads to a treatment effect of HR (95% CI)=0.606 (0.375, 0.979) in the absence of prior cisplatin and of HR (95% CI)=0.708 (0.532, 0.944) in the presence of prior cisplatin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No effect of prior cisplatin (p=0.8039) and no interaction between treatment group and prior cisplatin (p=0.9716). The pre-specified multivariate Cox model in the eligible population was used in order to adjust  the  effect  of  the  treatment  group  on  the  prognostic  factors  when  analyzing  the  PFS.  In  this model, the effect of the treatment group is found to be significant (p=0.0001).

This leads to a treatment effect of HR (95% CI)=0.625 (0.390, 1.001) in the absence of prior cisplatin and of HR (95% CI)=0.631 (0.476, 0.836) in the presence of cisplatin.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

## Renal Impairment

A pharmacokinetic study of IV vinflunine in cancer patients with renal impairment was conducted and is still ongoing (CSR L0070 IN 113 interim). The trial is an open-label, non-randomised, multicentre PK Phase I study in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the PK of vinflunine and DVFL in adult cancer  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  dysfunction  and,  to  propose  a  dose  adjustment  when required. The secondary objectives were to assess the safety of vinflunine. The results of the interim analysis  suggested  that  Clcr  of  vinflunine  was  decreased  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  The decrease was of approximately 16% in patients with moderate renal impairment and of approximately 30%  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  Renal  impairment  affected  the  elimination  of  both vinflunine and DVFL to a similar extent.

## Hepatic Impairment

A phase I pharmacokinetic dose adjusted of IV vinflunine in cancer patients with liver dysfunction was  conducted  during  the  drug  development  (CSR  L0070  IN  104).  The  study  was  an  open-label multicentre  phase  I  study.  The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  Recommended Dose  (RD)  of  vinflunine  and  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetics  and  tolerability  of  vinflunine  in cancer  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  hepatic  dysfunction.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to recommend dose adjustments of vinflunine if needed.

For pharmacokinetic analysis, no statistical difference was evidenced for VFL and DVFL among the 3 groups of liver impairment and between liver impairment groups and the control group (n= 49). No significant correlation was observed between individual values of VFL clearance and each biological variables at baseline (i.e bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, ALP, GGT, total plasma protein and prothrombine time) and between VFL clearance and the presence or absence of cirrhosis.

The liver impairment (LI) effect was also studied in the population PK analysis (372 patients including LI  patients  data)  which  showed  that  covariates  such  as  total  bilirubin,  transaminases  and  alkaline phosphatase were not related to VFL Cltot. Likewise, the population PK approach did not show any modification of VFL Cltot in patients with liver metastases (n= 141 patients out of 372).

## Phase II study - VFL 202

This was an open-label, multi-centre (18 centres in 5 European countries), single-arm non-randomised Phase  II  study  of  vinflunine.  Patients  with  TCCU  who  had  relapsed  after  a  previous  platinumcontaining regimen were enrolled. The study was carried out between November 2000 and September 2002. The primary objective was to estimate the response rate according to modified WHO criteria. Secondary objectives were to assess the duration of response, progression free survival and overall survival and to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with the treatment. An independent  radiologist  reviewed  all  the  responses  and  disease  stabilisations  lasting  at  least  2 consecutive assessments. Tumour assessment was performed every two cycles. Subjects included Men or  women  &gt;  18  years,  who  had  histologically  proven  advanced  TCCU  of  the  bladder,  with documented relapse or progression after first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy and KPS &gt; 80. The  median  age  of  patients  treated  with  350  mg/m²  group  was  66  and  the  median  age  of  patients treated with 320 mg/m² group was 63. Previous first-line chemotherapy included cisplatin-vinblastine (43%) and  gemcitabine  /platinum  (49%).  51%  of  patients  had  progressed  within  6  months  of  their prior chemotherapy.

Vinflunine  was  administered  as  a  10-minute  infusion  at  350  mg/m²  every  3  weeks  for  the  first  6 patients.  For  the  51  subsequent  patients,  vinflunine  was  administered  at  320  mg/m²  every  3  weeks following  preliminary  safety  evaluation.  The  treatment  was  discontinued  in  case  of  progressive disease,  unacceptable  toxicity,  intercurrent  illness  or  other  reactions  which  in  the  judgement  of  the investigator, affected clinical status of the patient or request by the patient to withdraw.

51 patients  were treated  at  320  mg/m²,  Day  1  every  three  weeks.  Out  of 47  evaluable patients,  the overall  response  rate  was  17.6%  (95%  CI:  7.7-30.8%)  as  assessed  by  independent  review  and  the median duration of the response was 9.1 months, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 4.2 to 15.0  months.  The  median  progression-free  survival  calculated  was  3  months  [95%  CI:  2.4-3.8 months], while the median overall survival was 6.6 months [95% CI: 4.8-7.6 months]

Safety  conclusions  refer  solely  to  the  patients  treated  at  the  dose  of  320  mg/m².  In  terms  of  drug exposure,  the  relative  dose  intensity  was  95.5%  [range:  71.0  -  102.3%].  The  majority  of  dose reductions were due to non-haematological toxicities (280 mg/m² [9.6%]). Neutropenia was reported in 82.4% of patients with grade 3-4 severity in 66.7%. The neutrophil nadir appeared at a median day 12 [range: 3-21] and lasted a median of 7 days [range: 1-14]. Grade 3 and 4 febrile neutropenia were observed in 7.8% and 2.0% of patients. Three cases of septicaemia/severe neutropenia occurred, with a fatal  outcome  for  2  patients.  The  overall  incidence  of  anaemia  was  in  90.2%  of  patients.  Grade  3 anaemia occurred in 13.7% of patients (5.1% of cycles). A significant percentage of patients (66.7%) experienced fatigue of mild intensity. Grade 3 fatigue occurred in 9.8% of patients (3.0% of cycles) with  no  grade  4  fatigue  being  observed.    Constipation  appeared  to  be  the  most  important  nonhaematological  toxicity  seen,  with  an  overall  incidence  of  64.7%  of  patients.  Four  patients  (7.9%) experienced  severe  (grade  3/4)  constipation.  All  four  patients  had  undergone  significant  prior abdominal surgery;  three  also  received  opioids  +  5HT3  antagonists.  Constipation  was  notified  as  a SAE in  7  patients.  Grade  3 toxicities  included  neutropenia  (33.3%),  anaemia  (16.7%),  nausea  and vomiting  (16.7%).  Grade  4 toxicities  included  leucopenia  (50.0%),  neutropenia  (66.7%),  anaemia (16.7%),  one  patients  experienced  a  fatal  febrile  neutropenia,  and  three  patients  died  due  to  SAE (septic shock, septicaemia febrile neutropenia).

## Phase II study CA 001

This was an open-label, multi-centre (60 centres in 12 countries), single-arm, non-randomised Phase II study  of  vinflunine.  Patients  with  TCCU  who  had  relapsed  after  a  previous  platinum-containing regimen were enrolled. The Study was carried out between the 27 th January 2005 and the 10 th April

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2007.  The  primary  objective  was  to  estimate  the  response  rate  (complete  response  [CR]  +  partial response  [PR];  as  defined  by  modified  WHO  criteria  and  determined  by  an  Independent  Response Review Committee (IRRC). Tumour assessment was performed every 6 weeks. Secondary objectives included estimation of the duration of response, time to response, disease control rate, progression free survival  (PFS),  and  overall  survival  (OS)  and  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  vinflunine  and vinflunine  pharmacokinetics.  Inclusion  criteria  included  men  and  women  &gt;  age  18  years  who  had histologically  proven  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  TCCU,  had  documented  progression  up  to  12 months after the last dose of a platinum-containing regimen, and KPS of 100, 90 or 80. The median age was 66 years (range: 31 to 83 years).

Vinflunine was administered every 21 days; prior to Amendment 5, patients received vinflunine at a dose of 320 mg/m² every 3 weeks if they had a KPS of 100 without prior pelvic irradiation. Upon implementation of Amendment 5, patients also needed to be &lt; 75 years old and have a CrCl &gt; 60 mL/min to receive vinflunine at a starting dose of 320 mg/m². Patients received vinflunine at an initial dose of 280 mg/m² if they had a KPS of 90 or 80

Among  the  175  patients  enrolled,  151  were  treated  with  the  study  medication.  In  the  All-Treated population, the primary endpoint of independently assessed response rate was 14.6% [95% CI: 9.4 21.2]. Duration of tumour responses was a median of 5.95 months (95% CI: 5.42 - 9.46). Median PFS was 2.76 (95% CI: 2.56 - 3.84) and median OS was 7.89 months (95% CI: 6.67 - 9.69)

The most frequent adverse events noted were myelosuppression, constipation and fatigue. Myelosuppression  was  common.  Severe  (Grade  3-4)  events  of  neutropenia  and  leukopenia  were reported  in  more  than  half  of  all  patients.  Febrile  neutropenia  was  uncommon  (6.6%).  The  most common  non-haematologic  AEs  were  constipation,  followed  by  fatigue,  nausea,  weight  decrease, anorexia, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, alopecia, and back pain. The most common (&gt; 10%) non-haematologic  severe (Grade 3-4) AEs  were  constipation and fatigue. The  frequency of discontinuation due to treatment related AEs was 15%. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was low and only 1 Grade 3 event was reported. Other AEs of special interest (ileus, intestinal obstruction, abdominal  pain,  injection/infusion  site  reactions,  immediate  hypersensitivity,  extravastion,  cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, infection with severe neutropenia, and diarrhoea) were manageable, though a few of these AEs led to discontinuation. 86 (57%) patients died after the study started, 10 of these (7%) died within 30 days of their last vinflunine dose. 2 patients (1%) died due to events judged to be related to the study drug (neutropenic sepsis, myocardial infarction).

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

Overall,  the  efficacy  results  were  considered  to  be  consistent  and  the  efficacy  endpoint  of  overall survival  was  considered  to  be  significantly  different  between  the  two  treatment  groups,  based  on  a consistent  picture  across  a  number  of  secondary  analyses  including  the  eligible  population  analysis and following adjustment for covariates. Secondary endpoints, particularly progression-free survival, favoured  the  vinflunine  arm,  supporting  the  conclusion  that  the  product  is  efficacious.  The  effects were  consistent  across  subgroups.  The  updated  overall  survival  data,  at  two  years  confirmed  the positive  treatment  effect  of  vinflunine  on  overall  survival  as  reported  at  the  first  cut-off  date  (Nov 30th, 2006).

With  regards  to  potential  interactions  between  treatment  effect  and  prior  cisplatin  therapy  in  the eligible population, the results were better in those patients without prior cisplatin therapy, but there was  still  evidence  of  efficacy  in  the  group  of  patients  who  had  received  prior  cisplatin  therapy.  A favourable trend was observed with the log-rank test and when covariates were adjusted in the Cox regression model, the difference reached statistical significance in both subgroups.

The following major objections were raised regarding the clinical efficacy data submitted.

1.  The CHMP was initially of the opinion that insufficient evidence for efficacy of Vinfluinine had been  provided.  The  primary  analysis  from  the  single  pivotal  study  had  failed  to  show  a  statistical significant difference in overall survival for vinflunine when compared to BSC in the ITT (intention to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treat) population. A difference in overall survival was only observed in secondary analyses, excluding patients from the ITT population. The need to exclude a substantial proportion of subjects from the per protocol analysis cast some doubt on the overall validity of the trial. Potential biases arising from these specific exclusions, needed to be addressed.

In  the  dossier  submitted,  the  eligible  population  corresponds  to  the  whole  randomised  population minus  the  ineligible  patients.  The  Applicant  argued  that  the  eligible  patients  represent  the  actual TCCU population targeted by the protocol. In the eligible population, a median of 2 months survival advantage  favouring  the  VFL+BSC  arm  was  observed  (6.9  months  vs.  4.3  months).  A  statistically significant  (stratified  log-rank  test)  survival  difference  between  the  2  arms  was  achieved  (HR  0.78 [0.61, 0.99] p=0.0403). In this analysis, where patients with clinically significant protocol violations at baseline  (i.e.  those  violating  the  inclusion  criteria)  were  excluded,  the  results  did  achieve  statistical significance.

The primary analysis performed in the ITT population was affected by the higher proportion of non eligible patients in the BSC arm (9 non eligible patients for BSC vs. 4 for VFL + BSC).  Ineligible patients  included  patients  with  no  progression  to  first  line  platinum-containing  chemotherapy  for advanced  disease  (12  out  of  13  patients)  or  patients  with  no  advanced  or  metastatic  histologically proven TCCU.  This is consistent with the longer survival observed in these patients.  Importantly, non eligible  patients  were  identified  using  a  blinded  review  before  database  lock,  and  all  analyses  were performed after the database  lock  (30th March  2007).   These  patients  are  not  representative  of  the population  targeted  by  the  protocol  (advanced  TCCU  that  has  failed  prior  platinum-containing regimen).

Furthermore,  a  significant  treatment  effect  of  vinflunine  (p=0.036)  on  overall  survival  in  the  prespecified multivariate Cox analysis conducted in the ITT population was seen. Vinflunine reduced the risk of death by 23% compared to BSC with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61-0.98).  In addition, the  fact  that  all  other  parameters  that  had  a  significant  independent  impact  on  OS  in  multivariate analysis (liver involvement, number of organs involved, alkaline phosphatase, haemoglobin, PS and pelvic irradiation)  were the  same  in the three populations  analysed (ITT,  eligible  and  Per-Protocol) further supports the consistency of the results.

## Therefore the CHMP considered that:

a. The primary analysis from the single pivotal study failed to show a statistical significant difference in overall survival for vinflunine when compared to BSC in the ITT population.

b. A statistically significant effect on overall survival was obtained from the pre-specified multivariate Cox analysis. The hazard ratio from this analysis was 0.77 (0.61, 0.98), very consistent with the 0.78 (0.61, 0.99) obtained from the eligible population analysis. At the request of the CHMP, the Applicant repeated  the  analysis  stratifying  for  Performance  Status  and  thereby  not  relying  on  proportional hazards for this covariate. The results were consistent with those previously observed - ITT population (p=0.0420, HR 0.776 (0.61, 0.99)); eligible population (p=0.0067, HR=0.708 (0.55, 0.91)).

2. The Applicant was also asked to present efficacy results in relation to prior platinum based therapy. Based on the evidence provided,  the results were better in the 'without prior cisplatin therapy group', although evidence of efficacy was still seen in the 'prior cisplatin group'. None of the prior platinum regimens received by the patients appeared to have a significant interaction with vinflunine on OS, PFS and DCR and the effect of the treatment arm was still found to be significant when adjusted for prior  platinum  based  therapies.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  modify  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  to include the following wording:

In  the  two  multi-centre  open-label,  single-arm  phase  II  clinical  trials  a  total  of  202  patients  were treated with vinflunine.

In  the  multi-centre,  open-label  controlled  phase  III  clinical  trial,  253  patients  were  randomised  to treatment with vinflunine + BSC (best supportive care) and 117 patients to the BSC arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  median  overall  survival  was  6.9  months  (vinflunine  +  BSC)  vs.  4.6  months  (BSC),  but  the difference  did  not  reach  statistical  significance;  hazard  ratio  0.88  (95%  CI  0.69,1.12).  However  a statistically  significant  effect  was  seen  on  progression-free  survival.  Median  PFS  was  3.0  months (vinflunine + BSC) vs 1.5 months (BSC) (p=0.0012).

In addition a pre-specified multivariate analysis performed on the ITT population demonstrated that vinflunine had a statistically significant treatment effect (p=0.036) on overall survival when prognostic factors (PS, visceral involvement, alkaline phosphatases, haemoglobin, pelvic irradiation) were taken into  consideration;  hazard  ratio  0.77  (95%  CI  0.61,  0.98).  A  statistically  significant  difference  on overall survival (p=0.040) was also seen in the eligible population (which excluded 13 patients with clinically significant protocol violations at baseline who were not eligible for treatment); hazard ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.99). This is considered the most relevant population for the efficacy analysis, as it most closely reflects the population intended for treatment.

Efficacy was demonstrated in both patients with and without prior cisplatin use.

In the eligible population, the subgroup analyses according to the prior cisplatin use versus BSC on overall survival (OS) showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.64 (0.40 - 1.03); p=0.0821] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR (95% CI) = [0.80 (0.60 - 1.06); p=0.1263] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When adjusted on prognostic factors, the analyses of OS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior cisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.53 (0.32 - 0.88); p=0.0143] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.70 (0.53 0.94); p=0.0174], respectively.

In  the  subgroup  analyses of  prior  cisplatin  use  versus  BSC  for  progression free  survival  (PFS),  the results were: HR (95% CI) = [0.55 (0.34 - 0.89); p=0.0129] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR (95%  CI)  =  [0.64  (0.48  -  0.85);  p=0.0040]  in  the  presence  of  prior  cisplatin.  When  adjusted  on prognostic factors,  the  analyses  of  PFS  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  without  or  with  prior  cisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.51(0.31 - 0.86); p=0.0111] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.63(0.48 - 0.84); p=0.0016], respectively.

The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  all  these  efficacy  results,  together  with  the  acceptable  and manageable safety of the drug demonstrated meaningful efficacy in the context of this patient group, with a short life expectancy and with an unmet medical need. Following the responses to both major objections, The CHMP considered that the Applicant had adequately demonstrated that the magnitude of the efficacy effects observed with vinflunine were comparable or greater than those observed and considered as clinically meaningful with other approved anticancer drugs in different and comparable settings.  The  meaningful  efficacy  effect  was  reinforced  by  the  positive  results  of  vinflunine  across endpoints.

When consulted in this matter, the SAG-Oncology raised some concerns about the quality of the study (long duration of recruitment into the study, the large number of ineligible patients, the control arm not including  other  available  options),  that  the  claimed  effects  were  not  consistent  across  different endpoints  as  the  response  rate  was  low,  and  that  the  population  studied  was  very  heterogeneous concerning important prognostic factors for survival. The SAG agreed that the claimed difference in terms of overall survival would be clinically meaningful, provided that the claimed difference could be established using robust methodology. Although meaningful, the size of the effect on OS in the overall population  was  considered  as  modest.  However,  if  efficacy  were  established  based  on  robust methodology, the SAG stated that would be of interest to identify patients that might be more likely to benefit from this treatment. Currently, it was considered difficult to identify such population.

In addition, the CHMP raised other concerns with regards to the clinical efficacy data submitted in this dossier.

3. The applicant was asked to provide further discussion on the efficacy results of the Phase II studies in reference to available historical controls for TCCU patients. In the responses, the literature review demonstrates  that  when  compared  to  other  anti-cancer  agents  in  patients  with  TCCU,  VFL  had

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

favourable activity. The data were considered to support the rationale for further study of vinflunine in the proposed indication.

4. The study Ca 183002 was prematurely terminated due to unexplained reasons. The clinical report of this study was submitted in the initial application and was requested by the CHMP, in particular, the reasons that led to study early termination, as these may include efficacy or safety issues that may be absolutely relevant to the present application. In the  applicant's responses, the reasons for early Ca 183002 study termination were explained and the clinical report of this study was provided.  Early termination of this study was due to commercial and development priorities matters and not to any major safety or efficacy issues related to vinflunine therapy.

5.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  submit  data  on  the  number  of  trial  subjects  in  each  arm  who  postprogression received chemotherapy, indicating what the type of chemotherapy was administered. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy at disease progression was well balanced between study arms, with slightly higher figures as expected among patients allocated to BSC (34.2%) than among VFL treated patients (28.8%).  Of them, the percentage of patients that received multiple agents at disease  progression  was  62.5%  (BSC  arm)  versus  57.5%  (VFL  arm).    Therefore,  an  unbalanced distribution of further subsequent therapies among study arms was considered unlikely to have had a major impact in the ability to observe a survival benefit for VFL treated patients.  In addition, data submitted  suggests  that  vinflunine  therapy  does  not  compromise  the  ability  to  receive  further treatment.

6. In line with the appendix on methodological issues on PFS in the CHMP anticancer guideline, the CHMP requested that the applicant address sensitivity analyses and discuss how ascertainment bias can  be  ruled  out  for  the  PFS  results  submitted.  From  the  applicant's  responses,  all  the  efficacy assessments  were  reviewed  by  a  blinded  Independent  Review  Committee  and  the  time  interval between tumour assessments was descriptively investigated. This was shown to be balanced between the study arms. The applicant carried out PFS sensitivity analyses in order to confirm the consistency of the initial results. Sensitivity analyses of PFS showed consistency, confirming the benefit of VFL + BSC treatment.

7.  The  CHMP considered that the statistically significant improvement in progression free survival obtained was small and clinically marginal. The applicant was therefore asked to explain any relating clinical relevance. In its responses, the applicant demonstrated that TCCU patients perform favourably in  terms  of  PFS  when  compared  to  historical  controls.  In  the  context  of  wider  clinical  practice,  to support the claim of clinical relevance, the size of increase in PFS is similar to other licensed anticancer agents in comparable situations.

8.  The  demographic  baseline  characteristics  in  VFL  302  showed  overall  comparability  in  many aspects. Nevertheless the number of patients with disease stage unknown was considerably higher in the active treatment arm (14.6%) vs the BSC control arm: (7.7%). Since the disease of stage is related to  survival  prognosis,  unfamiliarity  with  this  important  aspect  may  induce  considerable  bias.  The CHMP recommended that a sensitivity analysis would reveal the impact of these cases with unknown stage  of  disease.  The  additional  analysis  supplied  by  the  applicant  demonstrated  that  the  benefit  in terms of overall survival of the VFL + BSC group compared with the BSC group was not due to the effect of disease stage at diagnosis. In terms of overall survival in the ITT population, when adjusted for  the  effects  of  potential  prognostic  factors  including  disease  stage  at  diagnosis,  the  effect  of  the treatment arm was significant (p= 0.0221), showing a reduction of risk of death of 26% for the VFL + BSC group compared with the BSC group.

9.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  study  population  was  not  representative  for  the  patient  in  daily practice with advanced urothelial cancer progressive after first line chemotherapy as only Performance Status 0-1 patients were included, whereas the majority of patients have a poor Performance Status of 2 in whom any benefit of systemic therapy will be lower. Given that only patients with PS 0 and 1 were included in the phase III trial, which may not reflect the overall population of the patients with advanced TTCU relapsing after a platinum-containing regimen, the SPC was amended to reflect the

following statement in section 4.1:  'Efficacy and safety of vinflunine has not been studied in patients with Performance Status ≥ 2'.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

A total  of  1203  patients  received  4617  cycles  of  vinflunine  as  a  single  agent,  either  in  the  TCCU indication (450 patients) or in Non-TCCU setting. Safety analyses included all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. 1202 cycles were administered in the 320 mg/m² group, with a median number of cycles delivered of 4 (range 1-21). 620 cycles were administered in the 280 mg/m² group, with a median number of cycles delivered of 2 (range 1-20).

## Deaths

107 patients (8.9%) died within 30 days following the last vinflunine infusion. The rates of deaths within the 30 days were 7.0 % for TCCU patients in the 320 mg/m² group, 14.6% in the 280 mg/m² group and 8.2% in Non-TCCU patients. In all TCCU patients, the rate of death within 30 days was 10.0%.  Twenty  out  of  45  deaths  occurring  within  the  30  days  following  the  last  study  drug administration were due to disease progression. The most frequent adverse event leading to death was pulmonary embolism (8 patients).

In the TCCU patients, 6 study drug related deaths were recorded, 4 in the 320 mg/m² group. Two were in relation to myelosuppression (pancytopenia, febrile neutropenia), one was in relation to septicaemia and  one  in  relation  to  a  cardio-pulmonary  arrest.  Two  study  drug  related  deaths  in  the  280  mg/m² group  died  due  to  infection  associated  with  bone  marrow  depletion  and  one  lethal  myocardial infarction. When Non-TCCU patients were considered, 4 out of the 6 deaths due to study medication related to AEs that were a consequence of severe infection.

## · Laboratory findings

## Hematological toxicity

Neutropenia  is  a  frequent  adverse  reaction  of  vinflunine.  Adequate  monitoring  of  complete  blood counts should  be conducted  to  verify the  ANC  value  before  each  vinflunine  infusion.  The recommended dose should be reduced in patients with Grade&gt;3 haematological toxicity (see section 4.2 of the SPC). Vinflunine should not be administered when the ANC &lt; 1,000/mm 3 and/or platelets &lt; 100,000/mm 3 .

## Haemoglobin.

Anaemia was commonly observed in 90.8%, 96.0% and 81.7% of the TCCU (320 mg/m²), TCCU (280 mg/m²) and Non-TCCU patients, respectively. In the BSC arm of the Phase III trial (VFL 302), 2/3 of patients (61.3%) also experienced anaemia.

During the treatment period, severe anaemia (grade 3, haemoglobin ≥ 6.5 g/dl &lt; 8.0 g/dl; or grade 4, haemoglobin &lt; 6.5g/dl) was recorded in 14.8 % of TCCU (320 mg/m²) patients and in 21.3 % TCCU (280 mg/m²) patients. Grade 4 anaemia was rare, occurring in only 5 patients (1.8%) in the TCCU (320  mg/m²),  and  7  cases  (4.0%)  in  the  TCCU  patients  treated  at  280  mg/m².  Grade  3/4  anaemia occurred in 5.9% of cycles in the TCCU patients and in 1.9% of the cycles in Non-TCCU patients.

Seven percent (6.8%) of the patients had no anaemia at baseline, but experienced grade 3/4 anaemia as the  worst  grade  during  treatment.  Forty  seven  percent  (568/1203)  of  patients  treated  with  VFL presented  with  anaemia  at  baseline.  Among  patients  presenting  with  grade  1/2  at  baseline  anaemia worsened to reach grade 3/4 events in 27.2% of patients during treatment.

## Leucocytes

A total  of  120  (44.3%)  of  the  TCCU  patients  in  the  320  mg/m²  group  and  81  (46.6%)  of  the  280 mg/m² group experienced grade 3/4 leucopenia during vinflunine treatment. In Non-TCCU patients, the incidence of grade 3/4 leucopenia is lower (30.8%).

At baseline, TCCU patients were required to have a baseline neutrophils (ANC) value of at least 1.5 x 10 9 /L in VFL 302 and CA 001 studies and of 2.0 x 10 9 /L in the VFL 202 study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neutropenia  was  commonly  observed  in  all  data  sets.  Grades  3/4  severity  was  recorded  in  57.2%, 50.6% and 47.6% of patients in TCCU (320 mg/m²), TCCU (280 mg/m²) and Non-TCCU patients, respectively. Grade 3/4 neutropenia induced few major clinical consequences:

- Febrile neutropenia was recorded in 7% of the TCCU patients treated at 320 mg/m² (1.8% of cycle), 6.2% of patients treated at 280 mg/m² (1.8% of cycles) and in 4.5% of Non-TCCU patients (1.3% of cycles); only one patient died due to this adverse event (Patient 202-130601).

-  Infections  with  severe  neutropenia  and  any  grade  of  infection  were  observed  in  4.7%  of  TCCU patients  (4.0%  treated  at  320  mg/m²  and  5.6%  treated  at  280  mg/m²)  and  in  2.5%  of  Non-TCCU patients.

-  The rate of severe infection with severe neutropenia was very low (grade 4 life threatening sepsis (e.g. septic shock): 1.1% of TCCU patients).

-  Overall  7  deaths  were  reported  (0.5%)  from  infection  as  a  complication  occurring  during neutropenia. Five of those 7 deaths were observed in second line treatment (Two in NSCLC patients 301-090104, 301-570106; one in ovarian cancer patient 208-520211 and two in TCCU patients 202130102, CA001-13-124).

- Among the patients treated at the recommended dose of 320 mg/m², the median nadir of neutrophils at cycle 1was observed at 0.9 x 10 9 L ( range [0 ; 2.8 x 10 9 L] at the 8.5 day ,range [7 ; 17]. These values have been obtained from the phase I study in which WBC counts were performed twice every week.

## Platelets

In TCCU trials, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 10 patients (3.7%) among those treated at 320 mg/m² and in 12 patients (6.9%) among those treated at 280 mg/m², as compared to Non-TCCU patients (2.7%). In all studies, the threshold baseline value of platelets was 100 x 10 9 /L.

## Gastrointestinal disorders

Severe  constipation  occurred  in  15.3%  of  treated  patients.  Constipation  is  reversible  and  not cumulative. Special dietary measures such as oral hydration should be taken and laxatives should be administered  from  day  1  to  day  5  or  7  of  the  treatment  cycle.  Patients  at  high  risk  of  constipation (concomitant treatment with opiates, peritoneal carcinomas, abdominal masses, prior heavy abdominal surgery) should be medicated with polyethylene glycol from day 1 to day 7 administered once a day in the morning before breakfast.

In  case  of  Grade  2  constipation  for  more  than  5  days  and  Grade ≥ 3  of  any  duration,  the  dose  of vinflunine should be adjusted (see section 4.2 of the SPC).

Therefore, the following warning was adequately reflected in the SPC: The concomitant use of opioids could enhance the risk of constipation.

In case of any Grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (except vomiting or nausea) and of mucositis (Grade 2 for more than 5 days and Grade ≥ 3 of any duration) dose adjustment is required (see section 4.2 of the SPC).

## Cardiac disorders

Few QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. This effect may  lead  to  an  increased  risk  of  ventricular  arrhytmias although no  ventricular  arrhythmias  were observed  with  vinflunine.  Nevertheless,  vinflunine  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with increase  of  the  proarrhytmic  risk  (e.g.,  congestive  heart  failure,  known  history  of  QT  interval prolongation,  hypokalemia)  (see  section  4.8  of  the  SPC).  The  concomittant  use  of  two  or  more QT/QTc interval prolonging drugs is not recommended (see section 4.5 of the SPC).

Special  attention  is  recommended  when  vinflunine  is  administered  to  patients  with  prior  history  of myocardial  infarction/ischemia  or  angina  pectoris  (see  section  4.8  of  the  SPC).  Ischaemic  cardiac

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

events may occur, especially in patients who have underlying cardiac disease. Thus, patients receiving Javlor  should  be  vigilantly  monitored  by  physicians  for  the  occurrence  of  cardiac  events.  Caution should  be  exercised  in  patients  with  a  history  of  cardiac  disease  and  the  benefit  /  risk  assessment should be carefully evaluated regularly. Discontinuation of vinflunine should be considered in patients who develop cardiac ischaemia.

## Liver function

Bilirubin.  Overall,  the  incidence  of  grades  3  and  4  toxicity  was  low  and  there  was  no  relevant difference  between  groups:  1.9%  in  TCCU  (320  mg/m²)  patients,  2.4%  in  TCCU  (280  mg/m²) patients, and 0.8% in Non-TCCU patients.

As regards to alkaline phosphatase, the picture is very similar. 18 patients (4.1%) experienced grade 3 or 4 levels.

Grade 3 and grade 4 levels of SGOT/AST and SGPT/ALT were very infrequently observed 3 cases (0.7), whatever the data set of patients.

## Renal function

In  studies  VFL  302  and  VFL  202,  the  lower  limit  of  calculated  creatinine  clearance  (Cockroft  and Gault formula) for study inclusion was 40 ml/min. In the CA 001 study, this lower limit was extended to 20 ml/min. Forty three percent of TCCU patients had a creatinine clearance below normal value (&lt; 60  mL/min)  at  baseline,  this  is  probably  related  both  to  the  disease  setting  and  to  prior  cisplatin exposure (68.2% of patients having received a prior CDDP containing regimen). Furthermore, 6.0% of these patients had a calculated creatinine clearance lower than 40 mL/min. there was no worsening of levels of serum creatinine on study.

Serum creatinine levels observed during treatment were higher in the TCCU population (43.0%) than in  the  Non-TCCU  patients  (14.2%).  The  same  trend  is  observed  when  considering  the  grade  3/4 creatininaemia  which  remain  very  low  (TCCU:  1.1%,  Non-TCCU:  0.4%).  The  difference  of  rate between TCCU and Non-TCCU is probably explained by the disease setting: the upper urinary tract can be impaired by the TCCU and by prior platinum containing chemotherapy (nephrotoxic agent). A total of 5 TCCU patients (1.1%) had grade 3 levels of serum creatinine during treatment. Of note, 3 (2.8%)  BSC  arm  patients  in  the  TCCU  study  VFL  302  had  also  grade  3  or  4  as  worst  grade.).  In patient presenting normal values of serum creatinine at baseline, only 20% of TCCU patients treated with VFL had a grade 1 to 4 level of serum creatinine, as compared to 36% of BSC patients.

According to the NCI CTC version 2.0, Grade 3 and 4 hyponatraemia are defined as serum sodium level between 120 mmol/L to 130 mmol/L and &lt; 120 mmol/L respectively. The incidence is slightly higher (13.7%) in TCCU patients treated at 280 mg/m². The incidence of hyponatraemia is higher in TCCU patients (11.7%) than in Non-TCCU patients (6.8%).

## · Safety in special populations

## Hepatic impairment

A  phase  I  pharmacokinetic  dose  adjusted  study  of  IV  vinflunine  in  cancer  patients  with  liver dysfunction  was  carried  out.  Both  vinflunine  and  DVFL  PK  parameters  showed  no  significant differences  between  patients  with  liver  impairment  and  control  groups.    However,  the  safety

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evaluation  in  the  Phase  I  study  indicated  that  the  dose  of  vinflunine  needed  to  be  adjusted  to  250 mg/m² for patients  with  moderate  impairment  and  200  mg/m²  for  patients  with  severe  impairment. Therefore, the recommended dose should be reduced in patients with level 2 or 3 hepatic impairment (see section 4.2 of the SPC)

## Group 1: Mild chronic liver dysfunction

At the recommended dose of 320 mg/m², 6 patients were treated for a total of 15 cycles. Anaemia was seen in all patients and all cycles but no grade 3 or 4 were reported. Neutropenia grade 4 was reported in  2  patients  for  a  total  of  2  cycles  and  a  grade  3  neutropenia  was reported twice in  one  patient. A single episode of grade 3 fatigue was described.

## Group 2: Moderate chronic liver dysfunction

At  the  recommended  dose  of  250  mg/m²,  6  evaluable  patients.  1  experienced  neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia. 5 patients experienced anaemia and leucopenia. One episode of febrile neutropenia was recorded and 2 experienced grade 3 fatigue. One patient presented grade 1 neuropathy sensory. No other grades 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicities were reported in a total of 50 cycles.

## Group 3: Severe chronic liver dysfunction

At the recommended dose of 200 mg/m², the 9 patients treated for a total of 37 cycles had anaemia which was graded 3 in 2 patients. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia were observed in 4 patients and grade 3 thrombocytopenia was seen in 2 patients. As regards non-haematological toxicities no grade 4 event was recorded. Five cases of grade 3 were observed, 2 patients experienced fatigue and 3 episodes of diarrhoea, gastric ulcer and melena were observed.

Following the safety evaluation, the dose in patients with hepatic liver impairment is:

In patients with mild liver dysfunction (Prothrombin Time ≥ 70% and ULN &lt; bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and/or 1.5 x ULN &lt; transaminases ≤ 2.5 x ULN and/or ULN &lt; GGT ≤ 5 ULN), the recommended dose of vinflunine is 320 mg/m² given on day 1 every 3 weeks

In  patients  with  moderate  chronic  liver  dysfunction  (Child-Pugh  grade  A  cirrhosis  or  prothrombin Time ≥ 60% and 1.5 x ULN &lt; bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN and transaminases &gt; ULN and/or GGT &gt; 5 x ULN) vinflunine recommended dose is 250 mg/m² on day 1 every 3 weeks;

In patients with severe chronic liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh grade B cirrhosis prothrombin Time ≥ 50 % and 1.5 x  ULN &lt; bilirubin  &gt;3  x  ULN  and  transaminases  &gt;  ULN  and  GGT  &gt;  ULN)  vinflunine recommended dose is 200 mg/m², on day 1 every 3 weeks.

## Renal impairment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>



The interim analysis from a Phase I study regarding the vinflunine use in cancer patients with renal impairment  was  provided.  Clcr  of  vinflunine  decreased  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  This decrease was of approximately 16% in patients with moderate renal impairment (Creatinine clearance (calculated) from 40 ml/min to 60 ml/min.) and of approximately 30% in patients with severe renal impairment  (Creatinine  clearance  (calculated)  from ≥ 20  ml/min  to ≤ 40  ml/min).  Therefore,  the recommended  dose  should  be  reduced  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (see section 4.2 of the SPC).



Dose recommendations in patients with renal impairment are as follows:

Moderate renal impairment (40 ml/min ≤ Clcr ≤ 60 ml/min): the recommended vinflunine  dose is 280 mg/m²;

Severe renal impairment (20 ml/min ≤ Clcr &lt; 40 ml/min): the recommended VFL dose is 250mg/m².

## Elderly

A pharmacokinetic study of IV vinflunine in elderly cancer patients started in January 2005 and is still ongoing.

## Paediatric population

No studies have been submitted in this specific population.

- Immunological events

No data was submitted with regards to immunological events. A justification was provided.

When combined with each chemotherapy agent, except pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLDH), vinflunine exhibited a constant clearance with less than 15% difference compared to the control values (single agent vinflunine). A significant effect of PLDH on vinflunine Cltot was demonstrated (&gt;15% 30% decrease). The impact of vinflunine on PLDH was a 2-3-fold apparent increase in drug clearance and volume of distribution. The mechanism of interaction was explored in vitro, demonstrating that vinflunine is strongly adsorbed on to PLDH vesicles.

A  dose-finding  and  pharmacokinetic  study  of  IV  vinflunine  combined  with  PLDH  in  a  variety  of advanced solid tumours was carried out (L00070 IN 1 08 J1). The study recommended two schedules for dose adjustments if combining vinflunine with PLDH. In schedule 1, the vinflunine recommended dose is 250 mg/m² together with PLDH 25 mg/m² both given on day 1 every 21 Days. In schedule 2, the vinflunine recommended dose is 170 mg/m² given on days 1 and 8 together with PLDH 25 mg/m² given on day 1, every 21 days.

Other  studies  indicate  that  only  strong  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  such  as  Itraconazole,  Ritonavir  and ketoconazole are likely to inhibit the metabolism of vinflunine. Taxanes compounds (i.e.: paclitaxel and docetaxel) also inhibit metabolism of vinflunine but to a lesser degree. The effect of ketoconazole was confirmed in vivo in a specific Phase I study. Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg/day for 8 days) resulted in an increase of 31% in dose normalised AUCinf of vinflunine, a 31% increase in dose-normalized AUC (0-96h) of DVFL and a 49% increase in dose-normalized AUC (0-168h) of DVFL.  Co-administration  of  ketoconazole  at  400  mg  per  day  for  8  days  did  not  affect  the  dosenormalized Cmax of a 20 minute IV infusion of vinflunine but increased the dose-normalized Cmax for DVFL by 17%. The MTD of vinflunine is defined as 160 mg/m² when co-administered with 400 mg of ketoconazole.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

The most common reasons for discontinuation were progressive disease (54.9%) in the vinflunine + BSC group and completion of the 18-week period (29.1%) and progressive disease (26.5%) in the BSC group.

13.1% of  the  patients  discontinued  the  treatment  after  one  cycle.  25.3%  of  the  patients  in  the  280 mg/m² group received only one cycle versus 5.1% of the patients in the 320 mg/m² group. The main reasons for discontinuation after cycle 1 reported in the 280 mg/m² group were progression (20.0% of the patients) and related AEs (22.2% of the patients)

53  TCCU  patients  treated  with  vinflunine  stopped  their  treatment  due  to  treatment  related  adverse events. The table below lists the reasons for discontinuation and the number of patients discontinued in each treatment arm.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The overall patient exposure to vinflunine was considered adequate for safety assessment. In TCCU patients, the main toxicities of vinflunine were neutropenia, anaemia, constipation and asthenia/fatigue. All of these adverse events are considered class effects of the vinca alkaloids. The safety  profile  of  vinflunine  was  similar  for  both  TCCU  and  Non-TCCU  populations,  except  for constipation,  infection  with  severe  neutropenia,  stomatitis/mucositis  and  febrile  neutropenia.  The safety  profile  of  vinflunine  in  both  dosages  groups  (280  mg/m²/320  mg/m²)  was  comparable  with slightly  higher  rates  of  AEs  were  seen  in  the  280  mg/m²  group.  The  most  frequent  adverse  event leading to death in all patients treated with vinflunine was pulmonary embolism. These deaths were judged not to be related to the study medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following concerns were raised with regards to the clinical safety data submitted as part of this dossier.

1. The CHMP requested that the applicant provide a discussion on rarer adverse events. The applicant was  also  asked  to  comment  on  the  type  and  incidence  of  adverse  events  other  than  'common', particularly those related to the study medication.  From the data submitted. The CHMP noted no new safety concerns. The data was considered to clarify the acceptable safety prolife of vinflunine in the proposed indication.

2.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  incidence of  SAE  in  subjects  treated  with  vinflunine,  by commenting  on  the  observed  frequencies  of  SAE  in  the  vinflunine  +  BSC  arm,  comparing  the observed  safety  profile  of  vinflunine  with  other  vinca  alkaloids,  in  particular,  cardiovascular  and peripheral  neuropathic  AEs,  including  autonomic  neuropathy.  From  the  data  submitted  the  CHMP considered that there were no new safety concerns. The data were considered to clarify the acceptable safety prolife of vinflunine in the proposed indication.

3.    The  CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  provide  a  full  and  detailed  discussion  on  QTc  interval prolongation, in line with current guidelines (CPMP/986/96 points to consider: The assessment of the potential for QT interval prolongation by non-cardiovascular medicinal products).

Based  on  the  applicant's  response,  in  phase  I  studies,  more  than  100  ECGs  were  collected  and carefully measured. QTc prolongation was not observed except in one subject whose change in QTc from baseline was found to be 67 msec at distance (~167 h) from the infusion of vinflunine at the time when plasma concentration of vinflunine had decreased to a low level of 3.7 ng/mL (higher plasma concentrations  were  not  associated  with  QTc  prolongation  in  this  subject).In  the  clinical  studies database,  no  adverse  event  of  the  type  usually  associated  with  torsade  de  pointes  was  observed.  In addition to this, vinflunine belongs to the class of vinca alkaloids which is not known to be associated with  QTc  interval  prolongation  and  its  associated  pro-arrhythmic  events.  However,  the  CHMP considered that there were 3 cases in the study CA183001 with a QT interval prolonged that had not been sufficiently justified. Five cases in the same study had a ∆ QTcF between 31 and 60 msec and one subject had a ∆ QTcF exceeding 60 msec. Despite these increases being lower than 500 msec, it could be considered as a safety problem to be taken into account.

The CHMP therefore agreed that an amendment to the SPC wording be made regarding the potential QT interval prolongation at sections 4.4,  and 4.8 of the SPC.

The concomitant use of Javlor with others QT/QTc interval prolonging drugs should be avoided (see SPC section 4.4)

Cardiac effects are a known class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Myocardial infarction or ischemia were experienced by 0.6% of the patients and most of them had a pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. One patient died after myocardial infarction and another one due to a cardiopulmonary arrest. Few QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine. (see SPC section 4.8)

When consulted in this matter, the SAG-Oncology noted that the observed toxicity was considered as significant although the possible QTc effect did not raise particular concerns in the light of the overall toxicity profile and the applied indication, and overall agreed that due to the large unmet need in the applied indication, the safety profile did not raise particular concerns.

4.  A  potential  risk  of  pancreatitis  associated  with  vinorelbine  use  was  recorded.  Therefore,  the Applicant was  asked to discuss whether the risk of pancreatitis should be included in the SPC for Javlor. During vinflunine clinical trials, only 1 patient administered vinflunine injectable experienced pancreatitis NCI-CTC grade 3 (USBMS-C-20060024). This patient's medical history and concomitant drugs  were  considered  to  be  pancreatitis  risk  factors.    Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the rationale to include pancreatitis as a potential side effect was not supported by the available evidence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5. The CHMP  considered it was hard to estimate the magnitude of the tolerability problems, given that  gastrointestinal  grade  3/4  adverse  reactions  were  very  prevalent.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  was asked to provide information about the duration and incidence per treatment cycle, the manageability of constipation with laxatives, as well as the incidence of hospitalizations per treatment cycle. Based on the Applicant's response, the CHMP noted that in general, gastrointestinal adverse events induced by vinflunine were manageable. Out of the 450 TCCU patients treated with VFL, 35 were hospitalized for  constipation  -  40  events  in  total.  18/40  of  these  events  occurred  in  the  phase  III  study.  All  40 events  of  constipation  resolved,  with  a  median  time  to  recovery  of  5  days  either  after  laxative treatments (osmotics and/or stimulants and/or enema) or without any specific treatment.

As  well  as  dose  reduction  information  following  the  advent  of  constipation,  section  4.2  of  the proposed SPC states ' In order to prevent constipation, laxatives and dietary measures including oral hydration are recommended from day 1 to day 5 or 7 after each vinflunine administration (see section 4.4) '.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded that  overall, VFL induced constipation was non-cumulative, reversible, of relatively short duration and relative free of major clinical consequences.

When consulted in this matter, the SAG-Oncology noted that the observed toxicity was considered as significant  although no particular concerns were raised in  light of the overall toxicity profile and the applied indication, and overall agreed that due to the large unmet need in the applied indication, the safety profile did not raise particular concerns.

## The SPC also includes the following:

The concomitant use of potent inhibitors  or  potent  inducers  of  CYP3A4  with vinflunine  should  be avoided(see section 4.5 of the SPC).

When infused through a peripheral vein, vinflunine can induce Grade 1 (22%of the patients, 14.1% of the cycles), Grade 2 (11.0% of the patients, 6.8% of the cycles) or Grade 3 (0.8% of the patients, 0.2% of  the  cycles)  venous  irritation.  All  cases  resolved  rapidly  without  treatment  discontinuation. Instructions for administration should be followed as described in section 6.6.

Men and women with reproductive potential must use an effective method of contraception during the treatment and up to 3 months after the last vinflunine administration (see section 4.6 of the SPC).

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience any adverse reaction with a potential impact on the ability to perform these activities (e.g. dizziness, syncope are common). (See SPC section 4.7 of the SPC)

The main toxic effect due to an overdose with vinflunine is bone marrow suppression with a risk of severe infection. There is no known antidote for vinflunine overdose. In case of overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions should be closely monitored. Other appropriate measures should be taken, such as blood transfusions, administration of antibiotics and growth factors (see SPC section 4.9 of the SPC).

## 3.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  is  one  unresolved  quality  issues,  which  do  not  have  any impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. This will be addressed as part of the followup measure post-authorisation.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Vinflunine  distribution  in  rats  by  imaging  techniques  illustrated  that  the  compound  levels  in  lungs, kidneys, liver, salivary and endocrine glands, and gastrointestinal tract were rapidly higher than those in blood.

Preclinical data revealed moderate to severe neutropenia and mild anaemia, in all species tested, with liver toxicity in dogs and rats (characterized by dose-dependent increases in liver transaminases and hepatic necrosis/hepatocellular alterations at high doses). These toxic effects were dose-related, and fully or partially reversible following a 1-month recovery period. Vinflunine did not induce peripheral neuropathy in animals.

Vinflunine has shown to be clastogenic (induces chromosome breakage) in the in vivo micronucleus test  in  rat  as  well  as  mutagenic  and  clastogenic  in  mouse  lymphoma  assay  (without  metabolic activation).

## The carcinogenic potential of vinflunine has not been studied.

In  the  reproduction  studies,  vinflunine  appeared  to  be  embryolethal  and  teratogenic  in  rabbits  and teratogenic in rats.

During  the  pre-and  post-natal  development  study  in  rat,  vinflunine  induced  malformations  of  the uterus and vagina in 2 females, and adversely affected mating and/or ovule implantation and markedly lowered the number of concepti.

## Efficacy

One phase III and two phase II trials support the use of Javlor for treatment of advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium as second-line therapy after failure of a prior platinumcontaining regimen.

In  the  two  multi-centre  open-label,  single-arm  phase  II  clinical  trials  a  total  of  202  patients  were treated with vinflunine.

In  the  multi-centre,  open-label  controlled  phase  III  clinical  trial,  253  patients  were  randomised  to treatment with vinflunine + BSC (best supportive care) and 117 patients to the BSC arm.

The  median  overall  survival  was  6.9  months  (vinflunine  +  BSC)  vs.  4.6  months  (BSC),  but  the difference  did  not  reach  statistical  significance;  hazard  ratio  0.88  (95%  CI  0.69,1.12).  However  a statistically  significant  effect  was  seen  on  progression-free  survival.  Median  PFS  was  3.0  months (vinflunine + BSC) vs 1.5 months (BSC) (p=0.0012).

In addition a pre-specified multivariate analysis performed on the ITT population demonstrated that vinflunine had a statistically significant treatment effect (p=0.036) on overall survival when prognostic factors (PS, visceral involvement, alkaline phosphatases, haemoglobin, pelvic irradiation) were taken into  consideration;  hazard  ratio  0.77  (95%  CI  0.61,  0.98).  A  statistically  significant  difference  on overall survival (p=0.040) was also seen in the eligible population (which excluded 13 patients with clinically significant protocol violations at baseline who were not eligible for treatment); hazard ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 0.99). This is considered the most relevant population for the efficacy analysis, as it most closely reflects the population intended for treatment.

Efficacy was demonstrated in both patients with and without prior cisplatin use.

In the eligible population, the subgroup analyses according to the prior cisplatin use versus BSC on overall survival (OS) showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.64 (0.40 - 1.03); p=0.0821] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR (95% CI) = [0.80 (0.60 - 1.06); p=0.1263] in the presence of prior cisplatin. When adjusted on prognostic factors, the analyses of OS in the subgroups of patients without or with prior cisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.53 (0.32 - 0.88); p=0.0143] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.70 (0.53 0.94); p=0.0174], respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  subgroup  analyses of  prior  cisplatin  use  versus  BSC  for  progression free  survival  (PFS),  the results were: HR (95% CI) = [0.55 (0.34 - 0.89); p=0.0129] in the absence of prior cisplatin, and a HR (95%  CI)  =  [0.64  (0.48  -  0.85);  p=0.0040]  in  the  presence  of  prior  cisplatin.  When  adjusted  on prognostic factors,  the  analyses  of  PFS  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  without  or  with  prior  cisplatin showed a HR (95% CI) = [0.51(0.31 - 0.86); p=0.0111] and a HR (95% CI) = [0.63(0.48 - 0.84); p=0.0016], respectively.

## Safety

The most frequent treatment-related adverse reactions reported in the two phase II and one phase III trials  in  patients  with  transitional  cell  carcinoma  of  the  urothelium  (450  patients  treated  with vinflunine) were haematological disorders, mainly neutropenia, anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia; gastrointestinal disorders, especially constipation, anorexia, nausea, stomatitis/mucositis,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,    diarrhoea;  nervous  system  disorders,  especially peripheral sensory neuropathy; skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, especially alopecia; musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  especially  myalgia;  general  disorders,  especially asthenia/fatigue, injection site reactions, pyrexia;  and investigations, especially weight decrease.

Common treatment-related adverse events included neutropenic infection, viral, bacterial and fungal infections, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, dehydration, insomnia, syncope, headache, dizziness, neuralgia, dysgeusia, neuropathy, ear pain, tachycardia, hypertension, vein thrombosis, hypotension, dyspnoea,  cough,  ileus,  dysphagia, buccal disorders, dyspepsia, cutaneous reactions, pruritus, hyperhydrosis, arthralgia, back pain, pain in jaw, muscular weakness, pain in extremities, bone pain, mysculoskeletain pain, chest pain, chills, and oedemea.

## Blood and lymphatic system disorders

Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 54.6% of patients. Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were less  common  (respectively  17.3  and  4.9%).  Febrile  neutropenia  defined  as  ANC  &lt; 1,000/mm3and fever ≥ 38.5°C  of  unknown  origin  without  clinically  microbiologically  documented  infection  (NCI CTC version 2.0) was observed in 6.7% of patients. Infection with grade 3/4 neutropenia is observed in  4.2%  of  patients.  Overall  6  patients  (1.3%  of  the  treated  population)  died  from  infection  as  a complication occurring during neutropenia.

## Gastrointestinal disorders

Constipation is a class effect of the vinca alkaloids: 15.3% of patients experienced severe constipation during treatment with vinflunine. Grade 3/4 ileus reported in 2.7% of patients was reversible when managed by medical care. Constipation is managed by medical care (see section 4.4 of the SPC).

## Nervous system disorders

Sensory peripheral neuropathy is a class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Grade 3 was experienced by 0.2% patients. All resolved during the study.

## Cardiovascular disorders

Cardiac effects are a known class effect of the vinca alkaloids. Myocardial infarction or ischemia were experienced by 0.6% of the patients and most of them had a pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. One patient died after myocardial infarction and another one due to a cardiopulmonary arrest. Few QT interval prolongations have been observed after the administration of vinflunine.

## Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders

## Dyspnoea occurred in 3.6% of the patients but was rarely severe (Grade 3/4: 0.4%).

Bronchospam  was  reported  in  one  patient  treated  with  vinflunine  for  a  different  setting  from  the indication.

## Eye disorders:

One case of vision blurred and visual acuity reduced have been reported.

## Endocrine disorders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three cases of suspected Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) have been reported in patients treated with Vinflunine for a different setting from the indication.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (See SPC section 4.8)

Special precautions for disposal and other handling are adequately reflected in the SPC (see section 6.6).

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The efficacy results are consistent across endpoint and a difference in survival was observed based on a  number  of  secondary  analyses,  particularly  in  the  eligible  analysis  and  following  adjustment  for covariates.  Secondary  endpoints  all  favour  the  vinflunine  arm,  supporting  the  conclusion  that  the product  is  efficacious.  No  cumulative  toxicities  were  apparent  in  patients  with  TCCU  receiving vinflunine and in general, adverse events induced by vinflunine were transient and manageable.

In the eligible population, a difference in median of about 2 months survival favouring the VFL+BSC arm was observed (6.9 months vs. 4.3 months). A stratified log-rank test showed a survival difference between the 2 arms (HR 0.78 [0.61, 0.99] p=0.0403). Furthermore, a significant treatment effect of vinflunine  (p=0.036)  on  overall  survival  in  a  multivariate  Cox  analysis  conducted  in  the  ITT population was seen. Vinflunine reduced the risk of death by 23% compared to BSC with a hazard ratio  of  0.77  (95%  CI:  0.61-0.98).  Sensitivity  analyses  of  PFS  showed  consistency,  confirming  the benefit of VFL + BSC treatment.

The  pivotal  study  failed  to  achieve  its  primary  endpoint,  apparently  because  of  the  inclusion  of ineligible  patients  who  had  not  failed  prior  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  However,  these  patients with  long  survivals  are  not  representative  of  the  targeted  population  and  might  explain  why  the treatment effect did not reach significance in the primary analysis of the ITT population. The main toxicities of VFL were neutropenia (79.6%), anaemia (92.8%), constipation (54.9%) and asthenia/fatigue (55.3%), all these adverse events being class effects of the vinca alkaloids. The main dose limiting toxicity is neutropenia.

There is currently no standard therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, whose disease has  progressed  after  or  during  a  prior  platinum-containing  regimen.  These  patients  have  a  median survival of approximately 4 months and a poor prognosis.

The CHMP considered that the data presented support the conclusion that vinflunine has meaningful activity  in  this  group of  patients  and therefore  fulfils  an  unmet  clinical  need. The  magnitude of the efficacy  effects  observed  with  vinflunine  are  comparable  to  those  observed  and  considered  as clinically meaningful with other anticancer drugs in different and comparable settings. This effect is supported by the positive results of vinflunine achieved on disease symptoms and all the secondary endpoints  (PFS,  ORR,  DC).  Patient  exposure  to  vinflunine  is  considered  adequate  for  safety assessment. The main toxicities of vinflunine were class effects of the vinca alkaloids. No cumulative toxicities  were  apparent  and  in  general,  adverse  events  induced  by  vinflunine  were  transient  and manageable.  Overall,  the  evidence  supports  a  positive  benefit  risk  balance  for  vinflunine  in  adult patients with advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen.

A minority of CHMP members expressed a divergent view whereby the positive benefit-risk balance for  Javlor  was  not  considered  to  be  established  in  the  applied  indication  because  of  insufficient evidence of efficacy in the presence of significant toxicity. In particular:

- No difference in the pre-specified primary analysis of overall survival was observed for vinflunine compared to  best  standard  of  care  in  the  intent-to-treat  population,  based  on  the  single  pivotal study provided.
- Where  the  confirmatory  evidence  is  provided  by  one  pivotal  study  only,  this  study  has  to  be exceptionally compelling and special attention should be paid to internal and external validity. In the case of vinflunine, a difference in overall survival was only observed in post hoc exploratory analyses, excluding patients from the intent-to-treat population. However, potential biases arising from these specific exclusions, have not been adequately addressed.
- Notwithstanding  the  methodological  flaws  and  potential  biases  associated  with  exploratory analyses and post hoc exclusion of patients, the results observed from such analyses were of very modest clinical  significance  in  terms  of  overall  survival  or  indeed  any  other  clinically  relevant endpoint, and the results lacked consistency across different analyses and subsets. Furthermore, in patients  who  were  adequately  pre-treated  with  cisplatin  and  who  represent  the  majority  of  the target EU population, vinflunine showed an even lower level of activity compared to those treated with non-standard platinum compounds.
- Treatment  with  vinflunine  was  associated  with  significant  toxicity  including  severe  or  lifethreatening neutropenia, anaemia, constipation and asthenia/fatigue. Six study drug related deaths were  recorded,  in  relation  to  myelosuppression,  septicaemia,  cardio-pulmonary  arrest,  infection associated with bone marrow depletion and lethal myocardial infarction.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Javlor  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
