## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for loxapine (pre-dispensed inhalation powder), the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) from the literature including a case report with very strong evidence (confirmed DRESS diagnosis with RegiSCAR 6 and a positive skin test for loxapine), the PRAC considers a causal relationship between loxapine (predispensed inhalation powder) and DRESS at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing loxapine (pre-dispensed inhalation powder) should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for loxapine (pre-dispensed inhalation powder) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing for loxapine (pre-dispensed inhalation powder) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
