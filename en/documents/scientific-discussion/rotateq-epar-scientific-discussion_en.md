## 3.1 Introduction

Sanofi Pasteur MSD submitted a complete and independent application (in accordance with Article 8.3 of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended)  for  RotaTeq,  a  live,  oral,  pentavalent  rotavirus  vaccine consisting of five human-bovine reassortant rotavirus strains designated as G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1.

Rotavirus  infection  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  acute  gastroenteritis  (GE)  in  infants  and  young children throughout the world. The incidence of rotavirus infections is highest in children between 6 and 24 months of age.

Rotavirus  is  transmitted  mainly  by  the  fecal-oral  route  through  close  person-to-person  contact  and through fomites. After the incubation period (2 -4 days), there is an abrupt onset of watery diarrhoea and vomiting, which can result in (severe) dehydration. Other common clinical findings include fever and  abdominal  distress.  Viral  shedding  peaks  at  about  day  3  of  illness  and  then  declines.  The symptoms typically last from 3 to 9 days.

A  recent  review  of  epidemiological  data  estimated  that,  worldwide,  rotavirus  causes  annually approximately  111  million  episodes  of  gastroenteritis  requiring  home  care,  25  million  clinic  visits, 2 million  hospitalizations,  and  352,000-592,000  deaths  in  children  aged  less  than  5  years.  New surveillance  data  suggest  that  the  mortality  rate  is  now  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  608,000  annual deaths worldwide.

The rotavirus belongs to the Reoviridae family of viruses. Rotaviruses carry three important antigenic specificities: group, subgroup and serotype. Group specificity is mainly conferred by viral protein VP6 (inner  capsid  protein);  subgroup  specificity  is  also  determined  by  VP6  and  has  been  used  for characterizing  the  antigenic  properties  of  various  strains  in  epidemiologic  surveys.  The  serotype specificities  are  independently  determined  by  the  outer  VP4  and  VP7  proteins.  A  binary  system  of rotavirus  classification  was  established,  the  VP7  serotype  is  designated  as  G  serotype  (VP7  is  a glycoprotein) whereas the VP4 serotype is designated as P serotype (VP4 is protease sensitive).

In RotaTeq, all reassortants are composed of the bovine rotavirus strain WC3 (Wistar Calf 3) genome background. Four of the reassortants express one of the VP7 human outer capsid glycoproteins (G1, G2, G3, and G4 serotype), along with the VP4 bovine attachment protein from the P7[5] WC3 strain. The fifth reassortant expresses the VP4 human attachment protein of P1[8] serotype specificity, while retaining the VP7 bovine outer capsid protein of the G6 WC3 strain.

The prevalence of HRV in different regions within the same country can differ during the same year and the prevalence of individual serotypes in the same region can show a yearly change. There is no correlation between disease severity and serotype.

To  date,  the  only  licensed  rotavirus  vaccine  has  been  a  tetravalent  (G1-4)  RRV  rhesus/human reassortant  vaccine  marketed  as  RotaShield  by  Wyeth-Lederle  in  1998.  Less  than  a  year  after licensure,  the  vaccine  was  withdrawn  as  it  became  clear  that  there  was  an  increased  risk  of intussusception (IS) during the first two weeks after vaccination. As a consequence, occurrence of IS has  become  an  important  safety  parameter  in  the  evaluation  of  any  new  rotavirus  vaccine.  The majority of the IS cases occurred in infants who were 4 months old or older at first vaccination.

## 3.2 Quality aspects

## Active Substance

## · Manufacture

## Manufacturing process

The active substance is manufactured at West Point, Pennsylvania, USA.

Each monovalent vaccine bulk is produced by expanding Vero cells from a frozen vial through a series of expansion steps. Cell expansion is performed by propagating Vero cells, from the manufacturer's working cell bank (WCB), in single-use plastic tissue culture ware. The cells are initially propagated in  tissue  culture  flasks,  but  are  then  expanded  into  multiple-layer  tissue  cultureware  called  cell factories (CFs). In this way, Vero cells are initially expanded from a vial of cryopreserved Vero cells up to manufacturing scale.

The cells are then inoculated with aliquots of rotavirus stock seed and harvested to yield harvested virus fluids (HVF), which are frozen and stored at ≤ -60 °C until the next process step is initiated . The HVF is thawed and mixed with a culture media solution, and then clarified by microfiltration. This filtrate  is  concentrated  by  ultrafiltration  and  then  sterile  filtered  through  a  0.2 μ m  membrane.  The resulting filtered virus fluids (FVF) are frozen and stored at ≤ -60 °C. FVF is thawed and redispensed into aliquots appropriately sized for use in the RotaTeq formulation and filling process. These aliquots, the redispensed virus fluids (RVF), are frozen and stored at ≤ -60 °C in stainless steel containers until needed.

Each monovalent vaccine bulk (G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1) is prepared independently. All vaccine bulk intermediates are produced under aseptic manufacturing conditions using pre-sterilized equipment and filter-sterilized culture media. At the end of production, all vaccine bulks are subjected to a final 0.2μ m-sterile-filtration  step.    Subsequently,  all  materials  contacting  the  vaccine  bulk  are  pre-sterilized and all open aseptic manipulations are performed under Class 100 conditions.

## Control of materials

## Virus Seed Lots

At the lab of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, USA), bovine and human rotavirus were allowed to form reassortants and antisera for VP7 and VP4 for the bovine and human strains was used to inhibit the growth of the parent viruses in order to allow growth of the reassortant. The purpose of co-infection was to allow for exchange of the RNA segment encoding for either the major  (VP7)  or  the  minor  (VP4)  surface  protein  of  a  human  rotavirus  for  the  corresponding  RNA segments  of  the  bovine  WC3  rotavirus.  Individual  progeny  viruses  were  plaque  purified  and  their RNA segments were examined by electropherotyping to confirm that the desired genetic composition was achieved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The reassortant  viruses  were  transferred  from  the  Children's  Hospital  of  Philadelphia  to  Merck. Master  seeds  for  the  five  reassortants  were  produced  in  Vero  cell  cultures  that  had  been  expanded from  the  pilot-scale  WCB.  The  inoculated  cultures  were  then  harvested  and  frozen  to  produce  the harvested  master  seeds.  The  harvested  master  seeds  were  thawed,  clarified  by  microfiltration,  and frozen, resulting in the microfiltered master seed. Finally, a portion of each of the microfiltered master seeds was thawed and refrozen to produce the final master seeds, which are used in the subsequent production of stock seeds.

Pilot-scale stock seeds for the five reassortants were manufactured independently by a single passage of the appropriate master seed in Vero cell cultures that had been expanded from the pilot-scale WCB. The  pilot-scale  stock  seeds  were  used  for  production  of  material  for  clinical  lots  and  process validations  lots  (used  to  demonstrate  clinical  consistency),  and  are  used  for  manufacture  of  early market supply. The manufacturing-scale stock seed process and the manufacturing scale stock seeds will be used from the point that pilot-scale stock seeds are consumed. The manufacturing-scale stock seed  process  differs  from  that  used  at  pilot-scale  due  to  the  increased  batch  size  of  full-scale manufacturing.

## Cell substrate

The Vero cell line was derived from the kidney of a normal adult African green monkey in 1962 by T. Yasumura  and  Y.  Kawakita  at  the  Chiba  University  in  Chiba,  Japan.  In  1964,  the  cell  line  was transferred  to  the  Laboratory  of  Tropical  Virology,  National  Institute  of  Allergy  and  Infectious Diseases, NIH, USA by B. Simizu. The cells were maintained in Medium 199 supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell line was then submitted to the Animal Cell Culture Collection. Vero cells for the manufacture of the rotavirus vaccine bulks were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) as Continuous Cell Line 81 (CCL81).

The Vero cells  were  expanded  to  create  a  WCB;  the  cell  bank  was  tested  for  egg  safety,  cell  line identity,  absence  of  retroviruses  by  reverse  transcriptase  and  electron  microscopy,  animal  safety  in adult  and  suckling  mice,  rabbit  and  guinea  pig,  and  tumorigenicity  in  nude  mice.  Cell  fluids  were tested for sterility and mycoplasma.

The  pilot-scale  WCB  was  used  to  support  pilot-scale  stock  seed  production,  Phase  III  clinical  lot manufacture, process validation, and early manufacture of marketed material.

The manufacturing-scale WCB process will be used for all future WCB production.  The WCB was tested for cell line identity, sterility, mycoplasma, animal safety, tissue culture safety, tuberculosis in vitro and egg safety.

## Reagents

All  raw  materials  and  culture  media  are  controlled  and  tested  to  standards  appropriate  for  their intended use; selected tests and specifications are provided.

## Controls of critical steps / Process validation

The controls that have been implemented for routine manufacturing represent a subset of the critical process parameters (CPPs) or critical quality attributes (CQAs) that were used for process validation. Any deviation from the parameters in the routine-manufacturing control set will require investigation. These parameters are also part of the drug substance specifications.

Process validation lots were manufactured to demonstrate that the vaccine bulk manufacturing process conformed  to  the  validation  specifications  according  to  established  EMEA  guidelines.    Process validation was successfully completed for each of the five reassortants - G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1).  All

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lots met all CPPs and CQAs; therefore, validation of the vaccine bulk manufacturing process has been successfully completed.

A second sterile filtration step on FVF may be performed following specific unplanned events. This process  was  prospectively  validated  using  data  from  six  refiltered  FVF  lots  that  had  previously undergone one complete sterile filtration.

## Manufacturing process development

The development process was used for the manufacture of monovalent vaccine bulks for Phase I and II clinical studies (Protocols 001-005).  This process used the pre-master seed for inoculation of Vero cell  cultures  to  produce  monovalent  vaccine  bulks.    Pre-master  seed  was  also  expanded  to  produce new master seed, in support of long-term, large-scale vaccine manufacture.

In the final manufacturing process, the culture medium was supplemented with 1% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS) to improve cell-expansion-process performance. This process was implemented at pilot scale and manufacturing scale, which differs in scale but not in operating parameters. This process was used  to  manufacture  rotavirus  monovalent  bulks  in  support  of  Phase  III  clinical  study  monovalent vaccine bulks used to manufacture pentavalent vaccine in Protocols 006, 007 and 009.

## · Characterisation and specifications

RotaTeq is a combination of five human-bovine reassortant rotavirus strains, designated as G1, G2, G3,  G4,  and  P1,  respectively.  All  reassortants  are  composed  of  the  bovine  rotavirus  strain  WC3 (P7[5], G6) genome background expressing human outer capsid proteins.

RNA electrophoretic migration patterns confirmed the parental origin of the RNA genome segments as being from either the original bovine strain (WC3) or the WI79 original human strain.

Each of the 5 vaccine reassortants was sequenced and a primary amino acid structure deduced from the obtained sequence. Differences between the sequence of either the bovine or human parent and the reassortants were detailed. For the G1-G4 reassortants there was 97% sequence homology.

The genetic stability of the reassortant was monitored for the master seed through production level passage by complete sequence analysis of the 5 reassortants at the two extremes of processing time. Very  few  differences  in  the  overall  sequence  were  identified  which  are  attributable  to  either  the detection of dimorphic bases or the presence of two RNA variants in the sample.

The presence, identity and content of the reassortant rotavirus strains in each of the individual vaccine bulks were confirmed by assaying samples using the Rotavirus Multivalent Quantitative-Polymerase Chain  Reaction-Based  Potency  Assay  (M-QPA).  In  addition,  the  reassortants  were  characterized physically, biochemically and biologically.

The physical characterisation of the vaccine particle measured the amount of infectious triple (protein) layered virus and the amount of non-infectious double-layered virus particles. The majority of the five monovalent  virus  vaccines  have  the  majority  of  the  particles  in  the  double-layered  state  (noninfectious). The norm for cultured rotavirus is that the majority of the virus is in the double-layered condition.

The  biochemical  characterisation  measured  the  total  protein  for  each  of  the  5  strains  and  each determination  used  5  production  lots.  There  were  some  minor  differences  between  the  reassortant types, but these were not significant. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting showed that the protein profile for each reassortant over a number of batches was consistent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As vaccine bulks contain both rotavirus proteins and Vero cell components, the amount of rotavirusspecific  antigen  in  the  rotavirus  bulks  was  determined.  In  general,  there  was  no  link  between  viral antigen content and potency but there was a good link between viral antigen content and total protein content, suggesting that viral protein makes up a consistent percentage of the total protein content.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to determine the number of viral genomes present  in  process  validation  and  production  samples.  Overall,  the  amount  of  genomes/ml  of  all vaccine lots analyzed, indicated consistency in the manufacturing across the different lots.

The  biological  characterisation  was  carried  out  using  polyclonal  antibodies  generated  against  each strain. Cross neutralisation was attempted with the antibodies and the results confirmed that the G1-G4 strains were immunogenically similar, due to the fact that they only differed in their VP7 protein, and that the P1 strain was distinct from these.

The initial  interaction  of  rotavirus  strains  with Nacetylneuraminic (sialic)  acid  residues  on  the  cell surface  correlates  with  the  VP4  genotype  specificity.  The  five  reassortant  rotavirus  strains  from process validation lots were shown to be sialic acid-independent.

Process-related  residuals  arise  from  the  vaccine  bulk  manufacturing  processes.    Residuals  derived from the host cell substrate include proteins and Vero cell DNA. Residuals from medium components include bovine serum, trypsin, and chymotrypsin.

For the Vero cell DNA, a specification of 35 µg/dose was established, based on data supporting that orally administered DNA was on the order of 10,000 times less likely to enter cells as compared to parenteral  administered  DNA.  It  is  also  found  unlikely  that  rotaviruses  would  incorporate  cellular DNA.  Specifications were set based upon manufacturing capability.

For  the  bovine  serum,  procedures  have  been  implemented  to  minimize  the  concentration  of  bovine serum  proteins  carried  through  to  the  drug  product.    BSA  was  measured  for  a  series  of  process validation  and  production  lots  and  shown  to  be  at  very  low  levels  relative  to  many  parenternally administered vaccines.

During the vaccine bulk manufacturing process, porcine trypsin solution is added to ensure efficient cleavage of the VP4 spike; cleavage of this viral protein is necessary for infection.

Quality control testing of the active substance is performed at specified stages on the monovalent vaccine bulks. The testing scheme confirms the absence of extraneous agents, verifies potency and identity, and provides a measure of quality and process consistency.

The potency of the product was measured initially by a plaque assay.  The applicant then developed the M-QPA.  The M-QPA is the key potency assay for the active substance/finished product.  Briefly, Vero cells are incubated with dilutions of the unknown potency pentavalent vaccine and at the same time  duplicate  Vero  cells  are  incubated  with  a  pentavalent  virus  standard.  The  PCR  method  uses primers and probes specific to the VP7 gene (genome segment 9) of each rotavirus reassortant strain. The probes and primers for each strain do not cross react with other strains of rotavirus reassortants. The M-QPA assay result is related to the pentavalent standard which in turn were originally evaluated by the plaque assay.

The assays used in the testing of the active substance were adequately validated.

The control rotavirus pentavalent vaccine standard for the M-QPA assay is proposed as a reference standard.  This is a final filled container batch manufactured as part of clinical lots manufacture. This lot  was  filled  into  glass  vials  and  frozen  and  stored  at -60°C.  Future  reference  standards  will  be evaluated against the pentavalent 'gold standard,' which was formulated with process validation bulk retains and stored in liquid nitrogen (vapor phase). The 'gold standard' was manufactured by the same process intended for marketed product. The potency of the 'gold standard' was calibrated to a vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lot  used  in  the  end-expiry  potency  study  (Protocol  007)  in  order  to  establish  a  bridge  between  the release potency and the expiry potency of marketed product.

## · Stability

Formal stability  studies  for  three  vaccine  bulk  intermediates  (HVF,  FVF,  and  RVF)  held  at  -80  to -60 °C were initiated in 2001 and 2002. All stability study lots were prepared at manufacturing scale in the production facility to be used for licensed product. The stability studies were conducted using three lots of vaccine bulk for each of the five reassortants and for each type of bulk intermediate. Stability results for these lots of vaccine bulk are available through the 36-month time point for HVF, FVF and RVF;  at  these  time  points,  all  results  met  the  stability  specifications.  The  duration  of  the  stability studies at -80 to -60 °C is 5 years for HVF, 11 years for FVF, and 5 years for RVF.

Data  will  continue  to  be  collected  and  analyzed  until  the  end  of  the  stability  studies  in  all  cases. Annual stability data in support of the bulk intermediate shelf-life will be provided.

## Medicinal Product

The formulation for RotaTeq consists of stabilizer solution containing sucrose, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, sodium hydroxide, and polysorbate-80.redispensed virus fluids (G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1), and Rotavirus Diluent, added in appropriate proportions to meet target potencies.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

## Formulation development

Several formulations were used during the development of RotaTeq. The initial vaccine formulation was  stored  frozen  and  required  the  subject  to  be  pre-fed  to  neutralize  gastric  acid  prior  to  oral administration.  Further  development  resulted  in  a  formulation,  which  enabled  a  2 -8 °C  stable, buffered,  fully  liquid  rotavirus  vaccine  without  the  need  for  reconstitution.  Two  different  dose volumes of the latter formulation and one dose volume of a related vaccine formulation (with higher buffer levels) were evaluated in Phase I/II clinical trials administered under Protocols 001 -005. These studies  ultimately  supported  use  of  a  formulation,  which  is  composed  of  stabilizer  (that  contains sucrose, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, and polysorbate 80), the five reassortant vaccine bulks plus the volume of Rotavirus Diluent. Sodium hydroxide is used to adjust the pH. This formulation was evaluated  in  Phase  III  clinical  trials  administered  under  Protocols  006,  007,  and  009,  and  is  the formulation used for marketed product.

## Manufacturing process development

Minor modifications have been made after each formulation change and prior to the transition to fullscale manufacturing. The differences between the clinical lots made at pilot and manufacturing scale include  changes  in  composition  (increase  in  polysorbate  80)  and  packaging  material  (change  from glass  vials  to  LDPE  oral  dosing  tubes)  that  were  required  as  the  project  progressed  through development.

Process  validation  lots  (used  as  clinical  consistency  lots  under  Protocol  009  and  for  re-supply  of Protocol 006) were manufactured in the Merck manufacturing facility by the process that will be used in production of marketed product. All other lots for clinical trials were produced at pilot scale.

## · Manufacture of the Product

All  finished  product  manufacturing  operations  are  performed  at  Merck  &amp;  Co.,  Inc,  West  Point, Pennsylvania, USA. Testing upon importation is performed by MSD B.V, Haarlem, The Netherlands.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A calculated amount of Rotavirus Diluent is added to the stabilizer solution and the contents are mixed to prepare the formulation buffer.  The quantity to be added is determined from the potencies of the individual RVFs that will be used in formulation.

The formulation buffer is mixed to ensure homogeneity, and then sterile filtered into a sterile receiving tank. The five reassortant vaccine bulks, plus the Rotavirus Diluent are then added to the formulation buffer.

The  RVF  are  connected  to  the  formulation  buffer  tank  using  aseptic  connections,  added  to  the formulation buffer, and mixed to prepare the FFB. After mixing, samples of the FFB are collected for sterility testing.

Filling  and  sealing  of  the  oral  dosing  tubes  (ODTs)  take  place  in  an  aseptic  processing  suite  under Class 100, laminar-flow conditions. The ODTs passed physical and microbial challenge tests designed to test the integrity of the heat sealed closure.

All product-contact equipment is presterilized using validated processes.  The oral dosing tubes are sterilized by gamma irradiation. The Class 100 manufacturing environment is monitored for nonviable particulates and viable organisms.  Surfaces, air, and personnel are tested for viable organisms.

Marketed containers with approved labelling are stored at 2-8 °C until release testing is completed, then the vaccine is shipped to market. Validated, insulated containers that are designed specifically for vaccine shipments are used for shipping vaccine at all stages of distribution.

The consistency of product manufacture for formulation and filling was demonstrated through process validation  using  a  series  of  three  lots.  All  CPPs  and  CQAs  were  met;  the  process  validation demonstrated that RotaTeq can be consistently formulated and filled.

## · Control of excipients

The components of the stabilizer solution are compliant with existing compendial monographs. None of the raw materials included in the stabilizer solution are animal-derived.

Rotavirus Diluent contains a single component of animal origin, cholesterol, which is derived from sheep wool grease, and is considered in compliance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  Via  Human  and  Veterinary Medicinal Products , (EMEA/410/01 rev 2).

## · Product Specification

The final filled container is tested for identity, sterility, potency, appearance, dose uniformity, average deliverable  volume,  pH,  residual  Vero  cell  DNA.  The  potency  specifications  at  release  are  G1 ≥ 2.91 x 10 6 IU/dose, G2 ≥ 4.11 x 10 6 IU/dose, G3 ≥ 3.25 x 10 6 IU/dose, G4 ≥ 5.18 x 10 6 IU/dose and P1 ≥ 3.75 x 10 6 IU/dose.  The  minimum  potency  demonstrated  to  be  efficacious  in  clinical  trials,  final product  stability  losses,  and  assay  variability,  are  used  to  derive  a  lower  release  specification, guaranteeing (with 95% confidence) minimum potency of each rotavirus reassortant type through the shelf-life of the product (24 months).

Batch analysis confirms that the drug product can be produced consistently and within specification.

The reference standard used in the M-QPA is a pentavalent final filled container. The potency of the reference  standard  was  established  through  extensive  replicate  testing  in  the  M-QPA,  against  a reference standard set that consisted of five monovalent bulk preparations -one for each reassortant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

G1,  G2,  G3,  G4,  and  P1.  The  potencies  of  the  five  monovalent  reference  standards  had  been previously established through repeat testing over a 6-month period using a plaque titration method. Future  reference  standards  will  be  evaluated  against  the  pentavalent  'gold  standard,'  which  was formulated with process validation bulk retains and stored in liquid nitrogen (vapor phase). The 'gold standard' was manufactured by the same process intended for marketed product.

## · Adventitious agents and TSE

## Adventitious agents

Cell substrates, virus seeds, and animal-derived raw materials used during manufacture of RotaTeq are tested using validated methods to ensure that extraneous agents are not present in the drug product. The  seed  viruses  are  derived  from  Vero  cell  systems  under  conditions  similar  to  those  used  in monovalent vaccine bulk production.  Raw materials of animal origin are present in the culture media, cell substrates, and virus seeds used to produce the drug substance, final formulated bulks (FFB), and the drug product.  The animal-derived raw materials include: fetal bovine serum (EDQM certificates of  suitability  have  been  provided),  porcine  pancreatic  trypsin  solutions,  cholesterol,  polysorbate-80 (PS-80), and amino acids.  Bovine-derived PS-80 was used to manufacture seeds and early clinical lots; however, plant-derived PS-80 is currently used in the manufacturing process.

With regard to human-derived raw materials, three amino acids derived from human hair are used in the tissue culture medium (LPKM-3, Williams' E Medium) for manufacture of RotaTeq. These amino acids  are  highly-processed  biochemicals  that  are  commonly  present  in  culture  media  used  for manufacturing of live virus vaccine as well as other cell culture and fermentation processes used in the biotechnology industry.

The applicant has put adequate measures (EVCP for pre-master seeds, gamma irradiation of bovine serum and porcine pancreatic trypsin) in place to ensure absence of adventitious agents for the above materials and the virus removal or inactivation steps have been validated.

The  raw  materials  and  excipients  of  animal  origin  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  for  rotavirus vaccine  bulks  are  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  European  Agency  for  the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) guideline, 'Note for Guidance on Minimizing the Risk of Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  Via  Human  and  Veterinary  Medicinal Products' (EMEA 410/01 rev.2) (EMEA TSE Note for Guidance). Details have been given to verify that there is no risk of TSE transmission due to the use of EGF and insulin.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability studies have been conducted for process validation lots and manufacturing development lots. All lots were studied at the proposed long-term storage condition for the vaccine (2-8 °C).

The  stability  studies  for  process  validation  lots  held  at  2 -8 °C,  13-17 °C,  and  23-27 °C  support establishment of loss rates. The loss rates are used in the release model to support a shelf life of 24 months. The requested 24-month shelf life considers the total time from filling to administration of the vaccine.

Real  time  data  from  batches  stored  for  24  months  at  2-8  °C  have  been  submitted.  A  mathematical model  is  used  to  ensure  (with  95%  confidence)  that  the  minimum  potency  for  each  rotavirus reassortant is present throughout the proposed shelf-life (24 months).

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main quality issues were related to the potency assay (M-QPA) (comparability with the plaque assay  and  robustness  of  the  assay),  the  limit  for  residual  Vero  cell  DNA,  justification  of  storage periods  of  intermediates  and  the  proposed  potency  specifications  and  their  relationship  to  vaccine potencies  evaluated  in  Phase  III  studies.    All  quality  issues  hare  been  resolved  and  a  number  of commitments were made by the applicant, to provide further information post-approval.

## 3.3 Non-clinical aspects

## GLP aspects

The repeated-dose toxicity in mice and two definitive studies on Vero cell DNA uptake in rats were conducted under GLP conditions.

## Pharmacology

No  non-clinical  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed.  The  applicant  acknowledges  that  the EMEA  'Note  for  guidance  on  preclinical  pharmacological  and  toxicological  testing  of  vaccines' (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the 'WHO guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines' recommend that immunogenicity studies in animal models be conducted.  However, because a significant body of clinical data was generated prior to the EMEA and WHO guidances were established in 1998 and the lack  of  an  appropriate  animal  model  to  evaluate  the  immunogencitiy  of  RotaTeq,  no  non-clinical pharmacology studies were performed.

## Pharmacokinetics

Experimental studies to demonstrate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active ingredients in RotaTeq have not been performed for any of the component viruses. This is in line with Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95).

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity was assessed within the repeat-dose toxicity study in mice.

- Repeat dose toxicity

A  10-week  oral  toxicity  study  in  mice  was  performed  under  GLP  conditions  to  investigate  the potential toxicity arising from single and repeated oral administration of RotaTeq. During the 64-day study, mice were treated with either a single dose (given on Study Day 1) or three 0.2 mL oral doses (given on study days 1, 29, and 57) of either RotaTeq vehicle or RotaTeq 6.98 x 10 6 infectious units (based on actual potency data)

Complete  necropsies,  histopathology  examinations,  and  assessments  of  haematology  and  serum biochemistry parameters were performed both 7 days after the first dose (to assess acute toxicity) and 7 days after the third dose (to assess toxicity arising from repeated dose administration).

Oral administration of RotaTeq to mice as a single or 3-dose regimen over approximately 10 weeks was well tolerated. There were no treatment-related effects on mortality, physical signs, body weight, food  consumption,  haematological  parameters,  or  serum  biochemical  parameters.  There  were  no treatment-related gross, histopathological or organ weight changes at either the interim (Study Day 8) or terminal (Study Day 64) necropsy.

Based on these findings, the no-effect level had a safety margin relative to the projected human dose of approximately 14-fold.

- Genotoxicity

No genotoxicity studies were conducted; this is in line with CPMP/SWP/465/95.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies are required according CPMP/SWP/465/95.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

The reproductive toxicity potential of RotaTeq was not evaluated. RotaTeq is a paediatric vaccine and is not indicated for use in adults.  No studies were preformed as per CPMP/SWP/465/95 and Note for guidance on preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6).

- Local tolerance

The local tolerance of RotaTeq was not evaluated. RotaTeq is indicated for oral use, there is very little likelihood of skin or ocular irritation in vaccine recipients. This is in line with CPMP/SWP/465/95

- Other toxicity studies

The Vero cell DNA uptake studies in rats were carried out to support the safety of the residual Vero cell DNA levels in RotaTeq, as requested in the Scientific Advice letters.

Vero cell DNA prepared in either PBS or the RotaTeq vehicle and administered as a single 125-µg im or oral-feeding dose to female and male rats produced no treatment-related deaths during the 8-day study.  Vero cell DNA levels were measured and as expected, the DNA uptake level was markedly higher in the im group than in the oral group at each time point and the levels decreased with time for both routes of administration.  The im versus oral ratio was 1.0 x 10 6 .    This  ratio corresponds to an upper  safety  limit  of  about  10,000  µg  (10  mg)  after  converting  the  WHO  recommended  limit  for residual  DNA  from  continuous  cell  lines  in  parenteral  vaccines,  to  a  corresponding  limit  for  oral vaccines.    Thus,  the  results  of  this  animal  study  support  the  safe  administration  of  this  vaccine  to humans, as it found the levels of residual Vero cell DNA present in RotaTeq to be acceptable.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was conducted to assess any possible risks due to normal use of RotaTeq. The ERA was conducted in accordance with the relevant Guideline on environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00/draft) and EU Directives.

Rotaviruses are ubiquitous in nature, and due to the segmented characteristics of the genome, reassortment of rotavirus  genes  occur  naturally.  The  five  reassortant  rotavirus  strains  contained  in  RotaTeq  were generated in cell culture by taking advantage of the natural property of rotaviruses to reassort.

The vaccine strains are shed in a low proportion of subjects and for a brief period of time.  Therefore, there is limited opportunity to be transmitted horizontally.

In the very unlikely event that horizontal transmission would occur, the vaccine-virus strains will not be able to replicate productively in the intestinal tract of humans or most animals.

The vaccine strains are attenuated (presumably during cell culture adaptation) with respect to wild type strains.

In clinical settings where vaccines are usually administered, oral dosing tubes are disposed as infectious biohazard materials and the routine decontamination methods will result in rapid and effective inactivation.

There is no proven animal reservoir capable of sustaining transmission of these viruses and no carriers or vectors have been identified.

The vaccine viruses will not impact the flora or organisms living in sewage treatment plants or the effluent receiving streams and the reassortants are not genetically modified organisms.

## 3.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The vaccine contains five live human-bovine reassortants (HBRV).

- ¾ The bovine strain (WC3) used to make the reassortants was of G6 P7[5] type.
- ¾ The four human strains comprised G1 P1[8], G2 P2[4], G3 P1[8] and G4 P1[8].

From these parent strains, the five reassortants in the vaccine are as follows:

- ¾ Four each express one VP7 glycoprotein from the four human rotavirus strains (i.e. one of G1G4) plus the VP4 protein (P7) from the bovine strain.
- ¾ One expresses the VP4 protein from the G1 P1[8] human rotavirus strain plus the VP7 protein (G6) from the bovine strain.

The minimal content of each strain ranges from 2.0-2.8 x 10 6 infectious units (IU).

The clinical program to support licensure consisted of 5 phase I/II studies (n=3,186) and 3 phase III trials (n=70,141).

## Phase I/II studies

The five phase I/II studies (Protocols 001, 002, 003, 004, and 005) of the predecessors of the HBRV vaccine,  which  included  vaccines  of  different  formulations  and  reassortant  compositions,  were conducted involving 3,186 infants (2,470 vaccine recipients) and 46 adults (30 vaccine recipients).

The results  of  these  studies  were  utilized  to  select  the  formulation,  potency  (dose),  and  reassortant composition of the vaccine, which was evaluated in the Phase III clinical trials. The most important data  come  from Study  005 ,  which compared  pentavalent  vaccine  (not  final  formulation)  of three aggregate potencies with a quadrivalent G1-G4 vaccine, a monovalent P1 vaccine and placebo.

## Phase III studies

The three phase III studies involved administration of the final formulation vaccine to 35,365 infants and placebo to 34,776 infants. The studies were performed at 396 sites in 11 countries and enrolled healthy infants 6 to 12 weeks of age. Three doses of vaccine were given at 4- to 10-week intervals. There were no restrictions on breastfeeding or on the prior or concomitant use of licensed vaccines except for oral polio virus vaccine (OPV). Data on safety, immunogenicity and efficacy were collected in all or in subsets of infants.

- The large-scale Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial, REST (Protocol 006) evaluated  the efficacy and safety of the HBRV vaccine, particularly with regard to intussusception. In total, 70,301 infants were randomised.
- The Dose-Confirmation Efficacy Study (Protocol 007) involving 1,312 infants  evaluated the efficacy of the end-expiry potency of the HBRV vaccine in the final formulation intended for licensure.
- The Consistency Lots Study (Protocol 009) provided a clinical evaluation of the consistency of  the  manufacturing  process.  The  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  three  manufacturing  lots were evaluated in 793 subjects.

All 3 studies utilized the same methods for case finding and data collection, the same case definitions for safety and efficacy endpoints, and the same immunological assays.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies were not performed since these were not applicable. (Note for guidance on clinical evaluation of new vaccines CPMP/EWP/463/97).

## Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics of the vaccine relate to its interaction with the immune system. Therefore, this section concentrates on the immunogenicity data and the documentation of faecal shedding of vaccine and  wild-type  viruses  from  the  dose-finding  study  (005),  which  was  not  performed  with  the  final formulation,  and  the  large  safety  and  efficacy  study  (006)  in  which  the  final  formulation  was evaluated.

- Antibody assays were performed on sera and faeces at one of two US centralised laboratories. A validated EIA was used for determination of serum neutralising antibody (SNA). This EIA had  been  shown  to  correlate  with  PRN50  data.  The  ED40  values  were  used  for  determining titres.
- Faecal shedding was evaluated by plaque assay of stool specimens followed by electropherotyping. Wild-type human rotavirus is not cytopathic in cell culture so the plaque assay should detect only live WC3-reassortant rotavirus.
- Stool  samples  collected  during  acute  gastroenteritis  (AGE)  were  screened  by  EIA  for detection of rotavirus antigen. Stools that were EIA positive but negative in the plaque assay were deemed in all protocols to represent wild type rotavirus. However, this assumption was later re-examined (see under Efficacy) since it became clear that the EIA was also picking up vaccine virus strains that occasionally did not grow in cell culture. EIA positive stools were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjected to a novel in-house PCR/sequencing assay that was initially applied to the VP7 gene to  determine  G  serotypes.  During  the  assessment  process,  the  applicant  also  supplied  the results of an in-house PCR applied to VP4 to determine P genotypes of a selection of viruses obtained during studies 006 and 007.

Study 005 was a double blind dose-finding study with a primary endpoint of efficacy that ran from 1998-2001 in Finland (for details see below). Healthy infants aged 2-8 months received three doses of one of the five candidate vaccines or placebo (as in the table below) with 4-8 weeks between each dose.

|   Group | Clinical Material                           | Lot Number         | Dosage   | Aggregate (PFU/Dose)   |

|       4 | Live rotavirus vaccine (G1, G2, G3, G4)     | V260 OSO 002 C001  | 1.0 mL   | 2.90 x 10 7            |
|       5 | Live rotavirus vaccine (P1)                 | V260 OSO 004 E001  | 1.0 mL   | 9.24 x 10 6            |
|       6 | Placebo                                     | PV260 OSO 002 A001 | 1.0 mL   | 0                      |

The existence of a dose-response relationship between pentavalent vaccine potency and ≥ 3-fold rises in  G1  SNA  was  explored  for  first  year  data  from  the  PP  population  using  logistic  regression modelling. A statistically significant dose-response relationship was detected among the pentavalent vaccine groups.

Based on per-protocol (PP) cases of rotavirus AGE occurring during the first rotavirus season in the PP protocol population, logistic regression models showed a significant inverse relationship between rate of rotavirus AGE and the post-dose 3 SNA titres against G1, G2, G3, P1A and G6 SNA titres as well  as  with  proportions  with ≥ 3-fold  rises  in  SNA  titres  to  G1  and  G2.  The  findings  need  to  be viewed with caution due to multiplicity and the fact that the great majority of the rotavirus AGE cases were caused by the G1 serotype. However, it was found that post-dose 3 G1 SNA of 51 dilution units was predictive of protection with &gt; 70% sensitivity and that the odds of contracting rotavirus AGE would be 4.54 times higher for a subject with a post-dose 3 level ≤ 51 compared to a subject with a titre &gt;51 dilution units.

The percentage that shed vaccine virus 3 to 5 days post-dose 1 ranged from 1.4 to 6.3% across the vaccine groups. Typing of the shed strains after the first dose of vaccine showed that the majority were G1 or P1 reassortants. After the second dose, one infant shed G1, two shed P1 and one shed G1 with bovine 3. Only one infant shed G3 virus after the third dose.

In Study 006 , the immunogenicity sub-study included the first 300 enrolled at selected sites in Finland (used  for  the  primary  analysis  of  immunogenicity)  and  the  US,  the  first  300  randomised  from  the Navajo and White Mountain Apache Nations and a U.S. Concomitant Use Cohort of approximately 1,490 infants who were given COMVAX, INFANRIX, IPOL and PREVENAR on the same days as doses of RotaTeq. Schedules varied considerably across sites. Faecal shedding of vaccine-virus strains in stools collected 4-6 days after each vaccination was assessed in the first 150 randomised in each of Finland and the US. The results for SNA responses to G1 among Finnish infants after three doses are shown below.

The  responses  of  these  Finnish  infants  to  the  other  G  serotypes  in  the  vaccine  and  to  P1  showed marked  differences  in  parameters  between  the  vaccine  and  placebo  groups.  The  magnitude  of  the responses in the RotaTeq group was lowest for G2 and G3 serotypes.

The  analyses  regarding  the  immunogenicity  of  concomitantly  administered  vaccines  in  the  US Concomitant  Use  Cohort  suggested  that  there  was  unlikely  to  be  any  clinically  important  immune interference.

In study 006, there were 12.7% of the infants in the RotaTeq group and none in theplacebo group that shed a vaccine virus 4 to 6 days after the first dose and no shedding was found in either group after doses  2  or  3.  The  strains  shed  were  either  from  the  vaccine  or  reassortants  of  vaccine  strains.The number and percent that shed vaccine virus strains at any time following each vaccination (i.e. from samples taken 4 to 6 days after each dose and from samples collected as a result of a potential AGE) are shown below for studies 006 and 007 combined. Almost all instances occurred within one week of vaccination.

## Study 009

The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate consistency of the antibody responses to 3 lots of the HBRV vaccine produced in the final manufacturing facility. The study was performed at 10 US study sites. A total of 793 subjects were enrolled and randomised (2:2:2:1) to 1 of 3 lots of HBRV vaccine at potency within the range of final potencies (&gt;8.94x10 6 IU/dose to max 1.05x10 8 IU/dose) or placebo.  The  potency  for  each  dose  was  targeted  for  the  middle  of  the  range  and  actual  potencies ranged from 6.91x10 7 IU/dose to 8.81x10 7 IU/dose.

The primary immunogenicity analysis was based on post-dose 3 SNA GMTs against rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1 and a requirement that the two-sided 90% confidence interval on the ratio of each pair of GMTs excluded a difference of 2-fold or more, for each of the serology components measured). This criterion was satisfied.  With respect to the proportions of subjects with &gt;3-fold titre rise of SNA antibodies there were some differences between lots, but due to the limited number of samples tested no conclusions could be drawn.

## Clinical efficacy

Data on protective efficacy with pentavalent formulations were obtained from studies 005, 006 and 007. The final formulation was used in the latter two studies as follows:

- ¾ In 006 , 33 lots of RotaTeq were used with aggregate potencies from 6.7-12.4 x 10 7  IU/dose.
- ¾ In 007 , two lots of RotaTeq were used with aggregate potencies of 1.07 and 1.13 x 10 7 IU/dose.

All  the  studies  utilised  the  same  methods  for  case  finding  and  data  collection,  the  same  case definitions for safety and efficacy endpoints, and the same immunological assays. Because of the large

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sample size required for P006 (REST) for the intussusception evaluation, efficacy against rotavirus acute gastroenteritis (AGE) was assessed in a nested sub-study.

Whenever an infant had symptoms consistent with an AGE, the parent/legal guardian was instructed to collect two stool samples as soon as possible and within 14 days following the onset of symptoms and optimally  within  48  hours  of  the  onset  of  symptoms.  The  per  protocol  (PP)  case  definition  for rotavirus AGE required infants to meet the following criteria:

- ¾ ≥ 3 watery or looser-than-normal stools within a 24-hour period and/or forceful vomiting
- ¾ Rotavirus detected in a stool specimen taken within 14 days after the onset of symptoms.

Only G1-, G2-, G3-, or G4-specific rotavirus AGE occurring ≥ 14 days after the third dose of vaccine or placebo during the first rotavirus season were included in the primary efficacy analyses. Thus, the primary  efficacy  analyses  in  each  study  were  based  on  a  definition  of true  vaccine  failures. The severity of AGE was scored based on the same schema in all studies that classified a score of 1 to 8 points = mild, 9-16 = moderate and &gt;16 points = severe.

## · Dose response study

## Study 005

The study was conducted at a single centre in Finland and was double blind, randomised and placebocontrolled. Subjects were randomised to 1 of 6 treatment groups to receive either vaccine of varying potencies  and  compositions  or  placebo.  Healthy  infants  2  to  8  months  of  age  received  three  1-mL doses of vaccine/placebo with an interval of 4-8 weeks. All subjects were pre-fed by breastfeeding or with  infant  formula  30  minutes  prior  to  vaccine  administration.  If  infant  refused  pre-feeding,  an antacid was given. There was no restriction on the administration of the usual paediatric vaccines with the exception of oral polio vaccine (OPV).

## Statistical methods

The primary null hypothesis in this 3-year Finnish study was that the efficacy of each of the high-dose, middle-dose and low-dose pentavalent vaccines and the monovalent (P1) vaccine against all G1-4 cases of rotavirus GE occurring ≥ 14 days post-dose 3 during a single season would be &lt;0%.

## Results

Through  the  first  rotavirus  season  postvaccination,  the  primary  analysis  gave  point  estimates  for efficacy  of  68%,  74%  and  57%  for  pentavalent  vaccine  of  decreasing  potency  against  G1-G4 infections as shown below.  Efficacy estimates through two seasons for the middle-dose and low-dose pentavalent  vaccines  were  lower  but  estimates  for  the  high-dose  pentavalent  and  the  monovalent vaccines were higher than in the first season.

Groups 4 received quadrivalent vaccine at 2.9 x 10 7 pfu/dose

Group 5 received monovalent P1 vaccine at 9.2 x 10 6 pfu/dose.

The  analysis  of  efficacy  against  all  serotypes  in  the  PP  population  using  the  PP  case  definition included  41  additional  rotavirus  AGE  cases  (14  were  G9,  1  was  G8  and  26  could  not  be  typed). Efficacy estimates for all serotypes were generally slightly lower (ranging from 41.6 to 70.5% across all vaccine groups) as compared with the primary analysis and the lower 95% were 32% and 43% for groups 1 and 2 but 20% for the lowest potency pentavalent vaccine, 24% for the quadrivalent vaccine and only 3% for the P1 monovalent vaccine.

## · Main study

Study  006  (the  Rotavirus  [vaccine]  Efficacy  and  Safety  Study  -  REST  study) was  a  double  blind study  conducted  at  356  investigative  sites  worldwide  from  2001-2004.  Countries  included  were Belgium, Costa Rica,  Finland,  Germany,  Guatemala,  Italy,  Jamaica,  Mexico,  Puerto  Rico,  Sweden, Taiwan  and  the  United  States.  The  Navajo  and  White  Mountain  Apache  Nations,  where  G3  has historically been predominant, were considered as a demographic entity within the US.

## METHODS

## Study Participants and Treatments

Eligible infants were aged 6-12 weeks at the time of the first dose and three 2 mL volume doses of vaccine or placebo were to be administered with 28-70 days between doses. The study was run over three  rotavirus  seasons.  If  enrolled  early  enough  into  the  study,  infants  were  followed  for  a  second rotavirus season.

The per-protocol population was primary and included subjects who received the 3 scheduled doses and adhered to the study protocol.

The  modified  intention-to-treat  (mITT)  population  included  any  subject  with  valid  efficacy  data, including protocol violators.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Per  protocol  (PP)  case  definition  for  rotavirus  AGE  required  infants  to  meet  both  of  the  following criteria:

- Three  or  more  watery  or  looser-than-normal  stools  within  a  24-hour  period  and/or  forceful vomiting
- Rotavirus  detected  by  EIA  in  a  stool  specimen  taken  within  14  days  after  the  onset  of symptoms.  All  rotavirus-positive  stools  underwent  serotype  identification  by  PCR  that focused  on  VP7  (G  protein)  and  identification  by  VP4  (P  protein)  was  not  performed.  As necessary,  a  protocol  amendment  was  employed  so  that  the  PCR  results  were  used  in  the primary analysis due to the improved specificity over EIA for serotype identification.

## Objectives

There were two co-primary objectives:

(1) To evaluate the efficacy of a 3-dose regimen of RotaTeq against rotavirus disease caused by serotypes G1, G2, G3, and G4 occurring at least 14 days following the third dose

(2)  To  assess  the safety of  RotaTeq  with  respect  to intussusception within  42  days  of  any dose of vaccine/placebo (see next section on this endpoint).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Case ascertainment for AGE was by means of:

- Active surveillance that consisted of telephone contacts or home visits every 2 weeks during the rotavirus season to remind the parent/legal guardian to report all cases of AGE to study staff, to complete the worksheets and collect stool samples for rotavirus testing.
- Passive surveillance that  called  for  the  parent/legal  guardian  to  report  cases  of  AGE  at  any time after the first vaccination regardless if it was during the rotavirus season.

In the event that a subject had multiple episodes that met a case definition, the subject was counted only once for the efficacy analyses and the efficacy analyses was based on the date of the first episode.

## Statistical methods and Sample size

The primary null hypothesis referred to  efficacy  against  all  G1-,  G2-,  G3-,  or  G4-specific  cases  of rotavirus AGE occurring through the first rotavirus season that begins 14 or more days post-dose 3. Assuming 2295 evaluable subjects in each group, and assuming the true rotavirus attack rate was 10% and RotaTeq had a true efficacy of 60%, there was approximately 98% power to declare that RotaTeq was efficacious.

## RESULTS

The US sites (including Jamaica and Puerto Rico) contributed 50% of the total enrolled into the entire study (Safety Cohort) while Finland contributed 33%. There were 5,686 infants randomised into the Efficacy Cohort, of which 5128 (90.2%) received three doses and were followed up for 42 days postdose 3.

## Baseline data

Baseline data for the Efficacy Cohort were as follows:

## Numbers analysed

There were 112 in the vaccine group but only 59 in the placebo group who were excluded from the primary  analysis  due  to  protocol-defined  wild  type  rotavirus  before  14  days  post-dose  3.  Similar imbalances were noted in studies 005 and 007. These infants had stools that were EIA positive but negative on plaque assay, which implied that no vaccine strains were present and that they had wildtype infections. However, the results of VP7 analyses in studies 006 and 007 indicated that there had been EIA detection of non-viable vaccine strains in many of the infants in the vaccine group. Indeed, of those infants for whom a serotype could be identified, only 24/86 in the vaccine group but all those tested  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  wild-type  virus  in  stool  collected  during  an  episode  of  AGE  that occurred before 14 days post-dose 3.

## Outcomes and estimation

In the primary analysis of efficacy, protective efficacy was estimated at 74%, with a lower 95% CI of 67%. In the analysis of efficacy based on cases with severity scores &gt; 8, protective efficacy for first and worst episode scores in the PP population using the PP case definition was 82% with a lower CI at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

75%. For efficacy against episodes with severity scores &gt;16, the point estimate was 98% with a lower 95%  CI  of  88%.  Very  similar  results  were  obtained  in  the  mITT  population  using  the  PP  case definition.

The  data  for  all  rotavirus  AGE  (i.e.  regardless  of  G  serotype)  that  met  the  PP  case  definition  and occurred  at  least  14  days  after  the  third  dose  in  the  PP  population  during  the  first  season  postvaccination gave a point estimate of 71.8% (95% CI: 64.5, 77.8). Most of the non-vaccine G serotypes were non-typable. Efficacy against rotavirus AGE that occurred through the first and second rotavirus seasons gave a point estimate of 71.3% (95% CI: 64.7%, 76.9%) . A  similar  analysis  that  looked  at efficacy only in the second rotavirus season gave a point estimate of 62.6% (95% CI: 44.3%, 75.4%). Protective efficacy among the non-native US infants was lower than that for the US Concomitant Use Cohort. An analysis of efficacy by race among US infants (not including native Americans) suggested that the point estimate was 60% in whites, with 95% CI of -7.7, 87.2. However, this was based on 410 and  465  infants  per  group  and  only  6  and  16  cases  of  rotavirus  AGE,  respectively.  There  was  no gender effect on efficacy. The analysis by gestational age at birth included 153 of the 204 enrolled with gestational ages of 30-35 weeks at the time of birth. The point estimates for protective efficacy were 74.2% for full term infants and 70.3% for those born before 36 weeks, with lower 95% CI at 66.8% and -15.4%.

Sensitivity analyses were provided that counted all post-dose 1 rotavirus AGE. Results for prevention of AGE due to vaccine serotypes or any serotype were consistent with the above analyses for rotavirus AGE from  14  days  post-dose  3.  In  addition,  an  ITT  analysis  in  which  all  AGE  from  dose  1  was counted and infants with missing data were assumed to have rotavirus AGE gave a point estimate of 25% and a lower 95% CI of 16%.

The table below provides a breakdown of the primary analysis data by G serotype. For the non-G1 serotypes  included  in  the  vaccine,  the  numbers  were  very  small  and  the  95%  CI  were  very  wide, spanning zero for G3 and G4.

The applicant's RT-PCR and sequence-based assay for VP4 (P) typing was used to test 80 clinical samples collected during studies 006 + 007 and identified as G2, G3, G4 and G9 from both treatment groups. Also tested was a subset of samples identified as G1 and randomly selected by season.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two P-types were identified:

- -P1a[8] was associated with all G1, G3, G4, G9 and G12
- -P1b[4] was found with all G2 strains

The  primary  analysis  of  efficacy  was  supplemented  during  the  assessment  process  by  data  on hospitalisations  and  emergency  room visits  in  the  much  larger  total  study  population.  This  analysis yielded much larger numbers of PP rotavirus AGE for which the serotype was determined. The next table  summarises  the  findings  for  cases  from  14  days  post-dose  3.  For  the  four  G  serotypes  in  the vaccine, point estimates exceed 85% and the lower 95% are over about 50% except for G2, for which the  lower  95%  CI  is  negative.  The  data  below  indicated  efficacy  against  G9P[8]  rotavirus  and  the findings suggested that the P1[8] reassortant in the vaccine may be contributing to or wholly providing the protection observed against G9.

With somewhat conflicting data regarding efficacy against G2P[4] in the two analyses shown above, and uncertainty of the real effect due to the small numbers of cases, the applicant provided a further analysis of healthcare contacts for PP rotavirus AGE cases from the day of first vaccination. The data shown below demonstrate that the lower 95% CI for efficacy against G2 in this analysis was above zero.

On the basis of these data and those of the primary analysis it was concluded that efficacy had been demonstrated  against  G1,  G3,  G4  and  G9  but  only  when  these  serotypes  were  associated  with  the P1[8}  genotype.  Efficacy  against  G2P[4]  was  less  certain  but  it  was  considered  that  there  was sufficient evidence to mention this type in the indication provided that section 5.1 of the SPC showed the data clearly and explained that overall efficacy might be less since there would be no contribution from the immune response elicited by the P1[8] component of the vaccine.

- Supportive study

## Study 007

This was specifically designed to assess the efficacy of RotaTeq at end of shelf life potency. .

The primary analysis of efficacy was based on the PP population. The mITT population included all infants with valid efficacy data (including protocol violators).

The statistical primary null hypothesis was that the efficacy of RotaTeq at expiry potency against all G1-, G2-, G3-, or G4-specific cases of rotavirus AGE occurring at least 14 days post-dose 3 through one rotavirus season would be ≤ 0%. This hypothesis was tested using an exact binomial procedure based  on  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  rotavirus  AGE.  Assuming  437  evaluable  subjects  in  each group, and assuming the true rotavirus attack rate was 10% and RotaTeq had a true efficacy of 60% (one-sided α =  0.025),  there  was  90%  power  to  declare  that  RotaTeq  at  expiry  potency  was efficacious. The protocol was amended to increase the study numbers and to allow enrolment over two seasons to achieve the target

## Results

The primary efficacy estimate was 72.5% (lower 95% confidence interval 50.6%). In this analysis, 66/69 rotavirus AGE cases were of G1 serotype while the other three were G3. For severe cases (i.e. score &gt;16; using either the first episode or the worst score episode), the point estimate for efficacy was 100% (95% CI 13, 100). In the efficacy analysis using the ITT case definition in the mITT population the point estimate for efficacy was 45.2% with a lower 95% CI at 23.5. For infants enrolled within the USA, the efficacy estimate (based on the PP case definition in the PP population) in white Caucasians was 85.4% (95% CI -9.3%, 99.7%) while that in Hispanics was 100% (95% CI -386.7%, 100.0%). Within the homogeneous infants enrolled in Finland, the point estimate was 70.3% (95% CI 44.9%, 85.0%. An analysis of PP cases in the PP population by gender gave a point estimate for males of 72.0% (95% CI 37.0%, 89.0%) compared to 73.1% for females (95% CI 36.4%, 90.1%).

## N / A

- Discussion on clinical efficacy

It was considered that efficacy was demonstrated against G1 and that, using the hospitalisation and ER room visits data, efficacy was demonstrated also for G3, G4 and G9 but only when these serotypes were associated with the P[8] genotype. Efficacy against G2P[4] was less certain but it was considered that there was sufficient evidence to mention this type in the indication.

It was considered a deficiency of the dossier that only 3-dose regimens had been studied. It was also difficult  to  examine any effect of schedule since RotaTeq was administered along with a variety of infant primary series.

However, the majority of infants in the Efficacy Cohort received the third dose of vaccine between 1922 weeks of age. Therefore, taken together with the analysis of efficacy according to whether doses were given &lt;/&gt; 42 days apart, it was concluded that giving all three doses by 22 weeks would provide suitable efficacy. In addition, there would be a potential advantage in terms of prevention of infection and of minimising the number of cases of intussusception that could occur in temporal relationship with vaccine doses in recommending that all three doses should preferably be given by 22 weeks and, based on the median ages that all three doses should be given by 26 weeks. This is reflected in the final SPC recommendations.

The individual reassortant potencies (IU/dose) across the 33 final container lots supplied to the 006 study were as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|                                | G1         | G2         | G3         | G4         | P1         |
|--------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Lowest potency per 2 mL dose:  | 1.1 x 10 7 | 1.1 x 10 7 | 7.5 x 10 6 | 1.2 x 10 7 | 1.0 x 10 7 |
| Highest potency per 2 mL dose: | 2.3 x 10 7 | 4.2 x 10 7 | 2.9 x 10 7 | 3.3 x 10 7 | 2.8 x 10 7 |

These  data  raised  a  potential  issue  since  the  applicant's  proposed  potencies  for  each  reassortant  at release were lower at G1 ≥ 2.91 x 10 6 IU/dose, G2 ≥ 4.11 x 10 6 IU/dose, G3 ≥ 3.25 x 10 6 IU/dose, G4 ≥ 5.18 x 10 6 IU/dose  and  P1 ≥ 3.75 x 10 6 IU/dose.  However,  taking  into  account  the  estimates  of efficacy obtained with formulations of varying potencies by reassortant in studies 005 and 007 it was accepted that vaccine of the specified release potency should provide efficacy similar to that observed in 006. However, the applicant will monitor effectiveness in the post-licensure period.

## Clinical safety

- Risk of vaccine-associated intussusception was determined in study 006

To  address  the  primary  safety  endpoint,  the  study  employed  a  group-sequential  design.  Initially, 60,000 infants were to be enrolled, receive three doses of assigned treatment and complete 42 days of safety follow-up after the final vaccination. After this point was reached, the DSMB was to unblind the treatment arm of positively-adjudicated intussusception cases and assess whether the pre-defined statistical criteria for the primary safety hypothesis were met. If the criteria were not met with 60,000 infants, then an additional group of 10,000 was to be enrolled and then further groups of 10,000 were to be added until the pre-defined statistical criteria were met or until the total had reached 100,000.

The case definition for intussusception included the occurrence of the following within 365 days of the first dose of allotted treatment:

- ¾ Radiographic or surgical confirmation of the diagnosis of intussusception or
- ¾ Evidence of intussusception at autopsy.

The applicant's SOP regarding detection, adjudication and reporting of cases of intussusception stated that Infants were to have at least one of the following imaging findings:

| Radiographic                    | Description                                                                                                                                              |

| 2. Ultrasound (US)              | Intra-luminal soft tissue mass, which is described as a donut or pseudokidney appearance, multiple concentric, ring sign, and/or crescent-in-donut sign. |

And/or one of the following surgical findings:

- 1 Idiopathic intussusception with no anatomic lead point:
- a) Visualization of the telescoped bowel, treated with manual reduction.
- b) Visualization of the telescoped bowel, treated with resection.
- c) Spontaneous reduction of intussusception.
- 2 Intussusception associated with anatomic lead point:

If there is a lead point found, describe the lead point in detail and / or autopsy confirmation.

Case ascertainment involved contacting parents/legal guardians on approximately Days 7, 14 and 42 after each vaccination with RotaTeq or placebo to ask about all SAEs, including intussusception. The sponsor  obtained  relevant  medical  records  and  reported  each  case  to  a  blinded  independent  Safety Endpoint  Adjudication  Committee  (SEAC),  which  reviewed  and  adjudicated  all  potential  cases  of intussusception as they occurred by examining the relevant medical records and diagnostic tests in a blinded  fashion.  The  DSMB  unblinded  the  treatment  arm  of  the  SEAC's  positively-adjudicated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(confirmed) cases of intussusception and made recommendations for continuing the study based on pre-defined safety boundaries that were designed such that the study would be stopped early if the relative risk of intussusception in any of two overlapping day ranges (1 to 7 and 1 to 42 days after any vaccination) was  statistically significantly  increased  among  recipients  of  RotaTeq vs placebo recipients.

The primary null hypothesis was that RotaTeq would increase the risk of intussusception relative to placebo within 42 days of any dose. Assuming an underlying incidence of 1/2000 per annum, a 102day follow-up period, and that the true relative risk was 1.0, there was approximately 94% power to declare that the relative risk was ≤ 10.0. The primary safety analysis was based on all subjects who received at least one dose of RotaTeq or placebo.

Of the 56,310 infants that completed the safety follow-up either for 365 days following the first dose or until the study site end-of-study date 46,372 (82.4%) were actually followed for 365 days and 9,938 (17.6%)  reached  the  end-of-study  date  before  Day  365.  The  baseline  characteristics  of  the  Safety Cohort were as follows:

There  were  30  infants  with  positively-adjudicated  (confirmed)  intussusception  that  occurred  at  any time  throughout  the  study.  Twelve  of  these  had  received  RotaTeq  and  18  received  placebo.  Three cases  were  reported  after  completion  of  365  days  follow-up  post  Visit  1  and  all  three  occurred  in placebo recipients.

The data for the planned primary evaluation are shown below. There was no pattern of clustering of cases in the early period after each dose with either vaccine or placebo.  Ask rapporteur

† Excludes subjects who were cross-treated. There were no confirmed cases of intussusception among cross-treated subjects.

‡ Based on latest day of safety follow-up

The timing of cases in relation to dosing and the unadjusted estimates for relative risk were as follows:

- ¾ Within  7  days following  vaccination,  there  was  one  infant  in  the  RotaTeq  group  but  no placebo  group  infant  who  had  a  positively-adjudicated  (confirmed)  case  of  intussusception. The case occurred two days following the second dose.
- ¾ Within 14 days of vaccination, there was one confirmed case in each treatment group. These cases occurred at two days following the second dose of RotaTeq (as above) and at 10 days following the third dose of placebo.
- ¾ Within 60 days of  vaccination, there  were eight cases in the RotaTeq group and six in the placebo group with an unadjusted relative risk for the vaccine group of 1.3 and 95% CI at 0.4, 4.6.  Numbers  were  1,  5  and  2  cases  after  sequential  vaccine  doses  and  1,  2  and  3  after sequential doses of placebo.
- ¾ There were 28 infants who had a positively-adjudicated (confirmed) case of intussusception within 365 days following vaccination Visit 1 (13 in the RotaTeq group and 15 in the placebo group).  The  addition  of  these  extra  four  and  nine  cases  in  respective  groups,  all  of  which occurred after the third dose had been given, gives an estimate of relative risk of 0.8 and 95% CI at 0.3, 1.8. These cases included 16 males and 11 females.

The applicant also provided estimates for absolute risk for the various post-dose windows as follows

The ages at the time of diagnosis of intussusception of the 13 and 15 infants captured up to 365 days post-dosing showed a similar spread. Among the RotaTeq and placebo group cases that had received three doses before onset of intussusception, the third dose had been given no later than 30 weeks (7.5 months) of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The delay between last dose given and onset varied from approximately 2 days to 6 months in the RotaTeq group although all except one case occurred at least 2 weeks post-dose as already mentioned above.  In  the  placebo  group,  the  range  of  times  to  onset  ranged  from  10  days  to  about  9  months. Among infants that developed intussusception only after three doses of vaccine or placebo had been administered, the times of onset after the last dose ranged from approximately 5 weeks to 6 months in the RotaTeq group and from 5 weeks to 9 months in the placebo group.

In  addition,  there  were  85  infants  who  were  medically  evaluated  for  intussusception  but  were determined by the SEAC not to meet the per-protocol case definition. Of these 85 cases, 76 (89%) had a  radiographic  procedure  which  definitively  ruled  out  IS  while  8  (9%)  were  clinically  assessed  as having  diagnoses  other  than  intussusception.  One  negatively-adjudicated  subject  (in  the  placebo group) had IS diagnosed by the investigator based on ultrasound performed in the office but this was not  confirmed  by  a  repeat  ultrasound  performed  in  the  hospital.  The  diagnoses  for  the  AE  that triggered concern regarding potential intussusception included conditions such as abdominal distension and colic, urinary tract infections, milk allergies, viral gastroenteritis, haematochezia and vomiting.

## · Adverse events

For infants in the pre-defined Detailed Safety Cohort of study 006 parents/legal guardians were asked to record any AEs that occurred within 42 days following any vaccination. Other participants in this study were followed only for SAEs.

Within 42 days following any vaccination in the Detailed Safety Cohort of study 006 and all infants in 007  and  009,  in  the  RotaTeq  group  5273  (86.1%)  infants  and  4805  (86.6%)  in  the  placebo  group reported at least one AE.

† Excludes subjects who were cross-treated in Protocol 006 (REST) and Protocol 009 and 1 subject from Protocol 007 who received 4 doses of RotaTeq

Among the 11,673 infants followed for all AEs, the three most frequently reported were pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea and irritability. These all occurred at numerically similar rates in vaccine and placebo groups. However, the applicant reported that the incidences of diarrhoea (22.6% vs 19.4%), vomiting (15.2% vs 13.5%), nasopharyngitis (6.9% vs 5.9%) and otitis media (14.4% vs 12.9%) were statistically higher in the group that received RotaTeq.

In the Detailed Safety Cohort, parents/legal guardians were also to record the daily number of episodes of vomiting, diarrhoea and elevated temperature ( ≥ 38.1 û C) and irritability for the first 7 days following any  vaccination.  Temperature  was  taken  rectally  4  to  6  hours  after  each  dose  and  then  daily  at approximately the same time each day for 7 days. Based on the comparisons made below, RotaTeq was associated with higher rates of diarrhoea after the first, second and summed vaccinations and with a higher rate of vomiting after the first and summed doses compared to placebo.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Overall, 1723 infants in these studies had at least one SAE, with rates of 834 (2.4%) for RotaTeq and 889 (2.6%) for placebo. There were 123 infants with at least one vaccine-related SAE in these three studies, of which 47 (0.1%) received RotaTeq and 76 (0.2%) received placebo.

The  most  frequent  SAEs  within  42  days  following  any  vaccination  visit  were  infections  and infestations (in 1.7% and 1.9% per group), with bronchiolitis as the commonest diagnosis followed by gastroenteritis.  The  three  most  frequent  vaccine-related  SAEs  were  gastroenteritis,  pyrexia,  and dehydration. Of these, gastroenteritis considered vaccine-related occurred in 16 in the RotaTeq group and 32 subjects in the placebo group. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was reported as a SAE more frequently in the RotaTeq group (25 vs 17  cases  in  the  placebo  group;  risk  difference  = +2.2/10,000). It was considered that GERD and other serious gastrointestinal illnesses should feature in the Risk Management Plan.

There were 26 deaths reported in studies 006, 007 and 009 that occurred within 42 days following any vaccination,  of  which  15  occurred  in  the  RotaTeq  group.  For  52  deaths  that  occurred  at  any  time during the Phase III studies 25 received RotaTeq. The most commonly reported cause of death at any time  was  SIDS  (8  RotaTeq  and  9  placebo).  One  death  occurred  in  an  infant  diagnosed  with intussusception on Day 98 after the third dose of RotaTeq that required surgical resection and was followed by post-operative sepsis considered probably not related to vaccine by the investigator. All deaths were considered probably or definitely not related to vaccination/placebo.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

There  were  205  subjects  in  006,  007  and  009  that  discontinued  from  these  studies  due  to  AEs,  of which 111 received RotaTeq and 94 received placebo. There were 149 infants who discontinued from studies 006, 007 and 009 due to a SAE, of which 80 (0.2%) received RotaTeq and 69 (0.2%) received placebo.  In  addition,  29  discontinued  due  to  a  vaccine-related  SAE,  including  13  that  received RotaTeq and 16 that received placebo

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

There  were  6790  infants  in  study  006  that  received  a  hexavalent  vaccine  concomitantly  (&gt;99%  on same day) with RotaTeq or placebo. Of these, 95 (2.8%) in the group that received RotaTeq and 102 (3.0%) in the placebo group had a SAE within 42 days of any dose. The most common SAEs were infections  and  infestations.  In  general,  types  and  rates  of  SAEs  were  similar  between  vaccine  and placebo groups.

In the US Concomitant Use Cohort of 1358 infants who were followed for AEs, 545 (82.3%) in the RotaTeq group and 606 (87.1%) in the placebo group reported at least one AE, of which the most frequent were pyrexia (46.5% and 49.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.6% and 27.2%) and diarrhoea (13.9% and 18.1%).

In the German Detailed Safety Cohort (637 who received a concomitant hexavalent vaccine), AE rates were 286 (88.3%) in the RotaTeq group and 274 (87.5%) for placebo. Pyrexia occurred in 42.3% and 43.8%, diarrhoea in 28.7% and 26.8% and vomiting in 23.5% and 23.3%. Other AEs occurred at lower rates with no notable differences between treatment groups.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Regarding  the  risk  of  intussusception,  even  a  study  of  this  size,  which  is  really  as  large  as  any Company could realistically be expected to undertake pre-licensure, cannot rule out the possibility of an excess risk for intussusception associated with the vaccine. However, the only way to arrive at a better  assessment  will  be  to  study  safety  and  efficacy  in  very  large  numbers  of  infants  in  the  postlicensure period and to conduct very frequent and detailed reviews of the findings. Close collaboration will be needed between the Company, the CHMP and Public Health Authorities to ensure that every possible measure is taken to detect potential problems as early as possible.

The  occurrence  of  mild  AGE  in  vaccine  recipients  was  thought  to  be  most  likely  a  side  effect  of shedding vaccine strains although there are no data to rule out the possibility that these infants were co-infected with another pathogen. The proposal is based on the fact that the WC3 bovine rotavirus is thought to undergo a process of abortive replication in the human host, which could result in some mild AGE symptoms. It was considered highly unlikely that the mild AGE observed in these infants was due to development of virulent reassortants of vaccine and wild type strains because:

- ¾ Shedding  studies  showed  that  this  occurs  only  in  a  small  proportion  of  infants,  in  low quantities  and  predominantly  during  the  week  after  the  first  dose  so  there  is  very  limited opportunity for reassortment to occur between live vaccine and wild type strains
- ¾ A reassortant  would  be  very  unlikely  to  have  the  virulence  of  the  wild-type  human  strain. Since the vaccine reassortants contain genes of bovine origin except for 1 or 2 human genes multiple  reassortments  would  have  to  occur  with  exchange  of  bovine  segments  for  human segments before a rotavirus with the virulence of a human strain would result.

A  slightly  higher  number  of  CNS  events  occurred  in  the  RotaTeq  group  although  rates  for  those without an identified aetiology were similar to the placebo group. Although the current data do not show  any  clear  evidence  of  an  association  between  RotaTeq  and  the  potential  extra-intestinal manifestations  of  wild-type  rotavirus  that  have  been  reported  in  the  literature,  monitoring  for  such events has been highlighted in the Risk Management Plan.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was reported as a SAE more frequently in the RotaTeq group  (25 vs 17  cases  in  the  placebo  group;  risk  difference  =  +2.2/10,000).  It  was  considered  that GERD and other serious gastrointestinal illnesses should feature in the Risk Management Plan

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  was  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## 3.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

During the evaluation of RotaTeq, a number of issues were identified. The main issues related to the potency assay (M-QPA) (comparability with the plaque assay and robustness of the assay), the limit for residual Vero cell DNA, justification of storage periods of intermediates and the proposed potency specifications being lower than those used in the main efficacy study 006. Satisfactory answers have been provided to resolve these concerns.

Other minor concerns have been adequately addressed; however, a number of follow-up measures are defined to provide further information post-approval. In conclusion, all quality issues are resolved.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The  limited  programme  of  non-clinical  studies  in  support  of  this  vaccine  generally  fulfilled  the recommendations in the Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Oral administration of RotaTeq to mice as a single or 3-dose regimen over approximately 10 weeks was well tolerated.  There were no treatment-related effects on mortality, physical signs, body weight, food  consumption,  haematological  parameters,  or  serum  biochemical  parameters.    There  were  no treatment-related gross, histopathological or organ weight changes at either the interim (Study Day 8) or terminal (Study Day 64) necropsy

The Vero cell DNA uptake studies in rats were carried out to support the safety of the residual Vero cell  DNA  levels  in  RotaTeq,  as  requested  in  the  Scientific  Advice  letters.  The  presented  data  do support  the  conclusion  that  the  uptake  of  DNA  from  an  orally  administered  dose  of  RotaTeq containing 100 μ g of residual DNA is lower than from a parenteral vaccine containing DNA at the upper limit according to the WHO recommendations.

## Efficacy

Efficacy was demonstrated against G1 in the primary analysis. Efficacy against G3, G4 and G9 was based on data on hospitalisations and ER visits for rotavirus AGE. However, these claims for efficacy were restricted to strains with the P[8] genotype. Efficacy against G2P[4] was less certain but it was considered that there was sufficient evidence to mention this type in the indication. .

## Safety

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

Regarding  the  risk  of  intussusception,  even  a  study  of  this  size,  which  is  really  as  large  as  any Company could realistically be expected to undertake pre-licensure, cannot rule out the possibility of an excess risk for intussusception associated with the vaccine. However, the only way to arrive at a better  assessment  will  be  to  study  safety  and  efficacy  in  very  large  numbers  of  infants  in  the  postlicensure period and to conduct very frequent and detailed reviews of the findings. Close collaboration will be needed between the Company, the CHMP and Public Health Authorities to ensure that every possible measure is taken to detect potential problems as early as possible.

## · User consultation

The applicant  performed  readability  testing  ('user  consultation')  and  a  satisfactory  report  has  been provided.

## Risk-benefit assessment

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

Pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to investigate further some of the safety concerns.

No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product information )

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of RotaTeq indicated for

'the active immunisation of infants from the age of 6 weeks for prevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection. In clinical trials, efficacy was demonstrated against gastroenteritis due to rotavirus of  serotypes  G1P1[8],  G2P[4],  G3P1[8],  G4P1[8],  and  G9P1[8]'  was  favourable  and  therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
