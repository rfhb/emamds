## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

## Gastrointestinal perforation

Gastrointestinal perforation is a serious and potentially fatal adverse drug reaction already listed in the section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC of Relistor. One additional case of intestinal perforation was notified during the reporting period. In order to reflect this safety concern adequately the wording of the contraindication was amended to include patients at increased risk of recurrent gastrointestinal obstruction due to potential for gastrointestinal perforation and include warnings about the risk of gastrointestinal perforation in patients with peritoneal metastasis, infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancies, Crohn´s disease or diverticular disease.

## Opioid withdrawal syndrome

Similarly, five serious and three non-serious cases of opioid withdrawal syndrome have been received during the periodic safety period. Patients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal and/or reduced analgesia.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing methylnaltrexone bromide were warranted
