## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on hepatocellular injury from spontaneous reports in adults including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate and hepatocellular injury is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing artenimol / piperaquine tetraphosphate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
