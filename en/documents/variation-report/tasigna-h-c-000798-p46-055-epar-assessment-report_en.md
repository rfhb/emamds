## Study population and dosages administered

In order to collect the data on safety and efficacy of Tasigna for pediatric patients with CML in Japan, a central registration system was adopted and all patients who received Tasigna from the start of the study (22-Jan-2018) were registered.

Both of the safety analysis population and the efficacy analysis population consist of 10 patients (6 males and 4 females), registered from 8 sites. By age, 2 patients were &lt; 12 years old, and 8 patients were ≥ 12 years old and &lt; 18 years old (age range: 9-17 years). The body weights were 114.9-168.2 cm and the body weights were 21.5-60.6 kg.

The data on treatment in the safety analysis population (n = 10) at the end of 1-year observation after the start of treatment showed 10, of which 7 patients who had no interruption and the other 3 patients in whom Tasigna was resumed after temporary interruption due to AEs. In no patient was treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinued.  The  doses  of  Tasigna  were  calculated  based  on  body  surface  area  (230  mg/m2  of Tasigna bid).

## Summary of safety results

Of the 10 pediatric patients in this study, six patients (60 %) experienced AEs including:

myelosuppression,  nausea,  hepatic  function  abnormal,  hyperbilirubinaemia,  liver  disorder,  eczema, rash, myalgia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, blood bilirubin increased and blood bilirubin unconjugated increased. All the reported AEs were assessed to be causally related to Tasigna except for  nausea  and  rash.  All  reported  AEs  were  grade  1  or  2.  No  grade  3  or  higher  AE  occurred  of translated CSR). One AE was reported as serious.

MedDRA/J version 24.0

The single serious case concerned a 14-year-old female who has been hospitalized after experiencing hyperbilirubinaemia on day 11 of treatment. T-Bil and D-Bil increased from baseline value of 0.6 mg/dL to 3.0 mg/dL and 0.2 mg/dL to 1.0 mg/dL, respectively. Upon URSO treatment values reached T-Bil: 1.3 mg/dL, D-Bil: 0.6 mg/dL at Day 16 and Tasigna was resumed at a lower dose of 300 mg (BSAbased daily dose was 600 mg). On Day 18, GLYCYRON was started for treatment and Tasigna dose was  increased  to  450  mg.  On  Day  38,  hyperbilirubinaemia  recurred  (T-Bil:  2.4  mg/dL,  D-Bil:  0.8 mg/dL).  On  Day  39,  the  daily  dose  of  Tasigna  was  reduced  back  to  300  mg  and  the  event  was resolving  at  Day  42  (T-Bil:  1.2  mg/dL,  D-Bil:  not  reported).  The  2  episodes  of  hyperbilirubinaemia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  both  assessed  to  be  serious  (criteria  'hospitalization  [initial  or  prolonged]',  and  'other  serious [Important Medical Events)']. URSO and GLYCYRON, were continued. Details have been provided in the submitted dataset.

No deaths were reported.

Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (ADRs)  occurred  in  5  patients  (50.00%)  and  included  myelosuppression, hepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinaemia, liver disorder, eczema, myalgia, alanine aminotransferase increased, blood bilirubin increased and blood bilirubin unconjugated increased. All ADRs occurred in single cases, except blood bilirubin increased in two cases.

Three other studies with Tasigna included pediatric patients; study CAMN107A2120 (hereafter referred to  as  A2120),  study  CAMN107A2203  (hereafter  referred  to  as  A2203),  and  study  CAMN107A1401 (hereafter referred to as 1401). Study A2120 is a Phase I PK study investigating the safety, efficacy and PK study of nilotinib in pediatric patients Study A2203 is phase II study in pediatric patients which included a small number of Japanese pediatric patients (9 patients) at the time of approval in Japan (25-Dec-2017). Thus, a special drug use investigational surveillance was initiated in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tasigna administered to Japanese pediatric patients with CML. Study A1401 is a drug use investigational surveillance in CML and was conducted in Japan from 16 February 2009 to 18 January 2019. It was initiated after approval of adult indication in Japan and 7 pediatric patients with CML-CP (&lt; 18 years) were registered in this study.

In  Study  A2120,  ADRs  occurred  in  12  patients  (80.0%)  of  the  15  patients  enrolled.  Common  ADRs included  ALT  increased  and  rash  (4  patients  each,  26.7%),  followed  by  aspartate  aminotransferase (AST) increased, blood bilirubin increased, and hyperbilirubinemia (3 patients each, 20%). In Study A2203,  ADRs  occurred  in  50  patients  (86.2%)  of  the  58  patients  enrolled  (including  9  Japanese patients). Common ADRs included blood bilirubin increased in 18 patients (31.0%), ALT increased in 17  patients  (29.3%),  headache  in  16  patients  (27.6%),  AST  increased  in  14  patients  (24.1%), hyperbilirubinaemia and rash in 12 patients (20.7%) each, nausea in 9 patients (15.5%), rash maculopapular in 8 patients (13.8%), vomiting in 7 patients (12.1%) and alopecia in 6 patients (10.3%). In Study  A1401,  7  pediatric  patients  with  CML-CP  (&lt;  18  years)  were  registered,  of  whom  5  patients (71.43%)  had  ADRs,  including  rash  in  2  patients  (28.57%),  acne  pustular,  headache,  strabismus, hepatic function abnormal, jaundice, liver disorder, dry skin, bone pain, chest pain, blood creatinine phosphokinase increased, electrocardiogram QT prolonged and hepatic enzyme increased in 1 patient each (14.29%).

The AEs that occurred in the present study are in line with the known safety profile of Tasigna. They were observed also in the global phase I and II studies of Tasigna in pediatric patients (A2120 and A2203) and in pediatric patients of the Japanese drug use investigational surveillance (A1401).

In  study  A2203  hyperbilirubinaemia/blood  bilirubin  increase  and  transaminase  elevation  (AST,  ALT) were reported at a higher frequency than in adult patients. The higher risk of hepatotoxicity in the pediatric population is already reflected in current approved SmPC and monitoring recommendations for the liver function (bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels) are included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the EU SmPC.

## Summary of efficacy results

In  study  CAMN107A1402  statuses  of  complete  hematologic  response  (CHR),  complete  cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were assessed at the start of treatment (within 1 month before the start of treatment), 3 and 6 months and 1 year from the start of treatment with Tasigna.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In newly diagnosed patients (n=5), at 1 year, all 5 patients (100%) achieved CHR and CCyR and 3 patients (60%) achieved MMR. In Study A2120, no de novo patients were enrolled. In Study A2203, the proportion of patients who achieved CCyR and MMR at Cycle 12 were both 64.0% (16/25 patients) in the 25 pediatric patients with de novo CML-CP.

In  the  patients  with  resistance/intolerance  to  previous  therapy  (n=5),  4  patients,  2  patients  and  2 patients already achieved CHR, CCyR and MMR at the start of treatment, respectively. At 1 year 100% (n=5) achieved CHR, 80% (n=4) achieved CCyR and 80% (n=4) achieved MMR.

In Study A2120, 10 (90.9%) patients of 11 Ph+ CML patients achieved confirmed CHR and 1 patient satisfied CHR, 4 (36.4%) patients achieved CCyR. MMR was achieved in 3 Ph+ CML patients (27.3%). In study A2203, in the 33 imatinib- or dasatinib-resistant or intolerant pediatric patients with CML-CP, the proportion of patients who achieved MMR by Cycle 6 (Week 24) was 39.4% (13/33 patients). In Study A1401, the best response outcomes in the observation period, which was specified as up to 3 years,  were  as  follows:  CHR  100%,  major  CyR  100.0%  (complete  85.71%  [6/7  patients],  partial 14.29% [1/7)].

Acknowledging the small number of patients in these studies with Tasigna, the efficacy results in the present study were overall in line with those in the pediatric populations of Study A2120, Study A2203 and  Study  A1401.  Results  of  the  study  A2203  were  submitted  to  the  Agency  on  25-Feb-2021 (EMEA/H/C/000798/II/0109)  and  the  Art  46  submissions  for  study  A2120  and  study  A1401  were submitted to the Agency on 14-Dec-2015 (EMA/H/C/798/P46-0050) and 11-Jul-2019 (EMA/H/C/000798/P46), respectively.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  MAH  has  provided  results  from  study  CAMN107A1402  conducted  to  investigate  the  safety  and efficacy  profile  of  Tasigna  in  clinical  use  for  Japanese  pediatric  patients  with  CML,  in  line  with  the approved marketing authorization in Japan.

The conclusion as provided with the MAH is fully endorsed; one serious AE (hyperbilirubinaemia) was reported in a 14-year-old female was reported to be related to Tasigna. No new safety concerns were detected in the pediatric population treated with Tasigna. The safety profile observed in this study is consistent  with  the  known  and  well  characterized  safety  profile  of  Tasigna  and  in  line  with  the information already presented in the approved SmPC.

The  benefit  risk  assessment  remains  unchanged  and  no  further  update  of  the  currently  approved SmPC is required.
