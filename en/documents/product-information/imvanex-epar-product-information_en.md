## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

IMVANEX suspension for injection Smallpox and monkeypox vaccine (Live Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara)

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One dose (0.5 ml) contains:

Modified Vaccinia Ankara - Bavarian Nordic Live virus 1 no less than 5 x 10 7 Inf.U *

*infectious units

1 Produced in chick embryo cells

This vaccine contains trace residues of chicken protein, benzonase, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (see section 4.3).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension for injection.

Light yellow to pale white colored, clear to milky suspension.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Active immunisation against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in individuals 12 years of age and older (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Primary vaccination (individuals previously not vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses)

A first dose of 0.5 ml should be administered on an elected date.

A second dose of 0.5 ml should be administered no less than 28 days after the first dose, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.

Booster vaccination (individuals previously vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses)

There are inadequate data to determine the appropriate timing of booster doses. If a booster dose is considered necessary then a single dose of 0.5 ml should be administered, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special population

Immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV infected, patients under immunosuppressive therapy) who have been previously vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses should receive two booster doses. The second booster vaccination should be given no less than 28 days after the first booster dose.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of IMVANEX in children below 12 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Immunisation should be carried out by subcutaneous injection, preferably into the upper arm.

For instructions on administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or trace residues (chicken protein, benzonase, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.

## Concurrent illness

Immunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not result in the deferral of vaccination.

## General recommendations

IMVANEX should not be administered by intravascular injection.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

The protective efficacy of IMVANEX against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus has not been studied in humans, see section 5.1.

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees.

There are inadequate data to determine the appropriate timing of booster doses.

Prior vaccination with IMVANEX may modify the cutaneous response ('take') to subsequently administered replication-competent smallpox vaccine resulting in a reduced or absent take, see section 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Individuals with atopic dermatitis

Individuals with atopic dermatitis developed more local and general symptoms after vaccination (see section 4.8)

## Immunocompromised individuals

Data have been generated in HIV infected individuals with CD4 counts ≥ 100 cells/µl and ≤ 750 cells/µl. Lower immune response data have been observed in HIV infected individuals compared to healthy individuals (see section 5.1). There are no data on the immune response to IMVANEX in other immunosuppressed individuals.

Two doses of IMVANEX given at a 7-day interval showed lower immune responses and slightly more local reactogenicity than two doses given at a 28-day interval. Therefore, dose intervals of less than 28 days should be avoided.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies with other vaccines or medicinal products have been performed. Therefore, concomitant administration of IMVANEX with other vaccines should be avoided. The concomitant administration of the vaccine with any immunoglobulin including Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) has not been studied and should be avoided.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of IMVANEX in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of IMVANEX during pregnancy. Administration of Imvanex in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risk to the mother and foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether IMVANEX is excreted in human milk. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of IMVANEX during breast-feeding. Administration of Imvanex during breast-feeding should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks to the mother and baby.

## Fertility

Animal studies did not reveal any evidence of impaired female and male fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is no information on the effect of IMVANEX on the ability to drive or use machines. However, some of the undesirable effects mentioned in section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or use machines (e.g. dizziness).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of IMVANEX has been assessed in 20 clinical trials in which 5 261 Vaccinia-naïve individuals received two doses of no less than 5 x 10 7 Inf.U four weeks apart while 534 Vaccinia- and IMVANEX-experienced individuals received a single booster dose.

The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were injection site reactions and common systemic reactions typical for vaccines which were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without intervention within seven days following vaccination.

Adverse reaction rates reported after either vaccination dose (1 st , 2 nd or booster) were similar.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions from all clinical trials are listed according to the following frequency:

Very common (≥1/10) Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100) Rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000) Unknown (cannot be estimated from the available data)

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD)

In a non-placebo controlled clinical trial that compared the safety of IMVANEX in individuals with AD to healthy individuals, individuals with AD reported erythema (61.2%) and swelling (52.2%) at the injection site with a higher frequency than healthy individuals (49.3% and 40.8%, respectively). The following general symptoms were reported more frequently in individuals with AD compared to healthy individuals: headache (33.1% vs. 24.8%), myalgia (31.8% vs. 22.3%), chills (10.7% vs. 3.8 %), nausea (11.9% vs. 6.8%), and fatigue (21.4% vs. 14.4%).

7% of the individuals with AD in clinical trials with IMVANEX experienced a flare-up or worsening of their skin condition during the course of the trial.

## Rash

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IMVANEX may trigger local rashes or more widespread eruptions.  Events  of rash after  vaccination (related cases observed in 0.4% of subjects) with IMVANEX tend to occur within the first days after vaccination, are mild to moderate in intensity and usually resolve without sequelae.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## Paediatric population

## Adolescents 12-18 years

Interim data from the currently ongoing study DMID 22-0020 suggest a mainly similar safety-profile in adolescents as in adults. The study enrolled 315 adolescents. Data up to Study Day 57 are considered clean. More than 99% received two vaccination doses. According to the current database, the most frequent injection site reaction was injection site pain (&gt; 70%), and the most frequent systemic adverse reactions were fatigue (&gt; 50%) and headache (50%).

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX

## Efficacy in animals

Non-human primate (NHP) studies have demonstrated that vaccination with IMVANEX induced a comparable immune response and protective efficacy to traditional smallpox vaccines used to eradicate smallpox and protected NHP from severe disease associated with a lethal challenge of monkeypox virus. As seen with traditional smallpox vaccines, a significant reduction in both mortality and morbidity (viral load, weight loss, number of pox lesions, etc.) compared to non-vaccinated controls was demonstrated for NHP vaccinated with IMVANEX.

Mouse studies have demonstrated that vaccination with IMVANEX protected mice from a lethal challenge of replicating vaccinia virus.

## Immunogenicity

## Seroconversion to vaccinia in Vaccinia-naïve healthy and special populations

The Vaccinia-naïve study population included healthy individuals as well as individuals with HIV infection and AD who received 2 doses of IMVANEX 4 weeks apart. Seroconversion rates in Vaccinianaïve individuals were defined as appearance of vaccinia antibody titers equal or greater than the assay cut-off value following receipt of two doses of IMVANEX. Seroconversion by ELISA and PRNT were as follows:

## Immunogenicity and attenuation of take of ACAM2000 in healthy subjects

Imvanex was compared to ACAM2000 (a 'second generation' live attenuated smallpox vaccine produced in cell culture and licenced in the United States of America) in a randomized, open-label noninferiority clinical trial in healthy adults (US military personnel) aged 18 to 42 years and who were naïve to smallpox vaccine (Study POX-MVA-006).

A total of 433 subjects were randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either two doses of Imvanex followed by a single dose of ACAM2000 at four weeks intervals or to receive a single dose of ACAM2000. ACAM2000 was administered via scarification.

The first co-primary endpoint compared vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody responses at the peak visits (day 42 after first vaccination for Imvanex where the subjects received two doses according to the standard vaccination schedule and day 28 for ACAM2000). Imvanex induced a peak neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) of 153.5 (n = 185; 95% CI 134.3, 175.6), which was non-inferior to the GMT of 79.3 (n = 186; 95% CI 67.1, 93.8) obtained after scarification with ACAM2000.

The second co-primary endpoint evaluated if vaccination with Imvanex (n = 165) prior to administration of ACAM2000 results in an attenuation of the cutaneous reaction to ACAM2000 (n = 161) as measured by maximum lesion area in mm 2 . At day 13-15, the median maximum lesion area for subjects who were administered ACAM2000 was 75mm 2  (95% CI 69.0, 85.0) and for those who received Imvanex it was 0.0 (95% CI 0.0, 2.0).

## Vaccine effectiveness

In real-world observational studies conducted in vaccine-eligible individuals (according to local recommendations), vaccine effectiveness against mpox disease was demonstrated at least 14 days after vaccination a , with adjusted vaccine effectiveness estimates ranging from 35% (95% CI, -2-59) to 89% (95% CI, 76-95) after one IMVANEX dose and from 66% (95% CI, 47-78) to 90% (95% CI, 86-92) after two IMVANEX doses.

## Impact on hospitalisation

In a surveillance study conducted from May 2022 to May 2023 in the US, IMVANEX was shown to reduce the risks of mpox-related hospitalisation. Compared with unvaccinated mpox patients, the odds of hospitalisation were 0.27 (95% CI, 0.08-0.65) after one IMVANEX dose, and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.01-0.90) after two IMVANEX doses. The estimated relative risk reduction was 73% after one IMVANEX dose and 80% after two IMVANEX doses.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with IMVANEX in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for prevention of smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus by active immunisation against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus infection and disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

A study in adolescents (DMID 22-0020 7 ) is currently ongoing with immunogenicity data up to Study Day 43 (14 days Post Dose 2) already available. The results of the primary endpoint show non-inferiority regarding antibody response of adolescents to adults in the vaccinia specific neutralization assay.

<!-- image -->

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What IMVANEX is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given IMVANEX
3. How IMVANEX is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store IMVANEX
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What IMVANEX is and what it is used for

IMVANEX is a vaccine used to prevent smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection in the form of antibodies against the smallpox, monkeypox and vaccinia viruses.

IMVANEX does not contain smallpox virus (Variola) or monkeypox virus or vaccinia viruses. It cannot spread or cause smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia infection and disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given IMVANEX

## You must not receive IMVANEX:

- if you are allergic or have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) or chicken protein, benzonase, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin which may be present in the vaccine in very small amounts.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before receiving IMVANEX:

- if you have atopic dermatitis (see section 4).
- if you have HIV infection or any other condition or treatment leading to a weakened immune system.
- if you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The protective efficacy of IMVANEX against smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus has not been studied in humans.

In case of illness with high temperature, your doctor will postpone the vaccination until you are feeling better. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not require postponement of the vaccination, but talk to your doctor or nurse first.

IMVANEX may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated.

Prior vaccination with IMVANEX may modify the cutaneous response ('take') to subsequently administered replication-competent smallpox vaccine resulting in a reduced or absent take.

## Other medicines or vaccines and IMVANEX

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines or if you have recently received any other vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are a pregnant or breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask to your doctor for advice. The use of this vaccine during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not recommended. However, your doctor will assess whether the possible benefit in terms of preventing smallpox, monkeypox and disease caused by vaccinia virus would outweigh the potential risks to you and your foetus/baby.

## Driving and using machines

There is no information on the effect of IMVANEX on your ability to drive or use machines. However, it is possible that if you experience any of the side effects listed in section 4, then some of these may affect your ability to drive or use machines (e.g. dizziness).

## IMVANEX contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## 3. How IMVANEX is given

You can be given this vaccine whether or not you have received smallpox vaccination in the past.

The vaccine will be injected under the skin, preferably into the upper arm, by your doctor or a nurse. It must not be injected into a blood vessel.

## If you have never been vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses:

- You will receive two injections.
- The second injection will be given no less than 28 days after the first.
- Make sure you complete the vaccination course of two injections.

## If you have previously been vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses:

- You will receive one injection.
- If your immune system is weakened you will receive two injections with the second injection no less than 28 days after the first.

## If you miss an appointment for your injection of IMVANEX

If you miss a scheduled injection, tell your doctor or nurse and arrange another visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects

Contact a doctor immediately, or go immediately to the emergency department of your nearest hospital if you experience any of the following symptoms:

- difficulty in breathing
- dizziness
- swelling of the face and neck.

These symptoms may be a sign of a serious allergic reaction.

## Other side effects

If you already have atopic dermatitis, you may experience more intense local skin reactions (such as redness, swelling and itching) and other general symptoms (such as headache, muscle pain, feeling sick or tired), as well as a flare-up or worsening of your skin condition.
