## II.  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT RATIONALE

The purpose of this file is to summarize pediatric data with desloratadine collected by the Market Authorisation Holder in four studies with pediatric and/or adolescent subjects that have not been previously submitted to the EMEA.

Desloratadine (DL) is a second-generation, non sedating, oral, selective, peripheral H1receptor  antagonist  that  is  approved  and  marketed  in  the  European  Union  for  the treatment  of  allergic  rhinitis  and  urticaria.    DL  Tablets  were  first  approved  in  January 2001 for use in adolescent and adult patients 12 years of age and older. DL syrup was initially approved in April 2002 for pediatric use down to 2 years of age, and extended in September 2004 for use down to 1 years of age.

The once-daily 5-mg DL tablet, RediTabs (orodispersible) tablet, and DL syrup (10 mL) are approved in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and over. The once-daily DL 2.5-mg RediTabs (orodispersible) tablet and DL syrup (5 mL) are approved in children 6 to 11 years of age. The DL syrup (2.5 mL) is approved in children 12 months to 5 years of age at a dose of 1.25 mg once daily. In the EU, a sugar-and dye-free DL oral solution has replaced the syrup at the same dosages. Desloratadine is indicated in the EU for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relief  of  the  symptoms  of  allergic  rhinitis  (including  intermittent  and  persistent  allergic rhinitis) and urticaria in patients down to 1 year of age.

The  four  studies  described  in  this  file  included  a  total  of  4374  subjects.  Two  studies (Study  Nos.  P04446  and  P04706)  included  133  pediatric  subjects  between  1  and  11 years of age and three studies (Study Nos. P04683, P04684, and P04706) included 244 adolescent subjects between 12 and 17 years of age and 3994 subjects ≥18 years of age. The ages of three subjects in Study No. P04706 were not specified. A list of studies included in this response is presented in Table 2.

## Study P04683

Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group,

Multicenter/Multinational, Efficacy and Safety Study of Desloratadine 5 mg in the Treatment of Subjects With Allergic Rhinitis Who Meet the Criteria for Intermittent Allergic Rhinitis (IAR) (SCH 34117).

## Objective(s):

Primary: The primary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of desloratadine (DL) with placebo in the symptomatic treatment of subjects 12 years and older with intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR).

Secondary: The secondary objectives were to compare the effects of DL to those of placebo on quality of life and impact on productivity and health care utilization.

Number of subjects:

547.

Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects 12 years of age or older, of either sex with at least a 2-year history consistent with allergic rhinitis who met the criteria for IAR (defined as symptoms of allergic rhinitis present less than four days per week or for less than four consecutive weeks per year) were to be included in the study.

Duration of Treatment: 15 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results

## Efficacy

Primary  endpoint:  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  change  from baseline in the subjects AM/PM PRIOR total 5 symptom score (T5SS) over Days 1 to 15 of treatment. T5SS = Severity scores for five individual allergic rhinitis symptoms (nasal congestion/stuffiness,  sneezing,  rhinorrhea/nasal  discharge,  nasal  pruritus  and  ocular pruritus). Each symptom was scored 0 to 3. The scores were defined for T5SS as 0: no symptoms to 15: all severe symptoms. Analyses were performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA), extracting sources of variation due to treatment and site.

A significantly greater decrease from baseline in the average AM/PM-PRIOR T5SS over days  1  to  15  was  seen  with  DL  vs.  Placebo  (-3.01  vs.  -2.13;  P&lt;0.001).  Significantly greater decreases in AM/PM-PRIOR T5SS with DL vs. Placebo occurred from Day 1 (P= 0.001) and on all 15 days of the study (P≤0.013). The significant effect of DL on T5SS endured across the full 24-hour dosing period (AM NOW T5SS) as early as the first full 24-hour measurement on Day 2 (P&lt; 0.001) and averaged over Days 2 to 15 (P&lt; 0.001).

Key Secondary Endpoint: The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ-S) Total Score at the Final Visit (Endpoint evaluation as LOCF to the Final Visit). The RQLQ-S was only completed for  subjects  ≥18  years  of  age.  The  RQLQ  Total  Score  was  analyzed  using  the  same ANOVA  as  specified  for the primary endpoint. A significantly greater  decrease (improvement) from baseline in total RQLQ-S score was seen in the DL group (-1.10 [38.2%]) vs placebo (-0.73 [-24.9%]) (P&lt; 0.001) at the study endpoint. Since statistical significance of the primary efficacy variable was achieved, the overall alpha level of 5% is preserved for total RQLQ-S.

The  RQLQ-S  domains  of  activity,  non-nose/eye  symptoms,  practical  problems,  nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotion scores were also significantly improved with DL vs placebo (P≤0.007). Subjects with severe symptom score (with higher baseline diary T5SS  [≥8.5/15])  had  larger  improvements  from  baseline  in  total  RQLQ-S  with  DL  vs placebo, with an effect size (0.55).

Secondary  endpoints:  In  addition  to  the  AM/PM  PRIOR  T5SS,  a  significantly  greater improvement  from  baseline  in  average  AM/PM  PRIOR  nasal  congestion  scores  over days 1 to 15 was seen with DL vs. Placebo (-0.56 vs. -0.43, respectively; P=0.013). This benefit  favoring  DL  was  seen  as  early  as  Day  1  of  treatment  (p&lt;0.017).  Nasal congestion was significantly lower with DL vs. Placebo at the end  of the first 24-hour dosing interval (AM NOW Day 2; P≤0.001). Mean AM/PM PRIOR scores for rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal itching were also significantly lower in the DL vs. Placebo on Day 1, over week 1, week 2 and over Days 1 to 15 (P≤0.033).  Eye itching was significantly lower in the DL group over week 1 (P=0.021) and was numerically lower over Days 1 to 15 (P= 0.051). Rhinorrhea, sneezing, eye itching and nasal itching scores at the end of the 24-hour dosing period (AM NOW) were significantly lower with DL at Day 2 ( end of the first 24- hour interval; (P≤0.035)) and across Days 2 to 15 (P≤0.036).

A significantly greater decrease (improvement) from baseline in total RQLQ score was seen in the DL group (-1.10 [-38.2%]) versus Placebo (-0.73 [-24.9%]) (P&lt;0.001) at the study  endpoint.  The  RQLQ  domains  of  activity,  non-nose/eye  symptoms,  practical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotion scores were also significantly improved with  DL  versus  Placebo  (P≤0.007).  Subjects  with  severe  symptom  score  at baseline (higher baseline diary T5SS [≥8.5/15]) had larger improvements from baseline in total RQLQ with DL versus Placebo, with an effect size (0.55).

The evaluation of therapeutic response by subjects in the DL 5- mg treatment group at the final visit (LOCF to the Final Visit) (3.24) was significantly lower (improved) than the evaluation of subjects in the placebo group (3.66) (P&lt; 0.001).

There was a significantly greater decrease from baseline in the VAS score with DL (17.2  [-30.6%])  versus  Placebo  (-10.9  [-17.0%])  (P&lt;  0.001).  The  VAS  score  was significantly improved with DL on all treatment days.

The DL group had greater improvements from baseline in scores for interference with sleep than placebo over the duration of the study (P= 0.039). The DL group had greater improvements from baseline in scores for interference with activities of daily living than placebo over the duration of the study (P&lt; 0.001).

## Safety

There  were  relatively  few  adverse  events  reported  by  the  subjects  in  this  study.  The overall  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between the DL 5-mg group (20.7%) and the Placebo group (21.0%). Additionally, neither treatment group  had  a  greater  frequency  of  any  adverse  event  relative  to  the  other  treatment group.  The  only  adverse  event  that  was  reported  by  more  than  5%  of  subjects  was headache, which  was  reported  by  18  subjects  (6.5%)  in  the  DL  5-  mg  group  and  17 subjects (6.3%) in the placebo group. No pattern of adverse events occurred at a greater frequency in the DL 5-mg group compared to the placebo group. The number of subjects who experienced treatment-related  adverse  events  was  similar  between  the  DL  5-mg treatment group (20 subjects [7.2%]) and the placebo group (19 subjects [7.0%]). The most  frequently  occurring  treatment-related  adverse  event  was  headache,  which  was reported by 7 subjects (2.5%) in the DL 5- mg group and by 5 subjects (1.8%) in the placebo  group.  All  other  treatment-  emergent  adverse  events  occurred  in  &lt;2%  of subjects in either treatment group. There were no deaths or severe or life-threatening adverse events in this study.

DL - desloratadine.

## Study P04684

Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-group, Multicenter/Multinational, Efficacy and Safety Study of Desloratadine (SCH 34117) 5 mg in the Treatment of Subjects With Allergic Rhinitis Who Meet the Criteria for Persistent Allergic Rhinitis (PER)

## Objective(s):

Primary  Objective:  The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of desloratadine (DL) with placebo in the symptomatic treatment of subjects 12 years and older with persistent allergic rhinitis (PER).

Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives were to compare the effects of DL to those of placebo on quality of life and impact on productivity and health care utilization.

Number of subjects: 716.

Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects 12 years and older, of either sex with at least  a  2-year  history  of  allergic  rhinitis  who  met  the  criteria  for  PER  (defined  as symptoms of allergic rhinitis that were present for four days or more per week and for four or more consecutive weeks per year) were selected for the study.

Duration of Treatment:

12 weeks.

## Results

## Efficacy

Primary efficacy Variable:

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  change  from  baseline  in  the subjects' AM/PM PRIOR T5SS over days 1 to 29 of treatment. T5SS = Severity scores for  five  individual  allergic  rhinitis  symptoms  (nasal  congestion/stuffiness,  sneezing, rhinorrhea/nasal  discharge,  nasal  pruritus  and  ocular  pruritus).  Each  symptom  was scored 0 to 3. The scores were defined as 0: no symptoms to 15: all severe symptoms. Analyses were performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA), extracting sources of variation due to treatment and site.

A significantly greater decrease form baseline in the average AM/PM-PRIOR T5SS over days 1 to 29 was seen with DL vs placebo (-3.76 vs -2.87; p&lt;0.001). Significantly greater decreases  were  observed  from  day  1  with  DL  vs  Placebo  in  AM/PM-PRIOR  T5SS (p=0.010) and with all individual symptom scores (p≤0.006) on Days 1 to 29.

In  addition  to  the  T5SS,  a  significantly  greater  improvement  from baseline  in  average AM/PM PRIOR nasal congestion scores over Days 1 to 29 was seen with DL vs Placebo (-  0.69  vs.  -  0.53,  respectively;  P=0.002).  Mean  AM/PM  PRIOR  scores  for  rhinorrhea and eye itching were significantly lower with DL vs Placebo as early as Day 1 (P≤0.042), score  for  sneezing  was  significantly  lower  with  DL  vs  Placebo  as  early  as  Day  2 (P≤0.016), and nasal itching were significantly lower with DL vs Placebo on Day 3 (P= 0.005).

## Safety

There  were  relatively  few  adverse  events  reported  by  the  subjects  in  this  study.  The overall  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between the DL  5  mg  group  (40.6%)  and  the  placebo  group  (34.6%).  The  DL  5  mg  group  had  a somewhat greater incidence of nasopharyngitis (10.6% vs 4.8%), somnolence (2.2% vs 0.3%),  and  cough  (2.8%  vs  1.4%).  Subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  somewhat greater  incidence  of  headache  (10.4%)  compared  to  the  DL  5  mg  group  (6.9%).  The only adverse events that were reported by more than 5% of subjects were headache, which was reported by 25 subjects (6.9%) in the DL 5 mg group and 37 subjects (10.4%) in the placebo group, and nasopharyngitis, which was reported by 38 subjects (10.6%) of subjects in the DL 5 mg group and by 17 subjects (4.8%) of subjects in the placebo group. The number of subjects who experienced treatment-related adverse events was similar  between  the  DL  5  mg  treatment  group  (36  subjects  [10.0%])  and  the  placebo group (30 subjects [8.4%]). The two most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, which was reported by 7 subjects (1.9%) in the DL 5 mg group and by  9  subjects  (2.5%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  headache,  which  was  reported  by  6 subjects (1.7%) in the DL 5 mg group and by 7 subjects (2.0%) in the placebo group. All other treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in &lt; 2% of subjects in either treatment group.

The number of severe adverse events was similar between the two treatment groups. Most  severe  adverse  events  were  only  reported  by  one  subject  each.  The  most commonly reported  severe  adverse  events  were  headache,  which  was  reported  by  3 subjects (0.8%) in the DL 5 mg group and by 5 subjects (1.4%) in the placebo group. In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

addition two subjects (0.6%) in the placebo group also reported sinus headaches and one subject (0.3%) in the placebo group reported migraine that were considered severe by the investigator. Sinus headache and migraine were not reported by subjects in the DL 5 mg group. Fatigue and gastroenteritis were reported by three subjects (0.8%) and two subjects (0.6%), respectively in the DL 5 mg group. These two adverse events were not  reported  by  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  All  other  severe  adverse  events  were reported by one subject each.

There  was  one  life-threatening  adverse  event  reported  by  a  subject  in  the  placebo group.  Subject  No.  1449  experienced  a  myocardial  infarction  that  was  considered unrelated to study treatment. The subject was discontinued from the study.

There were five severe adverse events (0.7%) that were considered by the investigator to  be  either  possibly  or  probably  related  to  study  treatment.  Three  severe  adverse events (0.7%) were reported by subjects in the DL 5 mg group and two severe adverse events (0.5%) were reported by subjects in the placebo group.

There were three subjects (0.4%) who experienced four serious adverse events reported during the study. None of the serious adverse events were considered related to study treatment.  One  subject  (Subject  No.  1453)  in  the  DL  5-  mg  group  reported  a  serious adverse event (lower limb fracture). Two subjects in the placebo group reported serious adverse events. Subject No. 756 experienced a diverticulum intestinal and Subject No. 1449  experienced  a bronchospasm  and  acute  myocardial  infarction,  which  was considered life threatening by the investigator. One subject (Subject No. S00006) who was  screened  but  was  not  randomized  to  study  drug  experienced  dizziness,  ataxia, nausea,  vomiting,  spondylosis  arterial  hypertension,  and  a  transient  ischemic  attack. The transient ischemic attach was considered life-threatening.

A  total  of  23  subjects  (3.2%)  were  discontinued  from  the  study  because  of  adverse events: seven subjects (1.9%) in the DL 5-mg treatment group and 16 subjects (4.5%) in the placebo group. One subject (Subject No. 001453) in the DL 5-mg treatment group and two subjects (Subject Nos. 000756 and 001449) in the placebo group had adverse events that were considered severe, but these adverse events were considered unlikely related  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigators.  One  of  the  adverse  events  (acute myocardial infarction) experienced by Subject No. 001449 was considered life threatening by the investigator. All other adverse events that resulted in discontinuation from the study, including adverse events that were considered to be possibly or probably related to study drug, were considered to be mild-to-moderate in severity.

Four subjects  in  the  DL  5  mg  group  and  two  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  their treatment  interrupted  due  to  adverse  events.  All  adverse  event  leading  to  study  drug interruption were considered mild-to-moderate in severity and were considered unlikely related to study treatment.

## Study P04446

Non-Interventional Trial of the Safe Use of Aerius (Desloratadine) in Pediatric Patients With Allergic Rhinitis or Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria.

## Objective(s):

The objective of this non-interventional study was to evaluate the safety of Aerius syrup in pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years old with allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria.

Number of subjects:

100.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: Pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years old with allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria.

Duration of treatment: 1 to 9 weeks.

## Results

## Efficacy

Efficacy of the DL 1.25 mg dose of Aerius syrup was evaluated and measured by the amount of relief each subject experienced from the baseline visit to the final visit. Eightyeight subjects (88.9%) reported either marked or complete relief. Only two subjects (one subject with each condition) reported treatment failure.

Most  subjects  (77  subjects)  showed  an  improvement  in  symptoms  from  Baseline  to Follow-up.  None  of  the  subjects  showed  a  worsening  of  symptoms  from  Baseline  to Follow-up, and only 22 subjects reported that their symptoms remained the same. Most subjects  (20  subjects  [20%])  who  reported  no  change  in  symptoms  evaluated  their symptoms as 'mild' at Baseline, and two subjects (2.0%) evaluated their symptoms as 'moderate'  at  Baseline.  There  were  four  subjects  whose  symptoms  were  'severe'  at Baseline. The symptoms of two of these subjects were improved to 'moderate' and the symptoms of two of these subjects were improved to 'mild'.

## Safety

Forty-five of the 100 subjects (45.0%) reported adverse events in this study. Only four adverse  events  were  reported  by  at  least  5%  of  subjects.  Vomiting  and  cough  were reported  by  6  subjects  (6.0%)  each  and  diarrhoea  and  bronchitis  were  reported  by  5 subjects (5.0%) each.

Ten subjects (10.0%) reported treatment-emergent adverse events that were considered possibly related to treatment with desloratadine. The most common treatment-related, treatment-emergent adverse event was diarrhoea, which occurred in 4 subjects. Most of these  adverse  events  were  considered  mild-to-moderate  in  severity.  Subject  10/04 experienced  emotional  distress  that  was  considered  severe  and  possibly  related  to treatment.  This  subject  discontinued  treatment  due  to  this  adverse  event.  No  other treatment-related adverse event was considered severe.

There were no life-threatening adverse events in this study. Two subjects experienced adverse  events  that  were  considered  severe.  Subject  10/04  experienced  emotional distress  that  was  considered  severe  and  possibly  related  to  treatment.  This  subject discontinued treatment due to this adverse event. Subject 03/08 experienced pyrexia, tonsillitis,  and  vomiting  that  were  considered  severe.  The  subject  also  experienced dehydration, which was considered moderate in severity, and resulted in interruption of treatment. These were serious adverse events that were considered unlikely related to treatment.
