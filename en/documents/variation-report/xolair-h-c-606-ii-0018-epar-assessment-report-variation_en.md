## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

Xolair (omalizumab) is a humanised anti-IgE antibody manufactured by  recombinant  DNA technology  in  a  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  mammalian  cell  line.  It  is  currently  indicated  for treatment of severe allergic asthma in patients (12 years of age or older) in whom standard treatment has  failed.  Xolair  is  usually  administered  subcutaneously  every  2  to  4  weeks.  Xolair  was  first registered in Australia in June 2002. In October 2005 a marketing authorisation was granted in the EU member states.

A CHMP Scientific advice from June 2008 recognised the bioequivalence of the new form (used in study IA05), established in an adult population, was applicable also in the paediatric population.

The scope of the present variation application is to include information on a paediatric indication in children from 6 to &lt;12 years of age as add-on therapy in order to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent allergic asthma.

## I.1 NON-CLINICAL ASPECTS

No new data has been submitted. Adequate non-clinical testing, including repeat dose toxicity studies in  juvenile  cynomolgus  monkeys,  has  previously  been  reported  by  the  MAH.  The  conclusions,  in relation to the paediatric indication, are that omalizumab is well tolerated in non-human primates, with the exception of a dose-related and age-dependent decrease in blood platelets, which was seen with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. Relevant information has already been included in the SPC.

## I.1.1 Environmental Risk Assessment

No additional ERA was provided as the MAH justified that no appreciable risk for the environment emerges from the use of Xolair. The CHMP accepted the justification.

## I.2 CLINICAL ASPECTS

## I.2.1 Clinical pharmacology

The clinical  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  documentation  for  Xolair  (omalizumab)  in  the paediatric population comprise data from two studies:

- Study IA05 ,  which is a 1-year double-blind study in children (6 - &lt;12 years) with moderatesevere,  persistent,  inadequately  controlled  allergic  asthma.  This  is  the  pivotal  study  and comprises the main evidence for the applied indication.
- Study 010 , which is a 7-month double-blind trial with a 5-month open-label extension period in children (6-12 years) with allergic asthma requiring daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. This  study  has  been  submitted  in  previous  applications,  and  is  considered  supportive  for  the present type II variation.

In  both  studies  Xolair  was  administered  by  subcutaneous  injections  every  second  or  fourth  week according to patient's  pre-treatment  body  weight  and  baseline  IgE  levels  although  the  exact  dosing schedule  differed  somewhat  in  the  two  studies.  In  study  010,  the  dosing  schedule  deviates  slightly from the one recommended in the proposed SPC for this type II variation. In study IA05, the dosing schedule is the same as the one recommended in the proposed SPC. The pharmaceutical formulation used in these studies was the powder and solvent for solution for  injection.

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP, as stated by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## I.2.1.2  Pharmaceutical formulation

This  variation  application  concerns  both  approved  pharmaceutical  formulations  for  Xolair:  powder and  solvent  for  solution  for  injection  and  solution  for  injection  (75  and  150  mg).  The  extension application for solution for injection (EMEA/H/C/606/X/14 ) recently obtained European Commission Decision on the basis of a study (study 2204), which was a single-dose, parallel-group investigation of omalizumab bioequivalence between the two formulations (150 and 300 mg s.c.) performed in healthy but atopic volunteers with total IgE above normal levels (30- 300 IU/mL) at the screening visit.

Demonstration of bioequivalence in adults is regarded as adequate to detect formulation differences and  the  results  from  study  2204  therefore  allow  extrapolation  to  other  sub-populations.  Thus,  the clinical  studies  performed  using  the  original  formulation  (powder  and  solvent)  are  considered  to reflect also the efficacy and safety following treatment with the solution for injection.

This issue was discussed in the Scientific Advice.

## I.2.1.3  Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model

A population model describing the binding and turnover of omalizumab and IgE was presented. The starting  point  for  this  model  was  a  previously 1 described  model.  The  measurement  used  for  this purpose comprised total omalizumab concentrations, free and total IgE concentrations.

In  addition,  an  investigation  of  the  relationship  between  model-derived  free  IgE  concentrations  and changes in clinical outcomes in paediatric patients was performed. Additional data used for this aim were clinical signs and symptoms of asthma, total symptom score (TSS), peak expiratory flow (PEF), rescue medication use (RESC), forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) and exacerbations.

## Data used for models

The analysis included data from six studies, whereof two were studies 010 and IA05 as described above.

In addition data from the following studies in non-paediatric subjects were included:

- Studies 8 and 9: 7-month studies with 5-month blinded extension periods in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma requiring daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroids
- study 11: 32-week pilot trial to assess corticosteroid reduction in adolescents and adults with severe allergic asthma requiring daily treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, with or without oral corticosteroid
- Study 2204: single-dose, parallel-group, investigation of omalizumab bioequivalence (150 and 300 mg s.c.) in healthy but atopic volunteers with total IgE above normal levels (30-300 IU/mL) at the screening visit

The model was developed using data from both omalizumab- and placebo-treated patients. The full data set contained 7877 omalizumab concentrations from 1481 subjects, 13645 total IgE concentrations  from  2364  subjects,  and  7498  free  IgE  concentrations  from  1479  subjects.  The demographic data are shown in Table 1. It can be seen here that the baseline IgE levels on average are higher in the paediatric patients compared with adults/adolescents.

Samples were excluded due to one of the following reasons: inappropriate concentration values ( e.g.: a positive omalizumab concentration in a placebo subject), free IgE measurement greater than the upper limit  of  quantification,  inconsistencies  between  the  PK/PD  and  clinical  databases,  missing  baseline total IgE (a required covariate for model analysis, in which case the entire subject was removed), or samples not received by the analytical laboratory.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following a single omalizumab dose, omalizumab concentrations rises above 10,000 ng/mL while free IgE was suppressed to approximately 10 ng/mL. Following multiple dosing further suppression of free IgE is achieved. At the same time, total IgE increased.

In  the  next  Table  1  below,  the  observed  data  at  steady  state  from  all  the  included  studies  were summarised and grouped on the basis of paediatric/adult and baseline IgE levels. It was noted that it is most  paediatric  patients  having  high  baseline  values,  but  the  distributions  were  overlapping.  As expected,  patients  with  low  baseline  IgE  had  the  lowest  exposure  to  omalizumab  as  the  dose  is adjusted  for  the  baseline  IgE  level  and  accordingly,  patients  with  higher  baseline  IgE  had  higher exposures. It appeared however, that the used dosing schedule ensures that free IgE was suppressed to the same level irrespective of their baselines and their weight.

Omalizumab PK and IgE concentrations are summarised for trough samples drawn 84 days or more after commencing treatment with active omalizumab in the moderate to severe allergic asthma studies 10, IA05, 8, 9 and 11. Paediatric patients are those less than 12 years of age.

## Population model describing the binding and turnover of omalizumab and IgE

The binding and turnover model applied as a starting point is graphically illustrated in Figure 1. The model is defined as a system of differential equations describing the rate of change of omalizumab at the administration site, of total omalizumab and of total IgE. Molar units have been used throughout the modelling.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1.   Graphical illustration of the omalizumab-IgE binging and turnover model.

<!-- image -->

In this model the following parameters were estimated:

- ka the absorption rate constant of omalizumab
- RE   the rate of production of IgE

CLn  clearance terms for free omalizumab, free IgE and for the omalizumab:IgE complex

Vn   volume terms for omalizumab, free IgE and for the omalizumab:IgE complex

- Kd the in vivo , apparent equilibrium binding constant
- α the  change  in  the  affinity  of  binding  between  omalizumab  and  IgE  as  a  function  of  the molar ratio of total omalizumab and total IgE

Body weight was included as a covariate on all clearance and volume terms (apart from volume for free IgE) and on IgE production rate. Further, baseline IgE (IgE0) was included as a covariate on IgE clearance, IgE production rate and the equilibrium binding constant. The relationships were included as power function:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Other potential population covariates were explored graphically, using the empirical Bayes estimates of the inter-individual random effects (ETAs). This was performed for age, body mass index (BMI), sex, race and study.

Overall, the model fitted the omalizumab and total IgE well; however, for the free IgE there was a tendency  of  over-prediction  of  low  and  high  observations.  It  can  be  noted  that  the  exponents describing the effect of body weight were estimated for each parameter, thus, varying estimates were obtained.

The half-lives,  as  calculated  from  the  clearances  and  volumes,  of  the  three  modelled  entities,  were 28.5 (free omalizumab), 2.4 (omalizumab:IgE complex) and 2.1 (free IgE) days. However, note that omalizumab in vivo is based on total omalizumab concentrations (free and complex) and therefore the characteristics  are  recognized  as  non-linear.  Thus,  the  observed  half-life  for  omalizumab  will  vary over time and with IgE production.

A predictive check was performed in which the analysis dataset, with dosing regimens, sampling times and covariates (bodyweight and baseline IgE) from each patient, was replicated 10 times, then used with the final  model to  simulate omalizumab, total IgE and free IgE concentrations at steady state, approximately 6 months after dosing. The patients were then divided into nine subsets, based on the minimum to lower third, lower to middle third, and middle third to maximum baseline IgE values (20, 207.6, 459.4, 1371 IU/mL) and bodyweights (19.3, 40.4, 72.7, 150 kg). For each subset, a histogram of the observed steady-state free IgE levels was overlaid with that predicted from the simulation, to test the ability of the model to predict the free IgE across the dosing table. In general, there is a good agreement between observations and predictions as illustrated with the free IgE observations.

## Relationship between model-derived free IgE concentrations and changes in clinical outcomes

This analysis was a graphical analysis. For the phase III studies, based on patients' diary card data, mean changes from baseline were determined for total asthma symptoms score, mean morning peak

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

expiratory  flow  and  rescue  medication  use.  For  each  patient,  the  changes  from  baseline  in  these clinical outcomes were summarized into 28-day arithmetic means.

In Study IA05, asthma exacerbation episodes were also reported on a daily basis. The percentage of patients experiencing exacerbations during each 28 day period was calculated.

In addition, for both paediatric studies, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was measured at scheduled visits. The raw data were then normalised to a percentage of their predicted FEV1 (using the  Polgar  standard  calculation),  and  both  the  raw  and  predicted  FEV1  values  were  adjusted  as  a change from each patient's baseline value.

Correlations  between  free  IgE  and  the  clinical  variables  were  constructed  by  producing,  for  each patient,  post-hoc  predictions  of  their  free  IgE  at  the  midpoint  of  each  28-day  clinical  observation period, i.e. at 14 days, 42 days and every 28 days thereafter. The time-matched pairs of values for each observation period were then summarized across patients, using arithmetic means for the change in clinical variables (which were normally distributed) and geometric means for free IgE (log-normally distributed).

The plots revealed that there was a marked placebo response in all the clinical endpoints; from the diary data ( e.g. peak expiratory flow and rescue medication use) to the investigator measured FEV1. An effect in addition to placebo was indicated from the plots in FEV1 and exacerbations. Further, the suppression of free IgE is rapid, but the effect on clinical outcomes were delayed. In addition, in study IA05, where clinical symptoms were recorded after cessation of treatment, it took some time for the symptoms of asthma to re-emerge, with a distinct time lag being evident especially in the placebocorrected probability of asthma exacerbation.

## I.2.1.4  Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The  population  binding  and  turnover  model  describing  omalizumab  and  IgE  levels  contain  the covariates  used  in  the  dosing  schedule  for  omalizumab,  i.e.  body  weight  and  baseline  IgE  levels. However,  it  is  not  completely  clear,  that  the  chosen  dosing  schedule  is  the  most  adequate  one. However,  it  has  been  used  in  the  pivotal  clinical  trial  in  paediatric  patients  (study  IA05)  and  is indicated  to  result  in  sufficient  suppression  of  free  IgE  levels.  During  the  March  2009  CHMP  the MAH  was  requested  to  provide  additional  information  on  the  clinical  pharmacology  which  was submitted  in  April  2009.  With  the  proposed  dosing  regimen  in  children,  the  free  IgE  levels  are considered  sufficiently  suppressed  irrespective  of  body  weight  and  baseline  IgE  levels.  There  is  a general trend that the omalizumab and the total IgE levels are higher in the paediatric patients, and particularly  in  subjects  with  high  baseline  IgE  levels.  As  the  free  IgE  is  a  good  biomarker  for  the clinical effect, the dosing from a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic perspective appeared reasonable. With the changes proposed in the Product Information the issue has been adequately finalised.

## I.2.2 Clinical Efficacy

During  the  CHMP  Scientific  Advice  the  relevance  of  a  proposed  application  submission  for  a paediatric indication was discussed.

The main messages in the Scientific Advice were:

- The paediatric population studied in the phase III trial IA05 is not representative of the population that may be treated with omalizumab .
- The onus is on the MAH to demonstrate that the data from the population aged 6 to &lt; 12 years fulfil the criteria as defined in the current label. If the MAH is seeking a broader indication i.e. access to a milder population, this should be done in adults first, than children.
- A clear definition of an asthma cerebration should be used.
- Safety data for targeted population, children with severe persistent allergic asthma, should be presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH stated in the Clinical Overview of this variation application that in the paediatric program, the  pivotal  study  design  for  CIGE025IA05  was  set  up  prior  to  the  EU  registration  of  Xolair  in adolescents/adults severe allergic asthmatic patients, at that time the need to examine the most severe paediatric group was anticipated. Therefore, analyses of the primary efficacy variable and secondary variables  within  a  sub-group  of  patients  who  were  inadequately  controlled,  on  high  dose  inhaled steroids (ICS) and a long acting beta2-agonist (LABA) was prospectively planned.

The MAH has obtained CHMP Scientific Advice about the proposed extension of the current MA. The response from the CHMP provided guidance for the preparation of this submission.

In  the  pivotal  Study  IA05  the  predefined  analysis  plan,  identified  a  specific  subset  of  patients  with high dose ICS ( ≥ 500 mcg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus LABA, henceforth referred to as the EU(P) population .  This  population  reflected  the  approved  omalizumab  population  of  patients  12  years  or older,  as  well  as  following  GINA  (Global  Initiative  for  Asthma)  guidelines.  This  EUP  population subset of patients represents 41% of Xolair patients and 39.5% of placebo patients in study IA05.

To  be  consistent  with  the  current  approved  population  of  12  years  and  older,  as  well  as  GINA guidelines, omalizumab is proposed for use as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in adult and adolescent  patients  (6  years  of  age  and  above)  with  severe  persistent  allergic  asthma  who  have  a positive  skin  test  or  in  vitro  reactivity  to  a  perennial  aeroallergen  and  who  have  frequent  daytime symptoms  or  night-time  awakenings  and  who  have  had  multiple  documented  severe  asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled β 2 -agonist.

The two submitted placebo-controlled studies that provide data to support the efficacy claim in the paediatric  population  are  study  IA05  and  010.  Following  the  CHMP  request,  the  IA05  study  is presented in two parts;

- Including the whole population.
- Including only the EU population as defined above.

## I.2.2.1  Main clinical studies

In the following, the IA05 study results from the 'EU population' are considered as the main 'pivotal' results. The full IA05 study will be assessed in the Supportive Studies section which follows.

The Trial Study IGE025A IA05 (EU population) was a 1 year, randomised, double blind, parallelgroup, placebo-controlled, multicenter evaluation of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  of  omalizumab  in  children  (6-&lt;12  years)  with  moderate-severe,  persistent, inadequately controlled allergic asthma.

## Study Participants

## Main inclusion criteria:

- Children (outpatient males and females) aged 6 - &lt;12 years on study entry, with body weight between 20 and 150 kg.
- A total serum IgE level ≥ 30 to ≤ 1300 IU.
- A diagnosis of allergic moderate or severe persistent asthma (at least National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Guidelines step 3) ≥ 1 year duration. This despite therapy at NHLBI step  3  or  4  (at  least  medium  dose  ICS  -  fluticasone  DPI ≥ 200 μ g/day  or  equivalent  with  or without other controller medications).
- A positive prick skin test to at least one perennial allergen.
- Demonstrated ≥ 12% increase in FEV1 over starting value within 30 minutes of taking up to 4 puffs (4x100 mcg) or up to 5mg nebulized salbutamol.
- A documented history of experiencing asthma exacerbations despite therapy at NHLBI step 3 or 4. (Two exacerbations within last 12 months or three within last 24 months whereof on last 12 months or acute hospital care within last 12 months due to an exacerbation as defined by Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2002.) All qualifying exacerbations should have occurred while receiving NHLBI Step 3 or 4 therapies according to best clinical practice.
- A demonstrated inadequate symptom control during the last 4 weeks of run-in despite receiving an equivalent dose of fluticasone DPI ≥ 200 μ g/day total daily ex-valve dose.

## Main exclusion criteria

- Receiving systemic (oral or IV) corticosteroids for reasons other than asthma within 4 weeks of Visit 1 or during the double-blind treatment period.
- Taking methotrexate, gold salts, cyclosporin, troleandomycin or other immunosuppressants not approved for an asthma indication within 3 months of Visit 1 (or anticipated their use during the study).
- Receiving desensitization therapy with less than 3 months of stable maintenance doses prior to Visit 1.
- Being treated for an asthma exacerbation during the 4 weeks immediately prior to randomization.
- Elevated serum IgE levels for reasons other than allergy.

During  the  Scientific  Advice  from  the  CHMP  the  initial  inclusion  criteria  were  not  accepted.  By narrowing  the  criteria  including  only  patients  with  high  dose  ICS  ( ≥ 500  mcg/day  fluticasone equivalent)  plus  LABA,  the  study  participants  profile  is  acceptable  and  will  mirror  the  targeted population.

## Dosage

The doses selected for this study were based on previous drug exposure limits in adult and paediatric asthmatic patients who were treated with omalizumab. A dosing table was used that aimed to estimate for each patient the amount of active drug needed to reduce the patients total IgE level to ≤ 25 ng/ml to keep within reasonable endotoxin safety margins as determined in toxicology studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The omalizumab dose was individualized for each patient, based on their body weight and total serum IgE level at Visit 1. Omalizumab 75 to 375 mg (or placebo) was administered SQ every 2 or 4 weeks depending on the dose. Doses exceeding 150 mg were divided among more than one injection site to limit injections to not more than one 150 mg injection per site.

Patients entering the study were required to be receiving high dose ICS ( ≥ 500 mcg/day fluticasone equivalent)  plus  LABA.  No  changes  to  the  patient's  asthma  maintenance  therapy  were  permitted throughout the study except for ICS adjustments after the first 24 weeks.

The dose scheme which is based on knowledge from previous studies seems to be adequate.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The efficacy assessments were based on:

- Asthma  exacerbation  data:  A  clinically  significant  asthma  exacerbation  was  defined  as  a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the  baseline  inhaled  corticosteroid  dose  and/or  treatment  with  rescue  systemic  (oral  or  IV) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. In addition to these requirements at least one of the following criteria had to be met:
- PEF or FEV1 &lt; 60% of personal best - PEF or FEV1 60-80% of personal best following β 2 -agonist administration
- Fall in PEF of &gt; 20% on at least 2 of any 3 consecutive days compared to personal best.
- A &gt;50% increase in 24-hour rescue medication use on at least 2 of any 3 consecutive days compared to normal use ( ≥ 8 puffs of salbutamol)
- At least 2 night time awakenings due to asthma symptoms requiring rescue medication within the previous 7 days
- Any other specified clinically important reason
- Rescue  medication  use:  The  number  of  puffs  of  salbutamol  (albuterol)  or  terbutaline  taken during each 24 hour period for intercurrent bronchospasm.
- Clinical symptom scores: Total symptom score is obtained by adding the scores for nocturnal asthma (maximum score = 4), morning asthma symptoms (maximum score = 1), and daytime asthma symptoms (maximum score = 4).
- Global evaluations: PAQLQ(S) (paediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire).
- Pulmonary function: Spirometry and peak expiratory flow rate.

The safety assessments consisted of collecting:

- All adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), with their severity and relationship to study drug, and pregnancies.
- Regular monitoring of haematology, blood chemistry and urine
- Regular  assessments  of  vital  signs,  physical  examinations  including  medical  history  and abbreviated review of systems including height and body weight.

The primary efficacy variable was the rate of clinically significant asthma  exacerbations  in the 24week double-blind fixed steroid period. For each treatment group, the rate was defined as the number of exacerbations after adjusting for time at risk.

The evaluation of PK consisted of testing for total omalizumab levels. The evaluation of PD consisted of testing for free IgE and total IgE levels.

Anti-omalizumab (Ab) levels were performed on all patients prior to first dosing at randomization. Patients  were  also  instructed  to  return  to  the  clinic  for  an  anti-omalizumab  Ab  blood  sample approximately 16 weeks after their final treatment visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## I.2.2.2  Results

## Participant flow

A total of 627 patients were randomised, from a total of 1433 screened patients. Most exclusion at screening was due to unacceptable test procedure results (e.g. IgE levels or weight outside the dosing limit)  or  not  meeting  diagnostic/severity  criteria.  One  patient  in  the  placebo  group  received  study medication without being randomised and is included in the safety population but is excluded from the ITT  population.  In  the  full  study  a  total  of  628  patients  were  treated  and  comprised  the  safety population, 421 randomised to omalizumab and 207 to placebo (includes the one patient that was not randomised but received placebo). All randomised patients were treated with at least one dose of study medication.

The disposition of the EU population is shown in the table below.

## Primary efficacy results

The primary efficacy parameter was a clinically significant asthma exacerbation, as defined above.

The exacerbation rate in the omalizumab group in this period was 34% lower than that in the placebo group, and the proportion of patients who had at least one exacerbation was smaller in the omalizumab group.  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  three  or  more  exacerbations  was  lower  in  the omalizumab group than the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  primary  analysis,  the  between-group  ratio  of  exacerbation  rates  was  statistically  significant (p = 0.047, Poisson regression including terms for treatment, country, dosing schedule and exacerbation  history).  When  this  analysis  was  performed  for  the  EU  Per  Protocol  population  the results were similar.

In  patients  dosed  2-weekly,  omalizumab  was  associated  with  a  statistically  significantly  lower exacerbation  rate  than  placebo  in  patients  dosed  4-weekly,  the  exacerbation  rate  was  lower  for omalizumab than placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant.

The primary endpoint as specified and calculated according to the study protocol did reach statistical significance  (p=0.047),  favouring  the  omalizumab  treatment  over  placebo  in  this  highly  selected population. The ratio of the rates of clinically significant asthma exacerbations per treatment period was  similar  for  both  the  EU  mITT  and  the  EU  mPP  populations  (0.42/0.63)  but  due  to  statistical technicalities the p-value for the mPP population increased to 0.080.

Because of the dosing scheme, patients with higher IgE concentrations and to some extent with higher weight will be treated every other week. In the SPC addressing adolescents and adult the following is stated:

' Patients  with  IgE  lower  than  76  IU/ml  were  less  likely  to  experience  benefit  (see  section  5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that patients with IgE below 76 IU/ml have unequivocal in vitro reactivity  (RAST)  to  a  perennial  allergen  before  starting  therapy.' The  inclusion  criteria  for  study IA05 was only a total serum IgE level ≥ 30 to ≤ 1300 IU.

The CHMP requested that the effectiveness in patients with low IgE baseline values and its relations to the RAST for perennial allergen outcome in the studied paediatric population be discussed in depth by the MAH.

The MAH responded to the CHMP request that there is evidence that patients who have baseline IgE in the lowest quartile benefit from omalizumab treatment. However, they may have a lower probability of showing benefit in terms of exacerbation rate reduction than patients in the upper three quartiles.

Only  a  few  patients  were  tested  only  for  RAST  (n=29,  5.0%  of  the  total  population)  and  thus  a relationship  of  baseline  IgE  and  RAST  on  efficacy  is  difficult  to  establish.  However,  efficacy  was observed across all baseline IgE quartiles with consistent decrease of exacerbations.

In study IA05, patients were required to have a positive prick skin test (diameter of wheal ≥ 3 mm) to at least one perennial allergen (dust mite, cat/dog dander, cockroaches), documented within the past 2 years or taken at Visit 1. Mold allergies are a potential risk factor for severe exacerbations so a mold prick skin test (aspergillus, alternaria, penicillium and cladosporium) could also be performed on each patient but the results were used as an indicator and could not be used to determine positivity for study entry.

In addition, a RAST (radioallergosorbent) test could be performed for patients with a borderline skin prick  test  result,  only  after  consultation  with  the  MAH's  Clinical  personnel.  A  RAST  test,  using  a person's extracted blood, detects the amount of IgE that reacts specifically with suspected or known allergens.

The IgE cutoff point of 76 IU/mL for omalizumab treatment has been accepted for adults as efficacy could be demonstrated. From the MAH's response, benefit is not shown for omalizumab treatment in the  asthmatic, paediatric  subpopulation  with  initial  IgE  values  of  &lt;  200  IU/mL.  As  always,  a  few single patients in any subgroup may benefit, but on a population level (children with IgE values of &lt; 200 IU/mL) this was not shown.

The  CHMP  concluded  that  this  is  also  consistent  with  the  observation  that  children  with  severe asthmatic disease have higher IgE levels, in general, compared with adult patients. The consequence of  the  decreased  response  to  omalizumab  in  this  subpopulation  needs  be  included  in  the  SPC  4.2 'Posology  and  methods  of  administration'  section  in  a  similar  way  as  for  the  adult  population. According  to  the  SPC  in  the  adult  population,  patients  with  IgE  levels  &lt;  76  IU/mL  should  have  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

positive RAST independent of the skin prick test result for initiating an omalizumab treatment. As a result, from the submitted paediatric data the role of RAST for selecting treatment candidates cannot be concluded. However, before any new data indicate otherwise, in children with an IgE level &lt; 200 IU/mL,  RAST  should  be  performed  and  be  found  positive  before  beginning  treatment  with omalizumab.

The MAH has accepted the CHMP comments by amending the SPC accordingly.

Secondary efficacy results

- Change in nocturnal clinical symptom score from baseline to the end (last four weeks) of the 24 week double-blind fixed steroid treatment period.

A small decrease in mean nocturnal asthma symptom score was seen in both treatment groups for the EU  mITT  population  from  Study  IA05,  but  the  between-group  difference  was  not  statistically significantly different.

- Rate (time-adjusted number of) clinically significant asthma exacerbations during the 52 week double-blind treatment period

Most patients  continued  to  maintain  their  ICS  dose  throughout  the  study.  There  was  no  significant difference  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  defined  reductions  in  ICS  dose  between  the  treatment groups.

The  results  indicate  that  the  exacerbation  reduction  in  the  omalizumab  treatment  arm  remains  or maybe increased during the 52 week period.

- Change in beta-agonist rescue medication use from baseline to the end (last four weeks) of the 24 week double-blind fixed steroid treatment period.

The omalizumab group showed greater mean and median decreases than the placebo group at the end of  the  24-week  fixed  steroid  treatment  period  for  the  EU  mITT  population,  although  the  betweengroup difference was not statistically significant.

That also the beta2-agonist rescue medication (in addition to the ICS) did not differ more between the treatment groups could depend on the baseline treatment. Overall, the mean normal number of daily puffs of short-acting beta2- agonists at baseline was 2.7. The span for improvement is limited. Taking this  into  account  the  difference  of  -1.3  for  omalizumab  and  -0.71  for  placebo  could  be  clinically significant even if not statistically significant.

- Change in quality of life (PAQLQ(S)) in overall score from baseline to the end (last visit) of the 24 week double-blind fixed steroid treatment period.

Changes in quality of life scores from baseline were calculated to the end of Week 12, 24, 28, 40, and 52 in.  This  outcome is not separately presented by the MAH for the EU mITT population. For the overall  mITT  population  the  LS  means  of  change  from  baseline  were  broadly  similar  between treatments. The overall scores were not different between treatments at Weeks 12, 28, 40 or 52 either.

In  the  adult  population  (study  2306)  highly  significant  differences  in  Quality  of  Life  between omalizumab and placebo were recorded. For this paediatric EU population this was not the case. A brief discussion was submitted in the Clinical Overview. The MAH was requested to discuss in depth the clinical impact of these findings. In their response the MAH confirmed that unlike in adult studies, the pediatric clinical program did not show statistical differences in the quality of life of omalizumab patients.

The discrepancy in Quality of Life results between the adult and paediatric program may be due to various  reasons.  Several  studies  have  described  poor  agreement  in  asthma  control  as  perceived  by patients,  pediatricians,  and  as  indicated  by  objective  guideline  criteria.  An  important  cause  may  be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

poor  perception  of  airway  obstruction  and  symptoms  in  children  with  asthma.  The  children  in  a different study were not able to perceive the difference between excellent and good asthma control. Baker RR, et al (2000) demonstrated that 49% of his population of asthma patients had an inadequate perception of asthma symptoms.

The MAH concluded that omalizumab showed some improvements in the Quality of Life scores, for all domains and overall, though not statistically significantly different between the treatment groups. The lack of perception of asthma severity and control might explain the high baseline scores despite being  an  uncontrolled  asthma  population.  Missed  school  days,  a  parameter  significantly  associated with  specific  emotional  Quality  of  Life,  decreased  in  omalizumab  treated  patients.  In  addition, physician  overall  assessment  showed  a  greater  proportion  of  omalizumab  patients  achieved  marked improvement.

The CHMP considered that either did not the omalizumab treatment improve the overall Quality of Life to any significant degree or the used instruments could not detect an improvement. This situation is  not  unique for paediatric asthma studies. Any further analysis of the IA05 data will probably not come closer to a definite explanation.

## Exploratory secondary efficacy assessments

- Patient's and investigator's global evaluation of treatment effectiveness

The proportion of investigators rated as having 'Excellent' treatment effectiveness was higher (32.2% vs.  13.2%),  and  the  proportions  having  'Moderate'  or  'Poor'  Treatment  effectiveness  lower  in  the omalizumab group  compared  to  the  placebo  group;  the  difference  between  groups  was  statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test stratifying for dose schedule. The EU population's results were not presented by the MAH, only for the full mITT population.

## I.2.2.3  Supportive studies

## Study IGE025A IA05

The results from the IA05 subpopulation with severe asthma defined by the CHMP were presented above. Analysis of all the data showed that both the asthma medication and allergen history at baseline by the treatment groups were similar.

The  discontinuation  rate  between  the  omalizumab  and  placebo  groups  was  similar.  No  apparent attrition bias was introduced. No obvious differences between the two treatment arms can be detected.

The numerical point estimate of the primary endpoint for the full population was very similar to the estimate for the EU population. Due to the increased number of patients, the p-value will be lower. The results support the result of the primary endpoint for the EU population.

The differences in exacerbation rate considering the dosing (2-weekly vs. 4-weekly) was similar as for the EU population.

## Study 010C

Study 010C was a 7-month, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled study with a 5-month openlabel extension period with the aim to assess the safety, tolerability, steroid-reduction, pharmacokinetics,  and  pharmacodynamics  of  omalizumab  in  children  6  to  12  years  of  age  with allergic  asthma  requiring  daily  treatment  with  inhaled  corticosteroids.  Eligible  patients  were  those with  moderate  to  severe  allergic  asthma,  receiving  daily  inhaled  corticosteroids  (beclomethasone dipropionate 168-420 mcg/day) and as needed or regular use of bronchodilator therapy. Following a 46 week run-in period, patients were randomised to omalizumab or placebo treatment group in a ratio of 2:1 (omalizumab:placebo) for 28 weeks. Inhaled corticosteroid dosing remained stable for the first 16 weeks post-randomisation, followed by steroid dose reduction for the subsequent 12 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The children included in Study 010C do not fulfil the inclusion criteria requested by the CHMP (high dose  ICS  ( ≥ 500  mcg/day  fluticasone  equivalent)  plus  LABA)  as  a  basis  for  a  paediatric  Xolair indication. The MAH also clearly stated that the 010C study was regarded as supportive.

A paediatric  intent-to-treat  population  (paediatric  ITT),  a  subpopulation  of  the  ITT  population,  was used  for  the  summaries  and  analyses  of  the  efficacy  data.  The  paediatric  ITT  population  includes patients who were randomized to double-blind treatment, after excluding patients (a total of 36) who were 12 years or older at the time of randomisation, and who were analysed according to the treatment to  which  they  were  randomised.  The  efficacy  data  shown  in  the  010  (core)  clinical  study  report represent the full ITT population which includes all randomized patients.

The analysis methodology applied to Study 010 (core) paediatric ITT population was identical to the planned analysis used for Study IA05. From the rate of asthma exacerbations the population in this study had less severe asthma than the CHMP requested in its Scientific Advice.

## I.2.2.4  Conclusions on efficacy

The efficacy of omalizumab in this paediatric group with severe asthma is primarily based on study IA05.  The  efficacy  calculations  concern  a  subset  of  the  patients  forming  the  full  IA05  population. CHMP requested that any claims of efficacy should be based on children taking at least 500 mcg/day fluticasone equivalent plus LABA treatment.

The allocation and attrition bias in study IA05 is considered being low.

The primary endpoint was the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations during the 24-week fixed  steroid  treatment  period  using  an  imputation  method.  The  endpoint  was  pre-specified  to  be measured as the between-group ratio of exacerbation rates using Poisson regression including terms for treatment, country, dosing schedule and exacerbation history.

The rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations per treatment period using imputation was 0.42 for  omalizumab  and  0.63  for  placebo.  The  ratio  omalizumab/placebo  was  0.662  with  a  95% confidence interval of 0.441;0.995. The p-value was 0.047.

Clinically relevant and statistically robust effects in favour of omalizumab was demonstrated in the analysis of time to the first clinically significant asthma exacerbation (hazard ratio = 0.627, p = 0.018).

The  corresponding  results  for  the  adjustable  ICS  28  week  period  and  the  whole  52  week  period demonstrate a continuing and slightly increasing positive effect for omalizumab vs placebo. The ICS adjustments in the EU population during the last 28 weeks of the study were very small indicating that the asthma condition had still room for improvement. However, the decrease in beta2-agonist rescue medication  was  higher  for  the  omalizumab  population  than  for  the  placebo  population,  even  if  the result was not statistically significant.

Patients with low IgE baseline values seem to benefit less from the treatment than patients with high baseline values, which seems logical considering the underlying biological effect of omalizumab. The cut-off value at which omalizumab may be beneficial is not clear.

The subjective improvements as calculated by e.g. PAQLQ(S) were small in contrast to investigator's global evaluation of effectiveness which was statistically in favour of the omalizumab treatment.

The studies IA05 including the full number of patients, and 010 support the findings from IA05 EUP population.

## I.2.3 Clinical safety

The MAH has presented the safety data for five different populations according to the type of clinical trial.  The  safety  population  comprised all patients 6 to &lt; 12 years of age from clinical studies who received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug,  or  for  a  standard  therapy-controlled  patient,  had  been randomised and provided any post-randomisation data.

* Pre-planned because this subgroup reflected the severity criteria in the adult/adolescent severe asthma population for which omalizumab is already authorised in the EU.

- The Allergic  Asthma  Placebo-controlled (AAP)  population comprises the pooled safety populations from both double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in allergic asthma (IA05 and 010 (core)).
- The Allergic Asthma Open-label (AAO) population comprises the pooled safety populations from controlled  and  uncontrolled  open-label  studies  in  allergic  asthma  (Q2143g,  Q2195g,  Q2461g, 010E, 010E1).
- The All Placebo-Controlled (APC) population comprises the pooled safety populations from all controlled, double-blind studies in any indication (IA05, 010 (core), D01).
- The EU Pre-planned (EUP) population is a sub-group of the IA05 study population.
- The 'Total' from all studies (TOT) population comprises the pooled safety populations from all trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The focus on this safety assessment will primarily be on the Allergic Asthma Placebo-controlled and EU Pre-planned populations

In the AAP population, a higher percentage of placebo treated patients aged 6-9 years had exposure for greater than 28 weeks (and subsequent categories) than those aged 10-11 years by approximately 10% (&gt; 28 weeks exposure 69.1% in 10-11 years, 79.2% in 6-9 years). Mean and median durations of exposure were similar between age categories, as was the mean exposure in patient years.

In  the  AAP  population,  exposure  was  similar  between  males  and  females,  with  a  mean  exposure duration to omalizumab of 41.7 and 42.9 weeks, respectively.

In the uncontrolled studies included in the Allergic Asthma Open-label (AAO) population, a higher percentage of re-treatment patients had over 28 weeks treatment than new treatment patients (100% retreatment versus 50.0% new treatment). This is due to the original treatment period being included in the exposure calculation.

Mean patient  exposure  in  years  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  in  the  controlled  study,  but lower for new treatment patients in the uncontrolled studies. Overall mean exposure to omalizumab in all AAO studies was approximately 2 years.

The demographics in the treatment arms were fairly similar except for the fact that there were almost double males than females in the overall population (AAP, AAO and EUP).

The main population for analysis is the AAP population consisting of patients from the pivotal IA05 study, and Study 010 (core). Both of these studies were restricted to children with allergic asthma who demonstrated reversibility in  FEV1 following the administration of a short acting beta2-agonist and were confirmed to have allergies. The severity of disease did vary between groups since patients in Study IA05 were to have demonstrated inadequate symptom control as well as exacerbations in the past year, and to therefore be uncontrolled on their current medication, whilst in Study 010 (core), it was intended that patients should be controlled on their current dose of ICS.

In the AAP population, 86.7% of randomised patients completed the trials, with the main reasons for discontinuation being withdrawal of consent and administrative problems. Adverse event discontinuations were seen for 4 patients, with no abnormal laboratory values leading to discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse events

Approximately  90%  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  experienced  an  AE.  The  most  frequently affected organ classes were infections and infestations, respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders and gastrointestinal disorders (all greater than 25%).

Table 9. Most frequently affected primary system organ classes (at least 3% of patients in any group); AAP population

The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and headache. The majority of AEs were reported by a higher percentage of patients in the placebo group.

All  differences  of  adverse  events  which  had  a  3%  or  greater  difference  in  their  frequency  within treatment groups between dosing frequency subgroups were less than or equal to 8%. The majority of the  differences  were  seen  in  the  placebo  treatment  group,  with  all  but  viral  upper  respiratory  tract infection, otitis media, and pharyngitis streptococcal being more frequently reported by patients on the 2-weekly dosing schedule. In the omalizumab treatment group, four AEs were more frequent by at least 3% in the 4-weekly schedule, and two on the 2-weekly schedule. Vomiting and upper respiratory tract infections were seen more frequently with 4-weekly dosing in the omalizumab group but were more frequent with twice weekly dosing in the placebo group.

The incidence of AEs was generally higher in the uncontrolled studies than for the controlled. In the study, the percentage of patients reporting AEs by system organ class was similar in the omalizumab and control treatment groups, with the exception of nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue  disorders  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  which  were  reported  by  a higher percentage of patients in the omalizumab treatment group.

In  the  controlled  studies  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  between  the  omalizumab  and  control treatment  groups.  Sinusitis  was  more  frequently  reported  in  the  control  group,  as  was  influenza, gastroenteritis, wheezing and status asthmaticus.

In  the  uncontrolled  studies,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  sinusitis  and  headache  were  the  most frequently reported preferred terms.

Approximately 94% of all patients experienced at least one AE in the EUP population. The profile of system  organ  classes  affected  by  AEs  in  the  EUP  population  was  similar  to  that  in  the  AAP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

population,  although  rates  of  AEs  in  some  system  organ  classes  were  slightly  higher  in  the  EUP population  than  the  AAP.  These  system  organ  classes  were  infections  and  infestations;  respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; nervous system disorders; general disorders and administration site conditions; injury, poisoning and procedural complications; eye disorders; immune system disorders; and psychiatric disorders.

The most frequently reported AEs in the EU population treatment groups were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis. The majority of AEs were reported by a higher percentage of patients in the placebo group. For those preferred terms reported more frequently in the omalizumab group, the following AEs showed a greater than 1.5% difference between treatment groups: abdominal pain upper; pyrexia; nasopharyngitis; ear infection; gastroenteritis viral; viral infection; urinary tract infection; postnasal drip; and eczema. Of these AEs, the greatest difference between omalizumab and placebo was seen for pyrexia, where the difference was 10%.

There  was  no  apparent  pattern  in  terms  of  which  dosing  schedule  subgroup  was  more  likely  to  be affected by AEs that showed at least 3% differences between subgroups.

For the APP population the incidence of AEs was less frequent in the omalizumab treatment group than in the placebo group, in particular in the &gt;28-52 week period. The greatest percentage of patients experiencing  AEs  was  during  the  &gt;12-28  week  period.  This  period  corresponds  to  the  steroid reduction phase in Study 010 (core) and the beginning of the steroid adjustable phase in study IA05.

There  was  no  apparent  pattern  in  terms  of  which  dosing  schedule  subgroup  was  more  likely  to  be affected by AEs that showed at least 3% differences between subgroups. There are no obvious safety signals  in  the  presented  data.  Pyrexia  had  similar  frequencies  between  treatment  arms  in  the  AAP population, but was considerably higher for the omalizumab arm in the EUP population

## Adverse events by exposure in the EUP population

Up to 12 weeks, the total rate of AEs was very similar in each treatment group, but in later periods, the placebo  group  showed  a  higher  total  rate  of  AEs,  as  also  was  seen  in  the  whole  IA05  safety population.  The  total  rate  of  AEs  in  the  omalizumab  group  remained  constant  up  to  week  52,  but increased somewhat after week 12 in the placebo group. Infections and infestations was the system organ class most commonly affected by AEs in all time periods.

Up to 12 weeks, a few AEs, notably gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting and diarrhea) pyrexia and nasopharyngitis  were  more  frequent  in  the  omalizumab  group,  although  upper  respiratory  tract infection was more common with placebo.

From week 12 to 28, there were again few differences in AEs rates between treatments: headache and cough  were  more  frequent  in  the  omalizumab  group  and  pharyngitis,  viral  upper  respiratory  tract infection and pharyngolaryngeal pain were more frequent in the placebo group

From week 28 to 52, nasopharyngitis and gastroenteritis were more frequent in the omalizumab group, whereas  vomiting,  sinusitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  bronchitis,  pharyngitis,  headache,  and cough were more frequent in patients receiving placebo.

Beyond week 52, AEs were reported by 15.3% of patients in the omalizumab group and 20.8% in the placebo group. The only notable difference between treatment groups was for nasopharyngitis, which was more frequent in the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse events related temporally to injection days or representing injection site reactions

In  the  AAP  population  6.1%  of  patients  in  the  omalizumab,  and  7.0%  of  patients  in  the  placebo treatment groups experienced an adverse event on the first day of injection.

In the EUP population, a higher proportion of the placebo group (16.3%) experienced an AE on the first day of injection than was the case in the omalizumab group (6.0%). Most of these AEs were mild: only one severe AE was reported, a case of abdominal pain in a patient in the omalizumab group.

In  the  AAP  population,  adverse  events  were  reported  on  any  injection  day  for  33.2%  of  the omalizumab treated patients, and 36.1% of the placebo treated patients.

In the EUP population, adverse events occurring on any injection day were reported by 41.6% of the patients in the omalizumab group and 51.3% of the placebo. Infections and infestations was the system organ  class  most  commonly  affected  by  AEs.  There  were  no  major  differences  between  treatment groups in rates of specific AEs.

Injection  site  reactions  (in  the  combined  safety  population  from  studies  010  (core),  D01,  IA05  and Q2143g) were for erythema 0.8% and 0.1% (omalizumab vs. placebo). The corresponding numbers for pruritus were 1.0% and 0.5%.

In the omalizumab EUP population group 4/166 (2.4%) patients reported a local injection site reaction compared to 4/80 (5%) in the placebo group. Injection site pain and injection site swelling were the most common AEs of this type in the placebo group; injection site pruritus was the most common reaction  in  the  omalizumab  group  (1.2%  vs.  1.3%  for  placebo).  Injection  site  reactions  in  both treatment groups were more often of mild than of moderate intensity.

## However, there is no consistent pattern in the injection site reactions

## Events suspected to be related to treatment.

In the AAP population, there were no adverse events suspected by the investigator of being study drug related with a frequency of 3% or higher. Those AEs suspected of being related to the study drug with a frequency of 1% or greater were: headache, dizziness, cough, abdominal upper pain, erythema and urticaria.

In the EUP population, only one adverse event (headache) was suspected by the investigator of being study drug related in more than 1% of omalizumab-treated patients.

The MAH has already included the relevant information above in the proposed SPC.

## Deaths - SAEs

## There were no deaths during any of the studies.

In the AAP population there was a higher percentage of patients with SAEs in the placebo treatment group than in the omalizumab group. Most SAEs were reported by only one or two patients, with the exception of appendicitis (higher in omalizumab group) and pneumonia (higher in placebo group). The incidence of respiratory or infectious SAEs was similar in the omalizumab and placebo groups.

In the EUP population a greater proportion of patients in the placebo treatment group had SAEs than was the case in the omalizumab group. With one exception (pneumonia in the placebo group, which was reported in two patients) SAEs were reported by at most only one patient per treatment group. Most SAEs were infections; the rate of these was higher in the placebo group than the omalizumab group. There were no SAEs in either treatment group affecting the system organ class Respiratory, thoracic or mediastinal disorders. One pregnancy was reported in the placebo group. One SAE was suspected of being study drug related, a case of tic in the omalizumab group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse events of special interest

The  most  common  adverse  events  with  special  interest  were  under  the  terms  skin  rash,  urticaria, hypersensitivity and bleeding disorders for the both AAP and EUP populations.

Patients  with  the  cluster  of  adverse  events  considered  possible  components  of  serum  sickness  are shown in the table below for the AAP population. The percentage of patients with clusters of terms potentially related to serum sickness syndrome was small, and similar between treatment groups.

The MAH has already included the relevant information in the proposed SPC.

## Anaphylaxis

In the AAP population, one patient in each treatment group experienced an adverse event described as anaphylaxis  by  the  investigator,  both  were  moderate.  One  omalizumab  patient  reacted  to  pethidine hydrochloride, and one placebo to ingestion of nuts.

The  proposed  SPC  mentions  anaphylactic  reactions,  however  the  above  findings  were  not  deemed related to the data presented for the paediatric population.

## Malignancy

The total populations from all studies were used to assess the incidence of malignancy. There was one patient who reported a malignancy (medulloblastoma) and this patient received placebo treatment in Study IA05. No other cases were reported.

## Laboratory findings - Haematology

There was a shift from baseline to post-baseline measurements for the AAP population for the main hematology parameters. There were five patients who shifted to low platelet count by notable criteria.

In Study IA05, there were three omalizumab patients with platelet counts ≤ 75x109/L or with a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline had values within normal range at baseline.

None of these patients experienced AEs associated with bleeding disorders or viral illnesses.

In  study  010  (core),  there  was  one  omalizumab  patient  and  one  placebo  patient  with  a  low  platelet count reported post-treatment.

The  shift  from  baseline  to  post-baseline  measurements  for  the  EUP  population  for  the  main hematology parameters was similar to the AAP population.

One patient in the omalizumab group shifted to low platelet count by notable criteria. This patient had no AEs associated with bleeding disorders or viral illnesses.

The shift of White Blood Cell count (WBC) to low values was more pronounced in the EU population compared with the AAP population. In the AAP population 10.4% of the omalizumab patients had a low WCB count vs. 9.6% for placebo. The corresponding numbers for the EUP population was 21.7% for omalizumab vs. 16.3% for placebo.

Thrombocytopenia  has  earlier  been  identified  as  a  potential  problem  following  treatment  with omalizumab. The paediatric data can support that view due to different pattern in WBC shifts in the AAP and EU population. Information about this issue is present in the proposed SPC text. The CHMP requested  that  the  different  pattern  in  WBC  shift  in  the  AAP  and  EU  populations  should  be commented by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH responded that there has been increasing evidence in the scientific literature that the number of  neutrophils  in  the  airways  is  increased  in  patients  with  chronic  severe  or  acute  fatal  asthma. Neutrophils have been shown to be associated with severe asthma, instability of asthma, sudden-onset fatal asthma and status asthmaticus. The magnitude of neutrophilic inflammation has been correlated with eosinophilic inflammation in severe persistent asthma. Patients with high neutrophilic inflammation have showed a significantly higher percentage of sputum eosinophils as compared with 'non  neutrophilic'  asthmatic  patients.  The  effects  of  the  different  treatment  options  available  have shown that long-acting β 2 agonists may have an antineutrophilic effect.

In pivotal Study IA05 the predefined analysis plan identified a specific subset of patients with high dose  ICS  ( ≥ 500 μ g/day  fluticasone  equivalent)  plus  LABA,  henceforth  referred  to  as  the  EUP population.  This  population  reflected  the  approved  omalizumab  population  of  patients  12  years  or older, as well as following GINA guidelines. This EUP population subset of patients represents 41% of Xolair patients and 39.5% of placebo patients in study IA05.

The Allergic Asthma Placebo-controlled (AAP) population comprised the pooled safety populations from both double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in allergic asthma (IA05 and 010 (core)). The AAP population as a whole is not identical to the IA05 population. In the overall pediatric clinical program a  different  pattern  in  white  blood  cell  count  (WBC)  shift  was  seen  between  the  AAP  and  EUP populations.  The  frequency  of  low  WBC  in  AAP  (Omalizumab:  10.4%  vs  placebo:  9.6%)  was different  from  the  frequencies  observed  in  the  EUP  pop  (Omalizumab:  21.7%  vs  placebo:  16.3%). However,  the  changes  of  WBC  from  baseline  to  final  visit  in  both  in  the  AAP  and  in  the  EUP populations were similar in omalizumab and placebo groups.

The  appropriate  population  comparison  was  done  between  what  was  denominated  as  the  EUP population  (those  with  high  ICS  dose  plus  LABA  at  baseline)  and  the  rest  of  patients,  which  are referred  to  as  the  non-EUP.  A  comparison  of  the  AAP  population  and  EUP  population  was  not appropriate as the AAP population includes the EUP population.

There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of low WBC among treatment groups in each population studied. However, there is a higher % of patients, both in omalizumab and placebo treated groups, with low WBC in the EUP population. The EUP population, as previously described, is a  specific  subset  of  patients  with  high  dose  ICS  ( ≥ 500 μ g/day fluticasone equivalent) plus LABA, within study IA05. The EUP population received an average ICS dose (fluticasone equivalent) of 744 μ g/day,  whereas  the  non-EUP  received  at  baseline  an  average  ICS  dose  (fluticasone  equivalent)  of 282.1 μ g/day.  With  respect  to  additional  co-medications,  all  patients  in  the  EUP  population  were exposed to LABA, whereas only 26% of patients in the non-EUP were.

In summary, there were no significant differences in the frequency of low WBC between omalizumab and placebo patients, but there were differences among populations. The EUP exposed to higher doses of ICS, and to LABAs have a higher frequency of low WBC. The CHMP concluded that the MAH's explanation of the WBC counts in the different populations is supported by data. Any direct influence of omalizumab on the WBC is likely to be minimal.

## Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety data presented in this paediatric variation application has not identified any unknown safety concerns regarding omalizumab.

The omalizumab exposure in the paediatric population (&gt; 6 years of age) is considered to be large enough, both in time and in numbers of patients, to have a relatively adequate opinion of the expected safety concerns concerning omalizumab treatments with duration of at least 1 year in 156 patients and 3 years in 81 patients. Longer follow up should additionally be considered.

The  initial  apprehensions  about  potential  severe  adverse  events  related  to  omalizumab  have  been modified (reduced) as continuously new safety data are analysed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most commonly reported adverse event were respiratory infections which occurred for slightly more placebo  patients.  Most  adverse  events  frequencies  were  similar  between  the  omalizumab  and placebo treatment arms.

Two anaphylactic reactions in the paediatric studies were most probably not related to any of the study drugs.

'Serum  sickness'  is  present  also  in  the  paediatric  population,  even  if  the  symptoms  in  the  vast majority were mild.

Local reactions were not a cause for concern.

A limited number of cases of thrombocytopenia are reported. Two cases of severe thrombocytopenia were  reported  in  study  010,  one  in  the  omalizumab  and  one  in  the  placebo  arm  (31  and  21  x10 9 respectively). All thrombocytopenia patients returned to acceptable levels.

## I.2.4 Pharmacovigilance - Risk Management Plan

The  MAH  submitted  an  updated  version  (Version  3)  of  the  omalizumab  RMP  with  the  paediatric variation. This updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses the safety profile of omalizumab in patients 6 years of age and older. The experience in the paediatric population of approximately 1200 patients 6 - &lt; 12 years of age has been included in this version of the RMP.

## Hypersensitivity Reactions - 'skin prick' test results

During the latest RMP (Version 3) assessment there was noted that there were no milestones for the development of the two types of 'skin prick' tests. The MAH was advised that in the updated RMP it should  be  present  the  estimated  dates  when  the  tests  may  be  finalised  and  how  the  results  will  be communicated to health authorities. Also, the MAH was asked to present a more detailed description of the two 'skin prick' tests, e.g. how they were intended to be used as well as a detailed description of the study designs.

In their answers the MAH committed to develop a 'Skin Prick' test in patients with clinically reported hypersensitivity reactions associated with omalizumab administration to detect reactive IgE antibodies to Omalizumab or excipients in the formulation. Thirty normal subjects and allergic asthmatic patients will be studied to examine the validity and safety of the procedure.

In  a  second  phase  the  MAH  committed  to  establish  an  observational  repository  of  cases  of  severe hypersensitivity  reaction  associated  with  omalizumab  administration  and  appropriate  controls.  This repository will be a prerequisite to the conduct of a subsequent study that will assess the risk of severe hypersensitivity reaction associated with omalizumab use among repository cases and controls. Data collected for each case will consist of clinical history, serum for reactive antibody tests and allergy skin test results.

In the RMP version 3, the MAH also stated that a Risk Minimisation Action Plan (RiskMAP, which in the  meantime  has  been  replaced  by  the  REMS.)  is  planned  to  be  submitted  to  the  Regulatory Authorities concerning anaphylaxis / anaphylactoid reactions.

Since hypersensitivity reactions are of major concern, information on the riskMAP study plans as well as future results are also requested for submission to EMEA and the CHMP. In Europe these measures would be components of a Pharmacovigilance plan. In addition close surveillance and characterisation of such reactions should continue for more than the first two years.

## Off-label Use

Off-label  use  has  now  been  included  as  a  potential  risk,  and  information  on  the  magnitude  of  the problem from drug utilisation study (DUS) has been provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However not all forms of potential off-label use were mentioned in RMP Version 3.0. Use in children with  weight  under  20  kg  and  in  persons  with  weight  over  150  kg  should  also  be  mentioned  and reported, as well as other underlying disease states than asthma. Continuous reporting on all kinds of off-label use in PSURs is recommended .

## Awareness, Tracking, Usage (ATU) study

The  Awareness,  Tracking,  Usage  (ATU)  study  (market  research)  for  the  specific  monitoring  is described in the RMP and information is summarised in the table below:

| Table 3-2    | Specific monitoring plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The comments by the CHMP were that although this market research study has been outlined with a plan  for  the  first  survey  during  2009,  it  was  not  stated  how  the  results  will  be  reported  to  the authorities.

The MAH responded on this by stating that indeed, an ATU study to assess the effectiveness of related RMP activities on anaphylaxis was conducted in Europe in 2007. Participating countries were United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. The sample population was composed of a total of 296 physicians  practicing  in  these  countries.  Results  became  available  in  2008,  and  were  presented  in PSUR-11 submitted to EMEA and CHMP members on 24 February 2009.

In 2008, another ATU study assessing the same criteria as in 2007 was conducted. The 2008 results will be reported in the upcoming PSUR 12 (cut-off date 31 December 2009).

From 2009 onwards, the ATU study will be changed into an omnibus market research survey. This survey will cover wider respiratory questionnaire than the ATU study was. The criteria assessed in the

2007 and 2008 ATU will continue to be part of the questionnaire and are planned to be reported in future PSURs.

The list of identified and potential risks for adults and children (from 6 years) can be considered to cover the important suggested safety concerns. It should however be highlighted that knowledge on safety  is  sparse  and  long-term  data  &gt;3  years  are  missing  in  the  6  -  &lt;12  years  old,  such  that  close monitoring  of  all  possible  safety  concerns  including  in  addition  to  malignancies  also  infectious, respiratory, cardiac, neurological and other reactions is mandatory in this population. The MAH has identified  methods  to  collect  more  information  for  spontaneous  malignancies  reports  which  is appropriate. The MAH following the request by the CHMP will submit a detailed description of how information on the malignancies reports will be collected and discuss the suitability and value of using other data sources.

The only difference in mentioned safety concerns for children 6 - &lt;12 years compared to adolescents and adults concerned malignancy which has been regarded as a potential and not an identified risk, due to absence of any signal in the paediatric clinical program and interim data from the EXCELS study (see also below) of adolescent and adult patients.

## Ongoing studies

The studies EXCELS and EXPECT are still on-going. The third interim report of the EXCELS study was  provided  within  this  variation  application  but  also  in  EMEA/H/C/606/FU2/13.3  procedure. Comments and issues identified such as the need for further risk evaluation for specific malignancies and for cardiovascular events, and a discussion on the possible lack of statistical power to detect some increased risks were taken into account during this variation application. The full statistical analysis plan  (SAP)  for  the  EXCELS  study  has  been  provided  by  the  MAH  to  the  EMEA  and  it  is  under assessment by the CHMP.

## I.2.4.1  RMP assessment conclusions

## Safety specification

The safety profile of omalizumab is mainly established from adult and adolescent patients. However, in  data  from  this  variation  application,  no  new  safety  concerns  have  been  found  in  children  6-&lt;12 years from a maximal follow up duration of at least 1 year in 156 patients and 3 years in 81 patients (among all reported patients in this age category treated with omalizumab).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  March  2009  the  MAH  was  asked  by  the  CHMP  to  re-consider  the  exclusion  of  patients  with  a known history of allergies.  The MAH agreed to reword the RMP as proposed, in order to provide more clarity on the clinical programme conclusion and actual defined exclusion criteria.

In  addition  the  CHMP  had  proposed  that  Serum  sickness  syndrome  (SSS)  and  Serum  sickness  like disease (SSLD) should be included as identified instead of potential risks. The MAH agreed to change the risk status of SSS/SSLD from potential to identified and has amended the RMP accordingly.

The list of identified and potential risks for adults and children (from 6 years) is considered to cover the  important  ongoing  safety  concerns.  In  the  RMP  (Version  3),  the  only  difference  in  the  safety specification  for  children  6  -  &lt;12  years  compared  to  adolescents  and  adults  concerns  malignancy which has been regarded as a potential and not an identified risk in children due to absence of a signal in  the  pediatric  clinical  program  and  interim  data  from  the  EXCELS  5  year  follow-up  study  in adolescent  and  adult  patients.  This  is  considered  acceptable,  under  the  general  condition  of  close monitoring of reports of malignancies and other adverse events in paediatric patients.

## Pharmacovigilance plan

Since hypersensitivity reactions are of major concern, the future results of the RiskMAP study plans are requested to be submitted also to the EMEA and the CHMP.

Not all forms of potential off-label use were mentioned in the detailed action plan for off-label use. Use  in  children  with  weight  under  20  kg  and  in  persons  with  weight  over  150  kg  should  also  be mentioned  and  reported,  as  well  as  other  underlying  disease  states  than  asthma  in  all  age  groups. Continuous reporting on all kinds of off-label use in future PSURs is recommended.

The MAH has committed to gather additional information on the long term safety of omalizumab. In addition to routine pharmacovigilance with reporting in PSURs, also riskMAP studies (including skin tests) concerning hypersensitivity reactions, blood anti-therapeutic antibody identification for suspected  cases,  the  post-marketing  studies  EXCELS  and  EXPECT,  and  targeted  follow-up  with questionnaires concerning anaphylaxis and malignant neoplasms are included in the Pharmacovigilance plan. Paediatric patients are encompassed in these follow-up measures (except for the EXCEL and EXPECT studies), and overall the Pharmacovigilance plan is considered to adequately cover the important risks at present. However, long-term experience in the new paediatric population (6-&lt;12 years) is insufficient.

The MAH has identifying methods to collect more information for spontaneous malignancies reports which  is  appropriate.  The  MAH  will  submit  a  detailed  description  of  how  information  on  the malignancies reports will be collected and discuss the suitability and value of using other data sources.

## Risk minimisation plan

The ATU market research study has been outlined with a plan for the first survey during 2009. In March 2009 the CHMP requested clarifications on how the results will be reported to the authorities. The status of the ATU-studies performed, have been clarified in the RMP Version 4 and the study will be  reported  in  the  next  PSUR.  The  results  will  available  in  the  future  will  all  be  reported  in  the appropriate PSUR.

The CHMP is of the view that with the paediatric RMP now further updated (Version 4) an adequate risk management level is being fulfilled.

## I.3. Overall Discussion

The proposed dosing schedule used in the pivotal clinical trial in paediatric patients (study IA05) has shown  to  result  in  suppression  of  free  IgE  levels.  Under  the  assumption  that  free  IgE  is  a  good biomarker  for  the  clinical  effect,  the  dosing  from  a  pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic  perspective appears reasonable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  effect  of  omalizumab  in  this  subset  of  severe  asthmatic  paediatric  population  (IA05  EU population;  159  in  the  omalizumab  arm,  76  in  the  placebo  arm)  was  approximately  of  the  same magnitude as for the adult population with similar asthma severity. The pre-specified primary endpoint in the 'pivotal' study IA05 was statistically in favour of omalizumab vs. placebo.

The full study IA05 and study 010 support the findings for the EU population.

Secondary  endpoints,  including  time  to  first  clinically  significant  asthma  exacerbation  were  all  in favour  for  omalizumab  vs.  placebo  or  similar  between  the  treatment  arms,  even  if  statistically significance was reached only for a few of these endpoints.

Up till now there are no obvious new safety signals detected in the combined paediatric omalizumab studies compared with those found in the adolescent and adult populations.

The RMP (Version 4) has been updated during the assessment of this variation in order to include the comments received by the CHMP.

## I.4 Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

Following the assessment of the new clinical data on safety and efficacy the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk  ratio  of  Xolair  in  the  proposed  new  indication  for  children  between  6  and  less  than  12 years old is positive.

The additional indication for children between 6 and less than 12 years of age is:

## Children (6 to &lt;12 years of age)

Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.
