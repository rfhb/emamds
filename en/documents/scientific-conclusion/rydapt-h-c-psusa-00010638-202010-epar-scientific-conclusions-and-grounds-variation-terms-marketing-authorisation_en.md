## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for midostaurin, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on Interstitial lung disease and Pneumonitis from clinical trials, the literature, and spontaneous reports, including in some cases with a close temporal relationship, a positive dechallenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between midostaurin and Interstitial lung disease and Pneumonitis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing midostaurin should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on electrocardiogram QT prolonged from non-clinical data, clinical trials, spontaneous reports, including in 5 cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in some a positive re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between midostaurin and electrocardiogram QT prolonged is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing midostaurin should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for midostaurin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing midostaurin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information
