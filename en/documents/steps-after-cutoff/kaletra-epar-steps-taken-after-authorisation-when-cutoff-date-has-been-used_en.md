| The MAH applied to update section 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) following the assessment of four drug interaction studies aimed at evaluating the pharmacokinetics and safety of Kaletra co-administered with other approved protease inhibitors. In addition, following assessment of a study that evaluated the interaction between Kaletra and desipramine (a CYP2D6 marker substrate), the MAH seeks to amend section 4.3 (Contraindications), 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use) and 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), to remove the contraindication for co-administration with drugs dependent on the P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 for their metabolism. A consequential change in section 2 of the Package Leaflet (PL) is also proposed. | II/19     | II  | 20.11.03   | 30.01.04   |
| The Mah applied to update sections 4.8 (Undesirable effects) and 5.1 (Pharmacodynamic properties) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to reflect the long-term safety and efficacy data available from phase II study M97-720. The SPC, Package Leaflet (PL) and labelling have been updated to bring storage declarations in line with current guidelines and the list of local representatives in the new Accession Countries has also been added to the PL. Minor typographic errors in SPC are corrected and cross- references have been updated in line with QRD guidance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | II/21     | II  | 29.07.04   | 09.09.04   |
