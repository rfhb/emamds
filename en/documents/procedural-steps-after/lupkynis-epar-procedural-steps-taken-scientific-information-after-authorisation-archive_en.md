1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0013             | Update of sections 4.6 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update breast-feeding information based on final results from study AUR-VCS-2021-04. This study is a single-center, open-label, Phase 1, lactation study to investigate the amount of voclosporin excreted in breast milk following a single oral dose of 23.7 mg voclosporin in healthy, lactating, female volunteers. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The updated RMP version 5.0 is agreed. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 13/06/2024 | 18/11/2024 | SmPC and PL | SmPC Section 4.6 is updated to indicate that in a study in 12 lactating subjects, the highest estimated voclosporin dose ingested by a fully breastfed infant was 1.4% of maternal weight-adjusted dose (see section 5.2). The effect of voclosporin on newborns/infants is unknown. SmPC Section 5.2 is updated to indicate that following a single 23.7 mg dose of voclosporin in lactating volunteers (see section 4.6), an average of 0.00472 mg voclosporin was excreted in breast milk in 48h, with 80% being excreted within 12h. Data showed that the voclosporin milk to maternal blood exposure ratio was in the range of 0.42 to 0.95. For a breastmilk intake of 200 mL/kg/day, the highest relative infant dose was 1.4% of maternal weight- adjusted dose. For more information, please refer to the Summary of |

|                     | 2016-02 (AURORA 2) Kidney Biopsy Substudy, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. The AURORA 2 extension trial included an optional biopsy substudy which was designed to assess renal histology from tissue samples taken prior to and after approximately 18 months of randomized treatment with voclosporin or placebo. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority   |            |            |      | renal histology. It provides data on the long-term safety of voclosporin given the concern on CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. Although some concerns are raised because of the observed increase in chronicity index observed in the voclosporin group, it is acknowledged that the study is small and that the distinction between LN-induced fibrosis and sclerosis and CNI-induced nephrotoxicity is very difficult. No firm conclusions can be made on an association between voclosporin and CNI-induced nephrotoxicity, although it is reasonable to assume that voclosporin does not differ from other CNIs when it comes to the risk for chronic nephrotoxicity. Further data are expected from an observational PASS to further characterise and quantify long-term safety profile of Lupkynis, focusing on the risks of malignancy, neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.   |

AUR-VCS-2021-02 is a single-center, open-label, Phase 1 study to investigate the effect of voclosporin on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and simvastatin acid              | 20/07/2023 | 16/02/2024 | SmPC | Voclosporin is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. In the study AUR-VCS-2021-02 / Statin-DDI, the concomitant administration of a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin with 23.7 mg BID voclosporin increased Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite simvastatin acid (a sensitive OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrate) by 3.1-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively. In the same study, exposure of the parent drug simvastatin (which is also a BCRP substrate) was unaffected in terms of AUC while its Cmax increased by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It is recommended in the SmPC of Lupkynis to monitor for adverse events such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrates (e.g., simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin) are used concomitantly with voclosporin. Voclosporin inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro. A clinically relevant inhibition of intestinal BCRP cannot be excluded and voclosporin may increase the concentration of these substrates in vivo. It is recommended in the SmPC of Lupkynis to monitor use of BCRP substrates where small concentration changes may lead to serious toxicity (e.g., rosuvastatin) when used concomitantly with voclosporin.
