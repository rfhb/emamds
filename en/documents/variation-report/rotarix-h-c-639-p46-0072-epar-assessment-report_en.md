## I. RECOMMENDATION

Based on the review of the paediatric data on safety and immunogenicity collected in study Rota-074 the  Rapporteur  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  the  above  mentioned  product  remains unchanged and therefore does not require further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for Rotarix. The SmPC and PIL remain unchanged.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

The  current  study  was  submitted  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Article  46  of  the  regulation 1901/2006. The study has not been conducted in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan.

Adhering to the requirements of Chinese regulatory authorities and in order to support the licensure of GSK Biologicals' liquid HRV vaccine in China, it was necessary to conduct a Phase I safety study in the targeted infant population. This study was conducted to collect reactogenicity and safety data of liquid HRV vaccine from infants aged 6 to 16 weeks at the time of the first dose of vaccination. In addition, the immunogenicity of the liquid HRV vaccine was also explored in order to assess the anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations and vaccine take.

## 1. STUDY METHODOLOGY

## 1. Objectives

## Primary

To assess the reactogenicity of the liquid HRV vaccine when compared to placebo in terms of grade 3 solicited adverse events (AEs).

## Secondary

- To  assess  the  reactogenicity  of  the  liquid  HRV  vaccine  when  compared  to  placebo  in  terms  of solicited AEs.
- To assess the safety of the liquid HRV vaccine when compared to placebo in terms of unsolicited AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs).

## Exploratory

- To  explore  the  excretion  of  the  rotavirus  (RV)  antigen  in  the  stool  samples  collected  at predetermined time points after each liquid HRV vaccine/placebo dose.
- To  explore  the  immunogenicity  of  the  liquid  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of  seroconversion  rate  and Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) after a two dose primary vaccination course.

## 2. Design

- -Phase 1, Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single centre study, two parallel
- -Balanced 1:1 randomisation.
- -6-16 weeks at the time of first vaccination were to receive two oral doses of liquid HRV vaccine or placebo at a 0, 1 month schedule.
- -All subjects were to receive routine vaccination according to the local immunisation practice. The study consisted of three visits (Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 3).
- -Blood samples collected at Visit 1 and Visit 3. Stools samples collected at Day 0 (or a day prior to vaccination), Day 7 and Day 15 after each dose of vaccination and at Visit 3.
- -No restrictions on breast feeding

## 3. Laboratory assays and time-points

## Stool analysis

Two aliquots were prepared for all stool samples collected at pre-determined time points: One aliquot was shipped frozen  to  a  National  Institute  for  Food  and  Drug  Control  (NIFDC  in  China)  [previously known as the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological products (NICPBP)] and the other aliquot was shipped frozen to GSK Biologicals, Belgium, for back-up.

All stool samples were analysed by ELISA for detection of RV antigen to assess RV antigen excretion. Presence of RV antigen demonstrated by ELISA in any stool collected at pre-determined time points after Dose 1 up to Visit 3 were considered as vaccine virus shedding.

## Serum analysis

Two aliquots were prepared for all serum samples collected at Visit 1 and Visit 3: One aliquot was shipped  frozen  to  a  qualified  laboratory  in  China  and  the  other  aliquot  was  shipped  frozen  to  GSK Biologicals, Belgium (or Sponsor designated laboratory), for back-up.

Serum obtained from whole blood samples collected from subjects at Visit 1 and Visit 3 were tested by ELISA to measure serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations. The assay cut-off was 20 U/mL. Table 5 gives the assay method used for determining the antibody concentration and the assay cut-off.

## 4. Assessment of safety variables

## Adverse events

The following general AEs were solicited as shown in Table 6:

## 5. Determination of sample size

Target  enrolment  was  50  eligible  subjects  (25  subjects  in  the  HRV  Group  and  25  subjects  in  the Placebo Group) in order to obtain 40 evaluable subjects (20 subjects in each group). The estimated drop-out rate was 20%.

The primary objective of the study was to explore the reactogenicity of the vaccine in order to detect a large  increase  in  the  HRV  Group  as  compared  to  the  Placebo  Group  for  the  percentage  of  subjects reporting grade 3 solicited AEs during the 8-day (Day 0-Day 7) solicited follow-up period after each dose. With 25 subjects in the HRV Group and 25 subjects in the Placebo Group, Table 10 presents the increase in the percentage of subjects reporting at least one grade 3 solicited AE during the 8-day (Day

## 6. Study cohorts/data sets analyzed

## Total vaccinated cohort (TVC)

The TVC included all subjects with at least one dose of liquid HRV vaccine or placebo administration documented:

- a safety analysis based on the TVC included all vaccinated subjects.
- an  immunogenicity  analysis  based  on  the  TVC  included  all  vaccinated  subjects  for  whom immunogenicity data was available.

## ATP cohort for analysis of safety

The ATP cohort for safety included all subjects from the TVC:

- who had received the study vaccine according to the protocol,
- who had not received a vaccine forbidden by or not specified in the protocol,
- for whom the randomisation code had not been broken,
- for whom the study vaccine or placebo was administered according to the protocol,
- who were seronegative for serum anti-RV IgA antibodies on the day of Dose 1.

The TVC was used for the primary analysis of safety. The analysis on the ATP cohort for safety was to be performed only if more than 5% of the vaccinated subjects were excluded from the TVC.

## ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity

The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all subjects from the ATP cohort for safety:

- who had not received medication forbidden by the protocol,
- whose underlying medical condition was not forbidden by the protocol,
- for whom immunogenicity data was available, at pre-sampling and post-sampling time points,
- with no protocol violation of demographics (unknown age at study entry or outside reporting),
- who complied with the vaccination schedule,
- who complied with the blood sampling schedule,
- who had no RV other than the vaccine strain in GE stool samples collected up to Visit 3,
- who  had  no  concomitant  infection  unrelated  to  the  vaccine  which  might  have  influenced  the immune response.

The primary analysis was based on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. If, in any vaccine group, the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity was 5% or more, a second analysis based on the TVC was to be performed to complement the ATP analysis.

## A. Immunogenicity results

The exploratory analyses for immunogenicity was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity and on  TVC  since  more  than  5%  of  the  vaccinated  subjects  were  eliminated  from  the  ATP  cohort  for immunogenicity.

## ATP cohort for immunogenicity analysis

Table  21  presents  the  anti-RV  IgA  antibody  GMC  and  seroconversion  rates  for  the  ATP  cohort  for immunogenicity. Table 22 presents the anti-RV IgA antibody GMC calculated on subjects seropositive for anti-RV IgA antibodies at Visit 3 for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

## Vaccine take

## Assessor's note

'Vaccine take' is a combined immunogenicity endpoint based on seroconversion and/or shedding of the vaccine strain in stools. It is considered as being positive when serum IgA to RV in postvaccination sera is at a concentration of ≥20 U/ml and/or when vaccine virus is shedding in any stool sample collected from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo up to Visit 3 (=one month after the last vaccine dose) in subjects who were negative for RV before Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo.

Table  24  presents  percentage  of  subjects  with  vaccine  take  at  Visit  3  for  the  ATP  cohort  for immunogenicity. The percentage of subjects with vaccine take at Visit 3 was 86.7% [95% CI: 59.5; 98.3] in the HRV Group.

## Unsolicited adverse events

During the 31-day (Day 0-Day 30) follow-up period at least one unsolicited symptom was reported for six subjects (24%) in the HRV group and three subjects (12%) in the placebo Group. Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported unsolicited symptom in both the groups (four subjects (16%) in the HRV group and three subjects (12%) in the placebo group). Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported for one  subject  (4%)  in  each  group.  None  of  the  subjects  reported  any  unsolicited  AEs  with  causal relationship to vaccination.

## ATP cohort for safety analysis

Safety results of the ATP cohort for safety were in line with those of the TVC.

## III. DISCUSSION AND MAH'S OVERALL CONCLUSIONS (SUMMARY)

The occurrence of unsolicited AEs and SAEs observed in this study was similar to that of the studies conducted in the other Asian populations of similar age group. At least one unsolicited symptom was reported  for  14.6%  (95%  CI:  6.1-27.8)  of  the  doses  in  the  HRV  Group,  which  is  similar  to  that observed in a group of subjects who received liquid HRV vaccine according to a 0, 1 month schedule in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies  conducted  in  Vietnam  (15.6%  [95%  CI:  12.4:  19.3])  and  the  Philippines  (15.7%  [95%  CI: 12.5: 19.5]) [Anh, 2011]. There were no SAEs with causal relationship to vaccination nor fatal SAEs reported in this study, which is similar to that observed in a study conducted in Korea [GSK Biologicals Clinical Report 112269/068, 2011].

In the stool samples collected at pre-determined time points, RV antigen was detected in stool samples collected from two subjects in the HRV Group at Day 7 after Dose 1 of HRV vaccine which is similar that  of  a  trial  conducted  in  Singapore  were  shedding  of  vaccine  (RIX4414)  virus  was  detected  in  a large proportion of vaccinated infants on the seventh day after administration of the first dose of HRV vaccine [Phua, 2005]. RV detected in the stool sample collected at Visit 3 from one of the subject in the Placebo group was probably due to natural infection.

The results of this study support the conduct of further clinical studies with the liquid HRV vaccine in the infant population in China.
