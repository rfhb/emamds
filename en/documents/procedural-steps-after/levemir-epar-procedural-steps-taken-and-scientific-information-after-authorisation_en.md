| II/0101   | Update of sections 4.6 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update information on pregnancy, based on final results from the non-interventional Post-Authorisation Safety Study, NN304-4016, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a diabetes pregnancy registry study conducted to assess the long-term safety of insulin use in pregnant women. The RMP version 21.0 has also been submitted. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 09/04/2021   |     | SmPC                             | The use of Levemir in pregnant women with diabetes has been investigated in a clinical trial and in a prospective non-interventional post-authorisation safety study. Post-marketing data in pregnant women using Levemir, with more than 4,500 pregnancy outcomes do not indicate any increased risk of malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity.   |

| II/0066 | Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC in order to add information on an alternative titration algorithm, referred to as the 3-0-3 titration algorithm. In addition the MAHtook the opportunity to amend the product information in order to harmonise with other insulins from the same MAH. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 19/12/2013 | 29/01/2014 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | With the present application the MAH proposed the following changes to the product's posology: Switching from NPH insulin to Levemir The first proposed change concerns addition of information with regards to dose reduction when switching from twice daily NPH insulin to once daily Levemir. A level of 20-30% reduction was proposed by the MAH in accordance with clinical practice. In support of this variation the MAH submitted 4 clinical trials in which a subset of subjects switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once daily Levemir and had their daily dose reduced by 20-30% according to protocol. The data presented revealed no increased risk of no reduction in the Levemir dose when switching, and therefore the relevance of the proposed changes are questioned. More important is, however, that none of the four trials presented were designed to answer the question whether a dose reduction of Levemir (and to which extent), is appropriate when switching from twice daily NPH insulin to once daily Levemir. Thus the subjects were not randomized to different levels of dose-reduction of Levemir, but on levels of reduction chosen at the discretion of the investigators. Furthermore the studies were not powered to demonstrate differences between the groups of dose reduction. In fact the groups compared were small and in several cases there were so few events that comparison between the groups was difficult or inappropriate. Therefore the CHMP concluded that the changes related to the switching from NPH insulin to Levemir were not |

The MAH agreed with the CHMP and did not introduce the proposed changes to the product information. 3-0-3 titration algorithm The MAH further proposed to include a self-managed 3-0-3 algorithm allowing patients to titrate their Levemir dose in steps of ±3 units every third day. In support of this change data from 3 randomised controlled clinical trials including 6454 subjects with type 2 diabetes have been submitted. The data submitted demonstrates that a similar level of glycaemic control can be obtained with the use of the self-managed 3-0-3 titration algorithm compared to standard care titration. The use of the 3-0-3 regime is however associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia, although not major hypoglycemia, especially when using the more aggressive titration. Therefore a warning of hypoglycaemia has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Due to the benefits for the patients in terms of optimised self-care with this algorithm, the benefit risk ratio is however   |

| II/0052   | Update of sections 4.2, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include the results from a clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of Levemir versus NPH insulin in the treatment of pregnant women with type I diabetes and to make the information regarding lipodystrophy clearer. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH deleted the version number of the RMP in Annex II in order to align the text to the current QRD template. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/11/2011 | 19/12/2011 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Overall, Levemir was as efficacious as NPH insulin when administered as basal insulin in combination with IAsp as mealtime bolus insulin. Non-inferiority of IDet to NPH measured by HbA1c at Gestational Week (GW) 36 was shown. The upper limit of the 95% CI for the estimated mean treatment difference in HbA1c was below the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion of 0.4% for both the Full Analysis Set (FAS)Pregnant analysis set (IDet-NPH [95% CI]; 0.06 [-0.21;0.08]) and the Per Protocol (PP)Pregnant analysis set (IDet-NPH [95% CI]; -0.15 [-0.34;0.04]). IDet was not superior to NPH. With Estimated HbA1c values at GW 36 follows: FASPregnant analysis set, IDet 6.27%, NPH 6.33% PPPregnant analysis set, IDet 6.22%, NPH 6.37%. Secondary outcome measures showed a trend toward superior glycaemic control with Levemir compared to NPH as basal insulin treatment.

Randomised clinical drug trials in pregnant women are rare, and the inherent difficulties in interpreting these studies from a safety perspective are well illustrated by this case. A number of uncertainties regarding the safety of Levemir in pregnant women still exist - mainly related to the low power for detecting differences between IDet and NPH insulin. Even if it cannot be excluded that the observed excess of a number of untoward events on Levemir may represent a signal for a true difference, the observed differences could also very well be chance findings. Consequently, it is concluded that treatment with Levemir can be considered during pregnancy, but that any potential benefit must be weighed against a possibly increased risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome.   |

| II/0016   | Update of Section 4.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include information on the combination with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD). Consequential changes to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC were made and were also reflected in Package Leaflet. The Product Information has been also updated in accordance with the QRD template version 7.1 Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 24/01/2007   | 27/02/2007   | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Data from three confirmatory and one supportive trial performed in subjects with type 2 diabetes provided adequate evidence that detemir as add-on to OADs is non-inferior to NPH insulin and insulin glargine in terms of glycaemic control. It also seems that insulin detemir as add-on to OADs might be associated with a smaller weight gain than the comparator insulins. Furthermore insulin detemir as add on to OAD was in general well tolerated. Especially the safety-profile in terms of hypoglycaemic events seems to be favourable. As demonstrated in previous trials application site disorders, lipodystrophy and potential allergic adverse events were reported with higher frequency for insulin detemir than for NHP insulin and also a rise in specific and cross-reacting antibody formation associated with insulin detemir treatment was observed in the insulin detemir groups whereas this was not the case to the same extent in the NPH group. However, these safety issues are known and not related to the concomitant use of OAD. Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been changed as well as the relevant section in the PL. |

| II/0012 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and corresponding sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) with more precise information regarding injection site reactions. Additionally, update of the whole product information to be in accordance with the latest QRD template and minor changes to the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 01/06/2006 | 06/07/2006 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Based on recent information on adverse events from clinical trials as well as on spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions from general practitioners and healthcare providers using the marketed product, the MAH considered that the product information for Levemir should be updated with new relevant information regarding the frequency of application site disorders, how this compares to NPH insulin and the rare need for discontinuation of Levemir after such reactions. Consequently, section 4.4 of the SPC was updated with a warning including more precise information regarding injection site reactions and the recommendation to rotate the injection site in order to prevent these reactions, as well as the necessity to discontinue the treatment on the rare occasion that this reactions are not resolved in a few days to a few weeks. Additionally, the sentence related to the frequency of injection site reactions in section 4.8 of the SPC was updated to reflect that these reactions are seen more frequently during the treatment with Levemir than with human insulin. |
