## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Apnoea of prematurity (AOP) is defined as 'cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer, or as a brief  episode  if  associated  with  bradycardia  (HR&lt;100  beats/min),  cyanosis,  or  pallor'.  Primary  (or idiopathic)  apnoea  of  prematurity  is a  diagnosis  of exclusion  and implies that  underlying  causes  of apnoea have been excluded.

Brief  pauses  in  breathing  (five  to  ten  seconds)  are  a  common  event  in  preterm  infants.  Prolonged pauses  can  lead  to  hypoxaemia,  decreased  peripheral  perfusion,  cyanosis,  reflex  vagal  bradycardia, and hypotonia.

AOP  appears  to  be  due  to  central  immaturity  of  brainstem  respiratory  centres  with  an  attenuated respiratory response to carbon dioxide (CO2), a paradoxical response to hypoxia (resulting in apnoea rather  than  hyperventilation),  and  an  exaggerated  inhibitory  response  to  airway  (e.g.  laryngeal) stimulation.

AOP is a common condition in preterm neonates affecting approximately 90% of extremely low birth weight  infants  (&lt;1000g).  The  incidence  varies  inversely  with  gestational  age  (GA).  The  onset  of primary  AOP  presents  between  the  2nd  and  7th  day  of  life.  It  usually  resolves  by  36  weeks  postmenstrual age and does not predict future episodes of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Infants  at  risk  for  apnoea  should  be  monitored  with  apnoea  monitors.  Gentle  cutaneous stimulation may  suffice  for  infants  with  mild  and  intermittent  episodes.  Prolonged  and  recurrent  apnoeas  may result in a need for supplemental oxygen, bag and mask ventilation, or intubation and positive pressure ventilation.

Methylxanthines such as theophylline and caffeine act as effective respiratory stimulants. Caffeine and its salts, in the form of magisterial preparations, have been extensively used in Europe for more than two decades for the short-term treatment of apnoea of prematurity in neonates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Caffeine Citrate Chiesi, 60 mg/3 ml solution for intravenous infusion and oral solution was developed to meet the need often expressed in the scientific literature for a standardised preparation of caffeine citrate  of  suitable  quality.  Marketing  authorization  of  the  product  will  permit  the  European-wide availability of a preparation of caffeine citrate which is subject to the full assurances of an authorised product.

Caffeine is a trimethylxanthine structurally related to the methylxanthines theophylline and theobromine. Most of the pharmacodynamic effects of caffeine are attributed to adenosine receptor antagonism  at  both  A1  and  A2  receptor  subtypes.  Other  mechanisms,  such  as  phosphodiesterase inhibition, may play a role in some of caffeine's effects at higher plasma concentrations.

In the treatment of AOP, caffeine acts by increasing the sensitivity and probably also decreasing the threshold  of  the  medullary  respiratory  centre  to  CO2.  In  particular,  caffeine  can  increase  minute ventilation. Caffeine decreases the frequency of apnoeic episodes, increases respiratory rate and blood pH, decreases pCO2, and improves the function of the respiratory muscles in premature infants with recurrent apnoea.

Nymusa (formerly Caffeine Citrate Chiesi) 60 mg/3 ml is a solution for intravenous infusion and for oral administration in the strength 20 mg caffeine citrate/ml. Caffeine citrate 20 mg/ml is equivalent to 10 mg caffeine base/ml.

The recommended posology is:

|                    | Dose of caffeine citrate (Volume)   | Dose of caffeine citrate (mg/kg body weight)   | Route                                                         | Frequency       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Loading dose       | 1.0 ml/kg body weight               | 20 mg/kg body weight                           | Intravenous infusion （over30minutes)                          | Once            |
| Maintenance dose * | 0.25 ml/kg body weight              | 5 mg/kg body weight                            | Intravenousinfusion (over10 minutes)or by oral administration | Every 24 hours* |

* Beginning 24 hours after the loading dose

In  preterm  infants  with  insufficient  clinical  response  to  the  recommended  loading  dose,  a  second loading dose of 10 - 20 mg/kg maximum may be given after 24 hours.

Higher  maintenance  doses  of  10mg/kg  body  weight  could  be  considered  in  case  of  insufficient response, taking into account the potential for accumulation of caffeine due to the long half-life in premature  neonates  and  the  progressively  increasing  capacity  to  metabolise  caffeine  in  relation  to post-menstrual  age  (see  section  5.2  of  the  SPC).  Where  clinically  indicated,  caffeine  plasma  levels should be monitored. The diagnosis of AOP may need to be reconsidered if patients do not respond adequately to a second loading dose or a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg/day (see section 4.4 of the SPC).

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Nymusa is presented as  a  solution  for  infusion  and  oral  solution.  It  contains  caffeine  as  the  active substance. Other ingredients include citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate and water for injections.

The finished product is filled into clear 4 ml Pharm. Eur. type I glass ampoules containing a claimed volume of 3 ml of caffeine citrate solution (20mg/ml). To guarantee the claimed volume an overfilling is applied. The ampoules are packed in cardboard boxes.

## Drug Substance

Caffeine  is  a  well  known  active  substance  described  in  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  (monograph number 0267). The chemical name of caffeine is 1,3,7-Trimethyl-3,7-dihydro-1 H -purine-2,6-dione. It is  a  white  or  almost  white,  crystalline  powder  that  is  sparingly  soluble  in  water,  freely  soluble  in boiling water, slightly soluble in ethanol (96 per cent). It also dissolves in concentrated solution of alkali benzoates or salicylates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BASF Pharmachemikalien, the manufacturer of the active substance, has been granted a Certificate of Suitability  of  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  for  Caffeine  (R1-CEP  1998-022-Rev  01)  that  has  been provided  within  the  current  Marketing  Authorisation  Application.  Therefore  no  further  information about the manufacture, characterisation and stability of the active substance has been provided.

## · Specification

The active substance is analysed according to the Pharm. Eur. monograph. In addition the finished product  manufacturer  is  testing  the  microbiological  characteristics  the  active  substance  of  caffeine, since the finished product is sterile.

The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification, assay, acidity, related substances,  sulphates,  heavy  metals,  sulphated  ash,  loss  on  drying,  total  viable  aerobic  count  and bacterial endotoxins.

Batch analysis data from 3 batches have been provided. The results demonstrated compliance to the Pharm. Eur. monograph and have shown suitable microbiological purity.

- Stability

The  proposed  re-test  period,  storage  conditions  and  containers  are  according  to  the  certificate  of suitability.

## Drug Product

- Pharmaceutical Development

Nymusa is presented as a sterile solution for infusion and oral solution. Caffeine is dissolved in water for injection. The pH of the aqueous solution is adjusted and controlled by citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate. Addition of the buffering agents citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate results in in situ formation of the highly water soluble caffeine citrate salt.

The  chosen  excipients  are  regarded  to  be  suitable  for  their  intended  use.  All  excipients  are monographed  substances  and  are  tested  against  monographed  limits  by  Pharm.  Eur.  methods.  In addition  to  the  tests  described  in  the  monograph  the  excipients  have  been  analysed  for  total  viable aerobic count. Limits have  been  set in accordance  to requirements  of the Pharm.  Eur.  for microbiological quality of pharmaceutical preparations.

The medicinal product is provided in single dose containers covering a volume of 3 ml. The chosen ampoule  size  is  based  on  the  required  loading  dose,  which  may  vary  from  0.5  to  3ml.  Since  the formulation does not contain any preservatives any unused portions must be discarded after opening of the ampoules, which is clearly addressed in the SPC. The risk of withdrawal of more than one dose of the ampoules has been appropriately addressed by the risk management plan of the company. Since Nymusa  is  intended  to  be  administered  in  a  neonatal  intensive  care  unit  only,  the  overall  risk  is considered acceptable.

Caffeine  citrate  solution  is  filled  into  ampoules  of  colourless  neutral  glass  with  a  high  hydrolytic resistance. The glass complies with the requirements of Pharm. Eur. for Type I glass.

Since the product is intended to be administered by infusion after dilution, compatibility studies have been performed for the caffeine citrate solution and three possible solutions for infusion (5% Dextrose, 0.9% Sodium Chloride and 10% Calcium gluconate) for a total of 24 hours after dilution.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process is a standard process for these kinds of formulations. Terminal sterilisation is performed in line with the requirements of the Ph.Eur.

All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls, i.e. control of pH of the bulk solution, filter integrity before and after filtration, test of filling weight and filling height, control of the physical conditions within the autoclave and control of labelling and packaging of the ampoules.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The validation report from 3 production scale batches demonstrates that the process is reproducible and provides a product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications.

- Product Specification

The finished product specification includes tests for appearance of solution, colour of solution, final packaging, extractable volume, pH, identification and content of drug substance, uniformity of dosage unit, degradation products, sterility and particulate contamination.

Batch  analysis  data  from  3  production  scale  batches  have  been  presented.  All  batches  met  the  test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release.

- Stability of the Product

Data from stability studies on three production scale batches have been provided. Samples were stored for twelve months at long term and intermediate conditions and for 6 months at accelerated conditions in accordance with ICH  requirements All batches have been investigated for physical and technological parameters.

In addition, supporting stability data of pilot scale batches have been performed covering the proposed shelf-life of 36 months.

In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects.

The quality of Nymusa is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

The active substance is well known and has is described in a Ph. Eur. monograph. The quality of the drug  substance  is  regarded  to  be  suitable  for  the  intended  use  and  appropriately  controlled  by  the applicant. The excipients are commonly used in these types of formulations and comply with Ph. Eur. requirements.  The  packaging  material  is  commonly  used  and  well  documented.  The  manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard process that includes terminal sterilisation that has been adequately  described.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Due to the bibliographic nature of this application and the date of origin of some of the submitted studies GLP aspects are not fully covered according to the present regulatory standards.

This is however acceptable due to the well established use of the product.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

A thorough  review  of  the  mechanisms  of  action  of  caffeine  in  relation  to  the  expected  respiratory effects  as  well  as  proof  of  concept  studies  in  newborn  and  adult  animals  has  been  provided  in  the application based on published studies. Proof of concept studies are available in different species and ages.

In  newborn  rabbits,  the  facilitatory  effect  of  caffeine  on  the  central  mechanisms  controlling  the breathing  pattern  was  indicated  by:  1)  the  enhanced  Hering-Breuer  expiratory  promoting  effect;  2) lack  of  effect  on  the  Hering-Breuer  deflation  reflex;  3)  qualitatively  similar  effects  of  caffeine postvagotomy and prevagotomy. In rabbits, the respiratory system is in a more advanced stage than in humans at birth. Despite this fact that implies that the model here discussed is not ideal for preterm infants, the main effects intended for caffeine have been shown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  Authors  also  discussed  the  potential  clinical  relevance  of  the  increase  in  the  strength  of  the Hering-Breuer expiratory promoting reflex following caffeine injection. This reflex may be elicited by a  continuous airway distending pressure which is currently used to treat apnea in premature infants who  have  a  strong  inflation  reflex  as  compared  to  adults.  This  could  lead  to  decrease  in  minute ventilation  as  expiratory  time  is  prolonged.  In  the  presence  of  caffeine,  this  prolongation  could  be increased.  Therefore,  the  Authors  concluded  that  both  types  of  treatment  for  apnoea  should  not  be used together  unless  blood  gases  are  checked  to  ensure  that  alveolar  ventilation  has  not  decreased. However, this preclinical issue has sufficiently been considered on a clinical level (Study 5.3.4.2.1., Laubsher B. et. al).

In piglets aged 1-5 days, the effects of caffeine 20 mg/kg iv infusion were also shown in situations of hypocapnic  and  hypercapnic  hypoxia.  The  domestic  pig  reveals  a  similar  developmental  pattern  of histological and ultrastructural lung maturation (term at approx. 115 days) during pregnancy to that of humans. Differentiation of fetal lungs follows similar steps and time-windows known from humans [Baskerville  1976].  However,  pig  fetuses  are  not  viable  when  delivered  preterm  (e.g.  90  days  of gestation). Therefore the newborn animals at term are expected to be at a more advanced stage of lung development than the intended target premature infants. In addition, lung tissue and function in the piglets  would  have  been  normal,  which  may  not  be  the  case  in  some  target  babies.  Therefore,  this model can be considered as partially relevant only for the patient condition in discussion. This study was designed on the basis of the adenosine receptor blocking properties of caffeine. It did not address the clarification of the mechanism of action of the methylxanthine. Anyway, it has shown that caffeine ameliorated  the  ventilatory  depression  in  the  biphasic  response  to  hypoxia,  at  the  dose  which  is proposed also in the current file. Therefore, despite the insufficiencies highlighted here, the study may be considered as supportive of the proposed use of caffeine citrate.

In premature baboons the respiratory benefits of 20 mg/kg given at 20 min and 24 h of age to very premature animals (D125 gestation) treated with surfactant, has also been shown. The animal model using extremely premature baboons  delivered at 125 days (67% of term which is roughly equivalent to human gestation of 26-27 weeks) and treated with exogenous surfactant, mechanical ventilation and appropriate oxygen supply is described as a relevant model for BPD in premature newborn infants[ Coalson et al, 1999, Am J resp Crit Care, 160:133].

These animals develop structural lesions characterized by severe alveolar hypoplasia with decreased and  dysmorphic  vascular  growth.  The  baboon  model  shows  similarities  in  pathology  and  ontogeny comparable to preterm infants.  In  this  study,  the  dose  of  caffeine  citrate  used  was  the  same  as  the proposed for the current indication. Since the animal model is relevant and the dose used is the same as that proposed in the target patient population, this study seems to be the most relevant as proof of concept. However, only 24 hours effects were covered while up to one month is possible with this treatment. Possibility for changes in the response pattern, including development of tolerance, was not addressed. However, since clinical data is available from the approximately 25 years of caffeine use in this situation, this type of uncertainty is superseded by the findings in the clinical setting.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The  effects  of  Caffeine  on  renal  function  have  been  studied  in  comparison  with  theophylline  in  4 groups of 5 to 10-day old New Zealand rabbits.

The neonatal rabbit is described as a good model for renal function in newborn infants. Renal effects observed with the 10mg/Kg of caffeine, decreased diuresis and increased tubular water absorption are relevant for treated premature infants. Nevertheless, only one high dose of caffeine is in principle to be given, followed by 5mg/Kg which might be expected to be safer. 6mg/Kg caffeine had no relevant effect in renal function in the rabbit model.

Caffeine influenced T4 and TSH release in the premature animals. This may be of clinical relevance, particularly  because  preterm  infants  depend  on  maternal  thyroid  hormones.  The  impact  of  caffeine treatment on the thyroid and pituitary functions of the preterm infants under long term treatment was discussed by  the Applicant  and  is part of  the  Risk  management  plan  (long-term  effect  on neurodevelopment and growth).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Safety pharmacology programme

No conventional safety pharmacology studies on Caffeine were found in the literature. However, studies on behaviour, gastric tolerance and effects on necrotizing enterocolitis in rats as well as effects on  cardiovascular  system  in  rats  and  dogs  are  cited  and  discussed  in  the  toxicology  section  of  this report.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No conventional pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies on Caffeine were found in the literature. Interactions data are discussed in the clinical setting.

## Pharmacokinetics

Analysis of the extensive literature allowed a full characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile of Caffeine  in  the  most  relevant  species  used  in  pharmaco-toxicological  studies  and  in  particular  in neonatal animals. Dose-dependent kinetics have been reported in humans, as in animals, suggesting a saturation of metabolic transformations. In the neonatal period, elimination of Caffeine is impaired in animals  and  humans,  due  to  the  immaturity  of  the  hepatic  enzyme  systems.  In  mature  animals, Caffeine is metabolised in the liver, mostly in microsomes. There are some interspecies differences between Caffeine metabolism in experimental animals and humans. Some metabolites of Caffeine also have marked pharmacological activity. Thus, 1,3-dimethylxanthine (theophylline) and 1,7-dimethylxanthine  (paraxanthine)  are  to  be  taken  into  account  when  considering  the  biological  actions  of Caffeine.

Due to the high solubility of caffeine in water, different routes of administration (oral or parenteral) had  no  relevant  impact  on  the  PK  characteristics.  Metabolic  differences  between  different  animal species (rodents) and humans were identified. However, a progressive increase in the activity of the hepatic  enzyme  system  is  evident  during  neonatal  development.  I.e.  this  effect  is  the  same  in premature neonatal animals and humans, as caffeine undergoes very little biotransformation and - in the neonatal period of humans and animals - the caffeine half-life is increased.

A potential of caffeine to induce its own metabolism has been shown only for doses above 100mg/kg - and therefore seems to out of clinical relevance for the intended indication.

In summary preclinical aspects on pharmacokinetics were appropriately reviewed and considerations on PK drug interactions were addressed accordingly in the SPC.

## Toxicology

No toxicological studies have been conducted by Chiesi on Caffeine or Caffeine Citrate. There are, however, numerous published data on acute, repeated, mutagenicity and oncogenicity studies as well as  reproductive  toxicities  defining  the  safety  profile  of  Caffeine.  The  more  significant  published studies  are  summarized  and  discussed  below.  For  the  evaluation  of  the  safety  profile  of  Caffeine particular attention was paid to the 'Cafcit (Caffeine Citrate) - Summary Basis for Approval. NDAFDA  20-793,  1997'  (Study  4.2.3.1.2)  and  to  'Caffeine  monograph  issued  by  OECD  SIDS (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development - Screening Information Data Set) UNEP Publications  2003'  (Study  4.2.3.1.3),  where  the  toxicity  profile  of  Caffeine  is  well  defined  and discussed.

## · Single dose toxicity

Due to  the  lack  of  reliable  toxicokinetic  investigations  in  the  published  toxicity  studies,  the  safety margins with respect to the clinical dose have been calculated on mg/kg basis considering the daily intravenous or oral clinical doses: 10 mg/kg of Caffeine base by infusion on day 1 as a loading dose followed by 2.5 mg/kg, orally or by infusion, as the maintenance dose.

The  acute  toxicity  of  caffeine  expressed  as  LD50  seemed  similar  in  different  species,  rodents  and nonrodents.  The  information  in  newborns  has  only  been  collected  in  one  study  in  rats,  where  the neonatal animals (2 days of age) were more sensitive than the adult ones. In terms of CNS, 2 days old rats  are  less  mature  than  term  infants,  and  therefore  the  young  animals  used  may  be  relevant  as  a model of premature infants, in terms of CNS immaturity. The fact that after oral and intravenous bolus administration the blood levels at LD50 were similar despite the different values obtained for each

route  supports  the  need  for  discussion  on  whether  blood  concentrations  need  to  be  monitored  in neonates, particularly the younger ones. This is reinforced for the suggestion that in neonatal rats the metabolisation is slower.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The  revised  repeated  dose  toxicity studies of caffeine  were  not  in  compliance  with  current international guidelines and the experimental designs of several differed from those currently required for regulatory purposes. Nevertheless the studies may be considered as contributive to the description of the toxicity of Caffeine following repeated treatment. They allowed the identification of the main clinical signs at high doses, including convulsions and psychotic like reactions (animal biting and self mutilation  more  often  in  younger  animals),  anorexia  and  loss  of  body  weight  gain.  The  main morphological  changes  seen  at  lethal  doses  were:  lung  (congestion,  oedema,  thrombosis  and haemorrhage) and gastrointestinal effects (mild hyperaemia, mild to moderate inflammation with some ulcers). An effect on spermatogenic cells with testicular atrophy was also seen.

The NOAEL appeared to be 5 and 20 times the clinical loading (10 mg/kg on day 1) and maintenance (2.5 mg/kg up to 12 days) doses. These safety margins were calculated on a mg/kg basis dividing the NOAEL  for  the  clinical  doses  and  adjusting  the  value  obtained  by  3.  This  correction  was  made because the animals were treated via drinking water or diet, routes of administration which result in a lower absorption of the drug substance and are influenced by several factors (stability of the substance, spilling and pollution of food or water, etc). Consequently the safety margins are only indicative. With the exception of one study, the information discussed derives from adult animals.

The main targets of concern raised from these studies are the gastro-intestinal tract, the kidney and the lung where haemorrhages were observed in animals treated with high doses of caffeine.

Since the target population will be premature infants, some studies in juvenile animals addressing the potential safety of caffeine when administered to immature systems, have been included in the file. Three  studies  where  the  effects  of  postnatal  Caffeine  exposure  on  growth,  and/or  activity  and/or learning are included in the Application.

Oral  by  gavage:  the  effects  of  low  dose  Caffeine  exposure  during  the  first  week  of  life  was investigated  in  rats  from  day  1  to  day  6  of  age.  This  time  period  is  proposed  to  provide  an  animal model equivalent to the human third trimester or premature infant exposure.

- Treated animals grew more slowly, were hypoactive at two weeks of age, and were impaired on an operant spatial learning task as adults.
- The timing of the appearance of developmental landmarks, adult body weight and adult brain weight, however, were not affected by postnatal Caffeine exposure.
- Neither  of  the  two  developmental  measures  of  behaviour  (eye-opening  and  righting  reflex) were altered by Caffeine treatment.

Oral  through  maternal  milk:  Sprague  Dawley  rat  pups  were  exposed  to  caffeine  in  maternal  milk through exposure of 23-30 mg/kg, or 94-135 mg/kg to the dams throughout lactation for 21 days.

- No significant difference between weights of treated and untreated animals were seen.
- Offspring of Caffeine-treated dams showed significantly earlier onset of auditory startle and air righting reflexes.
- There  were  no  dose-related  effects  and  no  difference  in  eye-opening  between  treated  and control groups.
- No direct effects of treatment were observed on eight measures of open field activity.
- locomotor activity in animals exposed to Caffeine via dam milk was not different to control group.

Subcutaneous route: The behavioural responses of 1- and 10-day-old Long Evans rats to Caffeine (0, 5, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg subcutaneously) were determined using several behaviours readily exhibited by the neonatal rat.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- After  single  doses,  in  pups  of  both  ages  activity  as  well  as  attachment  latencies  in  the  on nipple suckling test increased, while weight gain and attachment frequencies in on mother and on nipple suckling tests decreased.
- In addition, the home orientation of 10-day-old rats was disrupted.
- Similar effects were found in l-day-old pups exposed to theophylline.
- Long term exposure (9 days) to Caffeine during gestation (l-day-old pups) or on Days 1-9 of lactation (10-day-old pups) increased the pup activity levels and altered the activity increase observed following an acute Caffeine challenge.

Additionally, other studies suggest an effect of caffeine in thyroid and pituitary function which may be of relevance in premature infants who are highly dependent on maternal hormones and therefore will be deficient on these.

In conclusion, the potential for caffeine to affect the cardiovascular system in a dose-dependent way is well known, and the studies described above in rats and dogs have reiterated this knowledge.

## · Genotoxicity

In their literature search, the Applicant has identified more than 150 in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity tests  on  caffeine  reported  in  the  literature.  Multiple  tests  have  been  included  and  discussed  in  the submitted file. The main battery including Ames test and chromosomal aberration was negative. The in  vivo  micronucleus  test  was  positive  only  at  substantially  high  dose  of  300mg/Kg.  No  specific concern is raised from the studies discussed in the file. Furthermore, caffeine is a component of dietary coffee and is present in multiple pharmaceutical formulations. The available information is considered sufficient to support the nongenotoxic potential of caffeine.

## · Carcinogenicity

In view of the maximal intended duration of the caffeine treatment of premature newborns (37 days at maximum), carcinogenicity studies would not be needed unless a cause of concern exists, taking into consideration the fact that the target population is low age pediatric. From the studies here discussed, no  concern  on  pro-carcinogenic  potential  for  caffeine  is  raised.  When  applied  concomitantly  with different carcinogens, caffeine administration has reduced the number of tumors for some carcinogens, increased for other or had no effect. This information is of difficult interpretation and its relevance for the current application may be limited. Indeed, it may be more important in relation to widespread use of caffeine in the multiple dietary components available.

The CHMP was of the opinion that there is no concern of tumorigenesis by caffeine in the context of indication and use proposed in this application.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Reproductive toxicity  studies  from  literature  allow  the  understanding  of  effects  of  caffeine  in  male fertility,  on  embryofetal  development  and  on  pre-post  natal  development.  As  a  conclusion,  adverse testicular  and  sperm  effects  that  may  affect  fertility  of  males  exposed  even  in  premature  stage  to caffeine cannot be excluded. Also growth retardation especially on ossification may be expected after administration of caffeine to premature infants.

## · Local tolerance

Local tolerance studies at the gastrointestinal tract in rodents have shown a potential for caffeine to increase the development of gastric ulcers in adult animals when these have been exposed postnatally to caffeine. Aminophyline aggravated the signals and consequences including mortality associated to a rat  model  of  necrotising  enterocolitis.  This  may  represent  a  risk  for  preterm  babies  treated  with caffeine, but has been addressed on a clinical level and was noted in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Other toxicity studies

The effect of caffeine on the cardiovascular system was investigated in a rat (Sprague Dawley) study which  results  demonstrated  that  long  term  administration  (117  weeks)  of  caffeine  (50mg/Kg/day) markedly reduced lifespan due to cardiovascular disease.

In  dogs  ,  dose-dependent  arritmogenic  potential  was  also  seen.  At  low  doses  (1.25  mg/Kg)  benign arrytmias (sinus arritmia, atrial ectopics, tachycardia) due to vagal stimulation, and at a higher dose of 5mg/Kg more severe pattern was observed (ventricular tachycardia, multifocal ventricular premature contractions, atrial flutter and fibrillation).

No skin or eye irritancy potential was identified for caffeine in rabbits.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment has been provided. A revised PECsurfacewater (0.008 µg/L) below the  action  limit  was  obtained  for  a  Fpen  of  0.0008%.  The  revised  Fpen  was  based  on  a  disease prevalence of 1.18/10000 inhabitants per year and assuming 20 mg of caffeine citrate as the maximum daily dose and a 25 days mean treatment duration. No published data was provided by the applicant to justify  either  the  disease  prevalence  or  the  assumption  of  1kg  as  the  maximum  body  weight  of premature newborns or even the treatment duration. However, natural substances are exempted from an  environmental  risk  assessment  because  they  are  unlikely  to  result  in  significant  risk  to  the environment. Consequently no further steps in ERA were required.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The toxicological profile of caffeine has been appropriately described in the file in the multiple studies presented in the extensive bibliographic revision performed.

The information included suggests a higher toxicity in caffeine in low ages and as compared to adults. Death due to acute toxicity is related to respiratory arrest and convulsions. The need for monitoring of plasma levels, particularly in the younger prematures is discussed in the clinical section.

Under repeated treatment, target organs  of  toxicity  were  the  stomach,  the  kidney,  the  lung  and  the reproductive tract. Behavioural changes could be seen in some studies in young animals at therapeutic levels. Consequently section 5.3 of the SPC was amended accordingly.

Growth and ossification retardation is suggested from reproductive toxicity studies, where embryotoxicity was observed, as well as increased toxicity on lactating animals. In addition, decreased male fertility with sperms decrease and testicular changes of treated males was observed, irrespective of  age.  Also,  embryotoxicity  was  observed  in  association  to  treated  males.  No  genotoxic  or carcinogenic concerns are raised from studies revised. The limited duration of treatment and the life threatening condition here discussed would not require carcinogenicity studies to be conducted in the absence  of  a  specific  concern.  Increased  propensity  for  ulcer  development  in  the  adult  stage,  and higher susceptibility to necrotising enterocolitis is also raised form the published information revised.

The main safety aspects of caffeine administration to premature newborns have been highlighted in the extensive literature publications submitted. Some of these aspects would have benefited from further discussion.  However,  since  there  is  an  extensive  clinical  experience  with  caffeine,  including  in premature newborns, additional nonclinical studies were not required.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

## GCP

Due to the bibliographic nature of this application and the date of origin of some of the submitted studies  GCP  aspects  are  not  fully  covered  according  to  the  present  regulatory  standards.  The  GCP status of the different studies is unknown.

According  to  Article  8.3  (ib)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  a  statement  to  the  effect  that clinical  trials  carried  out  outside  the  European  Union  meet  the  ethical  requirements  of  Directive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2001/20/EC  was  provided.  This  statement  indicates  that  'clinical  trials  carried  out  outside  the European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC' together with a listing of all trials  (protocol number) and third countries involved (see LoQ). For the main trial (study 5.3.5.1.1) and  for  the  CAP-study  (study  5.3.5.1.6)  this  statement  was  provided  by  the  Applicant;  for  the supportive trials the information is confined to declaration of protocol approval by an ethical board or compliance with the declaration of Helsinki.

## Pharmacokinetics

- Absorption

Literature  data  on  caffeine  pharmacokinetics  in  young  infants  indicate  that  orally  administered caffeine  citrate  is  rapidly  and  completely  bioavailable  for  preterm  neonates;  supporting  data  are, however, scarce and inconsistent (tmax 0.5 -2 hours in one study and 4.6 hours in another).

Absolute  bioavailability  was  not  fully  examined  in  preterm  neonates.  Comparison  of  the  PK parameters obtained in studies where IV and oral doses of caffeine citrate were administered suggests that oral and IV pharmacokinetics of caffeine citrate are similar and absolute bioavailability of orally administered caffeine citrate is nearly 100%.

No effect of formula feeding on the extent of absorption of caffeine citrate in premature infants has been detected. Mean tmax was, however, prolonged from 3.4 hours in the fasted state to 5.9 hours after feeding.

## · Distribution

Plasma protein binding is ca. 35% and almost exclusively to albumin.

Cerebrospinal fluid caffeine levels in treated preterm neonates are close to and appear to be in rapid equilibrium with their plasma levels.

Caffeine  ingested  by  the  mother  crossed  the  placenta  and  caffeine  concentrations  that  are  close  to therapeutic levels are often found in cord blood of preterm infants at birth.

Caffeine  ingested  by  nursing  mothers  appears  in  breast  milk  within  about  15  minutes  of  maternal ingestion  in  concentrations  comparable  to  those  in  plasma.  Monitoring  of  serum  caffeine  levels  is advisable when caffeine therapy is planned in infants born to mothers who consumed caffeine prior to delivery or in infants whose mothers consume caffeine while breast-feeding. This is reflected in the SPC.

The mean volume of distribution of caffeine in infants is about 0.8-0.9 L/kg, which is slightly higher than that in adults (0.6 L/kg).

- Elimination

In  adults,  biotransformation of caffeine occurs in the liver via microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP1A2) and via the soluble enzyme xanthine oxidase. In premature neonates CYP1A2 is not yet expressed.

The predominant process of caffeine metabolism in preterm infants is conversion to theophylline via N7-demethylation.  As a result, caffeine metabolism and excretion is very slow in premature neonates.

Interconversion  between  caffeine  and  theophylline  has  been  reported  with  25%  of  theophylline converted  to  caffeine  via  methylation  and  between  3-8%  of  caffeine  converted  to  theophylline  via CYP1A2.  Because  theophylline  is  metabolised  to  caffeine  in  neonates,  it  is  essential  that  baseline plasma concentrations of caffeine are measured in infants previously treated with theophylline when caffeine therapy is planned.

A delay in caffeine elimination has been observed in breast-fed as compared to formula fed infants.

No  proper  dose  escalation  studies  were  performed.  There  is  only  limited  information  on  dose proportionality  from  three  of  the  submitted  studies.  However,  results  give  supporting  evidence  to assume dose linearity for the investigated dose-range (2.5 - 3mg/kg to 30mg/kg).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Inter-patient  variability,  as  determined  based  on  population  pharmacokinetics, was  approx.  25%  for clearance and approx. 11% for volume of distribution. Intra-patient error (standard deviation, SD) was 3.9 mg/L. Interpretability of reported intra-subject variability is very limited.

In neonates, caffeine is eliminated predominantly via renal excretion according to first-order kinetics; approximately 86% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine within 6 days, compared with 4% in adults.

In infants, mean elimination half-life (t½) of caffeine and fraction excreted unchanged in urine (Ae) are inversely related to gestational age.

Maturation  of  different  caffeine  metabolising  systems  from  birth  to  ca.  9  months  of  age  follows  a pattern based on the following findings:

- The caffeine elimination half-life and CL varied linearly with GA and exponentially with PNA, the plateau being reached during the second trimester of life.
- Half-life  is  prolonged  during  the  neonatal  period  and  for  as  many  as  38  weeks  gestation  in premature babies: Half-lives approximately 20-fold longer (102.9 h, range 40 - 230 h) than in adults (5-6 hours) and an 11-fold decrease in body clearance relative to adult are observed.
- It is suggested that N3-demethylation is more important in young infants than in adults and that maturation of N1-demethylation occurs later than 19 months of age.
- 8-hydroxylation is mature as early as 1 month of age and may be higher in infants than in adults.
- By 9 months of age, the metabolism of caffeine approximates that seen in adults (t½ = 5h; Ae = 1%) and correlates closely with the rise in metabolite production.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No  proper  dose  escalation  studies  were  performed.  There  is  only  limited  information  on  dose proportionality from three of the submitted publications. However, results give supporting evidence to assume dose linearity for the investigated dose-range (2.5 - 3mg/kg to 30mg/kg).

In theory, repeated daily dosing as proposed for the maintenance of caffeine citrate treatment in AOP could result in accumulation of caffeine, due to its long elimination half-life in premature newborns. In the submitted clinical studies that applied once daily maintenance regimens and reported PK data, no accumulation of caffeine in plasma of premature infants was however observed.

In the main efficacy study by Erenberg, measurement of PK parameters in the course of the 10 - 12 day study period was a secondary objective. It is described that for 17 infants who completed doubleblind caffeine treatment, plasma samples obtained on day 10 (n=14) and on day 8 (n=3) were within the reported therapeutic range of 8-20µg/ml.

In  the  PK  study  by  JV  Aranda  (J  Pediatr  1979;  repeated  dosing  with  a  maintenance  dose  of 2.5mg/kg/day  was  carried  out  in  10  infants  for  a  mean  of  19  days,  yielding  steady  state  plasma concentrations between 7.4 and 19.4mg/L.

The SPC section 4.2 therefore states that:

The recommended dose regimen in previously untreated infants is a loading dose of 20 mg caffeine citrate per kg body weight administered by slow intravenous infusion over 30 minutes, using a syringe infusion pump or other metered infusion device. After an interval of 24 hours, maintenance doses of 5 mg per kg body weight may be administered by slow intravenous infusion over 10 minutes every 24 hours.  Alternatively,  maintenance  doses  of  5  mg  per  kg  body  weight  may  be  administered  by  oral administration, such as through a nasogastric tube every 24 hours.

The  recommended  loading  dose  and  maintenance  doses  of  caffeine  citrate  are  provided  in  the following  table  which  clarifies  the  relationship  between  injection  volumes  and  administered  doses expressed as caffeine citrate. The dose expressed as caffeine base is one-half the dose when expressed as caffeine citrate (20 mg caffeine citrate are equivalent to 10 mg caffeine base).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|                    | Dose of caffeine citrate (Volume)   | Dose of caffeine citrate (mg/kg body weight)   | Route                                                            | Frequency       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Loading dose       | 1.0 ml/kg body weight               | 20 mg/kg body weight                           | Intravenous infusion （over30 munutes)                            | Once            |
| Maintenance dose * | 0.25 ml/kg body weight              | 5 mg/kg body weight                            | Intravenous infusion (over 10 minutes) or by oral administration | Every 24 hours* |

事 Beginning 24 hours after the loading dose

The CHMP discussed whether a second loading dose of 20mg/kg body weight might be appropriate if an infant shows insufficient response to the first loading dose, i.e. at the beginning of treatment with caffeine citrate. This approach was supported by data from the Erenberg study. After further discussion at CHMP, it was agreed to propose a second loading dose of 10-20mg/kg maximum.

It  was however doubtful whether this approach would be successful if insufficient response became evident in the course of the treatment (in an infant that previously responded well to caffeine citrate).

In the large Schmidt study in 2006 premature infants, the adjustment strategy was to increase the daily maintenance  dose  up  to  10mg/kg.  Although  no  specific  efficacy/safety  data  for  this  subgroup  is available,  there  were  no  safety  concerns  in  this  study  overall,  and  only  23  of  1006  infants  in  the caffeine group had doses of caffeine citrate withheld or reduced due to suspected toxicity. Therefore, the  CHMP concluded that for infants with caffeine plasma levels below or at the lower end of the therapeutic range this option might be considered, given the ICU conditions of monitoring of heart rate,  blood  pressure, renal function, body weight, etc., and under continuous monitoring of caffeine plasma levels to recognise and minimise the risk of accumulation.

The  following  wording  was  agreed  upon  for  Section  4.2  in  the  SPC  (to  follow  after  the  abovementioned paragraph):

In  preterm  infants  with  insufficient  clinical  response  to  the  recommended  loading  dose,  a  second loading dose of 10 - 20 mg/kg maximum may be given after 24 hours.

Higher  maintenance  doses  of  10mg/kg  body  weight  could  be  considered  in  case  of  insufficient response, taking into account the potential for accumulation of caffeine due to the long half-life in premature neonates  and  the  progressively  increasing  capacity  to  metabolise  caffeine  in  relation  to post-menstrual  age  (see  section  5.2).  Where  clinically  indicated,  caffeine  plasma  levels  should  be monitored. The diagnosis of AOP may need to be reconsidered if patients do not respond adequately to a second loading dose or a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg/day (see section 4.4).

## · Special populations

No specific studies concerning renal, hepatic impairment are provided. This is adequately reflected in the SPC:

The  safety  of  caffeine  citrate  in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency  has  not  been  established.  In  the presence  of  renal  impairment,  there  is  increased  potential  for  accumulation.  A  reduced  daily maintenance dose of caffeine citrate is required and the dose should be guided by plasma caffeine measurements.

In very premature infants, clearance of caffeine does not depend on hepatic function. Hepatic caffeine metabolism  develops  progressively  in  the  weeks  following  birth  and  for  the  older  infants,  hepatic disease may indicate a need for monitoring caffeine plasma levels and may require dose adjustments (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

A publication referring that the female neonate demonstrates a higher rate of caffeine metabolism than the male is cited. The clinical significance of this finding was considered doubtful by the CHMP.

A  population  pharmacokinetic  study  in  Asian  populations  shows  that  PK  parameters  values  are comparable to other studies involving Caucasian populations.

Based on the therapeutic indication the section on elderly patients is not applicable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Caffeine has the potential to interact with active substances that are substrates for CYP1A2, inhibit CYP1A2,  or  induce  CYP1A2.  Even  though  in  premature  newborns  metabolism  is  limited,  it nevertheless seems prudent to advise caution, including the use of plasma caffeine monitoring, in the case of concomitant use of potential interacting drugs such as cimetidine and ketoconazole.

Phenobarbitone  therapy  concomitantly  with  caffeine  citrate  was  reported  to  possibly  induce  the hepatic metabolism of caffeine at 44-45 weeks post-conceptional age.

Dexamethasone may increase caffeine clearance by enzyme induction. Mexiletine is known to alter the disposition of caffeine and theophylline in adults. Caffeine is reputed to inhibit iron absorption in adults.

The stimulatory effects of caffeine and doxapram on the cardio-respiratory and central nervous system might mutually potentiate.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

The  pharmacodynamics  of  caffeine  has  been  extensively  studied.  The  pharmacological  effects  of caffeine  are  mediated  primarily  via  the  antagonism  of  the  actions  of  adenosine  at  A1  and  A2A receptors in the CNS. At high (potentially toxic) concentrations, caffeine increases cyclic 3,5 AMP by inhibition  of  phosphodiesterase,  and  translocates  intracellular  calcium  via  inhibition  of  ryanodine receptors.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

In ventilated neonates, caffeine increased respiratory system compliance and reduced supplementary oxygen  requirements.  A  respiratory  effect  of  caffeine  (increased  ventilation,  tidal  volume  and respiratory  flow)  in  premature  neonates  was  obtained  at  very  low  doses:  2.5mg/kg  caffeine,  with corresponding caffeine plasma concentrations of about 3 mg/L.

The demonstrated cardiovascular effects were increased left ventricular output and stroke volume and, transiently, mean arterial blood pressure.

Information  on  the  relation  between  plasma  concentration  and  effect  is  fragmentary.  The  PK/PD relationship between caffeine plasma levels and frequency of apnoea per day was not addressed.

## Clinical efficacy

Only one of the submitted publications  was  a  study  specifically  performed  for  regulatory  purposes (study  5.3.5.1.1)  to  support  an  application  to  the  FDA  for  marketing  authorization  for  Cafcit,  a preparation of caffeine citrate solution 20 mg/ml. This study is regarded by the Applicant as the main study for the current submission.

The remainder of the dossier comprises publications of investigator-led clinical scientific trials, and this is reflected in the heterogeneity of their approach. They are summarized in the table below.

## · Main studies

Study 5.3.5.1.1 Erenberg A et al. Caffeine citrate for the treatment of apnea of prematurity: a doubleblind, placebo-controlled study. Pharmacotherapy 2000; 20 (6): 644-52

This prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial studied the effects of caffeine citrate treatment in 85 preterm infants with AOP (82 patients -45 assigned to caffeine and 37 to placebo -were included in the efficacy analysis and 85 in the safety analysis).

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Infants between 28 and 32 weeks post-conception and more than 24 hours after birth who had six or more apnoea episodes (defined as cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds) in 24 hours were eligible. Eligible infants were randomly assigned to treatment with caffeine citrate or placebo for up to 12 days.

Exclusion criteria:

- Infants with identifiable causes of apnoea (CNS disorders, primary lung disease, generalized, metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances, abnormal temperature, obstructive apnoea);
- BUN  &gt;20mg/dl,  serum  creatinine  &gt;1.5mg/dl,  urine  output  &lt;1ml/kg/hour  after  the  first  48 hours of life;
- Serum AST/ALT &gt;3-times the upper limit of normal;
- Infants required mechanically assisted ventilation;
- Received  methylxanthines  or  H2  antagonists  for  regurgitation  within  last  7  days  before enrolment;
- Current use of (or effects of) CNS active drugs at the time of enrolment.

## Treatments

Double-blind treatment: Caffeine citrate 20 mg/kg or equal volume of placebo was administered IV over  30  minutes,  followed  after  approximately  24  hours  by  once  daily  administration  of  caffeine citrate solution 5 mg/kg/day orally or IV, or an equal volume of placebo. Initially, up to 10 days of double-blind therapy were planned, but the protocol was amended to allow for up to 12 days.

Open-label rescue: Infants failing double-blind therapy were eligible to receive open-label rescue with caffeine citrate after treatment day 1 and before treatment day 8. In the open-label phase of the study, a loading  dose  of  20mg/kg  caffeine  citrate  was  administered  IV,  followed  by  a  maintenance  dose  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6mg/kg/day, orally or IV. Duration of treatment of open-label caffeine was up to 12 days, including the double- blind treatment days.

## Study treatments:

Caffeine  citrate: 10mg/ml  caffeine  base,  5mg/ml  citric  acid  (monohydrate)  and  8.3mg/ml  sodium citrate (dehydrate).

Placebo: 5mg/ml citric acid (monohydrate) and 8.3mg/ml sodium citrate (dehydrate).

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of caffeine citrate for the treatment of apnoea of prematurity.

The secondary objective was to obtain plasma concentrations of caffeine citrate in premature infants receiving the product for up to 12 days.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  endpoint  was  'success'  which  was  defined  as  50%  or  greater  reduction  in  apnoea episodes from baseline and elimination of apnoea. It was summarised as number (%) of infants who were successes on each study day, and number of days (0-10) that an infant was classified as success.

The primary endpoint was changed in a final amendment of the study protocol, and was defined as the difference  in  the  number  of  apnoea  episodes  (rates)  between  caffeine  citrate  and  placebo  treatment groups  during  24-48  hours  after  the  double-blind  loading  dose;  results  of  this  endpoint  have  not, however, been reported in the publication.

## Sample size

The sample size was based on the assumption that 70% or more of caffeine-treated infants and 20% or less of placebo-treated infants would experience at least a 50% reduction of apnoea events within 2448 hours after the double-blind loading dose, compared with baseline rates.

A significance level of 5% and a power of 95% required 23 infants per group, for a total of 46 infants. As there was no information on placebo success rates, it was decided to recruit 39 infants per group.

85 preterm infants were included in the study.

## Randomisation

Infants were randomised to treatments using computer-generated random numbers in blocks of six.

## Blinding (masking)

There  is  no  information  on  precautions  to  maintain  blinding  in  the  publication  of  the  study. Determination  of  caffeine  plasma  concentrations  could  have  led  to  unblinding.  It  is  stated  that  a contract laboratory assessed the caffeine blood levels but the results were not made available to the investigator.

## Statistical methods

The  applicant  states  that  Chi-square  ( χ 2) and  analysis  of  variance  tests  were  used  to  compare demographic  data  between  groups.  Data  were  adjusted  for  length  of  baseline  period  and  length  of study day by scaling to 24 hours. The number (%) of successes and failures was analysed by χ 2 test for each study day. A subject withdrawn from the study or moved to open-label caffeine was classified as success or failure, and this classification was carried forward on subsequent days until the end of the double-blind period (LOCF). The number of days that infants were classified as success or failure was analysed  by  t-test.  In  relation  to  baseline  characteristics,  the  analysis  was  based  on  3  success categories among infants randomised to caffeine citrate: no days with zero apnoea, 1-6 days of zero apnoea events, and at least 7 days of zero apnoea events.

PK  data  was  described  using  a  one-compartment  open  model  with  first-order  absorption  and elimination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP noted that the description of statistical methods does not reflect the finally defined primary efficacy  endpoint  (difference  in  apnoea  rate  during  second  day  of  treatment).  The  description  of methods above refers to group comparisons of the proportion of patients fulfilling a certain success criterion. The performed 'success'-comparisons on a day-by-day basis using the Chi-square test can not be considered the optimal analysis method for a dataset with repeated measurement structure. The chosen  approach  of  consecutive  tests  ignores  the  correlation  structure  of  the  data.  Moreover,  no adjustments for multiplicity were considered. For the analyses of aggregated success endpoints (such as 'at least 7 days of 50% or greater reduction in apnoea episodes comp. to baseline) the Chi-square test can be considered adequate.

The use of LOCF to impute missing success-information for withdrawals and for patients transferred to open label treatment is seen very problematic, because of two reasons:

- o Several patients who were transferred to open label caffeine or were permanently discontinued … had a reduction of ≥ 50% in their apnoea rate the day they were transferred or discontinued from the trial. No information was provided regarding the reasons for transferring patients to open label treatment.  Under  such  circumstances,  'success'  was  carried  forward  until  day  10.  However, additional data analysis from patients staying under blinded conditions could not justify carrying forward success information. Less than 50% of patients who once achieved a reduction of apnoea rate ≥ 50% could maintain this 'success' until the end of treatment. Hence, it can not be excluded that the LOCF leads to an anti-conservative analysis approach, introducing substantial bias when estimating the treatment effect.
- o The choice of the imputation method in this specific case was considered to have a major impact on the efficacy results and their interpretation, as missing data from 49 patients (~60% from the defined  efficacy  analysis  set)  had  to  be  imputed  (carried  forward).  In  such  a  situation,  usually sensitivity  analyses  (using  alternative  imputation  strategies,  e.g.  classification  of  all  transferred and withdrawn patients as non-success patients as worst case scenario) should be carried out.

## RESULTS

Participant flow

<!-- image -->

There were many switches to open label and withdrawals (see table below). By the use of the LOCF method  the  authors  were  able  to  include  all  but  5  of  the  randomised  patients  in  the  final  efficacy analysis.  The  concerns  associated  with  this  approach  are  expressed  in  the  comments  on  Statistical methods, above.

## Numbers analysed

A total of 82 patients (45 assigned to caffeine and 37 to placebo) were included in the efficacy analysis and 85 in the safety analysis.

## Outcomes and estimation

The  safety  outcomes  were  assessed  by  means  of  vital  signs,  laboratory  values  and  adverse  events (AEs).

Caffeine citrate was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing apnoea episodes by at least 50% in  six  days  (p&lt;0.05),  and  approached  statistical  significance  (p&lt;0.10)  in  three  days.  Caffeine citrate  was  also  significantly  better  at  eliminating  apnoea  in  5  days  (p&lt;0.05)  and  approached significance in two days (p&lt;0.10).

The number of infants with an aggregate of 7-10 days of at least a 50% reduction in apnoea events or elimination of apnoea was significantly higher in the caffeine citrate group than in the placebo group (68.9% versus 43.2%, p=0.02, and 24.4% versus 0%, p=0.005, respectively). This additional endpoint has apparently not been specified as primary outcome measure a priori, however.

In  an  additional  analysis  of  the  subset  of  data  obtained  exclusively  under  double  blind  conditions without  imputation  (FDA  review,  ref.5.4.32),  almost  none  of  the  reported  statistical  significances could  be  maintained.  According  to  FDA  reviewer's  report  and  analysis,  there  was  no  statistically

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant difference in the primary endpoint as specified in the protocol between caffeine citrate and placebo, and no difference in the efficacy of caffeine and placebo on the secondary endpoints.

However, it has to be noted that the group comparison of estimates of treatment effects consistently indicates an advantage of caffeine treatment. Further important signals indicating efficacy of caffeine citrate  treatment  could  be  revealed  by  the  FDA  review:  there  were  more  days  without  any  apnoea under  caffeine  citrate  treatment  (3.0  days,  versus  1.2  days  for  placebo;  p=0.005);  also,  there  was  a higher percentage of patients with no apnoeas for ≥ 8 days (caffeine 22% versus placebo 0%).

Noticeably,  there  was  a  high  percentage  of  patients  with  &gt;50%  reduction  of  apnoea  in  the  placebo group.

Several flaws and methodological problems were identified during assessment of this trial: change/choice/analysis of primary efficacy endpoint finally reported, applied imputation methods for withdrawn and transferred patients, no correction for multiplicity.

There  is  some  uncertainty  about  the  representativeness  of  the  studied  population  in  terms  of comorbidities  and  comedications.  Additionally,  another  flaw  is  the  absence  of  double-blind  data beyond 10 days.

The study gives some evidence for the efficacy of caffeine citrate treatment in premature infants with AOP. Study  results  support  to  a  certain  extent  the  claim  that  caffeine  citrate  is  able  to  reduce  the number of apnoea episodes in preterm infants.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Ref. 5.4.42 Henderson-Smart DJ, Steer P. Methylxanthine treatment for apnea in preterm infants. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2004; (4).

The review included 5 randomised studies: 3 studies with theophylline and 2 studies (Erenberg, study 5.3.5.1.1; Murat, study 5.3.5.1.2) using caffeine for apnoea treatment, enrolling a total of 192 infants. Outcome measures were treatment failure (&lt;50% reduction in apnoea, or use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), or death during study), use of IPPV, death before hospital discharge, and side effects; efficacy was assessed after 2-10 days.

The  authors  found  that  compared  with  control  (placebo  or  no  drug  therapy),  methylxanthine administration  to  premature  infants  with  AOP  was  followed  by  less  treatment  failure:  summary relative  risk  (RR)  0.43  (95%  CI  0.31-  0.60),  risk  difference  (RD)  -0.40  (95%  CI  -0.16,  -0.01),  and number needed to treat (NNT) 13 (95% CI 6 - 100). The observed effects were similar for the two trials evaluating caffeine.

The systematic  Cochrane  Review  concludes  short-term  efficacy  of  methylxanthines in  reduction  of apnoea frequency and use of mechanical ventilation in premature infants with AOP. As the review is based on data from the published trials it must be assumed that the limitations of the Erenberg study were not accounted for. The authors also conclude that it is not clear whether  merely reducing the number of apnoeic episodes alters longer-term outcome.

Another Cochrane Collaboration Systematic Review by Steer PA (ref. 5.4.79) compared caffeine with theophylline for apnoea in preterm infants (see Supportive Studies below).

None

- Supportive studies

Five publications of non regulatory studies of efficacy and safety of caffeine citrate/methylxanthines in the proposed indication are regarded as supportive studies.

## Study 5.3.5.1.2 Murat I et al. Efficacy of caffeine in the treatment of recurrent idiopathic apnea in premature infants. J. Pediatr. 1981; 99 (6): 984-9.

The prospective, randomised controlled study investigated the efficacy of caffeine citrate in treating recurrent apnoea in 18 premature infants (29-35 weeks gestation). Infants received a loading dose of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

20 mg/kg of caffeine citrate by intramuscular injection followed by oral maintenance doses of 5 mg/kg daily. There was no placebo blinding, treated patients were compared with an untreated control group. Treatment was discontinued on day 15 if &lt;3 apnoeic episodes were recorded, and a follow up was performed one week after the end of treatment.

The apnoea index (defined as the average number of apnoeic attacks per 100 minutes, obtained from the total number recorded in 24 hours) was compared between the groups on day 0, day 1 and day 5.

Caffeine treatment resulted in a significant decrease of severe apnoea and of mild apnoea in the treated group compared with the control group (see table below).

(Apnoeaindex:Average number of apnoeaattacksper100mins)

The  study  was  not  blinded,  but  as  the  apnoea  index  was  calculated  from  24-hours  recordings  the potential for bias appears small. In spite of some uncertainties (small patient numbers, composition of study  drug  not  indicated,  intramuscular  application  of  loading  dose),  the  study  provides  supportive evidence for efficacy of caffeine citrate in the sought indication.

Study 5.3.5.1.5 Scanlon JE et al. Caffeine or theophylline for neonatal apnoea? Arch Dis Child 1992; 67: 425-8.

The three trials applied random or quasi-random patient allocation of premature neonates to caffeine treatment  compared  with theophylline  and  aminophylline. They  excluded  patients  in  whom  apnoea was attributable to a specific underlying cause. Measures of the severity of apnoea and of the response to treatment were similar to the definitions in the main study.

The efficacy results of the three active-controlled studies were evaluated in a Cochrane Collaboration Systematic Review. Steer PA, Henderson-Smart DJ. Caffeine versus theophylline for apnea in preterm infants. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2004;(2) (ref. 5.4.79).

The review did not include the high dose caffeine group (n=14) in the Scanlon study, and therefore reviewed the data of 66 infants. The overall quality of the studies is described as fair/good.

There was no difference in the failure rate (&lt;50% reduction in apnoea/bradycardia) of treatment with caffeine or theophylline at 1 to 3 days (two studies) or 5 to 7 days (one study). The authors concluded that  caffeine  appears  to  have  similar  short-term  effects  on  apnoea/bradycardia  as  theophylline,  but caffeine has a better safety profile.

## Study 5.3.5.2.1 Aranda JV et al.  Efficacy  of  caffeine  in  treatment  of  apnea  in  the  low-birth-weight infant. J Pediatr. 1977; 90: 467-72.

The  prospective  non-controlled  study  was  the  first  trial  to  explore  the  efficacy  of  caffeine  in  the treatment of APO in premature infants and to establish a dose schedule appropriate for the limited elimination of caffeine in this population. 18 preterm neonates with at least three recurrent apnoeic spells  per  day  (apnoea  &gt;30  seconds  and  bradycardia  &lt;100  bpm  with  or  without  cyanosis)  were included in the study. Mean birth weight and gestational age were 1065g and 27.5 weeks, respectively, mean  post-natal  age  at  start  of  caffeine  citrate  treatment  was  18.2  days.  Caffeine  citrate  was administered with a loading dose of 20 mg/kg IV followed within two to three days by 5 to 10 mg/kg once or twice daily, for a mean of 6 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All infants except one showed a significant decrease in the frequency of apnoeic episodes associated with  caffeine  therapy.  Mean  (±  SEM)  frequencies  of  apnoea  spells  were  13.6  ±  2.5  and  2.1  ±  0.6 apnoea episodes per day before and after initiation of caffeine treatment, respectively (p&lt;0.001).

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

According to the publication of the main efficacy study (5.3.5.1.1), Nymusa was significantly more effective  than  placebo  in  reducing  apnoea  episodes  by  at  least  50%  in  six  days  (p&lt;0.05),  and approached statistical significance (p&lt;0.10) in three days. Caffeine citrate was also significantly better at eliminating apnoea in 5 days (p&lt;0.05) and approached significance in two days (p&lt;0.10).

The number of infants with an aggregate of 7-10 days of at least a 50% reduction in apnoea events or elimination of apnoea was significantly higher in the caffeine citrate group than in the placebo group (68.9% versus 43.2%, p=0.02, and 24.4% versus 0%, p=0.005, respectively).

The key efficacy findings come from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The main study (report and data analysis) has a number of limitations, however:

- The primary endpoint was changed in a final amendment of the study protocol; results of this endpoint  have  not  been  reported,  however.  The  additional  endpoint  'percentage  of  infants with success for an aggregate of 7-10 days' (see above) has apparently not been specified as primary outcome measure a priori .
- The imputation method (LOCF) used in the final efficacy analysis introduces substantial bias when estimating the treatment effect. Missing data from 49 patients (~60% from the defined efficacy  analysis  set)  had  to  be  imputed.  An  additional  data  analysis  (FDA  review)  from patients  staying  under  blinded  conditions  reveals  that  carrying  forward  success  information was  not  justified,  however:  Less  than  50%  of  patients  who  once  achieved  a  reduction  of apnoea  rate ≥ 50% could  maintain  this  'success'  until  the  end  of  treatment.  No  sensitivity analyses  using  alternative  imputation  strategies,  e.g.  classification  of  all  transferred  and withdrawn patients as non-success patients as worst case scenario, were carried out.
- Only 46.7% of infants in the caffeine group and 32.4% in the placebo group completed 10 days of double-blind therapy; a large number of infants in both groups were switched to open label  caffeine  citrate  and  withdrawn.  No  information  is  provided  regarding  the  reasons  for transferring patients to open label treatment.

Efficacy  of  caffeine  citrate  treatment  in  reducing  the  frequency  of  apnoea  episodes  in  premature infants is supported by the results of several small studies, either RCT controlled with no-treatment, or RCT  comparing  2  active  treatments.  The  small  patient  numbers  however  preclude  a  confirmatory approach.

The data supporting efficacy of caffeine citrate in treating primary apnoea of prematurity are scant. In fact there is a single, small RCT demonstrating this efficacy, study 5.3.5.1.1. Therefore, small trials might  give  false,  large  positive  effects  and  publication  bias  might  affect  the  positive  picture constructed by the data discussed in this report.

The CAP study (Caffeine for Apnoea of Prematurity trial group, NEJM 2006) submitted in support of the  safety  of  caffeine  citrate  is  a  large  RCT  regarded  as  extremely  important  in  support  of  the benefit/risk conclusions. It finds a beneficial effect of caffeine citrate in terms of clinically relevant, disability  related  outcomes.  The  data  from  this  trial  are  clearly  robust.  Of  937  infants  assigned  to caffeine for whom adequate data at a corrected age of 18-21 months were available, 377 (40.2%) died or  survived  with  a  neurodevelopmental  disability,  compared  with  431  of  the  932  infants  (46.2%) assigned  to  placebo  (OR  adjusted  for  centre  0.77;  95%  CI  0.64  to  0.93;  p=0.008).  The  effect  was mainly driven by lower rates of cerebral palsy (4.4% and 7.3% for caffeine and placebo, respectively; adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.39 - 0.87; p=0.009). The rates of death before 18 months, deafness, and blindness did not differ significantly between the groups.

From a regulatory point of view, the major draw-back of the CAP study is that approximately 60% of infants received caffeine for prevention of apnoea and for facilitation of extubation, and, apparently, infants with apnoea secondary to underlying diseases were not excluded.

Following  CHMP´s  request,  a  post  hoc  subgroup  analysis  published  by  the  CAP  investigators  was submitted by the Applicant. It is reassuring that there was little evidence of a differential treatment effect of caffeine over subgroups defined by the clinical indication for starting the study.

Another important finding of the subgroup analysis was that the size and the direction of the caffeine effect on death or disability differed depending on the degree of respiratory support infants needed at randomisation (p=0.032). The OR (95% CI) was 1.32 (0.81 - 2.14) for no support, 0.73 (0.52 - 1.03) for non-invasive support and 0.73 (0.57 - 0.94) for endotracheal tube, respectively. The most severely affected infants, i.e. infants receiving respiratory support, appeared to have more neurodevelopmental benefit from caffeine treatment than unsupported infants. Also, infants who started treatment early had a greater reduction in time on ventilation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the clinical pharmacology studies a total of 474 premature neonates or infants received at least one dose of caffeine; 81 received only single doses and 393 had repeated administrations of caffeine. In total, 130 premature neonates or infants received a loading dose of 20 mg/kg caffeine citrate followed by maintenance at 5 mg/kg at least initially.

To support the safety of caffeine citrate treatment in premature infants, the Applicant submitted two publications of a large study (Study 5.3.5.1.6):

Schmidt B A et al. Caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity. N Engl J Med 2006; 354: 2112-21. and Schmidt B et al. Long-term effects of caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity. N Engl J Med 2007; 357(19): 1893-902

The objective of this study (the CAP study: Caffeine for Apnoea of Prematurity trial group) was to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of caffeine therapy in infants of very low birth weight. The study was a multicentre, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

Infants with a birth weight of 500 to 1250g were eligible for enrolment if their clinicians considered them candidates for caffeine therapy in the first 10 days of life. Caffeine was given for treatment of apnoea, for prophylaxis of apnoea, and for prophylaxis of apnoea following extubation.

2006 infants were randomly assigned to receive caffeine (20mg/kg caffeine citrate bolus followed by 5-10 mg/kg/d maintenance) or placebo; 1006 were assigned to caffeine citrate and 1000 to placebo. The median number of treatment days was 37 in the caffeine and 36 in the placebo group. The groups were comparable for baseline characteristics (see table below).

## Short-term outcome

Caffeine  citrate  significantly  reduced  the  frequency  of  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia  (defined  as  the need for supplemental oxygen at a post-menstrual age of 36 weeks). The rates of death before the first discharge home, ultrasonographic signs of brain injury, and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) did not differ significantly between the two groups (see table below).

## Long-term outcome

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The final publication of the study (Schmidt, NEJM 2007) reported that of the 937 infants assigned to caffeine citrate for whom adequate data on the primary outcome at a corrected age of 18 to 21 months were available, 377 (40.2%) died or survived with a neurodevelopmental disability, compared with 431 of the 932 infants (46.2%) assigned to placebo. Treatment with caffeine citrate as compared with placebo reduced the incidence of cerebral palsy (4.4% versus 7.3%) and of cognitive delay (33.8% versus  38.3%).  The  rates  of  death  before  18  months,  deafness,  and  blindness  did  not  differ significantly between the two groups (see table below).

The study addressed several longstanding concerns about possible risks due to the pharmacological effects of caffeine: the long-term risk concerning neurodevelopment due to possible effects of caffeine on cerebral blood flow and to inhibition of adenosine receptors, and the potential failure to thrive due to increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption with caffeine (see also Serious Adverse Events and Deaths below).

Evidence of a small but significant improvement in the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental disability in premature infants treated with caffeine citrate was provided. The effect was mainly driven by significantly lower rates of cerebral palsy at 18 to 21 months in the caffeine group as compared with  the  placebo  group.  Also,  a  significant  contribution  of  the  component  cognitive  delay  was observed.

Except  for  a  temporary  reduction  in  weight  gain,  caffeine  treatment  had  no  apparent  short-term  or long-term risks.

Apparently, infants with secondary apnoea due to underlying conditions were not excluded from the study.  Infants  treated  for  documented  apnoea  were  only  about  40%  of  the  study  population; approximately 20% received caffeine for the prevention of apnoea and 35-40% for the facilitation of extubation. A post-hoc subgroup analysis revealed little evidence of a differential treatment effect of caffeine over these subgroups.

Further safety information is available from studies in premature neonates using caffeine citrate for prevention of apnoea (Studies 5.3.5.4.1, Bucher, Eur J Pediatr 1988; 5.3.5.4.2, Romagnoli, Ther Drug Monit 1992; and  5.3.5.4.3 Larsen,  Acta  Paediatr  1995 ),  or  in  the  prophylaxis  of  apnoea  following general anaesthesia (Studies 5.3.5.4.4 and 5.3.5.4.5, Welborn, Anesthesiology 1988 and 1989 ),  or  in the prevention of extubation failure (Studies 5.3.5.4.6 , Steer, Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed 2004; and 5.3.5.4.7, Steer, J Paediatr. Child Health 2003 ).

516 infants were exposed to caffeine. Caffeine citrate was used for prevention of apnoea in premature infants  in  different  clinical  settings  for  short  time  periods,  up  to  ten  days  (5.3.5.4.3),  and  in  dose regimens  deviating  from  that  presently  proposed  (see  IV.2  Patient  Exposure,  Studies  with  caffeine citrate  in  other  indications,  D80AR-Clinical).  In  study  5.3.5.4.6,  a  follow  up  after  12  months  was performed. Studies 5.3.5.4.1, 5.3.5.4.4 and 5.3.5.4.5 compared caffeine with placebo, but only study 5.3.5.4.1  reported  safety  data  (no  side  effects,  such  as  tachycardia,  jitteriness  or  vomiting  in  either group). Studies 5.3.5.4.2, 5.3.5.4.6 and 5.3.5.4.7 compared different dosing groups of caffeine citrate; their results indicate dose dependence of some side effects of caffeine, such as tachycardia and feed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intolerance (see Adverse Events below). Caffeine had a better safety profile than aminophylline (less tachycardia, smaller amount of gastric aspirate) in study 5.3.5.4.3.

Studies  where  caffeine  was  compared  with  other  xanthines  were  too  small  and  not  powered  for  a formal  statistical  analysis,  either  as  non-inferiority  or  superiority.  The  results  on  efficacy  measured from baseline are of limited value given that there is no placebo group and the placebo effect can be sizable.

The data on prevention of apnoea are of low quality. Even though the studies were not submitted to support efficacy of caffeine citrate, it is relevant that the Cochrane review does not point to an effect; this  might  be  due  to  the  low  power  of  the  studies  or  the  inadequacy  of  the  population  studied  or because in fact there is  no  effect. This  cannot  be  overruled  by  a  study  with  historical  controls  that suggests  a  beneficial  effect.  In  fact,  the  data  on  prevention  of  apnoea  is  rather  limited  and unconvincing.  However,  in  the  large  RCT  (5.3.5.1.6)  40%  of  the  population  received  caffeine  for prevention of AOP. Data from these collateral indications has little value for the discussion of efficacy in  primary  apnea;  positive  results,  however,  might  suggest the sharing  of  a common  mechanism  of action  for  the  different  apnoeas/indications  and  might  imply  efficacy  of  caffeine  treatment  across categories/indications. It is also important because study 5.3.5.1.6 includes all these types of apnoeas and does not separate the subgroups.

Two (4.4%) infants in the caffeine citrate group were discontinued, one for dyspnoea and the  other  one  for  septicaemia,  while  one  (2.7%)  infant  in  the  placebo  group  was  discontinued  for necrotising enterocolitis (NEC).

4 infants receiving caffeine citrate and 2 receiving placebo experienced NEC after discontinuation of the study drug. NEC was assessed to be possibly related to caffeine citrate in one of the 4 infants.

Three deaths due to NEC occurred within 30 days after discontinuation of the study drug; all three infants  had  underlying  disorders  in  addition  to  AOP.  Two  of  these  infants  had  been  assigned  to caffeine; one was originally in the placebo group but was transferred to the open-label caffeine group on the same day that he required small bowel resection.

The most common AE in the caffeine group was constipation (17% of infants); the incidence was similar for the placebo group (21%). Rash was also a common event in both groups.

A table of AEs by study phase, System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (MedDRA) is given below.

Assessment of adverse events in the study is complex due to different study phases and differences in length of treatment. The FDA performed a post hoc safety data analysis of AEs for all patients who ever  received  caffeine  versus  those  who  never  received  caffeine,  by  treatment  for  the  double-blind phase only and by original randomisation. These analyses revealed no significant differences in the incidence of AEs between study groups except for sepsis. The reason for the higher incidence of sepsis in the caffeine group was not clear.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  higher  incidence  of  NEC  in  the  caffeine  group,  though  statistically  not  significant,  raises awareness, as NEC is a serious emergency event in premature infants. NEC is further discussed in Serious AEs and Deaths below.

## Adverse Events in Supportive Study 5.3.5.1.6 (Schmidt, 2006 and 2007)

Adverse  event  data  were  obtained  from  the  primary  caregiver  at  follow-up,  or  from  the  children's medical charts, where possible. The data obtained are summarised in the following table. The profile for caffeine was similar to that of placebo.

## Adverse Events in other submitted studies

The Cochrane review by Steer (ref. 5.4.79) of studies comparing caffeine citrate versus theophylline in the treatment of AOP (studies 5.3.5.1.3, 5.3.5.1.4, and 5.3.5.1.5) found that side effects, as indicated by tachycardia or feed intolerance leading to change in dosing, were lower in the caffeine group (RR 0.17,  95% CI  0.04 - 0.72; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.47 - -0.10). This was consistent across the three studies.  Similar  results  are  reported  in  study  5.3.5.4.3  comparing  aminophylline  and caffeine  in the prevention of AOP.

In  study  5.3.5.4.1  investigating  caffeine  prophylaxis  of  apnoea  in  preterm  neonates,  no  side  effects such as tachycardia, jitteriness or vomiting were observed in either group (caffeine or placebo). Study 5.3.5.4.2  reported  a  higher  frequency  of  side  effects,  such  as  hyperglycaemia  (5  of  13  infants), hypertension  (1/13),  tachycardia  &gt;180bpm  (11/13)  and  vomiting/feeding  problems  (11/13),  in  the group receiving the higher maintenance dose of caffeine compared with the lower maintenance dose group and a previous non-treated control group.

No  AEs  were  reported  in  the  trials  of  caffeine  treatment  to  prevent  apnoea  following  general anaesthesia in premature neonates (studies 5.3.5.4.4 and 5.3.5.4.5).

Two studies report the effects of caffeine citrate in the prevention of extubation failure. Study 5.3.5.4.7 was  a  trial  of  three  dose  regimens  of  caffeine  citrate  (3,  15  and  30  mg/kg  orally  or  IV  following loading doses of caffeine citrate of 6, 30 or 60 mg/kg IV, respectively, for up to six days). Tachycardia and feeding intolerance were higher, and weight gain was lower in the 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg groups, but  these  differences  were  not  statistically  significant.  The  second  study  (5.3.5.4.6)  compared  the efficacy and safety of two caffeine citrate dose regimens (5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg IV following a loading dose of 20mg/kg or 80 mg/kg IV, respectively).

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  two  dosing  regimens  with  regard  to tachycardia, jitteriness, feeding intolerance, duration of intravenous nutrition, major morbidity or predischarge mortality. No difference in the overall weight gain between the groups was observed over the duration of therapy, while the time to regain birth weight was significantly longer for infants in the higher dose group (14.8 ± 5.3 vs. 12.9 ± 5.0 days, mean ± SD; p&lt;0.01). At 12 months, there was no statistically significant difference in death, disability or mean general quotient between the groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs reported in publications of academic clinical trials can be unreliable due to underreporting and non-systematic  approach  to  the  listing.  This  is  more  so  in  older  and  small  trials.  Thus,  the  data available is to be taken with some caution. The CHMP noticed that the rates are usually higher for placebo, when this is present. There are many supportive studies without any mention to AEs, which is a  sign  of  underreporting.  Still  we  consider  the  database  generated  by  study  5.3.5.1.6  an  important database due to its size and duration of follow-up. Furthermore it contains a placebo arm for control, which is also relevant. Taking into consideration the data of this study the CHMP considered there was no important, unexpected safety sign.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Data  from  the  submitted  studies  were  not  collected  in  a  uniform  way  and  serious  adverse  events (SAEs) are not detailed as such.

The most common AEs considered likely to be serious by the Applicant were: deafness (9.1%), brain injury  (7.9%),  necrotising  colitis  (4.4%),  tachycardia  (2.0%)  and sepsis (1.8%).  The following  AEs were also reported in the placebo group and at a higher incidence than in the caffeine citrate group: deafness (14.4%), brain injury (12.7%) and necrotising colitis (6.2%); tachycardia and sepsis were not reported in the placebo group. With the exception of failure to thrive, all other SAEs in the caffeine citrate group were reported at an incidence below 1.0%.

## Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)

NEC is a serious emergency event occurring in about 10% of infants weighing less than 1500 g, and prematurity is the most important risk factor for NEC. Reports of decreased splanchnic blood flow in newborns after supra-therapeutic doses of caffeine (Lane, 1999; ref. 5.4.54) led to speculations that this effect might contribute to gut ischaemia and to NEC.  A  causal relationship between caffeine/methylxanthine treatment and NEC has not been established, however.

There was a higher incidence of NEC in the caffeine group than in the placebo group in the main efficacy study (5.3.5.1.1). Overall, 6 cases of NEC were observed: 4 cases of NEC   occurred in 46 infants assigned to caffeine (8.6%); 2 infants received caffeine in the double-blind treatment phase and 2 were switched to open-label caffeine. 2 cases of NEC occurred in 39 infants assigned to placebo; one infant received only placebo treatment, while the other infant developed NEC after being switched to open label caffeine.

In the CAP study in 2006 premature infants (5.3.5.1.6), there was no difference in the rate of NEC between the caffeine and the placebo group at the first discharge home: 6.3% and 6.7% for caffeine and placebo, respectively.

## Neurological development and growth

The long-term results of the CAP study (NEJM 2006) showed an improved rate of survival without neurodevelopmental  disability  (the  primary  endpoint  of  the  trial)  in  infants  randomly  assigned  to caffeine  therapy,  assessed  at  a  corrected  age  of  18  to  21  months.  In  particular,  the  incidences  of cerebral palsy and cognitive delay were reduced in the caffeine treatment group.

Growth, as indexed by height, weight, and head circumference, was not affected by caffeine treatment.

## Cerebral haemorrhage, brain injury

One case of cerebral haemorrhage is reported in the caffeine group in the Erenberg study; no cerebral haemorrhage occurred in the placebo group.

The publication of the Schmidt study does not report cerebral haemorrhage specifically, but analysed the  rates  of  brain  injury  assessed  by  cranial  ultrasonography  at  hospital  discharge.  The  rates  were comparable  for  both  groups  (13.0%  and  14.3%  for  infants  in  the  caffeine  and  placebo  group, respectively).

Only two of the supportive studies report intraventricular haemorrhage (5.3.5.4.6 and 5.3.5.4.7).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Deaths

Three  deaths  were  reported  in  the  main  study  (Erenberg,  2000):  2  patients  randomised  to  caffeine treatment  and  1  patient  randomised  to  placebo.  This  last  patient  received  open-label  caffeine  for  8 days. All deaths were secondary to complications from NEC.

In the supportive study by Aranda (5.3.5.2.1), one infant in the caffeine group died of disseminated cytomegalovirus infection at a PNA of 59 days, 30 days after the last dose of caffeine.

In  the  large  study  by  Schmidt  (5.3.5.1.6),  there  was  no  difference  in  the  rate  of  death  between  the caffeine  and  the  placebo  group  at  the  first  discharge  home  (5.2%  versus  5.5%,  for  caffeine  and placebo,  respectively)  and  death  at  18  months  (6.4%  versus  6.5%,  for  caffeine  and  placebo, respectively).

In  the  main  study  by  Erenberg  (5.3.5.1.1),  values  for  sodium,  potassium,  calcium,  chloride,  carbon dioxide,  blood  urea  nitrogen,  creatinine,  glucose,  AST,  ALT,  gamma-GTP,  and  haematocrit  were compared  between  the  caffeine  and  the  placebo  groups.  No  clinically  significant  differences  were identified between infants in the double-blind caffeine and the placebo groups or those who received open-label caffeine.

There was no information from other submitted studies.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

In  the  clinical  programme,  11  of  the  14  studies  reported  either  that  no  adverse  events  (AEs)  had occurred that led to discontinuation, or quoted the incidence. Overall, the rate of discontinuation due to AEs on caffeine for these studies combined was 2.8% (45/1611), compared with 1.4% (15/1087) on placebo and 16.7% (5/30) on theophylline.

In the main study (5.3.5.1.1), two infants (4.4%) in the caffeine group and one infant (2.7%) in the placebo group were withdrawn from the double-blind treatment due to adverse events. Discontinuation due to AEs is not reported in the Schmidt study; it is only stated that 1.8% of infants, 23 in the caffeine group and 14 in the placebo group, had doses of the study drug withheld or reduced because of clinical symptoms suggesting caffeine-induced toxicity.

In the PK study by Lee TC (Ref. 5.3.3.5.1) 119 preterm infants received maintenance doses of caffeine of 3mg/kg, 15mg/kg and 30mg/kg after a loading dose of 6mg/kg, 30mg/kg or 60mg/kg for up to 6 days.  It  is  reported  that  there  were  no  untoward  effects  necessitating  discontinuation  of  caffeine treatment before the scheduled end of treatment.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The safety  data  on  the  acute  use  of  Nymusa  are  scant.  This  is  mostly  due  to  the  lack  of  complete databases and the need to rely on published reports of clinical trials, which are known to be affected by under- and selective reporting.

The large, CAP study is reassuring from a safety point of view, showing that there is no relevant safety issue for the use of caffeine citrate. Additionally, PMS data from authorised caffeine citrate products reveal no new or unsuspected safety issues.

Duration  of  treatment  in  the  main  placebo-controlled  trial  was  10  to  12  days.  Median  duration  of caffeine treatment was 37 days in the CAP study. In clinical practice, treatment is usually continued until the child has reached a post-menstrual age of 37 weeks, by which time apnoea of prematurity usually resolves spontaneously. This limit may however be revised according to clinical judgment in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

individual  cases  depending  on  the  response  to  treatment,  persistence  of  apnoeas  and  other  clinical considerations; this is now reflected in the SPC. There still remains some uncertainty concerning the optimal duration of treatment; this is addressed in the RMP.

Necrotising enterocolitis was identified as a potential risk of caffeine treatment in the main efficacy study. NEC is a relatively common serious emergency event occurring in approximately 10% of very low birth weight infants (&lt;1500g). It is life-threatening and can result in long-term consequences, such as  strictures  and  short  bowel  syndrome  due  to  intestinal  resection.  Studies  indicating  reduced splanchnic blood flow in newborns who received 50mg/kg of caffeine citrate (Lane, 1999; ref. 5.4.54) had  raised  the  possibility  of  a  causal  relationship.  In  the  CAP  study  in  2006  premature  infants, however, there was no difference in the rate of NEC between the caffeine and the placebo group at the first discharge home: 6.3% versus 6.7%, for caffeine and placebo, respectively. NEC is addressed as a potential risk in the RMP.

In the non-clinical setting, behavioural deficits were observed in newborn rats in the therapeutic dose range,  most  likely  caused  by  persistence  of  upregulated  adenosine  receptors  into  adulthood.  The clinical relevance of this finding for humans is unclear. There is no data on intellectual, behavioural and somatic development of treated infants in childhood or adulthood.

## Risk Management plan

The Applicant presented the Safety Specification summarizing following important identified risks of a  medicinal  product,  important  potential  risks,  and  important  missing  information,  structured  as follows:

Identified risks for caffeine citrate include those which are known adverse effects characteristic of the methylxanthine class. Some have been further identified in clinical trials:

- Toxicity due to maternal caffeine ingestion;
- Increase in caffeine plasma levels in premature infants with cholestatic hepatitis;
- Irritability, restlessness and jitteriness at higher caffeine levels;
- Cardiac compromise in infants with pre-existing cardiac disease, including arrhythmias;
- Increased sodium and calcium excretion which may be associated with increased urine flow rate and increased creatinine clearance;
- Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia;
- Phlebitis and local inflammatory changes following inadvertent infiltration of skin and subcutaneous tissues at the site of infusion;
- Treatment-related convulsions/seizures;
- Reactions suggesting hypersensitivity.

Important identified risks are defined in Volume 9A as 'An identified risk that could impact on the risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product  or  have  implications  for  public  health'.  According  to  this definition, the following might reasonably be considered as important identified risks:

- Toxicity due to maternal caffeine ingestion;
- Increase in caffeine plasma levels in premature infants with cholestatic hepatitis;
- Cardiac compromise in infants with pre-existing cardiac disease, including arrhythmias.
- Treatment-related convulsions/seizures.

Potential risks are defined in Volume 9A as 'An untoward occurrence for which there is some basis for suspicion of an association with the medicinal product of interest but where this association has not been confirmed'.

According to this definition, the following might reasonably be considered as potential risks:

- Decrease in weight gain / failure to thrive;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Caffeine withdrawal;
- Necrotising enterocolitis;
- Medication errors.

Important potential risks are defined in Volume 9A as 'An identified risk, potential risk or missing information  that  could  impact  on  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product  or  have  implications  for public health'.

According  to  this  definition,  all  of  the  above  risks  might  reasonably  be  considered  as  important potential risks.

## Evaluation of the need for a Risk Minimisation plan:

In considering the need for risk minimisation activities, the Applicant pointed out that extemporaneous preparations of caffeine have been used for many years by neonatologists and that the proposed SPC requires initiation to be under the supervision of a physician experienced in neonatal intensive care and that treatment should be administered only in a NICU.

A laminated card highlighting the appropriate dosing regimen, the approved therapeutic indications and the key warning and precautionary statements from the SPC will be made available for neonatal units  that  may  use  the  product.  Further,  sales  representatives  will  be  specifically  briefed  on  these points and encouraged to emphasise the relevant messages to the relevant HCPs that they meet.

The laminated card is annexed to the RMP.

As a part of the communication of the identified and potential risks, and to inform of the availability of an  approved  product  within  the  EU,  a  single  presentation  that  can  be  used  for  either  infusion  or oral/nasogastric administration, the material planned for HCP communication including the laminated card highlighting the appropriate dosing regimen, approved therapeutic indications and key warnings has been in general endorsed by CHMP.

The restricted prescription status should be regarded as an additional risk minimisation activity

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal product: see as detailed in section 2.4 of this CHMP Assessment Report.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Nymusa  (formerly  Caffeine  Citrate  Chiesi)  is  intended  for  the  'Treatment  of  primary  apnoea  of premature newborns'.

Severe  apnoea  may  lead  to  hypoxaemia  and  hypotension,  and  ultimately  to  brain  hypoxia  and/or ischemia, and thus negatively affect the newborn's neurodevelopment and survival. Premature infants with severe and frequent apnoeic episodes require intensive care treatment, supplemental oxygen or intubation and positive pressure ventilation.

AOP treatment aims at avoidance of hypoxaemic/ischaemic brain damage in the newborn.  On the other hand, early discontinuation of positive pressure ventilation and oxygen supplementation should be targeted, because of the risks associated with these interventions (e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia and  retinopathy  of  prematurity).  This  is  all  the  more  important  as  apnoea  of  prematurity  is  a  selflimiting  condition;  it  usually  resolves  by  36  weeks  post-menstrual  age  and  does  not  predict  future episodes of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Caffeine citrate, in form of magisterial formulations, is widely used as a respiratory stimulant in the treatment of AOP in Europe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Quality

The quality of Nymusa is considered to be acceptable, when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The toxicological profile of caffeine has been appropriately described in the file in the multiple studies presented in the extensive bibliographic revision performed.

The information included suggests a higher toxicity in caffeine in low ages and as compared to adults. Death due to acute toxicity is related to respiratory arrest and convulsions. The need for monitoring of plasma levels, particularly in the younger prematures is discussed in the clinical section.

Under repeated treatment, target organs  of  toxicity  were  the  stomach,  the  kidney,  the  lung  and  the reproductive tract. Behavioural changes could be seen in some studies in young animals at therapeutic levels. Consequently section 5.3 of the SPC was amended accordingly.

Growth and ossification retardation is suggested from reproductive toxicity studies, where embryotoxicity was observed, as well as increased toxicity on lactating animals. In addition, decreased male fertility with sperms decrease and testicular changes of treated males was observed, irrespective of  age.  Also,  embryotoxicity  was  observed  in  association  to  treated  males.  No  genotoxic  or carcinogenic concerns are raised from studies revised. The limited duration of treatment and the life threatening condition here discussed would not require carcinogenicity studies to be conducted in the absence  of  a  specific  concern.  Increased  propensity  for  ulcer  development  in  the  adult  stage,  and higher susceptibility to necrotising enterocolitis is also raised form the published information revised.

## Efficacy

According to the publication of the main efficacy study (5.3.5.1.1), Nymusa was significantly more effective  than  placebo  in  reducing  apnoea  episodes  by  at  least  50%  in  six  days  (p&lt;0.05),  and approached  statistical  significance  (p&lt;0.10)  in  three  days.  These  efficacy  findings  come  from  a randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial.  The  main  study  has  however  a  number  of limitations:

- The primary endpoint was changed in a final amendment of the study protocol
- The imputation method (LOCF) used in the final efficacy analysis introduces substantial bias when estimating the treatment effect. No sensitivity analyses were carried out.
- Only 46.7% of infants in the caffeine group and 32.4% in the placebo group completed 10 days of double-blind therapy; a large number of infants in both groups were switched to open label caffeine citrate and withdrawn..

Efficacy  of  caffeine  citrate  treatment  in  reducing  the  frequency  of  apnoea  episodes  in  premature infants was also supported by the results of several small published studies.

The  CAP  study  (5.3.5.1.6)  submitted  in  support  of  the  safety  of  caffeine  citrate  is  a  large  RCT regarded by the CHMP as extremely important. It finds a beneficial effect of caffeine citrate in terms of clinically relevant, disability related outcomes. The data from this trial are clearly robust. Of 937 infants  assigned  to  caffeine  for  whom  adequate  data  at  a  corrected  age  of  18-21  months  were available, 377 (40.2%) died or survived with a neurodevelopmental disability, compared with 431 of the 932 infants (46.2%) assigned to placebo.

From a regulatory point of view, the major draw-back of the CAP study is that approximately 60% of infants received caffeine for prevention of apnoea and for facilitation of extubation, and, apparently, infants with apnoea secondary to underlying diseases were not excluded.

Following  CHMP´s  request,  a  post  hoc  subgroup  analysis  published  by  the  CAP  investigators  was submitted by the Applicant It is reassuring that there was little evidence of a differential treatment effect of caffeine over subgroups defined by the clinical indication for starting the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Another important finding of the subgroup analysis was that the size and the direction of the caffeine effect on death or disability differed depending on the degree of respiratory support infants needed at randomisation (p=0.032). The OR (95% CI) was 1.32 (0.81 - 2.14) for no support, 0.73 (0.52 - 1.03) for non-invasive support and 0.73 (0.57 - 0.94) for endotracheal tube, respectively. The most severely affected infants, i.e. infants receiving respiratory support, appeared to have more neurodevelopmental benefit from caffeine treatment than unsupported infants. Also, infants who started treatment early had a greater reduction in time on ventilation.

Overall therefore the CHMP considered that the efficacy of Nymusa in reducing apnoea episodes is established.

## Safety

The safety  data  on  the  acute  use  of  Nymusa  are  scant.  This  is  mostly  due  to  the  lack  of  complete databases and the need to rely on published reports of clinical trials, which are known to be affected by under- and selective reporting.

The large, CAP study is reassuring from a safety point of view, showing that there is no relevant safety issue for the use of caffeine citrate. Additionally, PMS data from authorised caffeine citrate products reveal no new or unsuspected safety issues.

Duration  of  treatment  in  the  main  placebo-controlled  trial  was  10  to  12  days.  Median  duration  of caffeine treatment was 37 days in the CAP study. In clinical practice, treatment is usually continued until the child has reached a post-menstrual age of 37 weeks, by which time apnoea of prematurity usually resolves spontaneously. This limit may however be revised according to clinical judgment in individual  cases  depending  on  the  response  to  treatment,  persistence  of  apnoeas  and  other  clinical considerations; this is now reflected in the SPC. There still remains some uncertainty concerning the optimal duration of treatment; this is addressed in the RMP.

Necrotising enterocolitis was identified as a potential risk of caffeine treatment in the main efficacy study and is addressed as a potential risk in the RMP.

In the non-clinical setting, behavioural deficits were observed in newborn rats in the therapeutic dose range,  most  likely  caused  by  persistence  of  upregulated  adenosine  receptors  into  adulthood.  The clinical relevance of this finding for humans is unclear. There are no data on intellectual, behavioural and somatic development of treated infants in childhood or adulthood.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these

- User consultation

The  section  intended  for  healthcare  professionals  (HCP)  of  neonatal  intensive  care  units  in  the proposed Package Leaflet is only an excerpt of the proposed SPC. For safety reasons, HCP should be offered access to the full information on the product; therefore, it was recommended to enclose the complete SPC in the packages. This is in line with the updated Guideline on the readability of the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use (Revision 1, January 2009).

Although  Nymusa  is  intended  to  be  administered  exclusively  at  neonatal  intensive  care  units,  an additional Package leaflet for lay persons (primarily parents), as proposed, was considered useful to inform them about their baby's medication.

The  validated  questionnaire  consisted  of  15  questions  concerning  the  information  in  the  Package Leaflet,  1  question  concerning  the  healthcare  professional  section  and  4  questions  concerning  the layout and design.

After a pilot phase with 3 subjects, 10 males and 10 females in the age of 21 to 78 years were recruited by an advertisement.

The  age  range  of  the  selected  test  population  was  not  considered  representative  for  care-givers (parents) of newborn babies (40% of the subjects were older than 50 years), but, since this population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

will  receive  the  Package Leaflet only on special request and just for information, the provided user testing was considered sufficient.

According to the Guideline on the readability the result  of  the  user  testing  is  sufficient,  since  each question  was  correctly  answered  (information  correctly  found  and  understood)  by  at  least  85%  of participants. Due to the outcome of the pilot phase and the test round, it was considered necessary to better emphasize that Caffeine Citrate Chiesi 'should only be used in a neonatal intensive care unit', in the first paragraph of section 3 in the PL: this was the aspect with the lowest readability index in the test.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Caffeine is a well-known pharmacological product. Caffeine citrate is currently used in the form of magisterial  formulations  in  the  treatment  of  AOP  in  Europe  (except  for  France  and  UK,  where formulations of caffeine citrate have been authorised in 1997 and 2008, respectively). The use of a well standardised caffeine citrate formulation could lessen the risk of preparation errors as compared to magisterial preparations.

According to the publication of the main efficacy study (5.3.5.1.1), caffeine citrate was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing apnoea episodes by at least 50% in six days (p&lt;0.05), and approached  statistical  significance  (p&lt;0.10)  in  three  days.  These  efficacy  findings  come  from  a randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial.  The  main  study  has  however  a  number  of limitations, which were discussed above

The submission of the CAP study (5.3.5.1.6), a large RCT, in support of the safety of caffeine citrate was regarded by the CHMP as extremely important for the assessment of the benefit risk balance. The CAP  study  showed  a  beneficial  effect  of  caffeine  citrate  in  terms  of  clinically  relevant,  disability related outcomes. The data from this trial are clearly robust. Of 937 infants assigned to caffeine for whom adequate data at a corrected age of 18-21 months were available, 377 (40.2%) died or survived with  a  neurodevelopmental  disability,  compared  with  431  of  the  932  infants  (46.2%)  assigned  to placebo.

From a regulatory point of view, the major draw-back of the CAP study is that infants with apnoea secondary to  underlying  diseases  were  not  excluded.  The  post  hoc  subgroup  analysis  reassured  the CHMP that  there  was  little  evidence  of  a  differential  treatment  effect  of  caffeine  over  subgroups defined by the clinical indication for starting the study.

Another important finding  of  the  subgroup  analysis  was  that  he  most  severely  affected  infants,  i.e. infants receiving respiratory support, appeared to have more neurodevelopmental benefit from caffeine treatment than unsupported infants. Also, infants who started treatment early had a greater reduction in time on ventilation.

The  target  population  of  premature  newborns  is  particularly  fragile.  The  frequency  and  severity  of known AEs of caffeine citrate is not well characterized. However, as the product will be applied by specialists under intra-hospital conditions of monitoring, the risks associated with these uncertainties seem  manageable.  Also,  the  Applicant  agreed  to  install  a  study/registry  which  will  help  to  better define  the  frequency  and  severity  of  adverse  drug  reactions  and  address  areas  of  remaining uncertainties related to duration of treatment and conditions of use.

Overall therefore the CHMP considered that the efficacy of Nymusa in reducing apnoea episodes is established.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
- the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 2.3.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Nymusa  in  the  treatment  of  apnoea  of  prematurity  was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
