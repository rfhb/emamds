C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL Medicinal product | 16/03/2023 09/02/2024 | Section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated to include a brief description of the exploratory PTC124-GD-045-DMD aiming to explore quantitative levels of dystrophin in muscle tissue before and after 40 weeks of treatment with ataluren in 20 subjects with nmDMD aged 2-7 years. The baseline median dystrophin level as measured by electrochemiluminescence assay was 0.42% of normal (range 0.00% to 41.85%). At the end of the study, the median dystrophin level was 0.33% of normal (range 0.04% to 48.55%). For immunohistochemistry assay, the median percentage of positive fibres at baseline was 73% (range 0.42% to |

The currently approved therapeutic indication remains the same as the benefit-risk balance of Translarna remains positive only in ambulatory nmDMD patients aged ≥2y ears as indicated in Section 4.1 of the SmPC |

The toxicity of the metabolite is unknown. Higher ataluren exposure was associated with potential decrease in efficacy. Therefore, patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease should be treated with ataluren only if the anticipated clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk, and should be closely monitored for possible metabolite toxicity and decrease in efficacy. A lower ataluren dose should be considered. Treatment should not be initiated in previously untreated patients with eGFR <30 ml/min. authorised   |

No apparent differences of the total ataluren exposure in the control, mild, and severe hepatic impairment groups were observed. An approximately 40% decrease of mean total ataluren exposure in the moderate hepatic impairment group versus the control group was noted probably due to the small sample size and variability |
