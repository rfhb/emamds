The MAH submitted a final report for: CHDR1219 (NEU child-PK);

## 2.3.2. ·Clinical study

## CHDR1219 (NEU child-PK)

## Description

Open  label,  Single  Ascending  Dose,  Cross-over  Study  to  Assess  the  Pharmacokinetics  of  Circadin® (Prolonged-Release Melatonin) Mini tablets in Children with Neurodevelopmental disorders and Sleep Disturbances

## Methods

## Objective(s)

- To establish the 24-hour baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations and urine 6SMT excretion in children with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances over the age of 2 and under the age of 18 years.
-  To  establish  the  concentration-time  profile  of  saliva  melatonin  concentrations  and  24  hour  6-SMT urine excretion after 2 and 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets single dose administration in children with neurodevelopmental  disorders  with  sleep  disturbances  over  the  age  of  2  and  under  the  age  of  18 years.
-  To  evaluate the adverse event profile after a single dose of 2 or 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets in children with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances over the age of 2 and under the age of 18 years.

## Study design

open-label, single ascending dose study of 2 and 10 mg Circadin® minitablets with a wash-out of ≥ 7 days.

## Study population /Sample size

16 children (eight aged 2-10 years; eight aged 11-18 years) with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), Smith-Magenis syndrome, Angelman syndrome or Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (Bourneville's disease) who suffer from sleep disturbances.

## Treatments

Treatment arms will be (1) 2 mg Circadin (2 mini-tablets of 1 mg each), and (2) 10 mg Circadin (10 mini-tablets of 1 mg each).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

Endpoints of the study: -  24-hour baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations and urine 6-SMT excretion (12 hours + 12 hours); - Concentration-time profile of saliva melatonin concentrations and 24-hour 6-SMT urine excretion (12

hours + 12 hours) after intake of 2 or 10 mg Circadin® minitablets.

## Statistical Methods

Planned sample size The planned sample consists of 16 subjects (eight in the age group 2-10 years; eight in the age group 11-18 years). Power calculation This is an exploratory pharmacokinetic study in children with ASD or neurogenetic disorders. A formal power calculation has not been performed. However, based on previous experience, a sample size of 16 subjects should suffice for determination of PK parameters. Statistical plan and methods to be employed Results of questionnaires will be reported using descriptive statistics only. Adverse events will be listed as well as summarized by system organ class, dose level and treatment. Pharmacometric analysis Individual saliva melatonin profiles will be plotted and descriptive statistics per planned sampling time point and treatment will be provided, including mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and median. Population pharmacokinetic modeling using NONlinear Mixed Effects Modeling (NONMEM) will be used to  interpret  the  pharmacokinetic  data.  Effects  of  potential  modulating  factors  like  body  weight  or pubertal stage will be investigated. Individual PK parameters will be derived from the model, including (time to) peak concentration (Tmax, Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), clearance and elimination half-life (t1/2). Selection of subjects to be included in the analysis Before the data analysis, a data review will be done. This will allow identification of missing, unused, and spurious data. The data review will be an integral part of the report and includes the decisions on and documentation of the handling of  the  missing,  unused,  and  spurious  data.  Data  of  all  subjects participating in the study will be included in the analyses if the data can meaningfully contribute to the objectives of the study. Reporting deviations from the original statistical plan

Deviations from the original statistical plan will be documented in the study report.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 16 subjects (12 male, 4 female) were enrolled in the study centre in the Netherlands. All subjects completed the study as planned. The study was conducted from January 2013 to March 2014, with the first subject, first visit on 23 January  2013  and  the  first  study  drug  administration  on  7  February  2013.  The  last  study  drug administration was on 14 March 2013. The last follow up phone call was performed on 25 March 2014.

## Baseline data

The  demographic  and  key  baseline  characteristics  of  study  subjects  are  summarised  in  Table  1.  All subjects  who  were  included  in  the  study  fulfilled  the  inclusion  criteria  and  did  not  meet  any  of  the exclusion criteria.

The study population was 75% male and 25% female. The mean age was 10.9 years (range 7 to 15 years),  with  a  mean weight of 43.3  kg (range 26 to 67 kg). All subjects included in the study had autism spectrum disorder.

sclerosis

## Concomitant disease

All of the subjects had a recorded medical history. However, none of the anomalies reported affected their eligibility for the study.

## Efficacy results

The  endogenous  levels  of  melatonin  and  its  major  metabolite  6-SMT  in  this  patient  group  were generally  low,  with  lower  levels  during  the  day  compared  to  night  hours.  This  confirms  the  low endogenous levels found in earlier studies in children with ASD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetic profile of the Circadin® mini tablets 2 mg was similar to the profile measured with the Circadin® 2 mg commercial tablet in adults demonstrating a prolonged release profile that mimics the endogenous profile of the hormone in healthy subjects.

Overall, this study demonstrated the safety, acceptability and prolonged-release profile of 2 mg and 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets in school-aged children and adolescents with autistic spectrum disorder.

## Measurements of treatment compliance

The investigator or his deputy supervised the drug administrations, which were specifically recorded in the CRF. The measurement of melatonin in saliva samples confirmed compliance.

## Bioanalytical conduct

A total of 369 saliva samples were received frozen in good condition by ABL, the Netherlands; all were analyzed  for  melatonin.  The  final  results  are  listed  in  Appendix  15.2.  The  analytical  study  report describes the accuracy, linearity, and precision of the analytical method employed. A total of 96 urine samples were received frozen in good condition by ABL, the Netherlands; all were analyzed for 6-SMT.

## Pharmacokinetic results

## Oral Contamination

A  saliva  sample  was  taken  2  minutes  after  administration  to  measure  saliva  contamination  by melatonin. The sample taken after 2 minutes was not included in the PK analysis. Summary of saliva melatonin concentrations of the contamination sample are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. Following administration  of  Circadin  2  mg  and  Circadin  10  mg,  3  and  8  samples  were  above  the  ULOQ, respectively. Following administration of Circadin 10 mg, 1 sample was below the LLOQ.

Pharmacokinetic parameters of melatonin were calculated on the basis of the actual saliva-sampling time points. The summary figures are based on scheduled saliva-sampling time points.

For endogenous melatonin concentrations measured in the 24 hours prior to administration of Circadin mini-tablets,  each  individual  had  several  observations  above  the  LLOQ  (2  pg/mL).  For  almost  all subjects (14/16), melatonin levels were missing at time points between 23:00 PM and 7:00 AM, as samples were not taken because the subject was sleeping.

Lambda\\_z  and  its  derived  parameters  (Term  (t½  ),  AUC\\_0\\_inf,  PercAUCExtrap,  CL\\_F,V\\_F)  were excluded  from  analysis  (Table  3)  for  the  following  subjects,  as  lambda  could  not  be  accurately estimated for these individuals.

PK Population

Summaries  of  the  PK  parameters  for  the  PK  population  of  melatonin  in  saliva  per  treatment  are presented in Table 4 (Circadin 2 mg), Table 5 (Circadin 10 mg). The plasma concentration-time profile of melatonin was characterized by rapid absorption and disposition (Table 4 and Table 5). The mean tmax was less than 2 hours for both 2 and 10 mg Circadin mini-tablets and concentrations remained elevated for several hours thereafter. Circadin exposure increased 5-fold with a 5-fold increase in dose saliva was dose-linear and apparent clearance in saliva was comparable between dose groups.

Figure 6 Total 6-SMT measured in urine following Circadin 2 mg, PK population.

<!-- image -->

For the safety population, the mean amount of total 6-SMT recovered from urine during the baseline period was 4.2 ug following the 0-12 hour collection period, during the daytime and 13.5 ug following the 12-24 hour collection period, during the night. For the PK population, following administration with Circadin 2 mg the mean amount of total 6-SMT recovered from urine was 989.5 ug following the 0-12 hour collection period and 95.3 ug following the 12-24 hour collection period.

Following  dosing  with  Circardin  10  mg,  many  of  the  6-SMT  values  were  above  the  upper  limit  of quantification  (ULOQ)  during  the  collection  period  0-12  hours  follow  dosing  (further  dilution  of  the samples  was  not  validated).  This  reflects  the  expected  extensive  metabolism  of  melatonin  and excretion of 6-SMT in the first 12 hours following dose administration.

## Conclusions on pharmacokinetic results

Baseline melatonin concentrations were characteristic, being low in the morning and increased over 12 hours towards the evening yet showed overall low endogenous levels. These results were confirmed by baseline  6-SMT  measured  with  lower  amounts  recovered  during  the  day-time  collection  period compared with the night-time collection period. In the safety population, the mean 6-SMT levels during the day were 4.2 ug/12 daytime hours and 13.5 ug /12 night-time hours showing normal pattern of higher levels during the night compared to daytime but very low absolute endogenous levels.

Following Circadin administration, melatonin concentrations peaked within 2 hours after administration and remained elevated for several hours thereafter. The pharmacokinetic profile achieved in the saliva is  similar  to  the  profile  achieved  with  Circadin  tablets  in  adults  and  the  elderly,  i.e.,  the  desired prolonged release profile is demonstrated in ASD children after 2 and 10 mg minitablet administration.

Circadin  exposure  derived  from  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  data  was  dose-linear  and  apparent clearance  was  approximately  1,000  L/hr  and  comparable  between  dose  groups.  Median  apparent terminal  half-life  was  comparable  between  2  and  10  mg  dose  groups.  The  apparent  volume  of distribution  in  saliva  appeared  to  be  smaller  (with  comparable  clearance)  with  increasing  dose. However, data regarding dose effects on this parameter should be interpreted with caution as the Area Under the Moment Curve (AUMC) was established only on a limited number of subjects.

## Pharmacodynamic results

A summary of the pharmacodynamic results are given in this section. Full results are given in following sections, and any issues potentially affecting these results are discussed within the appropriate section.

Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale

A  summary  of  responses  to  the  Observer's  Assessment  of  Alertness/Sedation  Scale  (OAA/S)  are presented in Figure 7.

Following  morning  administration  of  Circadin  (2  mg  or  10  mg),  most  subjects  were  assessed  by Observer's  Assessment  of  Alertness/Sedation  Scale  to  have  a  mild  increase  in  sedation,  with  most scores  indicating  'drowsy/normal  speech'  or  'slow  reaction  to  verbal'.  Only  one  subject  (subject  9) reported a transitory score 'reacts to soft touch'.

## Conclusions on pharmacodynamic results

Following morning administration of Circadin, most subjects were assessed by Observer's Assessment of  Alertness/Sedation Scale to have a mild increase in sedation following Circadin (2 mg or 10 mg) administration, with most scores indicating 'drowsy/normal speech' or 'slow reaction to verbal'. Only one  subject  (subject  9)  reported  a  transitory  score  'reacts  to  soft  touch'.  Sedation  after  the  2  mg Circadin dose peaked at 2 hours which is around Tmax time of the PK profile demonstrating PK/PD correlation.

Overall, participants and caregivers were positive about burden and duration of the study. Nearly all of subjects (68.75%) and their caregivers (87.5%) stated they would consider (consent for) participation again. Most children found saliva sampling not bothersome. The 4 subjects who indicated that saliva sampling  was  somewhat  bothersome  were  10,  11,  13  and  15  year  old.  The  child  who  would  not participate  again,  found  participation  rather  nice,  but  found  study  day  duration  long  and  the  urine sampling  a  bit  bothersome.  The  parent  who  would  not  consent  for  participation  in  similar  research found the child's participation very nice, but thought saliva and urine sampling were a bit bothersome, as did the child. The child itself found participating not so nice and didn't know if it would participate again.

## Conclusions on safety results

All subjects were able to swallow the tablets, none of the subjects chewed, spat out, chocked on or refused to take the tablets.

In general, both treatments were well tolerated. Just over half of the 16 subjects reported at least one AE of mild intensity during the study following either Circadin 2 mg (N=11, 68.8%) or Circadin 10 mg (N=9, 56.3%) administration. No moderate or severe AEs and no deaths or other SAEs occurred.

The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs were headache, fatigue, somnolence, sudden onset of sleep,  sensation  of  heaviness  and  nausea.  Most  of  these  are  to  be  expected based on  the known effects of melatonin.

Overall, subjects and caregivers were positive about burden and duration of the study. Nearly all of subjects (68.75%) and their caregivers (87.5%) stated they would consider (consent for) participation again.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Endogenous Melatonin and Pharmacokinetics

Baseline melatonin concentrations were characteristic of daytime sampling, being low in the morning and increased over 12 hours towards the evening yet showed overall low endogenous levels. These results  were confirmed by baseline 6-SMT measured with lower amounts recovered during the daytime  collection  period  compared  with  the  night-time  collection  period.  In  the  safety  population,  the mean 6-SMT levels during the day were 4.2 ug/12 daytime hours and 13.5 ug /12 night-time hours showing normal pattern of higher levels during the night compared to daytime but very low absolute endogenous levels.

In the PK population, the plasma concentration-time profile of melatonin was characterized by rapid absorption and disposition, with a mean Cmax of 965 pg/mL, mean tmax of 1.57 hours, mean AUC0-∞ of  2370  pg  h/mL,  and  t½  of  5.74  hours  following  Circadin  2  mg.  Following  oral  administration  of Circadin 10 mg a mean Cmax of 3970 pg/mL, mean tmax of 1.37 hours, mean AUC0-∞ of  13,300 pg.h/mL, and t½ of 4.44 hours was observed. In the sub-analysis population, representing a group of subjects who did not seem to have much saliva melatonin contamination from the mini-tablets, the plasma  concentration-time  profile  of  melatonin  was  also  characterized  by  rapid  absorption  and disposition,  with  a  mean  Cmax  of  410  pg/mL,  mean  tmax  of  1.73  hours,  mean  AUC0-∞ of  2150 pg.h/mL, and t½ of 4.87 hours following Circadin 2 mg.

Determination  of  the  melatonin  metabolite,  6-SMT,  in  urine  indicated  extensive  metabolism  and excretion in the first 12 hours following dose administration.

## Pharmacodynamics

Following  morning  administration  of  Circadin,  most  subjects  assessed  by  Observer's  Assessment  of Alertness/Sedation  Scale  had  a  mild  increase  in  sedation  following  Circadin  (2  mg  or  10  mg) administration with peak levels at 2 hours, around tmax time with the 2 mg dose.

## Safety and tolerability

In this study of children with autism spectrum disorder (aged 7 -15 years), single morning doses of Circadin of 2 or 10 mg were well tolerated, with no severe, serious, or significant AEs. Most AEs are to be expected based on the mechanism of action of melatonin. The most frequently reported treatmentemergent AEs were headache, fatigue, somnolence, sudden onset of sleep, sensation of heaviness and nausea.  Nausea,  fatigue  and  headache  were  more  frequently  reported  following  Circadin  10  mg compared with Circadin 2 mg.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

This study accomplishes Measure 4 of the agreed PIP for melatonin. It should be of note that morning administration of melatonin is not physiological. As such, both efficacy and safety data relate to a nonphysiological  administration.  Notwithstanding,  the  PK  /  safety  /  saliva  as  an  acceptable  method  of melatonin kinetics tool, were objectives fulfilled by the study. It has provided reasonable data in the studied population regarding administration of prolonged release melatonin tablets. Data on two other relevant aspects was also presented: pharmacodynamic insight from sleep related symptoms and the easiness  of  the  study  sampling,  questionnaires,  and  overall  methodology,  both  for  the  caregivers (parents) and children.

Regarding safety, most adverse events are within the expected effect of the product (somnolence), and previously known AEs, particularly fatigue, headache and GI events.

The extent of exposure as a group and individually has not been specifically presented on graph or table,  although  it  was  mentioned  that  this  information  would  be  presented.  This  aspect  should  be addressed by the time of submission of a consolidated application.

The CHMP concluded that these preliminary data did not impact the current B/R profile of Circadin.
