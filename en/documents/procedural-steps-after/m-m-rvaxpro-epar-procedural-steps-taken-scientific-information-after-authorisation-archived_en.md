1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update information regarding the concomitant use of M-M-RvaxPro and Varivax with Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCVs), based on the final results from study V114-029; this is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-comparator- controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 4-dose regimen of V114 in healthy infants (PNEU-PED). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the product information and update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 24/10/2024 | SmPC and PL | SmPC new text - Section 4.5. Concomitant administration with other vaccines M-M-RvaxPro can be given concomitantly with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. […] Since M M RvaxPro has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity profiles similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by MSD, experience with this vaccine can be considered. M M RvaxPro should be given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or after administration of other live virus vaccines. - Section 5.1. Concomitant administration In a double - blind, active comparator - controlled study (Protocol V114-029), 1,720 healthy infants were randomised to receive Vaxneuvance (a 15-valent PCV) or a 13-valent PCV. The infants also received standard paediatric vaccines, including M-M-RvaxPro which was administered concomitantly with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age.

Update of section 4.8 of the ProQuad and M-M- RVaxpro SmPC to clarify that in severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported; disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection has also been reported. Further, minor | 20/11/2014 | 09/04/2015 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | A published article, which described a study of more than two million children, suggested that MMR vaccines were not associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy after vaccination per se. However, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis and death as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported post-marketing in severely immunocompromised individuals that were - in spite of the contraindication - vaccinated with measles-containing vaccines. As a consequence, the existing statement in the product information concerning encephalitis and encephalopathy was clarified. |

Taking into account all the variations and Follow-Up Measures (FUMs) that have been approved by the CHMP and given that the MAH commits to submit the data requested in the ongoing follow-up measures (FUMs that have not been fulfilled yet), it can be concluded that the product M-M-RVAXPRO conforms to the current CHMP quality guidelines. No change in the immunogenicity profile or efficacy of M-M-RVAXPRO was observed in clinical trials |

With respect to safety data no new specific safety concern was raised in clinical trials. The safety results provided in the PSUR data did not indicate any new safety signal or new adverse events, which are not covered in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Based on the data available the benefit/risk balance of M-M-RVAXPRO remains positive. The proposed SmPC, PIL and labelling were endorsed by the CHMP. The CHMP is of the opinion that the renewal can be granted with unlimited validity.   |

| II/0021 | To update section 4.5 of the SmPC to include information on the concomitant use of M-M- RVAXPRO with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine based on 4 clinical studies (P019, P066, P067 and P057). Section 2 of the PL was updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to modify section 6.6 of the SmPC to improve the reconstitution instructions. Section 6 of the PL was updated in agreement to it. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/01/2010 | 15/03/2010 | SmPC and PL | The modification sought within this variation was to obtain approval for the concomitant administration of MM- RVAXPRO with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine. Based on studies conducted with ProQuad (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine) and M-M-RII/ M-M-RVAXPRO (measles, mumps and rubella) the clinical data analysed (protocols P019, P066, P067 and P057) confirmed that M-M-RVAXPRO can be administered concomitantly with hepatitis A vaccine (VAQTA) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar-Pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine) without impairing antibody responses to measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A, or the serotypes of S. pneumoniae included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The data also demonstrated that the concomitant administration of M-M-RVAXPRO with hepatitis A vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine had an acceptable safety profile.

Pneumonia is a common complication of infection by wild measles virus. After vaccination with any live virus vaccine, it is biologically possible that very few patients may develop respiratory complications ranging from mild upper respiratory infections to pneumonia. Reviewing the spontaneous reports, there were 7 cases of pneumonia temporally associated with the administration of M-M-R II, the nationally authorised predecessor vaccine to M-M- RVAXPRO produced using human serum albumin. The CHMP therefore agreed to include these events in the Product Information.                                                                                                                                            |

| II/0012 | During a mass vaccination campaign in adolescents and adults in Canada 6 cases of suspected anaphylactic reactions were reported. All cases were observed in young adults 18-30 years of age who each had a history of allergies. The symptoms were similar, e.g. tingling in the mouth and throat, hoarseness, swelling in the throat, difficulty breathing, and occurred within 30 minutes following vaccination. All patients recovered after receiving treatment. The SPC was updated to reflect that adults and adolescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at increased risk of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions. Close monitoring is therefore recommended following vaccination for the early signs of such reactions.

| II/0006   | To amend the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 to add a new route of administration of the vaccine further to the CHMP assessment of Follow-Up Measure 13. The Labelling and Package Leaflet (PL) were updated accordingly. The MAH took the opportunity to correct the wording of section 4.1 of the SPC and accordingly section 1 of the PL. Additionally, the contact details of the local representatives for The Netherlands and Norway in section 6 of the PL were updated. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 24/05/2007   | 25/06/2007 | SmPC, Labelling and PL           | The immunogenicity and safety of M-M-RVAXPRO and VARIVAX when administered concomitantly by intramuscular (IM) route or subcutaneous (SC) route at two separate injection sites was assessed in healthy subjects 12 to 18 months of age. The study found no difference in immunogenicity between the two routes of administration. The general safety was comparable, however the frequencies of injection site reactions (such as redness or rashes at the injection site) were higher when the SC route was used instead of the IM route. The Product Information was updated to reflect that both routes of administration can be used, however the preferred route should be IM, except in subjects with coagulation disorders. A further change related to SPC Section 4.1 clarifying the use of M-M-RVAXPRO in outbreaks or post-exposure in line with section 4.2 of the SPC. |
