## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study MET41 'A Randomized Study to Describe the Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine Administered Concomitantly with Routine Pediatric Vaccines in Healthy Infants and Toddlers' is part of a clinical development program. The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. ongoing paediatric clinical studies covering 6 weeks to 12 months population: MET33, MET41, MET42, MET52, MET58, MET61) is expected to be submitted by Q1/2025. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation of the MenACYW vaccine (MenQuadfi) as solution for injection is approved for the active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria (N.) meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y (as 10µg polysaccharides each and with 55µg conjugated tetanus toxoid carrier protein).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study MET41: 'A Randomized Study to Describe the Safety of an Investigational Quadrivalent Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine Administered Concomitantly with Routine Pediatric Vaccines in Healthy Infants and Toddlers'.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

MET41 is a phase III, modified double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicentre study to describe the safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and the comparator vaccine MENVEO when administered in a 3+1 schedule concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines given to healthy infants and toddlers between 6 weeks of age and 12 months of age.

This study was conducted at 75 centres that enrolled, screened, and randomised subjects in the United States (US) and Puerto Rico.

The study was conducted between 17-Sep-2018 (first subject first visit) to 16-Mar-2023 (last subject last contact).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Approximately 3080 healthy infants aged ≥ 42 to ≤ 89 days were planned to be randomi sed.

The study population included healthy male and female subjects aged 42 to 89 days on the day of the first study visit. Subjects had to have received the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at least 28 days before the first study visit.

Written informed consent was obtained from the subject's parent(s) / guardian.

Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first study vaccination (except for monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines, which could be received at least 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after any study vaccination), or planned participation in another clinical study investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure in the 4 weeks before and/or following any study vaccination was not allowed. Subjects should not have received more than 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine at enrollment.

## Treatments

Group 1 : MenACYW conjugate vaccine + routine paediatric vaccines

Group 2 : MENVEO + routine paediatric vaccines

All subjects were to receive a dose of either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO with the following routine paediatric vaccines:

- •
- PENTACEL (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus

// Haemophilus influenzae type b [DTaP-IPV//Hib]) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age;

## Sample size

Approximately 3080 healthy infants were planned to be randomised.

The sample size of this study was chosen to provide safety data; it was not intended for the purposes of hypothesis testing. No formal sample size calculation was performed. Though there were no statistically powered hypotheses, the overall study cohort of 3080 subjects were to provide a probability of approximately 95% of observing any adverse events (AE) with a true incidence of 0.15%. In the treatment arm with 2310 subjects, there was a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 0.2%.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Randomisation

All subjects were centrally assigned to randomised study intervention using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT).

On the day of enrollment, subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and whose parent / guardian signs the informed consent form (ICF) will be randomly assigned to Group 1 or Group 2 in a  3:1  ratio  such  that  Group  1  will  have  approximately  2310  subjects  and  Group  2  will  have approximately 770 subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Site staff will connect to the IRT system, enter the identification and security information, and confirm a minimal amount of data in response to IRT system prompts. The IRT system will then provide the vaccine assignment and subject number. The full detailed procedures for group allocation are described in the Operating Guidelines. If the subject is not eligible to participate in the study, then the information will only be recorded on the subject recruitment log.

Subject numbers that are assigned by the IRT system will consist of a 12-digit string (a 3-digit country identifier, a 4-digit study centre identifier, and a 5-digit subject identifier). For example, Subject 840000100005 is the fifth subject enrolled in Centre Number 1 in the US (840 being the US country code).

Subject numbers should not be reassigned for any reason. The randomisation codes will be kept securely in the IRT system.

## Blinding

This trial is a modified double-blind trial, which means that the subject's parent / guardian, the Investigator, and other study personnel remain unaware of the treatment assignments throughout the trial. An unblinded vaccine administrator will administer the appropriate vaccine but will not be involved in safety data collection. The Sponsor will also remain blinded to treatment assignments throughout the trial until database lock.

The code may be broken in the event of an AE only when the identification of the vaccine received could influence the treatment of the subject. Code-breaking should be limited to the subject(s) experiencing the AE.

- The blind can be broken by the Investigator or a delegate through the IRT system, as explained in the code-breaking procedures described in the Operating Guidelines. Once the emergency has been addressed by the site, the Investigator or a delegate must notify the Sanofi Pasteur RMO if a subject's code was broken. All contact attempts with the Sponsor prior to unblinding are to be documented in the source documents, and the code breaking CRF is to be completed.

A request for the code to be broken may also be made:

- by the Global pharmacovigilance (GPV) Department through an internal system for reporting to health authorities in the case of an SAE as described in International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2A. In this case, the code will be broken only for the subject(s) in question. The information resulting from code-breaking (i.e., the subject's vaccine or group assignment) will not be communicated to either the Investigator or the immediate team working on the study, except for the GPV representative.

The Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB) must be notified of the code-breaking. All documentation pertaining to the event must be retained in the site's study records and in the Sanofi Pasteur files. Any intentional or unintentional code-breaking must be reported, documented, and explained, and the name of the person who requested it must be provided to the Sponsor.

## Number analysed

Definition of the 6 Safety Analysis Sets

Safety Analysis Set (SafAS) Overall Population: Defined as those subjects who have received at least 1 dose of the study vaccines and have any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after any dose according to the vaccine received at the first dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -SafAS1: Defined as those subjects who have received the study vaccine at Visit 1 around 2 months of age and have any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after the Visit 1 dose according to the vaccine they actually received at Visit 1.
- -SafAS2: Defined as those subjects who have received the study vaccine at Visit 2 around 4 months of age and have any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after this dose according to the vaccine they actually received at Visit 2.
- -SafAS3: Defined as those subjects who have received the study vaccine at Visit 3 around 6 months of age and have any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after the dose according to the vaccine they actually received at Visit 3.
- -SafAS4: Defined as those subjects who have received the study vaccine at Visit 4 around 12 months of age and have any safety data available. All subjects had their safety analysed after the dose according to the vaccine they actually received at Visit 4.
- -SafAS5: Defined as those subjects who have received all 4 doses of the study vaccine (3 doses in infancy and 1 dose in the second year of life at 12 months of age) and have any safety data available. All 4-dose vaccinations received in a series should be either all MenACYW conjugate vaccine or all MENVEO.

## Safety Summary - After the third MenACYW conjugate vaccine dose at 6 months of age (SafAS3)

Within 30 days after vaccine injections at 6 months of age, 1 subject (0.1%) in Group 1 was discontinued from the study due to at least 1 AE and no subjects in Group 2 were discontinued due to at least 1 AE. The AE of 'unresponsive to stimuli' leading to the withdrawal of the subject in Group 1 from the study was considered as not related to vaccination by the Investigator.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

MET41 was a phase III, modified double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicentre study to describe the safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and the comparator vaccine MENVEO when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines given to healthy infants and toddlers (Group 1: MenACYW conjugate vaccine + routine paediatric vaccines; Group 2: MENVEO + routine paediatric vaccines). The meningococcal vaccines were administered in 4 doses at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. The study report of this paediatric study was submitted within 6 months after study completion as required with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended. MENVEO is currently approved in the EU from the age of 2 years (single dose). At submission of the planned type II variation, the MAH should discuss the use of MENVEO as comparator vaccine. Furthermore, at the time of variation submission the MAH should justify a possible extrapolation of the concomitant vaccines and schedules used to the European situation (available vaccines and recommended vaccination schedules in the EU).

Solicited AE information for both solicited injection site reactions and solicited systemic reactions was collected from D0 up to D07 after each vaccination. Immediate unsolicited systemic adverse events were collected within 30 minutes after each vaccination. Unsolicited AE information was collected from D0 up to D30 after each vaccination. SAE information (including AESIs and MAAEs) was collected throughout the study from Visit 1 (day of first vaccination) until the end of the 6-month follow up period after the last vaccination. These measurements are considered appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 2797 subjects were randomised: 2099 subjects to Group 1 and 698 to Group 2. Overall, a total of 2777 subjects received at least one dose of study vaccine, 2080 subjects in Group 1 and 697 in Group 2. Hence, the 3:1 randomisation strategy yielded a rather small sample size to detect the less frequent AEs for the comparator vaccine. Overall, groups were comparable regarding the baseline demographics (sex, age, and ethnicity). For instance, the mean age was 64.7 days (±6.63) in Group 1 and 64.9 days (±6.77) in Group 2. There were slightly more males than females in both vaccination groups (52.5% in Group 1 and 51.9% in Group 2), which is acceptable.

Concomitant vaccinations were similarly distributed between groups. For instance, at visit 4, a total of 2452 subjects (87.7%) received PREVNAR 13: 1832 subjects (87.3%) in Group 1 and 620 subjects (88.8%) in Group 2. A total of 2448 subjects (87.5%) received VARIVAX: 1830 subjects (87.2%) in Group 1 and 618 subjects (88.5%) in Group 2. A total of 2445 subjects (87.4%) received M-M-R II: 1827 subjects (87.0%) in Group 1 and 618 subjects (88.5%) in Group 2. Therefore, the exposure to different infant vaccines was comparable between the MenACYW and MENVEO groups.

The safety data was presented descriptively (no efficacy or immunogenicity data was provided with study MET41).

In the SafAS Overall Population, 91.5% and 92.9% of subjects were experiencing at least one solicited reaction from D0 to D7 after vaccination with MenACYW (group 1) and MENVEO (group 2), respectively. Injection site reactions (such as injection site pain or erythema) were observed in 84.9% (group 1) and 84.6% (group 2) of subjects, respectively. Injection site reactions following the different concomitant vaccines were also comparable between groups at any dose (e.g., solicited injection site reaction after injection of M-M-R II: 49.7% of subjects (group 1) and 51.4% of subjects (group 2). Solicited systemic reactions (such as drowsiness and fever) were observed in 87.1% (group 1) and 88.2% (group 2) of subjects. Within 30 days after any dose, unsolicited AEs occurred in 65.0% and 62.7% of subjects in group 1 and group 2, respectively. At least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR was assessed as related to vaccination in 10.4% and 10.6% of subjects in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Most unsolicited ARs started during the time period D0-D3 and resolved after 1-3 days and 4-7 days in group 1 and group 2, respectively. In summary, the incidence and nature of AEs were comparable between MenACYW and MENVEO groups after vaccination with either meningococcal vaccine. Likewise, injection site reactions after vaccination with the concomitant paediatric vaccines were highly similar between groups.

Importantly, none of the AESIs, MAAEs, SAEs and deaths reported during the study (SafAS) were considered related to vaccination. Also, the majority of SAEs recovered or resolved during the study (120 of 133 events in group 1 and 25 of 26 events in group 2). This is somewhat reassuring since a numerically higher incidence for these safety parameters was observed during the study in the MenACYW group compared to the MENVEO group (MenACYW vs MENVEO: AESIs: 0.9% vs 0.1% of subjects; MAAEs: 76% vs. 75.5%; SAEs: 5.2% vs 3.0%; deaths: 0.1% vs 0.0%).

Three deaths were reported during the study (all in the MenACYW group). One subject (a 12-week-old male; unknown ethnicity) deceased following a non-accidental injury of the head 30 days after injection of the first dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine with routine paediatric vaccines. The second subject (12-week-old Black male) had sudden unexplained death in infancy, 24 days after first dose injection with investigational vaccine administered concomitantly with first doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib, hepatitis B vaccine, pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine, and rotavirus vaccine. The investigator defined the primary cause of death as sudden unexplained infant death and the secondary cause of death as pulmonary oedema. The third subject (06-month-old Black female) had medical history of neonatal hypoglycaemia. The participant was found unresponsive in bed by parent, 4 days after third dose injection of investigational vaccine administered concomitantly with second dose of hepatitis B vaccine, and third doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib, pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine, and rotavirus vaccine. A health care provider was not contacted for the event. The primary cause of death was unknown, and the secondary cause of death was not reported. Thus, the primary cause for 2 of 3 deaths in subjects &lt;12 months of age in the MenACYW group (both black individuals) remain obscure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Besides reported fatal events, the higher rate in SAEs during the study is also reflected in life threatening events (0.3% vs. 0.1% of subjects), events requiring hospitalization (4.6% vs. 2.9% of subjects) and other medically important events (0.7% vs. 0.1% of subjects). Serious system organ class (SOC) General disorders and administration site conditions were reported only in group 1, but the incidence rate is low (4 vs. 0 events in group 1 and 2, respectively). Similarly, serious events in the SOC Injury poisoning and procedural complications were reported in 0.5% vs. 0% of subjects in group 1 and group 2, respectively. However, no specific preferred term (PT) was identified as risk and no PT that shows reasonable possibility to be in causal relation to vaccination. Serious lower respiratory tract infections in the SOC Infections and infestations (i.e. PTs Respiratory syncytial virus infection, Bronchiolitis, Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in SOC Infections and infestations) were reported by 1.2% of subjects in group 1, but only 0.3% of subjects in group 2. However, no difference is seen for the SOC Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (0.3% of subjects in either group). Whether serious respiratory tract infections are indeed associated to the vaccination with MenQuadfi is not clear, but should be discussed in more detail once licensure for subjects &lt;12 months is requested.

A serious event in the SOC Nervous System Disorders was reported by 1.2% and 0.1% of subjects in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Of note, the majority of events was related to seizures/convulsions (i.e. PTs Febrile convulsion, Seizure, Epilepsy, Seizure like phenomena). Thus, it can be expected that a bit less than every 100 th  subject &lt;12months will have a serious seizure/convulsion during the vaccination schedule (i.e. 4 doses) with MenQuadfi, whereas a factor 10 less subjects will be affected by these events during the vaccination schedule with Menveo. In line with this observation, all AESIs during the study (22 events in 19 subjects in group 1 vs. 2 events in 1 subject in group 2) were within these 4 PTs related to seizures/convulsions (i.e. PTs Febrile convulsion, Seizure, Epilepsy, Seizure like phenomena). Considering a possible relation to study treatment, 2 serious events (one PT Febrile convulsion and Seizure each) were reported within 7 days and 6 serious events (3 Febrile convulsion, 2 Seizure and 1 Seizure like phenomenon) within 30 days after vaccination in group 1 (none in group 2; all of these events were also rated as AESI). Thus, serious AEs in the SOC Nervous System Disorders and especially PTs with relation to seizures/convulsions should be discussed in detail once all data from the clinical developmental program in subjects &lt;12months become available.

In addition to the SafAS Overall Population, the MAH also provided summaries after the first MenACYW conjugate vaccine dose at 2 months of age (SafAS1); after the second MenACYW conjugate vaccine dose at 4 months of age (SafAS2); after the third MenACYW conjugate vaccine dose at 6 months of age (SafAS3); after the fourth MenACYW conjugate vaccine dose at 12 months of age (SafAS4) and for subjects who received the entire 4-Dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine Vaccination (SafAS5). The different safety sets mirrored results obtained with the Safety Analysis Set (SafAS) Overall Population. Hence, no specific significant safety risk for a certain age group within study MET41 or after one specific dose was observed.

Only very few subjects discontinued participation in the study due to safety experienced AEs in the different age groups (mostly injections site reactions; up to 0,3% in the MenACYW group, at 2 months of age). Slightly more subjects discontinued due to AEs in the MenACYW group compared to the MENVEO group (11 [0.5%] vs 1 [0.1%] subjects). Overall, a total of 1799 subjects (85.7%) in Group 1 and 611 subjects (87.5%) in Group 2 completed the study, indicating a high and comparable vaccination acceptance for MenACYW and MENVEO vaccines.

Protocol Deviations were overall comparable between groups (group 1 25 subjects [1.2%] vs group 2 11 subjects [1.6%]) and do not indicate major irregularities in study conduct.

## 3. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The fact that AEs were erroneously reported raises concerns on the integrity of study MET41 and raises the question about the correct reporting of AEs for other studies included in the planned variation. The Applicant is asked to perform a root-cause analysis and to outline measures to identify such issues in submitted and ongoing MenQuadfi studies as well as to prevent such errors in future submissions (OC).

The timetable is a 30-day response timetable with clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question:

The MAH is asked to provide an updated documentation with corrected errors and a clear communication of all applied changes. This should include a separate document that depicts all changes applied to tables, figures and text (i.e. previous erroneous and the respective amended version) and with reference in what part of the dossier and in which document the change was applied as well as all documents of the initial submission updated with the corrected information in the same format and manner as for the initial submission.

| CEO Summary of Changes     | Due to a programming discrepancy that had occurred during MET41 study statistical analysis, minor errors in the safety results were noted and have been corrected in the clinical study report (CSR) and this critical expert overview (CEO). • Unsolicited AEs with missing or partial missing dates that were previously not categorized as 'occurred within 30 days' are now considered as 'occurred within 30 days' and were added tothe safety statistical analysis of 'Unsolicited AE within 30 days after vaccination'. This has increased the number of unsolicited non-serious AEs reported in the safety tables and now present the results in a more conservative way. All these AEs were non-serious and non-related to study products. • The denominator (M) of the safety tables describing 'All and related AEs leading to study discontinuation, by SOC and PT' were wrongly computed and was updated using the definition 'M: number of subjects in the safety analysis set'. Numerators remain the same as the Version 1.0 of the CEO. These changes resulted in updates to relevant safety tables and the body of MET41 clinical study report Version 1.0 dated 11 September 2023 as outlined in this amendment as well as the CEO Version 1.0 dated 18 September 2023.

List of Changes from Clinical Study Report Version 1.0 Dated 11 September 2023 to Version 2.0 Dated 11 December 2023 (including the appendices)

## Rational of the MET41 CSR Amendment 1:

Due to a programming discrepancy that had occurred during MET41 study statistical analysis, minor errors in the safety results were noted and have been corrected in the clinical study report (CSR).

- Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) with missing or partial missing dates that were previously not categorized as 'occur within 30 days' are now considered as 'occur within 30 days' and were added to the safety statistical analysis of 'Unsolicited AE within 30 days after vaccination'. This has increased the number of unsolicited non-serious AEs reported in the safety tables and presented the results in a more conservative way. All these AEs were non-serious and non- related to study products.
- The denominator (M) of the safety tables describing 'All and related AEs leading to study discontinuation, by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred terms (PT)' were wrongly computed and was updated using the definition 'M: number of subjects in the safety analysis set'. Numerators remained the same.

Those changes resulted in updates to relevant safety tables and the body of MET41 CSR Version 1.0 dated 11 September 2023 as outlined in the amendment. All changes are shown in the Redline of the CSR V1.0 to V2.0 included in the submission.

Minor typographical/transcriptional corrections unrelated to the amendment have been made in the CSR.

None of these corrections have an impact on the final conclusions of the study as provided in the CSR Version 1.0.

## Rapporteur's assessment and conclusion:

The rational for the MET41 CSR Amendment is acknowledged. Unsolicited AEs within 30 days are now also included when missing or partial missing dates were recorded and the denominator (M) of the safety tables describing 'All and related AEs leading to study discontinuation, by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred terms (PT)' was implemented in its correct definition (i.e. M: number of subjects in the safety analysis set). The provided corrected data were included in this updated assessment report and do not alter the original conclusion.

The fact that AEs were erroneously reported raises concerns on the integrity of study MET41 and raises the question about the correct reporting of AEs for other studies included in the planned variation. The Applicant is asked to perform a root-cause analysis and to outline measures to identify such issues in submitted and ongoing MenQuadfi studies as well as to prevent such errors in future submissions (OC).

## Question:

The fact that AEs were erroneously reported raises concerns on the integrity of study MET41 and raises the question about the correct reporting of AEs for other studies included in the planned variation. The Applicant is asked to perform a root-cause analysis and to outline measures to identify such issues in submitted and ongoing MenQuadfi studies as well as to prevent such errors in future submissions (OC).

## MAH response:

As communicated in the answer to Request for Supplementary Information received on 14 December 2023, the discrepancy in the analyses of unsolicited AEs were due to the following two reasons:

1. Unsolicited AEs with missing or partially missing dates, preventing proper classification, were previously not categorized as 'occur within 30 days' but were listed and described in Appendix 16.5, listing 5.1. These unsolicited AEs with missing or partially missing dates are now considered as 'occur within 30 days' and are included in the safety statistical analysis of 'Unsolicited AE within 30 days after vaccination'. This increases the number of unsolicited non-serious AEs reported in the safety tables by a total of 59 cases, presenting the results in a more conservative way. All these AEs were non-serious and non-related to study products.
2. The denominator (M) of the safety tables describing 'All and related AEs leading to study discontinuation, by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT)' are updated using the definition 'M: number of subjects in the safety analysis set'. All numerators remain the same. This update ensures the denominators of corresponding tables are consistent with the denominators used in other safety analysis tables.

Other previously submitted clinical studies in the frame of a variation or Article 46 (MET62, MEQ00065, MET59, MEQ00066 stage I, MET52, MEQ00071, MET33) were not impacted by the above issues. For statistical analyses of other studies to be submitted later, preventive measures have been implemented and will prevent such errors in future submissions.

Applicant would like to confirm that despite the discrepancy in the analyses, AE reporting of MET41 study was not impacted. AEs were reported correctly according to MET41 study protocol and Sanofi safety guidelines for clinical trials.

A complementary answer on root-cause analysis and preventive measures is provided hereafter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Root cause analysis

The root cause of the two observations above leading to the update in the MET41 Clinical Study Report (CSR) were due to programming's different understanding of the derivation rules used in those AE analyses and the specific context of the study.

In the general statistical analysis plan template, in order to cover all study types and situations, there are several options available for analyzing a particular endpoint. In MET41, the original statistical analysis plan for Tables, Listings and Figures (TLF) of Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) didn't specify the correct denominator, which caused the programmers to use a different derivation rule from what was intended by the study statistician and generally used in other studies.

## Preventive measures

- 1) Internal statistical analysis plan template is now updated with more detailed instructions and examples, on how to deal with missing/partially missing dates. Please see the appendix below for more details.
- 2) Related trainings for these standard derivation rules will be conducted and will be reinforced in the onboarding program for new programmers and statisticians.
- 3) Statisticians are instructed to put more detailed instructional specifications in the statistical analysis plan or related document for programming team, to avoid any possible misunderstanding.

## Appendix: Instruction wording recently added in Sanofi's internal standard safety analysis template (January 2024) to prevent future issue of similarkind

- For unsolicited AE with missing day, month and year, the unsolicited AE will be classified as \"Within 30 days\"
- For unsolicited AE with partially missing start date, the partial available information will be used to determine if this AEis classified \"Within30 days\"or\"Not within 30days\".An AEwill be categorized as\"Not within30 days\"only ifthere is clear evidence from the partially missing start date that this AE happens before the first vaccination or after the last vaccination +30 days.In all other situations, this AE is considered as\"Within 30 days\".Situations may happen as:
- Ifthe start date of AE hasmissing Day and non-missing Month andYear
- Ifthe\"Month/YearofAEstart date\"&lt;\"Month/Year offirst vaccination date\", then it is clear that this unsolicited AE happened beforethefirstvaccination and thisunsolicitedAEwill not be included in the analysisbutwill belistedseparately.
- Else ifthe \"Month/Year of last vaccination date\"&lt;= \"Month/Year of AE start date\"&lt;=\"Month/Year of (last vaccination date + 30 days)\", then this unsolicited AE will be categorized as \"\"Within 30 days\".
- Elseifthe\"Month/Year of AE start date\"&gt;\"Month/Year of(last vaccination date + 30 days)\",then this unsolicited AE will be categorized as \"not within 30 days\". If the AE is non-serious, nonAESI and non-MAAE, then it will not be included in the analysis but will be listed separately.
- If the start date of AE has missing Day and Month and non-missing Year:
- Ifthe \"Year of AE start date\"&lt;\"Year of first vaccination date\", then it is clear that this unsolicited AE happens before the first vaccination and thisunsolicitedAEwill not beincluded in the analysis butwill be listed separately.
- Else ifthe \"Year oflast vaccination date\"&lt;= \"Year of AE start date\" &lt;=\"Year of (last vaccination date + 30 days)\", then this unsolicited AE will be categorized as\"Within 30 days\".
- Elseifthe\"Year ofAEstart date\"&gt;\"Yearof(lastvaccination date + 30 days)\", then this unsolicited AE will be categorized as \"not within 30 days\".If the AEis non-serious,non-AESI and non-MAAE,then it will not be included in the analysis but will be listed separately.

## Rapporteur's assessment and conclusion:

The MAH clarified that other previously submitted clinical studies in the frame of a variation or Article 46 (MET62, MEQ00065, MET59, MEQ00066 stage I, MET52, MEQ00071, MET33) were not impacted by the statistical issues of study MET41.

The provided root cause analysis explained why erroneous data was submitted initially for study MET41.

For the statistical analyses of future studies, preventive measures such as the update of the MAH´s internal statistical analysis plan template and specific internal trainings have been implemented. These measures are considered adequate to avoid the methodological issues of MET41 in future submissions.

Issue resolved. No further actions required.

## 4. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

At present, the study population of MET41 is not covered by the EU Marketing Authorisation of MenQuadfi, which is currently indicated in the EU from the age of 12 months and older. The purpose of MET41 was to describe the safety profile of the MenACYW conjugate vaccine and the comparator MENVEO   when administered in 4 doses concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines given to healthy infants and toddlers between 6 weeks of age and 12 months of age.

The submitted results of study MET41 comprised descriptive safety data sets summarizing AEs that occurred during the study at different age (dose 1-4). Overall, the data indicate a safety profile of MenQuadfi that is roughly comparable to the comparator vaccine MENVEO, when administered concomitantly with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers 2 to 12 months of age. However, the adequacy of Menveo as comparator vaccine is questionable as Menveo is not licensed for the respective age group in the EU. This aspect requires further elaboration for any future variation application. Similarly, the use of administered concomitant vaccines should be justified based on EU standards (i.e. licensure of vaccines used and vaccine schedule). Furthermore, serious adverse events (especially those related to lower respiratory tract infections as well as seizures/convulsions) should be assessed in detail once all data of the clinical program in subjects &lt;12 years become available.

Study MET41 is part of the MenQuadfi Paediatric Investigational Plan, EMA procedure number: EMEA001930-PIP01-16-M04). The MAH´s plan is to complete all the ongoing paediatric clinical studies MET33, MET41, MET42, MET52, MET58, MET61 covering 6 weeks to 12 months population prior to submit all the data together under a type II variation with product information update all the data together to support the extension of indication for use of MenQuadfi in individuals from the age of 6

weeks and older (planned submission Q1 2025 in the EU). As discussed above, data from the complete developmental program are considered of high relevance for the risk assessment in toddlers, especially with respect to observed deaths and serious adverse events.

After finalisation of this report, the MAH communicated errors in the currently provided documentation of this article 46 standalone procedure for MET41. The respective information was updated after request of the corrected information.

Furthermore, the MAH clarified that other previously submitted clinical studies in the frame of a variation or Article 46 (MET62, MEQ00065, MET59, MEQ00066 stage I, MET52, MEQ00071, MET33) were not impacted by the statistical issues of study MET41.

For the statistical analyses of future studies, preventive measures such as the update of the MAH´s internal statistical analysis plan template and specific internal trainings have been implemented. These measures are considered adequate to avoid the methodological issues of MET41 in future submissions.
