## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Numient is recommended to be dosed orally, approximately every 6 hours. Dosing this medicinal product more than 5 times per day is not recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each capsule strength may be used alone, or in combination with other capsule strengths as required. Use of this medicinal product with other levodopa containing medicinal products has not been studied.

Dose recommendations should be followed at initiation of treatment and adapted according to clinical response.

## Initial dose and titration in levodopa-naïve patients

The starting dose is one capsule containing 95 mg of levodopa and 23.75 mg carbidopa three times daily (TID) for the first three days; this may be increased to a dose of one modified-release hard capsule containing 145 mg of levodopa and 36.25 mg carbidopa three times daily from Day 4 of treatment .

Further increases should be individualized based on clinical response.  The daily dose must be determined by careful titration. Patients should be maintained on the lowest dose required to achieve symptomatic control and to minimize adverse reactions such as dyskinesia and nausea. There is limited experience with a total daily dose of more than 1,170 mg of levodopa when administered in levodopa-naïve patients. Converting patients from other levodopa/ dopa-decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide) immediate release medicinal products to Numient As a result of Numient's pharmacokinetic characteristics, the doses and dosing frequency of Numient are not directly interchangeable with those of other levodopa/DDC inhibitor immediate release medicinal products (see section 5.2). When patients are initially converted from immediate release levodopa/DDC inhibitor medicinal products to Numient, the dosing conversion guidelines provided in Table 1 are recommended for initial dosing. Table 1: Guidelines for initial conversion from immediate release (IR) levodopa/DDC inhibitor medicinal products to Numient in Parkinson's disease patients. When patients are initially converted from immediate release levodopa/DDC inhibitor plus catechol-Omethyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors (such as entacapone) to Numient the dosing conversion guidelines provided in Table 2 are recommended for initial dosing.

Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been associated with dose reductions and withdrawal of levodopa/carbidopa containing medicinal products. Patients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product is required, especially if the patient is receiving antipsychotics (see section 4.4).

When converting patients from levodopa/DDC inhibitor medicinal products to Numient, the dose should be adjusted to maintain sufficient symptomatic control. The dosing frequency may be changed from three times a day to a maximum of five times a day if sufficient symptomatic control is not observed. In studies in advanced Parkinson's disease patients, there is limited data using doses above 2,450 mg of levodopa and 612.5 mg of carbidopa given as Numient. The final total daily dose of levodopa from Numient is about double that of the final total daily dose of levodopa from immediate release tablets while the final total daily dose of levodopa from Numient is about three times that of the final total daily dose of levodopa from the combination of levodopa/DDC inhibitor/entacapone. Converting patients specifically from other levodopa/DDC inhibitor modified-release medicinal products to Numient For patients currently treated with other levodopa/DDC inhibitor modified-release medicinal products, limited information regarding conversion to Numient is available. The initial total daily dose of Numient described in Table 1 above may need to be decreased by approximately 30% for patients converting specifically from levodopa/DDC inhibitor modified-release medicinal products to Numient. Maintenance Because Parkinson's disease is progressive, periodic clinical evaluations are recommended. Therapy should be individualized and adjusted for each patient according to the desired therapeutic response. Addition of other medicinal products for the treatment of Parkinson's disease Modified-release levodopa/carbidopa may be used together with other medicinal products for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, dose adjustments may be required (see section 4.5). Interruption of therapy Medicinal product no longer authorised

If general anaesthesia is required, the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take oral medicinal products. If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the usual dose should be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral  medicinal products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

No dose adjustment of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product is required for elderly patients.

## Renal impairment

Impact of renal function on levodopa/carbidopa clearance is limited (see section 5.2). Numient has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. It is recommended to administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe renal disease (see section 4.4).

Hepatic impairment Numient has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. It is recommended to administer this medicinal product cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Numient in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available. Method of administration Numient should be administered with a glass of water and can be taken with or without food. A high-fat, high-calorie meal delays the absorption of levodopa by two hours. Further, high protein meals may impair clinical response by decreasing the absorption of levodopa (see section 4.5). Therefore, Numient should not be taken at the same time as high protein meals. The modified-release hard capsule should be swallowed whole, and not chewed or crushed, in order to maintain the modified-release effect of the levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product. Alternatively, for patients that have difficulty swallowing a capsule, this medicinal product may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a small amount (e.g., 2 tablespoons) of soft food such as apple sauce, yoghurt, or pudding. The medicinal product/food mixture should be swallowed completely and immediately without chewing and should not be stored for future use. It cannot be excluded that heating may change the properties of the medicinal product. Therefore, the medicinal product should not be heated or added to hot food. Products containing ferrous sulphate should be administered separately from levodopa/carbidopa, with the longest possible time interval between administrations (see section 4.5). 4.3 Contraindications -Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. -Narrow-angle glaucoma. -Phaeochromocytoma. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -Co-administration with non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. These inhibitors must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy (see section 4.5).
- -A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## CNS effects and mental disturbances

## Somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset

Levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset (see section 4.7). Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment (see section 4.7). Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of dose or termination of therapy may be considered.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling NMS have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of levodopa/carbidopa medicinal products. NMS is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia and can be associated with rhabdomyolysis. Neurological findings, including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other disturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnoea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leucocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin have been reported. Therefore, patients must be monitored carefully when the dose of levodopa/carbidopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving antipsychotics (see section 4.2). Mental disturbances Patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioural changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like and suicidal behaviour during levodopa treatment or after starting or increasing the dose of levodopa. This abnormal thinking and behaviour can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including anxiety, depression, paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder or a history of psychotic disorder must be treated cautiously with levodopa/carbidopa because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medicinal products used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa. Concomitant use of antipsychotics should be monitored carefully for worsening of Parkinson's motor symptoms especially when D2-receptor antagonists are used (see section 4.5). Impulse control disorders Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating, and dopamine dysregulation syndrome can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa. Review of treatment is recommended if such symptoms develop. Dyskinesias Medicinal product no longer authorised

Medicinal products containing levodopa cause dyskinesias that may require treatment adjustment . Carbidopa permits more levodopa to reach the brain and more dopamine to be formed increasing the risk for certain adverse CNS reactions including dyskinesia. It is recommended to monitor patients for the onset or evolution of dyskinesia and to adjust levodopa/carbidopa doses accordingly.

## Orthostatic hypotension

Levodopa/carbidopa can cause orthostatic hypotension. Levodopa/carbidopa should be used with caution in case of concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause orthostatic hypotension, e.g. anti-hypertensive medicinal products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Glaucoma

Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with levodopa/carbidopa provided the intraocular pressure is well-controlled and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.

## Melanoma

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as medicinal products used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.

Non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation with the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product (see section 4.3). Numient can be taken concomitantly with the recommended dose of an MAO inhibitor, which is selective for MAO inhibitor type B such as selegiline and rasagiline. There is a recognized drug-drug interaction of levodopa with type B MAO inhibitors which potentiates the effects of levodopa. The combination may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension.

For the reasons stated  above,  patients and  prescribing physicians  are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using levodopa/carbidopa, especially in patients with suspicious, undiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma. Periodic skin examinations performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists) are recommended. Laboratory testing Decreased haemoglobin and haematocrit have been observed on long-term levodopa/carbidopa treatment. Periodic evaluation of hepatic, haematopoietic, cardiovascular and renal function is recommended during extended therapy. Levodopa/carbidopa preparations may provide a false-positive test result for ketone bodies, if a test strip is used for determining any ketonuria. This reaction does not change upon boiling the urine sample. False negative results might be obtained upon application of glucose-oxidase methods for glucosuria. Special populations Levodopa/carbidopa should be administered cautiously to patients with ischemic heart disease, severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or history of peptic ulcer disease (because of the possibility of upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage) and a history of convulsions. Care should be exercised in administering levodopa/carbidopa to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias.  In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dose adjustment. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Medicinal product no longer authorised

The dose of levodopa may need to be reduced when an MAO inhibitor selective for type B is added. Patients should be maintained on the lowest dose required to achieve symptomatic control and to minimize adverse reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and isoniazid

Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone), benzodiazepines and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. Patients taking these medicinal products together with levodopa/carbidopa should be monitored carefully for loss of therapeutic response.

## Tricyclic antidepressants

There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and levodopa/carbidopa.

<!-- image -->

Antihypertensives Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when combinations of levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor are added to the treatment of patients already receiving certain antihypertensives. Dose adjustment of the antihypertensive medicinal products may be required during the titration phase of treatment with this modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product. Anticholinergics Anticholinergic medicinal products can work synergistically with levodopa, in order to improve tremor. Concurrent use can, however, cause a worsening of involuntary motor disorders. Anticholinergic medicinal products may impair the effect of levodopa, due to a delayed absorption. A dose adjustment of levodopa may be required. Phenytoin and papaverine There have been rare reports that the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease are reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these medicinal products with levodopa/carbidopa should be carefully monitored for loss of therapeutic response. COMT inhibitors The effect of co-administration of this modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule product and COMT inhibitors such as entacapone has not been studied. The addition of entacapone to levodopa/carbidopa has been demonstrated to increase the levodopa bioavailability by 30%. The dose of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product may need to be decreased with concomitant use of COMT inhibitors. Ferrous salts Levodopa/carbidopa and ferrous salts or multivitamins containing ferrous salts should be co-administered with caution. Ferrous salts can form chelates with levodopa and carbidopa. Products containing ferrous sulphate and levodopa/carbidopa should be administered separately with the longest possible time interval between administrations (see section 4.2). Alcohol interaction Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

In vivo , co-administration of Numient with up to 40% volume-to-volume (v/v) alcohol did not result in dosedumping of levodopa or carbidopa.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Food interaction

In healthy adults, oral administration of Numient after a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced levodopa Cmax 21% while the overall extent of absorption of levodopa (AUCinf) was similar (13% increase) to that observed in the fasted state (see section 5.2). Administration with a high-fat, high-calorie meal delays levodopa absorption by up to 2 hours (see section 4.2).

Following administration of the modified-release hard capsule contents sprinkled over a small quantity (e.g., 2 tablespoons) of soft food such as apple sauce, yoghurt, or pudding, the rate and extent of absorption of levodopa was similar to that observed in the fasted state.

<!-- image -->

Patients being treated with this modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines), until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also section 4.4).

Levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport, therefore high protein meals may impair the absorption of levodopa. Effect of levodopa and carbidopa on the metabolism of other medicinal products Inhibition or induction effects of levodopa and carbidopa have not been investigated. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There  are  no  or  limited  amount  of  data from the  use  of levodopa/carbidopa in  pregnant  women.  Studies  in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Numient is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception, u nless the benefits for the mother outweigh the possible risks to the foetus. Breast-feeding Carbidopa is excreted in rat milk, but it is not known whether carbidopa or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. In a study of one breastfeeding mother with Parkinson's disease, excretion of levodopa in human milk was reported. There is insufficient information on the effects of levodopa/carbidopa or their metabolites in newborns/infants. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Numient. Fertility There are no data on the effects of levodopa or carbidopa on human fertility. Effects of levodopa on fertility were evaluated in mouse studies (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Levodopa may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Certain side effects such as sleepiness and dizziness that have been reported with this modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product may affect some patients' ability to drive or operate machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reaction s with Numient were nausea, occurring in approximately 12% of all patients; dizziness, headache, and dyskinesia, each  occurring in approximately 8% of all patients;  and insomnia,  occurring  in  approximately  6%  of  all  patients. Serious  event s  of  gastrointestinal  ha emorrhage (uncommon)  and  of  allergic  oe dema  (uncommon)  were  reported  in  the  clinical  studies  with  Numient.  A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis   may occur with levodopa/carbidopa  medicinal  products,  although no cases have been identified in clinical studies  with Numient.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms and signs

The acute symptoms of levodopa/DDC inhibitor overdose can be expected to arise from dopaminergic overstimulation. Doses of a few grams may result in CNS disturbances, with an increasing likelihood of cardiovascular disturbance (e.g. hypotension, sinus tachycardia) and more severe psychiatric problems at higher doses. Levodopa overdose may give rise to systemic complications, secondary to dopaminergic overstimulation.

## Treatment

Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system. Since its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for delivery to the brain. The addition of carbidopa to levodopa reduces the peripheral effects (nausea, vomiting) due to decarboxylation of levodopa; however, carbidopa does not decrease the adverse reactions due to the central effects of levodopa.

Management of acute overdose with levodopa/DDC preparations is the same as management of acute overdose with levodopa. Pyridoxine is not effective in reversing the actions of this combination medicinal product. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient should be observed carefully for the development of arrhythmias; if required, give appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy. Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BA02 Mechanism of action Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine, and is given as dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease. Carbidopa is a peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor. It prevents metabolism of levodopa to dopamine in the peripheral circulation, ensuring that a higher proportion of the dose reaches the brain, where dopamine exerts its therapeutic effects. A lower dose of levodopa can be used when it is coadministered with carbidopa, reducing the incidence and severity of peripheral side effects. Pharmacodynamic effects When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect and these may often be accompanied by nausea and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Levodopa-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease APEX-PD

The effectiveness of Numient in patients with early Parkinson's disease was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-group, 30-week clinical trial in 381 patients who had a median disease duration of 1 year and limited or no prior exposure to levodopa and dopamine agonists. Patients continued on stable concomitant anti-Parkinson medicinal product. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to placebo or one of three fixed levodopa/carbidopa doses of 145 mg/36.25 mg, 245 mg/61.25 mg, or 390 mg/97.5 mg, three times a day. Patients were not allowed to receive supplemental levodopa or catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors. Patients receiving the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product initiated treatment at 95 mg levodopa/23.75 mg carbidopa three times daily (TID). The dose was increased starting on Day 4 and the highest target dose (390 mg levodopa/97.5 mg carbidopa TID) was achieved by Day 22.

In both studies the primary endpoint was the percentage 'off' time during waking hours. The main secondary endpoints included 'off' time, 'on' time without troublesome dyskinesia, and UPDRS Parts II+III score. In the ADVANCE-PD study, the Clinical Global Impression of Change was also assessed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## ADVANCE-PD

The ADVANCE-PD study was a 22-week study consisting of a 3-week dose adjustment of pre-study immediate release levodopa/carbidopa treatment prior to a 6-week conversion to Numient. Next, patients were randomized to a double-blind, 13-week study treatment period of either optimized immediate release levodopa/carbidopa treatment or Numient. A total of 471 included patients had been maintained on a stable regimen of at least 400 mg per day of levodopa prior to entry into the trial. Dosing of concomitant antiParkinson medicinal products was kept stable. Patients were not allowed to receive supplemental levodopa/carbidopa or catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor medicinal products during the trial. A total of 393 patients (mean age 63.2 years; 65% male patients) were randomized.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ASCEND-PD

The ASCEND-PD study was a randomized, double-blind, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study in which 110 patients on a stable regimen of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE) containing at least 400 mg per day of levodopa were included. Minimum dosing frequency was four times per day for at least 4 weeks upon entry into the trial. Concomitant anti-Parkinson medicinal products were kept stable during the study. LCE treatment was converted into Numient over a 6-week period. Following this dose conversion, 91 study patients (mean age: 64.1 years; 75% male patients) were randomized to receive Numient followed by prestudy LCE or vice versa. All efficacy data is based on 84 patients who completed the study with the exception of patient diary data which is based on 83. Each double-blind study period lasted 2 weeks.  In between these periods, all patients received open-label Numient treatment for 1 week.

The most frequently recorded concomitant medicinal products for Parkinson's disease in randomized patients were dopamine agonists (64%), and MAO inhibitors (37%). Results Main study results are summarized in Table 5. Medicinal product no longer authorised

*In the ADVANCE-PD study an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model for End of Study was used with treatment and centres as main effects and interaction term for treatment by centre and baseline as covariate.

Data in the ASCEND-PD study were analysed using a standard mixed-model analysis of variance. Treatment, sequence and period were included as fixed effects, intra- and inter subject factors were included as random effects. There was no evidence of period, sequence/carry -over effects in the ASCEND-PD study (p-values all &gt; 0.10).

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Numient in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

## Levodopa

<!-- image -->

The pharmacokinetics of Numient were evaluated following single doses in healthy subjects and following single and multiple doses in patients with Parkinson's disease. The single dose pharmacokinetics in healthy adults following oral administration of 2 Numient 195 mg levodopa/48.75 mg carbidopa capsules is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: Mean concentration-time profiles of levodopa plasma concentrations in 22 adults following a single oral dose of 2 Numient 195 mg levodopa/48.75 mg carbidopa capsules The bioavailability of levodopa from Numient in patients was approximately 70% relative to immediate release levodopa/carbidopa. For comparable doses, Numient results in a levodopa peak concentration (Cmax) that is 30% that of immediate-release levodopa/carbidopa. Following an initial peak at about one hour, plasma concentrations are maintained for about 4 to 5 hours before declining. Peak plasma concentrations are reached at about 4.5 hours. In patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple-dose pharmacokinetics was comparable to single-dose pharmacokinetics, i.e. there was a minimal accumulation of levodopa from the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Following multiple dosing in patients, modified-release levodopa/carbidopa had reduced fluctuations in levodopa plasma concentrations with peak-to-trough fluctuation index of 1.5 with minimal accumulation of levodopa.

## Carbidopa

Following oral dosing of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product the maximum concentration occurred at approximately 3.5 hours. The bioavailability of carbidopa from this medicinal product relative to immediate release levodopa and carbidopa tablets was approximately 50%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Food effect

In healthy adults, oral administration of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product after a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced levodopa Cmax by 21%. The extent of absorption of levodopa (AUCinf) was similar (13% increase) to that observed in the fasted state. Administration with a high-fat, high-calorie meal delays levodopa absorption by up to 2 hours.

Following administration of the modified-release hard capsule contents sprinkled over a small quantity of soft food such as apple sauce, the rate and extent of absorption of levodopa was similar to that observed in the fasted state.

<!-- image -->

Renal excretion of intact levodopa accounts for only about 10% of clearance. Thus, impaired renal function may potentially have a small effect on the exposure of levodopa. Modified-release levodopa/carbidopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).

Levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport, therefore high protein meals may impair the absorption of levodopa. Distribution Levodopa Levodopa is bound to plasma protein only to a small extent (10-30%). Levodopa crosses the blood-brain barrier by active transporters for large neutral amino acids. Carbidopa Carbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma proteins. Carbidopa does not cross the blood-brain barrier at clinically relevant doses. Biotransformation Levodopa Levodopa is extensively metabolized to various metabolites. The two major metabolic pathways are decarboxylation by dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and O-methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Unchanged levodopa accounts for less than 10% of the total urinary excretion. The terminal phase elimination half-life of levodopa, the active moiety of antiparkinsonian activity, is approximately 2 hours in the presence of carbidopa. Carbidopa Carbidopa is metabolized to two main metabolites: α-methyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and α-methyl-3, 4-dihydroxy-phenylpropionic acid. These two metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine unchanged or as glucuronide. Unchanged carbidopa accounts for 30% of the total urinary excretion. The terminal phase elimination half-life of carbidopa is approximately 2 hours. Dose linearity Numient shows dose proportional pharmacokinetics for both carbidopa and levodopa over the levodopa dose strength range of 95 mg to 245 mg. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

There are no studies on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Modified-release levodopa/carbidopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There are no studies on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa when administered as Numient in children.

## Elderly

In the pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients following a single dose of Numient , systemic exposure to levodopa generally increased with increasing age with AUC values being, on average, approximately 15% higher in elderly (≥65 years) than younger subjects (&lt;65 years).

Gender Levodopa Following a single dose of Numient in patients with Parkinson's disease the plasma AUC and Cmax of levodopa was higher in females than males (on average, 37% for AUC and 35% for Cmax). These differences are primarily explained by the lower body weight in females. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. Reproductive toxicology Both levodopa and combinations of carbidopa and levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits. No effects were seen on male or female reproductive organs in repeat dose toxicology studies in mice, rats or monkeys with levodopa alone, or in combination with carbidopa. However, levodopa has been shown to mildly affect mating behaviour in male rats. 6.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Numient is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you take Numient 3. How to take Numient 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Numient 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Numient is and what it is used for Numient contains two different medicines called levodopa and carbidopa in one hard capsule. -levodopa turns into a material called 'dopamine' in your brain. The dopamine helps to improve the symptoms of your Parkinson's disease. -carbidopa belongs to a group of medicines called 'aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors'. It helps levodopa work more effectively by slowing the speed at which levodopa is broken down in your body. Numient is used to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in adults. 2. What you need to know before you take Numient Do not take Numient: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -if you are allergic to levodopa or carbidopa, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6);
- -if you have narrow-angle glaucoma (an eye disorder);
- -if you have phaeochromocytoma (a rare tumour of the adrenal gland);
- -if you are taking certain medicines for treating depression [non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors]. You need to stop using these medicines at least two weeks before you start Numient (see also under ' Other medicines and Numient ');
- -if you have ever had neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS -a rare severe reaction to medicines used to treat severe mental disorders);
- -if you have ever had non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis (a rare muscle disorder).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Numient if you have, have ever had, or develop:

- -sudden sleep attacks or sometimes feel very sleepy
- -any form of severe mental disorder like psychosis
- -feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or notice unusual changes in your behaviour
- -tremors, agitation, confusion, fever, rapid pulse, or wide fluctuations in your blood pressure, or notice that your muscles get very rigid or jerk violently. If any of this happens, contact your doctor immediately
- -an eye condition called chronic wide angle glaucoma, because your dose may need to be adjusted and the pressure in your eyes may need to be monitored

<!-- image -->

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is because other medicines can affect the way Numient works.

-melanoma or suspicious skin lesion -a heart attack, heart beat problems, circulation or breathing problems -kidney or liver problems -an ulcer in your gut (called 'duodenal' or 'peptic ulcer') -an endocrine (hormone) disease -bronchial asthma -obsessive behaviour(s) -convulsions -low blood pressure or feeling dizzy when getting up -new or increased abnormal body movements (dyskinesias) If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Numient. If you must undergo surgery, please tell your doctor that you are using Numient. Impulse control disorders Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your treatments. Tests You may need to have testing of your heart, liver, kidney, and blood cell functions during long-term treatment with medicines containing levodopa/carbidopa. If you need to have tests on your blood or urine, tell the doctor or nurse that you are taking Numient. This is because the medicine may affect the results of some tests. Children and adolescents The use of Numient is not recommended in patients under 18 years of age. The safety and efficacy of Numient in patients under 18 years of age have not been studied Other medicines and Numient Medicinal product no longer authorised

Do not take Numient if you have taken a medicine called a 'non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor' for treating depression in the last 14 days. These medicines include isocarboxazid and phenelzine. If this applies to you, do not take Numient and ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking the following medicines:

- -Other medicines for Parkinson's disease, such as 'anticholinergics' (e.g. orphenadrine and trihexyphenidyl), 'selective MAO-B inhibitors' (e.g. selegiline and rasagiline), and a 'COMT inhibitor' (e.g. entacapone)
- -Ferrous sulphate (used to treat anaemia caused by low levels of iron in the blood). Levodopa/carbidopa may make it harder for your body to use iron. Therefore, do not take Numient and iron supplements or multivitamin supplements containing iron at the same time. After taking one of them, wait at least 2 to 3 hours before taking the other
- -Phenothiazines - such as chlorpromazine, promazine and prochloroperazine (used to treat mental illness)
- -Benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, diazepam, and lorazepam used to treat anxiety
- -Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure

<!-- image -->

-Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; used to treat depression) -Papaverine (used to improve blood flow around the body) -Treatment for high blood pressure (hypertension) -Phenytoin which is used to treat fits (convulsions) -Isoniazid which is used to treat tuberculosis -Dopamine antagonists used to treat mental disorders, nausea, and vomiting Numient with food and drink A high-fat, high-calorie meal delays the absorption of levodopa by two hours. If your diet contains too much protein (meat, eggs, milk, cheese), Numient may not work as well as it should. Avoid taking your capsules at the same time that you consume a high fat or high protein meal. Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking Numient. Numient is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
