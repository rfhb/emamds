Nivolumab BMS should also be permanently discontinued for Grade 2 or 3 immune-related adverse reactions that persist despite treatment modifications (see section 4.4) or for inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.

Patients treated with Nivolumab BMS must be given the patient alert card and be informed about the risks of Nivolumab BMS (see also package leaflet).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Nivolumab BMS in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years) (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Data from patients 75 years of age or older are too limited to draw conclusions on this population.

## Renal impairment

For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. If immunosuppression with corticosteroids is used to treat an adverse reaction, a taper of at least 1 month duration should be initiated upon improvement. Rapid tapering may lead to worsening of the adverse reaction. Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy should be added if there is worsening or no improvement despite corticosteroid use. Nivolumab should not be resumed while the patient is receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. Prophylactic antibiotics should be used to prevent opportunistic infections in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Based on the population pharmacokinetic (PK) results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population. Hepatic impairment Based on the population PK results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on these populations. Nivolumab BMS must be administered with caution in patients with moderate (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × to 3 × the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Method of administration Nivolumab BMS is for intravenous use only. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 60 minutes. The infusion must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter with a pore size of 0.2-1.2 µ m. Nivolumab BMS must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. The total dose of Nivolumab BMS required can be infused directly as a 10 mg/mL solution or can be diluted to as low as 1 mg/mL with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection. For instructions on the handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Nivolumab is associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Patients should be monitored continuously (at least up to 5 months after the last dose) as an adverse reaction with nivolumab may occur at any time during or after discontinuation of nivolumab therapy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nivolumab must be permanently discontinued for any severe immune related adverse reaction that recurs and for any life threatening immune related adverse reaction.

## Immune-related pneumonitis

Severe pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, has been observed with nivolumab treatment (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis such as radiographic changes (e.g., focal ground glass opacities, patchy filtrates), dyspnoea, and hypoxia. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out.

For Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents.

For Grade 2 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, nivolumab should be withheld. Persistent elevations in these laboratory values should be managed with corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents and nivolumab must be permanently discontinued.

For Grade 2 (symptomatic) pneumonitis, nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents and nivolumab must be permanently discontinued. Severe diarrhoea or colitis has been observed with nivolumab treatment (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for diarrhoea and additional symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and mucus or blood in stool. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. Immune-related colitis For Grade 4 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. For Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued. For Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab should be withheld. Persistent diarrhoea or colitis should be managed with corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents and nivolumab must be permanently discontinued. Severe hepatitis has been observed with nivolumab treatment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis such as transaminase and total bilirubin elevations. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. Immune-related hepatitis For Grade 3 or 4 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immune-related nephritis or renal dysfunction

Severe nephritis or renal dysfunction has been observed with nivolumab treatment (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of nephritis and renal dysfunction. Most patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

present with asymptomatic increases in serum creatinine. Disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out.

For Grade 4 serum creatinine elevation, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents.

For Grade 2 or 3 serum creatinine elevation, nivolumab should be withheld, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents, and nivolumab must be permanently discontinued.

Severe rash has been observed with nivolumab treatment that may be immune-related (see section 4.8). Nivolumab should be withheld for Grade 3 rash and discontinued for Grade 4 rash. Severe rash should be managed with high-dose corticosteroid at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents.

Severe endocrinopathies, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, and diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed with nivolumab treatment. Immune-related endocrinopathies Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies and for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation). Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-related. For symptomatic hypothyroidism, nivolumab should be withheld, and thyroid hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, nivolumab should be withheld and methimazole should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation of the thyroid is suspected. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Monitoring of thyroid function should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised. For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, nivolumab should be withheld, and physiologic corticosteroid replacement should be initiated as needed. Monitoring of adrenal function and hormone levels should continue to ensure appropriate corticosteroid replacement is utilised. For symptomatic hypophysitis, nivolumab should be withheld, and hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation of the pituitary gland is suspected. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Monitoring of pituitary function and hormone levels should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised. For symptomatic diabetes, nivolumab should be withheld, and insulin replacement should be initiated as needed. Monitoring of blood sugar should continue to ensure appropriate insulin replacement is utilised. Immune-related rash Medicinal product no longer authorised

Caution should be used when considering the use of nivolumab in a patient who has previously experienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other immunestimulatory anticancer agents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other immune-related adverse reactions

The following immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients treated with nivolumab  in  clinical  trials  across  doses  and  tumour  types:  pancreatitis,  uveitis,  demyelination, autoimmune  neuropathy  (including  facial  and  abducens  nerve  paresis),  Guillain-Barré  syndrome, hypopituitarism, and myasthenic syndrome.

For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. Nivolumab must be permanently discontinued for any severe immune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-related adverse reaction.

The use of systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants at baseline, before starting nivolumab, should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity. However, systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants can be used after starting nivolumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions. The preliminary results show that systemic immunosuppression after starting nivolumab treatment does not appear to preclude the response on nivolumab.

Severe infusion reactions have been reported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). In case of a severe infusion reaction, nivolumab infusion must be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy administered. Patients with mild or moderate infusion reaction may receive nivolumab with close monitoring. Infusion reactions Patients with a baseline performance score ≥ 2, active brain metastases or autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, and patients who had been receiving systemic immunosuppressants prior to study entry were excluded from the clinical trials of NSCLC (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of data, nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis. Special populations Each mL of this medicinal product contains 0.1 mmol (or 2.5 mg) sodium. To be taken into consideration when treating patients on a controlled sodium diet. Patients on controlled sodium diet Patient Alert Card All prescribers of Nivolumab BMS must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management Guidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of Nivolumab BMS therapy with the patient. The patient will be provided with the Patient Alert Card with each prescription. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody, as such pharmacokinetic interaction studies have not been conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other drug metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab. Other forms of interaction Systemic immunosuppression Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of nivolumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown embryofoetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Human IgG4 is known to cross the placental barrier and nivolumab is an IgG4; therefore nivolumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

developing foetus. Nivolumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk. Effective contraception should be used for at least 5 months following the last dose of Nivolumab BMS.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether nivolumab is secreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products, including antibodies, can be secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from nivolumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

Studies to evaluate the effect of nivolumab on fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of nivolumab on male and female fertility is unknown. Fertility 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, nivolumab is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. Because of potential adverse reactions such as fatigue (see section 4.8), patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain that nivolumab does not adversely affect them. 4.8 Undesirable effects Nivolumab is most commonly associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of nivolumab (see 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). Summary of the safety profile In the pooled dataset of two studies in squamous NSCLC (CA209017 and CA209063), the most frequent adverse reactions ( ≥ 10% of patients) were fatigue (33%), decreased appetite (15%), and nausea (12%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). Adverse reactions reported in the pooled dataset (n=248) of CA209017 and CA209063 are presented in Table 2. These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Data for the following immune-related adverse reactions are based on patients who received nivolumab 3 mg/kg in two NSCLC studies (CA209017 and CA209063, see section 5.1). The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are described in section 4.4.

## Immune-related pneumonitis

In CA209017 and CA209063, the incidence of pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, was 5.2% (13/248). Grade 2 and Grade 3 cases were reported in 2.8% (7/248) and 1.6% (4/248) of patients, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 cases reported in these studies. In the phase 1 study MDX1106-03, pneumonitis, including a Grade 4 case in 1 patient, was reported in 3/37 patients (8.1%) with NSCLC receiving nivolumab 3 mg/kg.

Median time to onset was 10.5 weeks (range: 2.1-27.0). Two patients, including the one patient with a Grade 3 case (tubulointerstitial nephritis), received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) at a median initial dose of 0.8 mg/kg (range: 0.5-1.2) for a median duration of 5.3 weeks (range: 0.9-9.7). Resolution occurred in 5 patients (71%), including the Grade 3 case, with a median time to resolution of 5.9 weeks (range: 0.7- 37.6 + ); + denotes a censored observation.

Median time to onset was 11.6 weeks (range: 2.6-85.1). Eleven patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) at a median initial dose of 1.1 mg/kg (range: 0.5-4.0) for a median total duration of 4.3 weeks (range: 0.6-13.1). Eight patients, including the 4 patients with a Grade 3 case, required permanent discontinuation of nivolumab due to pneumonitis. Resolution occurred in all 13 patients with a median time to resolution of 3.9 weeks (range: 0.6-13.4). In CA209017 and CA209063, the incidence of diarrhoea or colitis was 9.3% (23/248). Grade 2 and Grade 3 cases were reported in 2% (5/248) and 1.6% (4/248) of patients, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 cases were reported in these studies. Immune-related colitis Median time to onset was 5.6 weeks (range: 0.1-91.0). Three patients, including 2 patients with a Grade 3 case, received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) at a median initial dose of 0.6 mg/kg (range: 0.4-1.3) for a median duration of 2.0 weeks (range: 1.4-14.1). One patient required permanent discontinuation of nivolumab due to Grade 3 diarrhoea. Resolution occurred in 19 patients (83%) with a median time to resolution of 2.0 weeks (range: 0.1-31.0). In CA209017 and CA209063, the incidence of liver function test abnormalities was 1.2% (3/248). Grade 2 cases were reported in 0.4% (1/248) of patients. No Grade 3-5 cases were reported in these studies. Immune-related hepatitis Median time to onset was 25.1 weeks (range: 4.1-31.1). None of these patients received high-dose corticosteroids. One patient required permanent discontinuation of nivolumab due to Grade 2 increases in transaminases. Resolution occurred in 2 patients (67%) with a median time to resolution of 4.1 weeks (range: 2.9-22.3 + ); + denotes a censored observation. In CA209017 and CA209063, the incidence of nephritis or renal dysfunction was 3.2% (8/248). Grade 2 and Grade 3 cases were reported in 1.2% (3/248) and 0.4% (1/248) of patients, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 nephritis or renal dysfunction was reported in these studies. Immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immune-related endocrinopathies

In CA209017 and CA209063, the incidence of thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism or thyroiditis, was 4.4% (11/248). Grade 2 cases were reported in 3.6% (9/248) of patients. No Grade 3-5 thyroid disorders were reported. The incidence of adrenal insufficiency was 0.4% (1/248; Grade 3). There were no reports of hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, or diabetic ketoacidosis in these studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Median time to onset of these endocrinopathies was 17.8 weeks (range: 6.1-33.1). Three patients, including the one patient with Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency, received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) at a median initial dose of 1.1 mg/kg (range: 0.5-1.3) for 2.7 weeks (range: 0.6-4.6). The Grade 3 case required permanent discontinuation of nivolumab. Resolution occurred in 6 patients (50%) with a median time to resolution of 20.6 weeks (0.4-47.6 + ); + denotes a censored observation.

## Immune-related rash

In CA209017 and CA209063, the incidence of rash was 12.1% (30/248). Grade 2 and Grade 3 cases were reported in 1.6% (4/248) and 0.8% (2/248) of patients, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 rash was reported in these studies.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Median time to onset was 8.1 weeks (range: 0.3-51.9). None of these patients received high-dose corticosteroids. Two patients (1 with Grade 2 rash and 1 with Grade 3 rash) required permanent discontinuation of nivolumab. Resolution occurred in 24 patients (83%), including the 2 patients with a Grade 3 case, with a median time to resolution of 5.7 weeks (range: 0.1- 46.9 + ); + denotes a censored observation. In CA209017 and CA209063, the incidence of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions was 1.6% (4/248). Grade 3 anaphylactic reaction and Grade 4 hypersensitivity were each reported in 1 patient; both of these cases led to discontinuation and resolved with treatment. Infusion reactions In CA209017 and CA209063, the proportion of patients who experienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 13.2% for decreased lymphocytes, 9% for hyponatraemia, 2.9% for hypercalcaemia and hyperkalaemia, 2.5% for decreased haemoglobin (all Grade 3), 2.0% for hypokalaemia, 1.6% for decreased neutrophil count, 1.3% for hypomagnesaemia, 1.2% for hypocalcaemia, 0.8% for increased total bilirubin, and 0.4% for increased AST, decreased platelet, hypermagnesaemia, and hypernatraemia. There was no worsening to Grade 3 or 4 in increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, and increased creatinine. Laboratory abnormalities In study CA209017, hypercalcaemia was more frequently reported in the nivolumab group (31/130, 24%) than in the docetaxel group (9/124, 7%). The exact cause is not known. Although hyperparathyroidism was not reported in CA209017, immune-related hyperparathyroidism might be considered especially if associated with hypophosphataemia (reported in 6 hypercalcemic patients in this study). As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for an immune response to nivolumab. Of the 497 patients who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-product-antibodies, 51 (10.3%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-product antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. Only 4 (0.8%) patients were persistent positive. Neutralising antibodies were detected in only 5 (1.0% of the total) of the positive anti-product-antibody patients. There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile associated with anti-product-antibody development. Immunogenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No cases of overdose have been reported in clinical trials. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC17. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. In syngeneic mouse models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumour growth. Mechanism of action Clinical efficacy and safety The safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a single agent for the treatment of advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, open-label study (CA209017). The study included patients (18 years or older) who have experienced disease progression during or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients were enrolled regardless of their PD-L1 status. Patients with active autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, or untreated brain metastasis were excluded from the study. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to baseline at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. Randomised phase 3 study vs. docetaxel (CA209017) A total of 272 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (N = 135) administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks or docetaxel (n = 137) 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no longer tolerated. Tumour assessments, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), version 1.1, were conducted 9 weeks after randomisation and continued every 6 weeks thereafter. The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Key secondary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). In addition, symptom improvement and overall health status were assessed using the Lung Cancer Symptom Score (LCSS) average symptom burden index and the EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), respectively.

Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was 63 years (range: 39-85) with 44% ≥ 65 years of age and 11% ≥ 75 years of age. The majority of patients were white (93%) and male (76%). Thirty-one percent had progressive disease reported as the best response to their most recent prior regimen and 45% received nivolumab within 3 months of completing their most recent prior regimen. Baseline ECOG performance status score was 0 (24%) or 1 (76%).

The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS are shown in Figure 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The observed OS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients. Survival benefit was observed regardless of whether patients had tumours that were designated PD-L1 negative or PDL1 positive (tumour membrane expression cut off of 1%, 5% or 10%). However, the role of this biomarker (PD-L1 expression) has not been fully elucidated. Study CA209017 included a limited number of patients ≥ 75 years (11 in the nivolumab group and 18 in the docetaxel group). Nivolumab showed numerically less effect on OS (HR 1.85; 95% CI: 0.76, 4.51), PFS (HR=1.76; 95%-CI: 0.77, 4.05 ) and ORR (9.1% vs 16.7%). Because of the small sample size, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data. Efficacy results are shown in Table 3. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 3 : Efficacy results (CA209017)

The rate of disease-related symptom improvement, as measured by LCSS, was similar between the nivolumab group (18.5%) and the docetaxel group (21.2%). The average EQ-VAS increased over time for both treatment groups, indicating better overall health status for patients remaining on treatment. Study CA209063 was a single-arm, open-label study conducted in 117 patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous-NSCLC after two or more lines of therapy; otherwise similar inclusion criteria as study CA209017 were applied. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg showed an overall response rate of 14.5% (95% CI: 8.7-22.2%), a median OS of 8.21 months (95% CI: 6.05-10.9 months ), and a median PFS of 1.87 months (95% CI 1.77-3.15 months. The PFS was measured by RECIST version 1.1. The estimated 1-year survival rate was 41%.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were reported between elderly ( ≥ 65 years) and younger patients (&lt; 65 years). Data from patients 75 years of age or older are too limited to draw conclusions on this population.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with nivolumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant solid tumours (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab is linear in the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. The geometric mean clearance (CL), terminal half-life, and average exposure at steady state at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks of nivolumab were 9.5 mL/h, 26.7 days, and 75.3 µ g/mL, respectively, based on a population PK analysis.

Nivolumab CL increased with increasing body weight. Body weight normalised dosing produced approximately uniform steady-state trough concentration over a wide range of body weights (34-162 kg).

The metabolic pathway of nivolumab has not been characterised. Nivolumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Special populations A population PK analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumour type, tumour size, and hepatic impairment. Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and mild hepatic impairment had an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. The effect of renal impairment on the CL of nivolumab was evaluated in patients with mild (GFR &lt; 90 and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; n = 379), moderate (GFR &lt; 60 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; n = 179), or severe (GFR &lt; 30 and ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; n = 2) renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; n = 342) in population PK analyses. No clinically important differences in the CL of nivolumab were found between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.2). Renal impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the CL of nivolumab was evaluated in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 1.0 × to 1.5 × ULN or AST &gt; ULN as defined using the National Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction; n = 92) compared to patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN; n = 804) in the population PK analyses. No clinically important differences in the CL of nivolumab were found between patients with mild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. Nivolumab has not been studied in patients with moderate (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × to 3 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 3 × ULN and any AST) (see section 4.2). Hepatic impairment 5.3 Preclinical safety data Medicinal product no longer authorised

Blockade of PD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to increase foetal loss. The effects of nivolumab on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in monkeys that received nivolumab twice weekly from the onset of organogenesis in the first trimester through delivery, at exposure levels either 8 or 35 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg of nivolumab (based on AUC). There was a dose-dependent increase in foetal losses and increased neonatal mortality beginning in the third trimester.

The remaining offspring of nivolumab-treated females survived to scheduled termination, with no treatment-related clinical signs, alterations to normal development, organ-weight effects, or gross and microscopic pathology changes. Results for growth indices, as well as teratogenic, neurobehavioral, immunological, and clinical pathology parameters throughout the 6-month postnatal period were comparable to the control group. However, based on its mechanism of action, foetal exposure to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nivolumab may increase the risk of developing immune-related disorders or altering the normal immune response and immune-related disorders have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice.

Fertility studies have not been performed with nivolumab.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Preparation should be performed by trained personnel in accordance with good practices rules, especially with respect to asepsis.

## Preparation and administration

## Calculating the dose

The prescribed dose for the patient is given in mg/kg. Based on this prescribed dose, calculate the total dose to be given. More than one vial of Nivolumab BMS concentrate may be needed to give the total dose for the patient.

 The total nivolumab dose in mg = the patient's weight in kg × the prescribed dose in mg/kg.  The volume of Nivolumab BMS concentrate to prepare the dose (mL) = the total dose in mg, divided by 10 (the Nivolumab BMS concentrate strength is 10 mg/mL). Take care to ensure aseptic handling when you prepare the infusion. The infusion should be prepared in a laminar flow hood or safety cabinet using standard precautions for the safe handling of intravenous agents. Preparing the infusion Nivolumab BMS can be used for intravenous administration either:  without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; or  after diluting to concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL. The final infusion concentration should range between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Nivolumab BMS concentrate may be diluted with either:  sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection; or  50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. STEP 1  Inspect the Nivolumab BMS concentrate for particulate matter or discoloration. Do not shake the vial. Nivolumab BMS concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid that may contain few light particles.  Withdraw the required volume of Nivolumab BMS concentrate using an appropriate sterile syringe. STEP 2  Transfer the concentrate into a sterile, evacuated glass bottle or intravenous container (PVC or polyolefin).  If applicable, dilute with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. Do not shake. Nivolumab BMS infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Administration Administer the Nivolumab BMS infusion intravenously over a period of 60 minutes. Nivolumab BMS infusion should not be infused at the same time in the same intravenous line with other agents. Use a separate infusion line for the infusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Use an infusion set and an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size of 0.2 μm to 1 .2 μm).

Nivolumab BMS infusion is compatible with PVC and polyolefin containers, glass bottles, PVC infusion sets and in-line filters with polyethersulfone membranes with pore sizes of 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm.

After administration of the nivolumab dose, flush the line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection.

## Nivolumab BMS 10 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion nivolumab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. It is important that you keep the Alert Card with you during treatment. If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Nivolumab BMS is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use Nivolumab BMS 3. How to use Nivolumab BMS 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Nivolumab BMS 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Nivolumab BMS is and what it is used for Nivolumab BMS is a medicine used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer (a type of lung cancer) in adults. It contains the active substance nivolumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body. Nivolumab attaches to a target protein called programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) that can switch off the activity of T cells (a type of white blood cell that forms part of the immune system, the body's natural defences). By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action and prevents it from switching off your T cells. This helps increase their activity against the lung cancer cells. 2. What you need to know before you use Nivolumab BMS You should not be given Nivolumab BMS  if you are allergic to nivolumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 \"Contents of the pack and other information\"). Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. Warnings and precautions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Talk to your doctor before using Nivolumab BMS as it may cause:

-  Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease).
-  Diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or any symptoms of inflammation of the intestines (colitis), such as stomach pain and mucus or blood in stool.
-  Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). Signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include abnormal liver function tests, eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach area, or tiredness.
-  Inflammation or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal kidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Problems with your hormone producing glands (including the pituitary, the thyroid and adrenal glands) that may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms that these glands are not working properly may include fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight change or headache and visual disturbances.
-  Diabetes (symptoms include excessive thirst, the passing of a greatly increased amount of urine, increase in appetite with a loss of weight, feeling tired, drowsy, weak, depressed, irritable and generally unwell) or diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from diabetes).
-  Inflammation of the skin that can lead to rash and itching.

Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or if they get worse. Do not try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. Your doctor may

 give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms,  withhold the next dose of Nivolumab BMS,  or stop your treatment with Nivolumab BMS altogether. Please note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed , and may develop weeks or months after your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have blood tests during your treatment. Check with your doctor or nurse before you are given Nivolumab BMS if:  you have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain  you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells);  you have any history of inflammation of the lungs ;  you have been taken medicines to suppress your immune system. Children and adolescents Nivolumab BMS should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## Preparation and administration of Nivolumab BMS

Preparation should be performed by trained personnel in accordance with good practices rules, especially with respect to asepsis.

## Calculating the dose

The prescribed dose for the patient is given in mg/kg. Based on this prescribed dose, calculate the total dose to be given. More than one vial of Nivolumab BMS concentrate may be needed to give the total dose for the patient.

Nivolumab BMS infusion should not be infused at the same time in the same intravenous line with other agents. Use a separate infusion line for the infusion.

 The total nivolumab dose in mg = the patient's weight in kg × the prescribed dose in mg/kg.  The volume of Nivolumab BMS concentrate to prepare the dose (mL) = the total dose in mg, divided by 10 (the Nivolumab BMS concentrate strength is 10 mg/mL). Preparing the infusion Take care to ensure aseptic handling when you prepare the infusion. The infusion should be prepared in a laminar flow hood or safety cabinet using standard precautions for the safe handling of intravenous agents. Nivolumab BMS can be used for intravenous administration either:  without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; or  after diluting to concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL. The final infusion concentration should range between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Nivolumab BMS concentrate may be diluted with either:  sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection; or  50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. STEP 1  Inspect the Nivolumab BMS concentrate for particulate matter or discoloration. Do not shake the vial. Nivolumab BMS concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid that may contain few light particles.  Withdraw the required volume of Nivolumab BMS concentrate using an appropriate sterile syringe. STEP 2  Transfer the concentrate into a sterile, evacuated glass bottle or intravenous container (PVC or polyolefin).  If applicable, dilute with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. Do not shake. Administration Nivolumab BMS infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.
