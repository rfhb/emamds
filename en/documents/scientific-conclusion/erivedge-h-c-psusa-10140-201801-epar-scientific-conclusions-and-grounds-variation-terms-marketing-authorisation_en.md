## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

A review of potential causal relationship between vismodegib and drug induced liver injury (DILI) for cases that fulfil the criteria for DILI and were reported with positive dechallenge and dechallenge-rechallenge to vismodegib from company's safety database showed that the causal association was possible. In addition, two new literature case reports provide additional evidence of a potential causal association.

The clinical course of the events is usually benign with recovery after drug withdrawal. Based on the accumulated evidence, no predisposing factors or patient groups particularly at risk of developing DILI could be identified. The available evidence does also not justify a recommendation to avoid rechallenge in patients who have experienced DILI under vismodegib and no guidance can be given about a specific population at risk or management of the affected patients. A frequency determination cannot be made from post marketing data.

In view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that drug induced liver injury should be added as an adverse drug reaction to the product information with the frequency not known.
