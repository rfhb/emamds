| II/0011 | Extension of Indication Addition of a new indication for reduction of hypercalcaemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. The Package Leaflet has been updated further to the results of the readability testing. The list of local representatives has been updated. In addition, the MAH has submitted the Pharmacovigilance System (version 2.1) and an updated Risk Management Plan (version 1.0). Annex II has been updated to reflect this update. product | 24/04/2008          | 18/06/2008 no                             | SPC, Annex II, PL                | Please refer to the scientific discussion Parareg - H-C-570-II-11 Scientific Discussion                                                                                                                                                            |

| II/0010   | Update of the section 4.5 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to reflect the data from the study 20050226 using midazolam, demonstrating that the co-administration of cinacalcet would not alter the pharmacokinetics of classes of drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 15/11/2007   | 21/12/2007    | SPC                       | The study 20050226 was a randomized, single center, open-label, 2-period, 2 treatment, 2-sequence, crossover study in healthy volunteers. The results show no effect of cinacalcet on midazolam plasma concentrations indicating low inhibitory potential of cinacalcet on CYP3A4/5. These data suggest that cinacalcet would not affect the pharmacokinetics of those classes of drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, such as certain immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine and tacrolimus. authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| II/0009   | Update of safety information following observations from post-marketing surveillance to include hypotension and/or worsening of heart failure, in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC, as well as diarrhoea in sections 4.8 in line with the recently revised Core Data Sheet. The section 4 of the Package Leaflet has been updated to reflect these changes. The contact details of the local representatives of Bulgaria and Romania have also been inserted. The Latvian local representative contact details have been amended. Minor editorial corrections are inserted in Labelling. | 19/07/2007   | 31/08/2007 no | SPC, Labelling, PL longer | The MAH has submitted this variation application to update the SPC and the PL with post-marketing information and post-hoc analysis of clinical trials regarding cases of hypotension and/or worsening of heart failure in patients. In addition diarrhoea has been added to section 4.8 of the SPC and in the relative section of the PL. The contact details of the local representatives of Bulgaria and Romania have also been inserted. Minor editorial corrections are inserted in Labelling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| II/0008   | Update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), sections 4.4 and 5.1, to reflect Safety data from the final analysis of Study 20000178, assessing the safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with secondary hygerparathyroidism, not on dialysis (CKD stage 3 and 4 population). Medicinal product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 19/07/2007   | 31/08/2007    | SPC                       | The MAH submitted the Study 20000178 in patients with secondary HPT and CKD not receiving dialysis. The efficacy results of this study were presented and they were in principle consistent with those previously submitted. Even if the current study was modified to reduce the incidence of hypocalcaemia, the incidence of low serum calcium concentrations remained in principle similar with that observed in previous studies. The events of hypocalcemia were predominantly asymptomatic laboratory findings without discernible clinical sequelae. Consequently section 4.4 of the SPC was updated to include the warning for hypocalcaemia in patients not on dialysis compared with cinacalcet-treated CKD patients on dialysis. Section 5.1 of the SPC has been updated as well to include the information derived from the study 20000178 in patients with CKD and secondary HPT not undergoing dialysis. |

| II/0007         | The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied for an update of section 5.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to include information on surrounding activity on secondary receptors, following CHMP recommendation.   | 01/06/2006                                                                                      | 13/07/2006                                                                                      | SPC                                                                                             | The MAH has performed additional non-clinical studies investigating the activity on the primary receptor (CaR) and the two secondary receptors as requested by the CHMP at the time of the granting of the initial marketing authorisation. In in vitro studies, IC50 values for the serotonin transporter and KATP channels were found to be 7 and 12 fold greater, respectively, than the EC50 for the calcium-sensing receptor obtained under the same experimental conditions. The clinical relevance is unknown, however, the potential for cinacalcet to act on these secondary targets cannot be fully excluded This new data have been included in section 5.3 of the SPC. authorised   | The MAH has performed additional non-clinical studies investigating the activity on the primary receptor (CaR) and the two secondary receptors as requested by the CHMP at the time of the granting of the initial marketing authorisation.
