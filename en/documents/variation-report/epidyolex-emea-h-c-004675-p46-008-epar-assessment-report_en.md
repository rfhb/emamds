## 1. Introduction

Epidyolex was approved, via the European Union centralised procedure by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), with European Commission decision issued on 19th September 2019 for the following indication:

'Epidyolex  is  indicated  for  use  as  adjunctive  therapy  of  seizures  associated  with  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older.'

The  intent  of  this  paediatric  study  was  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral solution [CBD-OS]) in 681 patients aged 2 years and above (≥104 weeks after Visit 1). The  study  comprised  an  open-label  extension  study  in  children  and  adults  as  part  of  a  paediatric investigational plan as approved by the European Medicines Agency's Paediatric Committee (PDCO).

No  unexpected  or  new  clinically  significant  safety  findings  were  noted.  Therefore,  no  regulatory consequences were identified by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH).

## 2. Summary of data submitted

## 2.1. Study design and methodology

## 2.1.1. Study design

This  was  a  multi-center,  open-label  extension  (OLE)  study for  participants  with  DS  or  LGS  who  had completed  the  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  clinical  studies  of  GWP42003-P  (Core  Studies).  The study consisted of a titration period and a maintenance period, followed by a 10-day taper period.

## 2.1.2. Methods

Participants  could  receive  treatment  for  up  to  a  maximum  of  6  years,  depending  on  the  country. Information on seizures was recorded weekly using an interactive voice response system. All participants titrated up to 10 to 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P using a recommended titration schedule. The participants continued at this dose during the maintenance period. However, investigators could decrease or increase (upon discussion with medical monitor) the dose if a participant experienced intolerance or for additional seizure control. The maximum dose patients could receive was 30 mg/kg/day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.1.3. Objective

## Primary Objective:

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of GWP42003-P, as adjunctive treatment, in children and adults with inadequately controlled DS or LGS.

## Secondary Objectives:

Evaluated the effect of GWP42003-P, as adjunctive treatment, on:

- Quality of life.
- Adaptive behaviour.
- Need for hospitalizations due to epilepsy.
- Usage of rescue medication.
- Maintenance of seizure frequency reduction and freedom from seizures during the OLE study.
- Frequency of total and subtypes of seizures.
- Change in duration of subtypes of seizures.
- Number of episodes of status epilepticus .
- Cognitive function.
- Growth and development.
- Menstruation cycles (in females).
- Signals indicating drug abuse liability of GWP42003-P.

## DS Participants Only:

Evaluated the effect of GWP42003-P, as adjunctive treatment, on:

- Total convulsive seizure frequency.
- Total non-convulsive seizure frequency.
- Number of participants convulsive seizure-free.
- Responder rate (defined in terms of percentage reduction in total convulsive seizure frequency).

## LGS Participants Only:

Evaluated the effect of GWP42003-P, as adjunctive treatment, on:

- Drop seizure frequency.
- Non-drop seizure frequency.
- Number of participants drop seizure-free.
- Responder rate (defined in terms of percentage reduction in drop seizure frequency).

## 2.1.4. Study Population

Participants aged 2 years and above with DS or LGS who had completed the double-blind, placebocontrolled, clinical studies of GWP42003-P (Core Studies) were included in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.1.5. Treatment

GWP42003-P oral solution was presented as an oily solution containing 100 mg/mL CBD dissolved in the excipients  sesame  oil  and  anhydrous  ethanol  with  added  sweetener  (sucralose)  and  strawberry flavouring.

Dosage: Participants were titrated up to 10 to 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P. Participants then remained at  this  dose  until  the  'End  of  Treatment'  visit,  with  the  option  for  doses  to  be  increased  (up  to  30 mg/kg/day, maximum) or decreased, if deemed necessary by the Investigator. Following the 'End of Treatment'/Withdrawal visit, doses of IMP were down-titrated at home (10% per day for 10 days) until the 'End of Taper Period' visit.

Investigational medicinal product was to be taken twice daily (morning and evening) immediately after the participant's usual antiepileptic drug (AED) administration, or as GW Pharma (International) B.V otherwise specified by the investigator.

## 2.1.6. Outcomes/Endpoints

## Primary Endpoint:

The safety of GWP42003-P was assessed by the adverse event (AE) profile and by evaluating changes in  the  following,  relative  to  the  pre-randomisation  baseline  of  the  Core  Study:  vital  signs,  physical examination (including height and body weight), 12-lead ECG, Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (The Children's C-SSRS for participants 6 to 18 years of age and C-SSRS for participant's 19 years and above), Cannabis Withdrawal Scale (CWS) (for participants older than 18 years), Pediatric Cannabinoid  Withdrawal  Scale  (PCWS)  (for  participants  4  to  17  years  of  age),  Clinical  laboratory parameters.

## 2.1.7. Statistical Methods

All data collected during this study were summarised across time, using appropriate statistical methods. Where baseline data were available from the Core Studies (seizure information, C-SSRS, quality of life assessments, Vineland-II, cognitive assessment battery, other measures of safety [vital signs, clinical laboratory samples]), changes from baseline were also presented. Summaries were presented overall as well as for the different etiologies (DS and LGS) separately. Descriptive statistical methods were used throughout. There was no formal hypothesis testing.

## CHMP comments

The present study was designed as a multi-center, open-label extension (OLE) study for patients with DS or LGS who had completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies of GWP42003-P (Core Studies). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Epidyolex, as adjunctive treatment, in children and adults with inadequately controlled DS or LGS. Secondary objectives were to measure the efficacy of the study measured as reduction in seizures and measurement of Quality of life. Overall, the objectives of the study are considered relevant and, the chosen endpoints are considered adequate for the corresponding objectives. Treatment duration was up to a maximum of 6 years, which is considered acceptable for a long-term safety-study.

Eligible patients were patients aged 2 years and above with DS or LGS who had completed the doubleblind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies of GWP42003-P (Core Studies). Treatment was administered as an oral solution and the patients (both DS and LGS) were titrated up to 10 to 20 mg/kg/day (could be increased up to 30 mg/kg/day, if deemed necessary by the Investigator). Recommended dose according to the SmPC is up to 20 mg/kg/day; thus, the overall recommended dose was according to the SmPC. The higher dose may (up to 30 mg/kg/day) may be associated with an increase in (dosedependent) adverse reactions.

Only descriptive statistical methods were used. Considering the study being an open-labelled safety study, with no formal hypothesis testing, this is considered acceptable. Overall, the statistical methods applied are acceptable.

Conclusion: The overall study design and methodology is considered acceptable. Of note, the study protocol has been approved by the CHMP.

## 2.2. Results

## 2.2.1. Disposition of Participants

A total of 681 participants were enrolled into the study. All enrolled participants received at least 1 dose of IMP and thus were included in the safety analysis set.

## 2.2.1.1. Populations analysed

For this study, the safety analysis set was the only population analysed. The only participants excluded from this safety analysis set were those that had not taken any IMP.

## CHMP comments

The MAH informs that the safety analysis set, defined as all patients who had been treated with at least one dose of IMP was the only population analysed. Considered the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Epidyolex, as adjunctive treatment, in children and adults with inadequately controlled DS or LGS, thus is considered appropriate. A total of 681 participants were enrolled into the study. This is considered sufficient to detect Very common ( ≥ 1/10) and Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10) adverse events, and thus acceptable. Of the 681 patients, 315 were diagnosed with DS and 366 were diagnosed with LGS.

Overall, 60.6% of all patients completed the treatment phase of the study, with more LGS patients (66.4%) compared to DS patients (54.0%) completing the study. For both patient populations, the most common reason for withdrawal was 'Withdrawn by patient/parent/Guardian (overall 16.2%). The MAH has not provided information regarding the reasons for withdrawal by the patient/parent/Guardian however, this will not be pursued.

Only about ¼ of the patients; totally 23.1%, continued to the taper phase, indicating that the majority of patients continued treatment with epidyolex after finalising the Open-Label Extension (OLE) study.

The demographic characteristics were mostly similar across the DS and LGS groups. 48% were females and the majority (87.2%) were White/Caucasians (Table 4-3). Overall, there was a similar proportion of male (52.0%) and female (48.0%) participants; the majority were White/Caucasian (87.2%). The mean (SD) age was 13.05 (8.2) years with a total of (18.9%) patients being 18-55 years. More patients with LGS (23.8%) compared to patients with DS (2.9%) were &gt;18 years old. This might be coincidental or due to the higher mortality related to DS (reported mortality up to 15%)  compared to LGS (reported mortality approximately 5%).

As the primary objective of the study was to investigate safety of epidyolex as adjuctive treatment (underlined by the the Assessor), all patients were treated with at least one other antiepileptic drug (AED); most often clobazam. This is anticipated as clobazam is widely used in patients with DS and LGS. Mean number of AEDs was Overall, the mean (SD) number of AEDs were 3.30 (1.27).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Conclusion: Study  participants  including  demography  and  baseline  characteristics  are  overall sufficiently  described.  Approximately  half  of  the  681  patients  were  diagnosed  with  LGD  and approximately two-thirds of the patients completed the treatment phase of the study. As the most common reason for withdrawal, was 'Withdrawn by patient/parent/Guardian (overall 16.2%). Only one-fourth  of  the  patients  continued  in  the  taper  phase,  indicating  that  the  majority  of  patients continued  treatment  with  epidyolex  after  finalising  the  Open-Label  Extension  (OLE)  study;  this  is reassuring for the efficacy and safety of Epidyolex (see efficacy and safety assessment later in the present AR).

## 2.2.2. Evaluation of Response to Study Intervention, Efficacy

Efficacy data are presented for the safety analysis set defined as all participants who received at least 1 dose of IMP. For the analysis of efficacy, the safety analysis set was split by indication (315 participants DS and 366 participants LGS).

## 2.2.2.1. Secondary Endpoint, Seizure Frequency

The percentage change from baseline in drop (DS) and convulsive (LGS) seizure frequency in participants with Week 37 to 48 data is presented in Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2. Reduction in seizure frequency provides an estimate of the effect of CBD on a participant's entire seizure burden.

During Week 37 to 48, participants with DS experienced a median 54.2% reduction from their baseline convulsive  seizure  frequency  (Figure  5-1),  and  a  median  62.6%  reduction  from  their  baseline  total seizure frequency (Table 5-1).

During Week 37 to 48, participants with LGS experienced a median 60.1% reduction from their baseline drop seizure frequency (Figure 5-2), and a median 57.8% reduction from their baseline total seizure frequency (Table 5-1).

During the last 12 weeks, only 3.1% of the participants reported convulsive seizures greater than 30 minutes in duration, as compared to 4% during the first 12 weeks. Between Week 193 and Week 264, all participants (100%) had convulsive seizures less than 30 minutes in duration.

## Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change

The change from baseline in overall condition, assessed using the S/CGIC, was reported during the treatment period and was tested using the safety analysis set. When measured on a numerical scale, a lower score represents an improvement in condition.

At their last visit, more caregivers and participants (combined) reported as having an improvement in overall condition (slightly improved, much improved, or very much improved).

compared  to  their  status  before  the  study;  158  (24.8%),  180  (28.8%),  114  (17.9%)  respectively. However, 116 (18.2%) of participants reported no change in their condition. Overall, there was slightly more change reported in participants with LGS as compared to those with DS.

When measured on a continuous scale, the mean S/CGIC scores at last visit was 2.8 (compared to 3.2 at Day 1) which corresponds to 'slightly improved.

At their end of treatment visit, more participants had a decrease in average duration of tonic-clonic (190 [54.1%]), tonic (171 [53.1%]), clonic (80 [38.8%]) and atonic (124 [49.8%]) seizures as compared to their Day 1 based on the S/CGIC score.

## CHMP comments

Seizure  Frequency  was  a  secondary  endpoint.  The  present  study  found  that  patients  with  DS experienced a median 54.2% reduction from their baseline convulsive seizure frequency, and a median 62.6% reduction from their baseline total seizure frequency. These results are in line with the results obtained in the Phase III studies, which found 38.9-56.8% reduction when Epidyolex 20 mg/kg/day was used as adjunct treatment in treatment of patients with DS. Among patients with LGS, the present study found that the patients experienced a median 60.1% reduction from their baseline drop seizure frequency, and a median 57.8% reduction from their baseline total seizure frequency. As for DS, the results for LGS patients are in line with the results obtained in the Phase III studies, which found 39.564.3%  reduction  when  Epidyolex  20  mg/kg/day  was  used  as  adjunct  treatment  in  treatment  of patients withLGS. For both DS and LGS, the highest percentages were obtained in patients treated concomitantly with clobazam. The slightly higher success-rate may (partly) be due to the higher dose, up to 30 mg/kg/day used in the present study and also due to the high rate (60.8%) of patients concomitantly treated with clobazam. Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated  with  Lennox-Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  or  Dravet  syndrome  (DS),  in  conjunction  with clobazam.

Also, the results for the proportion of ≥50% responders during Weeks 37 to 48 were in line (or slightly higher) than observed in the Phase III studies.

Other efficacy parameters including reduction in the number of status epilepticus , decrease in average duration  of  tonic-clonic  seizures  and  effect  on  'Subject/Caregiver  Global  Impression  of  Change' (slightly improved, much improved, or very much improved) were reported for both DS and LGS.

Effect  of  the  treatment  was  generally  obtained  within  the  first  two  weeks  of  treatment  for  both participants with DS and LGS. This is in line with the expected as steady state obtained within 11-13 days (T½ 56-61 hours).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Conclusion: Overall, addition of Epidyolex to baseline anti-epileptic treatment in patients with DS or LGS, not sufficiently responded on the initial treatment resulted in a reduction in seizures, decreased average duration of seizures, and an improvement in Global Impression of Change. The results are in line with previous studies in a comparable population of patients with DS and LGS.

## 2.2.3. Safety

The number of participants who experienced TEAEs during the study is summarised in Table 5-2. A total of 659 participants (96.8%) had 1 or more TEAEs during the study: 306 (97.1%) in the DS and 353 (96.4%) in the LGS disease categories.

## 2.2.3.1.3. Treatment-related Adverse Events

Overall,  the  incidence  of  treatment  related  AEs  was  slightly  higher  in  the  DS  (229  [72.7%])  group compared to the LGS (234 [63.9%]) group. The most common treatment-related TEAEs by PT reported were diarrhea (149 [21.9%] participants), decreased appetite (106 [15.6%] participants), and somnolence (131 [19.2%] participants).

## CHMP comments

The majority (96.8%) of all patients had at least one TEAEs during the study; there were no difference between  disease  groups  (97.1%  in  the  DS  and  96.4%  in  the  LGS  disease  categories).  The  most commonly reported TEAEs were pyrexia (36.7%) and GI-related TEAEs including diarrhea (40.4%) and decreased  appetite  (28.2%),  vomiting  (25.0%)  but  also  neurological  TEAEs  including  somnolence (28.5%) were commonly reported. Convulsions were reported in 32.3% and status epilepticus was reported in 13.1%. With regards to severity, approximately 25% of the patients in each disease group experienced  severe  TEAE(s)  and  almost  50%  of  the  patients  in  each  disease  group  experienced moderate TEAE(s).

Overall, the incidence of treatment related AEs was slightly higher in the DS (229 [72.7%]) group compared  to  the  LGS  (234  [63.9%])  group;  this  may  (partly)  be  due  to  the  difference  in  agecategories as described in the Baseline and demographic section above.

Conclusion: Overall,  the  reported  TEAEs  including  the  frequencies  and  severity  observed  in  the present study are fully comparable with previous observations from the pivotal trials and as reported in the SmPC for Epidyolex.

## CHMP comments

A total of 42.6% of all patients experienced at least one Treatment-related serious TEAEs; 29 (9.2%) patients with DS and 24 (6.6%) patients with LGS. Among both disease groups, the most commonly reported serious TEAEs were status  epilepticus (13.1% in total) and Convulsion (11.5% in total). Considered the multiple convulsions characterizing patients with DS and LGS, and the expectable efficacy of the anti-epileptic treatment (including but not limited to Epidyolex as this was given as adjunct  to  other  anti-epileptic  treatment),  it  is  not  unexpected  that  both  convulsions  and status epilepticus was reported in this long-term study where patients were followed for up to 6 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to Increase in hepatic enzymes (ALAT and ASAT), please see section below.

A total of 18 (2.6%) patients died during the study period including 6 patients (1.9%) with DS and 12 (3.3%) patients with LGS. The only reason for death which was reported in more than 1 patient in each treatment group was 'Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy', which was reported in 4 patients in each disease group. It is well-known that both DS and LGS has a notably mortality (reported to be up to 15% for DS and approximately 5% for LGS) and therefore the reported deaths during the study period including the number and reasons for death are not unexpected.

Conclusion: A total of 42.6% of all patients experienced at least one Treatment-related serious TEAEs with  the  most  commonly  reported  serious  TEAEs  being status  epilepticus (13.1%  in  total)  and Convulsion (11.5% in total). This is not an unexpected finding in a long-term safety study where patients with DS and LGS were followed in up to 6 years. A total of 18 patients died with the only reason for death which was reported in more than 1 patient in each treatment group was 'Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy'. Overall, the reported serious TEAEs including deaths are within the expected for the study.

PT = preferred term; MedDRA; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

The most common TEAEs that led to discontinuation of IMP (i.e., PTs reported in &gt;1% of participants in any treatment group) were convulsion (15 [2.2%]; 8 participants in the DS and 7 participants in the LGS group; out of which 9 (1.3%) were treatment related), ALT increased (11 [1.6%]; 7 participants in  the DS and 4 participants  in  the  LGS  group;  all  were  treatment  related),  AST  increased  (11  [1.6%];  8 participants  in  the  DS  and  3  participants  in  the  LGS  group;  all  were  treatment  related,  diarrhea  (6 [0.9%)]); 0 participants in the DS group and 6 participants in the LGS group; out of which 4 (0.6%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were treatment related, vomiting (6 [0.9%)]) 1 participant in the DS group and 5 participants in the LGS group;  out  of  which  4  (0.6%)  were  treatment  related,  hepatic  enzyme  increased  (5  [0.7%]);  1 participant  in  the  DS  group  and  4  participants  in  the  LGS  group;  all  were  treatment  related,  and somnolence (5 [0.7%]); 1 participant in the DS group and 4 participants in the LGS group; all were treatment related).

## CHMP comments

A  total  of  71  (10.4%)  of  all  patients  permanently  discontinued  treatment  with  Epidyolex  due  to TEAE(s). The most commonly reported TEAEs leading to study discontinuation was convulsions (15 [2.2%] patients) and increase in hepatic enzymes (ALAT and ASAT; 11 [1.6%] patients each). Another 4 (0.6%) patients discontinued due to 'Hepatic enzyme increased'. Cannabidiol is known to be able to cause a dose-related increase in hepatic enzymes (ALAT and ASAT) and this increased risk is known to be potentiated by concomitant anti-epileptic treatment with either valproic acid and/or clobazam. Thus, considered that at baseline, 60.8% of the patients were treated with clobazam and 53.7% were treated with valproic acid, it is expectable that increase in hepatic enzymes would be observed as a common (i.e. &gt;10%) adverse reaction. It is reassuring, that only increase in hepatic enzymes were only reported as a serious TEAE in approximately 2%. Importantly, increase in hepatic enzymes is adequately and sufficiently addressed in the Epidyolex SmPC (both in section 4.4 and in section 4.8).

Conclusion: The  percentage  of  patients  permanently  discontinuing  treatment  with  Epidyolex  was 10.4% which is within the expected when compared to other cannabidiol studies. The most common reasons were convulsions and increase in hepatic enzymes. Both are known events to cause treatment discontinuation. It is reassuring that only few patients experienced increase in hepatic enzymes as a serious TEAE.

## 2.2.3.4. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

The summary of haematology values by timepoint and treatment group are presented in the listings of the  study  report.  There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  findings  in  the  hematology  in  this  study.  The assessments and observations were comparable across both DS and LGS study groups.

At baseline and EoT, most participants had normal RBC values in both DS (84.1% [n=265/315], and the LGS groups (85.0%, n=311/366 participants. Some small decreases in haemoglobin were observed (across both DS and LGS groups, a mean decrease of 0.21 g/dL from baseline to end of treatment) although clinical implication is unclear. Similarly, at baseline and EoT, haematocrit values were normal for majority of the participants in both DS (86.3, N=272/315) and LGS (86.9%, n=318/366) groups. Similar results were observed for white blood cells and platelets across both DS and LGS groups at baseline  and  EoT.  No  other  significant  cell  changes  were  observed  including  erythrocyte  mean corpuscular volume and erythrocyte mean corpuscular haemoglobin.

When considering individual participant changes, in DS study, increases in ALT or AST &gt;3 × ULN during treatment occurred in 75 participants (23.8%) (Table 5-3). While, in LGS study, elevations in ALT or AST &gt;3 × ULN occurred in 49 participants (13%). Some of the transaminase elevations were reported as AEs and led to discontinuation from the study if they met protocol-defined withdrawal criteria. No participant in the study met laboratory criteria for Hy's Law.

There was a mean change from baseline in creatinine (Enzymatic, μmol/L) at EoT of 3.8 in the DS group and 4.0 in the LGS group.

## CHMP comments

Overall only few and minor changes in haematology parameters (haemoglobin, haematocrit, white blood cell count) were reported. There were no reports of serious adverse events related to changes in haematology parameters. Similarly, for changes in creatinine; only few and minor changes were reported.

AS described above, changes in hepatic enzymes (ALAT and ASAT) is a known TEAE to Epidyolex and increase in either ALAT or ASAT was reported for 124 (18.2%) patients. It is reassuring that none of the  patients  met  the  laboratory  criteria  for  Hy's  Law.  Increase  in  hepatic  enzymes  leading  to permanent treatment discontinuation is described and discussed above.

Conclusion: The most commonly reported changes in laboratory values were increase in hepatic enzymes  (ALAT  and  ASAT),  which  was  reported  in  a  total  of  18.2%  of  the  patients.  Changes  in haematology and creatinine were generally few and minor and does not lead to any concerns.

## 2.2.3.5. Vital signs, ECG and Physical Examination Findings

## 2.2.3.5.1. Vital Signs

The changes from baseline in vital sign parameters that met pre-defined criteria for clinical significance over time are presented in the study report.

For each vital sign parameter, including blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, respiratory rate, mean changes from baseline to end of treatment were similar across both DS and LGS groups. The numbers of  participants  with  a  change  from  baseline  in  vital  signs  that  met  predefined  criteria  for  clinical significance (as per the SAP) were similar across the DS and LGS groups for each parameter, with the following exception:

Potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in sitting systolic blood pressure of &gt;20 mmHg were reported in fewer participants in the DS (19 [6.0%]) compared to LGS (30 [8.2%]) group. Similarly, fewer participants reported changes in sitting diastolic blood pressure of &gt;10 mmHg in DS (41 [13.0%]) compared to LGS (70 [19.1%]).

## 2.2.3.5.2. ECG

ECG data are summarised by time point and disease groups. No clinically significant ECG parameters were reported. Overall, 8 (2.5%) participants had corrected QT interval with Bazette correction of &gt;450 msec during the DS study compared with 22.0 (6.0%) LGS study.

## 2.2.3.5.3. Physical Examination Findings

Physical Examination Findings data are summarised by visits up to Week 184.

Body weight remained generally similar/stable during the study for both DS and LGS groups. The mean (SD) change from baseline in weight (kg) in DS group and LGS study at EoT group was 5.84 (8.43), and 4.21 (7.73), respectively. There were fewer number of participants in DS compared to LGS group who reported TEAEs related to decrease in weight i.e., 21 (6.7%) and 61 (16.7%), respectively (Table 5-3). Although 7.3% of participants  had  lost  ≥7%  of  weight  by  the  end  of  treatment  visit,  overall,  more participants gained ≥7% of weight (46.0%).

## 2.2.3.5.4. Inpatient Hospitalisations due to Epilepsy

Six participants in the DS group (1.9%) and 3 participants in the LGS group (0.8%) reported an inpatient hospitalisation  due  to  epilepsy  during  the  baseline  period  (Day  15).  Through  study,  a  total  of  33

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants (5.8%) reported 1 or more inpatient hospitalisations due to epilepsy, with similar numbers in each treatment group: 16 participants in the DS group (6.4%), and 17 participants in the LGS group (5.4%).

## CHMP comments

A potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in sitting systolic blood pressure of &gt;20 mmHg was  reported  in  a  total  of  49  (7.2%)  patients.  Similarly,  a  total  of  30  (4.4%)  patients  reported corrected QT interval with Bazette correction of &gt;450 msec. Neither increase in blood pressure nor QTC prolongation are mentioned as known adverse reactions to Epidylex however, the few cases reported in the present study are not considered sufficient to justify amendments to the SmPC at this stage.

With regard to physical examination, decrease in weight was the most commonly reported finding. Decrease in weight is a known common (&gt;10%) adverse reaction to treatment with epidyolex. It may be related to the commonly reported GI-related adverse reactions like decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting. As the majority of the study participants were children, it is not surprising that during the study (with up to 6 years of observation), more patients gained weight compared to the proportion  who lost weight.

Conclusion: During  the  study,  increase  in  systolic/diastolic  blood  pressure  was  reported  in  few patients without a consistent pattern. Likewise, few patients were reported with a corrected QT interval with Bazette correction of &gt;450 msec. As there were no consistent findings and the majority of findings were not repeated at subsequent physical examinations, these findings will not be pursued. The most commonly  reported  finding  during  physical  examination  was  weight  decreased.  This  is  a  known common adverse reaction to Epidyolex.

## 2.2.3.6. Other Observations Related to Safety

## 2.2.3.6.1. Children's Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale

No  TEAEs  relating  to  suicidality  were  reported  during  the  study  although  isolated  positive  C-SSRS questionnaire scores were received.

One (0.1%) case suicidal ideation and 1 (0.1%) case of suicidal behaviour was reported at Day 1 of the study. Three (0.4%) cases of suicidal ideation and 1 (0.1%) case of suicidal behaviour was reported post dose during the study. Although one case of completed suicide was recorded in the C-SSRS data at Week 104 (Patient X), no AE relating to suicidality was reported, furthermore, this patient had 3 subsequent C-SSRS questionnaire results that were all negative subsequent to Week 104. Thus, the C-SSRS result for completed suicide appears to be a data-entry error for this patient. Overall,  in combination with the AE reporting, no signal for a risk of suicidality with CBD was identified.

## 2.2.3.6.2. Tanner Stages

Details regarding Tanner staging has been presented in the listings.

## 2.2.3.6.3. Menstrual Detail

The numbers of female participants with any changes in menstrual cycle (since previous visit) at baseline were small 6 (5.7%) and 4 (3.1%) females reported changes at the end of treatment. Two (1.9%) participants  reported  abnormalities  related  to  menstrual  cycle  at  baseline.  No  TEAEs  relating  to menstruation were reported during the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3.6.4. Cannabis Withdrawal Scale (CWS)

The CWS (participants aged 18 or over) or PCWS (participants aged 4-17 years) inclusive, CWS/PCWS data were summarised at baseline (Core Studies), the OLE end of taper period, 2 weeks after the OLE end  of  taper  period  and  at  OLE  follow-up  using  appropriate  summary  statistics.  Following  end  of treatment, a total of 16 participants either completed all questions of at least 1 subcategory of the CWS (5 in the DS group and 11 in the LGS group) or completed all questions of the PCWS (1 in the DS group and 1 in the LGS group). For all other participants with available data, any post-treatment increases from baseline in CWS or PCWS scores were small, with no notable differences across the DS and LGS groups.

## 2.2.3.6.5. Study Medication Use and Behaviour Survey

Of the 17 questions in the survey, 14 were marked unanimously as 'never', 'no desire', or 'not at all' including all those relating to routes of administration and diversion. For the remaining 3 questions, relating to drug dosage, dose impact, withdrawal syndrome, and desired use, the numbers of responses which were marked as anything other than 'never', 'no', or 'not at all' were small and were similar across the DS and LGS groups.

## CHMP comments

Other  observations  related  to  safety  included  Children's  Columbia-Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale, Tanner Stages, Menstrual Detail, Cannabis Withdrawal Scale (CWS) and Study Medication Use and Behaviour Survey. Overall, no significant findings were reported.

It is reassuring that No TEAEs relating to suicidality were reported during the study. It is agreed that the one report of a succeeded suicide in a patient X with no previous events related to suicidality and three subsequent C-SSRS questionnaires without indication of suicidial thoughts most likely is a dataentry error. Additional data cannot be retrieved and the issue will not be pursued. Importantly, sucidial behaviour and suicidial ideation is already included in the Epidyolex SmPC (section 4.4).

Conclusion: Other  observations  related  to  safety  included  Children's  Columbia-Suicide  Severity Rating  Scale,  Tanner  Stages,  Menstrual  Detail,  Cannabis  Withdrawal  Scale  (CWS)  and  Study Medication Use and Behaviour Survey. Overall, no significant findings were reported.

## 2.2.4. Pharmacokinetics

PK  data  were  collected  from  5  participants  with  DS  during  this  OLE  trial;  all  originating  from  the GWEP1424 core trial. PK samples were taken no earlier than Visit 4 (Day 85; ±3 days) during the trial, to ensure all participants were on a stable dose of GWP42003-P. The actual doses received ranged from 19-25 mg/kg/day.

All  participants had detectable plasma levels of CBD, 7-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD at all 3 nominal time points (see Figure 5-3 for geometric mean plasma concentrations by time; inter-subject variation was low to moderate for CBD and moderate to high for 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analysis of CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD exposures (AUC0-t) showed that 7-COOH-CBD was the most abundant analyte overall; AUC0-t for 7-COOH-CBD was 21.3-fold higher than parent CBD (Table 5-8).

## CHMP comments

Cannabidiol is hepatic metabolised via the CYP450- and UGT-enzymes. The known metabolites of cannabidiol are 7-COOH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD and (to a lesser extend) 6-OH-CBD. The concentration of the 7-OH-CBD metabolite in human plasma has been shown to be ~40% of the CBD-exposure (based on AUC).

Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected from 5 participants with DS during this OLE trial thus, the dataset is indeed very limited and no conclusion can be made. Overall, based on these data, the geometric mean AUC0-t of cannabidiol was shown to be 1640 h*ng/mL and the concentration of 7-OHCBD and 7-COOH-CBD was 450 and 34900 h*ng/mL, respectively. For 7-OH-CBD, this ~27.4% of the CBD-exposure (based on AUC), which is somewhat lower than the previously reported. However, due to the low sample size for PK measurements, no conclusions can be made and the issue will not be pursued.

Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected from 5 participants with DS during this OLE trial thus, the dataset is indeed very limited and no conclusion can be made. There were no unexpected findings.

## 4. Overall conclusion

The present study was designed as a multi-center, open-label extension (OLE) study for patients with DS or LGS who had completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies of GWP42003-P (Core Studies). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Epidyolex,  as  adjunctive  treatment,  in  children  and  adults  with  inadequately  controlled  DS  or  LGS. Secondary objectives were to measure the efficacy of the study measured as reduction in seizures and measurement of Quality of life. The overall study design and methodology is considered acceptable. The most commonly concomitantly used AED was clobazam (60%). Of note, the study protocol has been approved by the CHMP.

With regard to the efficacy of Epidyolex, the present study showed that addition of Epidyolex to baseline anti-epileptic treatment in patients with DS or LGS, not sufficiently responded on the initial treatment, resulted in a reduction in seizures, decreased average duration of seizures, and an improvement in Global Impression of Change. The results are in line with previous studies in a comparable population of patients with DS and LGS.

With regard to the safety profile of Epidyolex, the present study confirmed previous safety findings. The far majority of the patients experienced at least one TEAE with the most commonly reported TEAEs being pyrexia and GI-related AEs including diarrhoea, vomiting and decreased appetite. Increase in hepatic enzymes were also commonly reported and was one of the most commonly reported TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported serious TEAEs were convulsions and status epilepticus. Overall, the safety profile of Epidyolex reported in this OLE safety study with a safety observation up to 6 years was fully in accordance with the known safety profile for Epidyolex (cannabidiol) and no new safety findings have been identified.

Conclusively, the results from the present long-term safety study are fully in line with findings in previous studies with Epidyolex, including the pivotal studies. Further, the present study does not lead to any need for update of the SmPC.

The Benefit-risk assessment for Epidyolex (cannabidiol) in the following indication: for use as adjunctive therapy  of  seizures  associated  with  Lennox-Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  or  Dravet  syndrome  (DS),  in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older remains positive.
