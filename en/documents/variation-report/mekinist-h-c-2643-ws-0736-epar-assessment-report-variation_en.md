## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

RAF, MEK1 and MEK2 are proteins in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (i.e., the mitogen-activated protein kinase  [MAPK] pathway)  which is a critical  proliferation  pathway  involved  in  normal  cellular  functions  as well  as  in  many  human  cancers,  relating  to  regulation  of  cell  proliferation.  The  pathway  affects  many cancers,  in  particular  melanoma  where  BRAF  mutat ions  are  present  in  50%  of  melanoma 1 .  The  most frequently observed BRAF mutation in melanoma was shown to be V600 (74 -90%) 2   .  Oncogenic mutations in BRAF lead to constitutive activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  are  currently  two  small  molecule inhibitors  of  BRAFV600  (Zelboraf  and  Tafinlar)  and  one  small molecule inhibitor of MEK  (Mekinist) that have been approved. Both trametinib and dabrafenib currently  approved  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic melanoma that expresses a somatic gene mutation known as BRAF V600 mutation. Mekinist (trametinib) was granted a marketing authorisation on June 30 th  2014, and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) on August 26 th 2013.

are

The pivotal registration study for dabrafenib was the phase III BRF113683 study in which the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib was compared with DTIC. In this study , a statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR  0.37;  95%  CI  0.24,  0.58;  p&lt;0.0001)  was  seen where  median  PFS  for  dabrafenib  was  6.9  mo nths compared  to  2.7  months  with  DTIC .  The  median  OS  for  dabrafenib  was  20.0  months  in  comparison  to 15.6 months for DTIC (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.52, 1.13).

In the pivotal phase III study of trametinib MEK114267, the median PFS was 4.8 for patients treated with trametinib and 1.5 months for patients trea ted with chemotherapy (HR 0.45; 95%  CI 0.33, 0.63; p&lt;0.0001). The median OS was 15.6 and 11.3 months for patients in the trametinib and chemotherapy arms respectively (HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.57,1.06).

The clinical benefit of monotherapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors appears to be limited by the development of resistance, with approximately 50% of the patients treated with BRAF inhibitors progress within  5  to  7  months  after  starting  treatment. There  are  several  mechanism s  of  acquired  resistance  to BRAF and MEK inhibitors that have been proposed. However, the main pathway for resistance is thought to  be  the  reactivation  of  the  MAPK  pathway  through  alternative  activation  of  downstream  MEK. Thus, trametinib  and  dabrafenib   combination  would inhibit  two  kinases  in  this  pathway,  MEK  and  RAF,  and provide concomitant inhibition of the pathway. It is suggested that inhibiting both MEK and BRAF simultaneously could postpone or possibly prevent the development of resistance.

monoclonal advance

Other  t reatment  options  have  been  approved  for  melanoma  in  recent  times,  namely  treatments  that target the immune  system  instead of targeting the cancer itself. In 2011, the anti -CTLA4  antibody ipilimumab (Yervoy) was approved for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. More recently, additional immunotherapeutic options available include the antibodies nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for the treatment of (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.

The  applicant  has  applied  for  an  extension  of  the  indication  for  both  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  MAs  to include the combination of trametinib with dabrafenib for the treatment of adult patients unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.

The applicant applied for the following indications:

'Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.'

'Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.'

The final approved indications are as follows:

## Mekinist

'Trametinib  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  dabrafenib is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  with  a  BRAF  V600  mutation  (see  sections  4.4  and 5.1).

Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1).'

## Tafinlar

'Dabrafenib  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  trametinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections and 5.1).'

4.4

The recommended dose of trametinib, either used as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, is 2 mg once daily (QD). The recommended dose of dabrafenib, when used in combination with trametinib, is 150 mg twice daily (BID) (see SmPC section 4.2).

The recommended dose of dabrafenib, either  used as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib,  is 150 mg (two  75 mg capsules) twice daily (corresponding to a total daily dose of 300 mg).  The recommended  dose  of  trametinib,  when  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib,  is 2 mg  once  daily  (QD) (see SmPC section 4.2).

Patients should take trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib at least one hour prior to or two hours after a meal due to the effect of food on trametinib absorption (see section  4.2 and 5.2).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Trametinib and dabrafenib as single agents have shown growth inhibition of BRAF V600 melanoma cell lines and demonstrate anti -tumour effects in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma animal models. The non-clinical aspects of the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib have been presented in the initial marketing  authorisation application. In summary,  the  data  submitted  had  shown  that  the combination  resulted in  vitro cell  growth  inhibition  in  cells  that  harboured  human  BRAFV600  mutations and for those that had become resistant to dabrafenib treatment. In vivo in A375PF11 BRAFV600E human melanoma mouse xenografts, the combination treatment showed a delayed tumour resistance and significant survival improvement with prolonged tumour growth inhibition and delayed tumour outgrowth when  compared  to  treatment  with  the  single  agents  individually.  Sequential  administration  of  one  week dabrafenib (30 mg/kg) and the other week trametinib (3 mg/kg) for 11 weeks showed prolonged tu mour growth inhibition.

mutant for

A repeat dose toxicity study in dogs receiving trametinib (0.0075/5 or 0.0225/20 mg/kg/day trametinib/dabrafenib) resulted in decreased food consumption, abnormal faeces, decrease in body weight which resulted in mortality in one male rat. Microscopic findings were observed in the heart, colon, rectum,  mesenteric  lymph  nodes  and  thymus.  There  was  evidence  of  toxicity  to  the  heart  and  coronary arteries and veins, with vascular changes characterized by endothelial hypertrophy, int imal proliferation, disruption of the internal elastic lamina  and  fibrinoid necrosis of the tunica  media,  and  perivascular inflammation leading to haemorrhage.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Proliferative skin lesions such as epithelial hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis of the skin and forestomach mucosa induced with dabrafenib treatment alone administered for at least 2 weeks were not observed in the combination study.

Toxicity  was  observed  in  the  male  and  female  reproductive  organs.  Testicular  toxicity  characterised  by testicular  degeneration  and  secondary  epididymal  oligospermia  was  observed  in  rats  and  dogs  in  a  13 week toxicity study. After 4 week recovery period, there was no sign of reversibility. In females, toxicity characterised  by  alteration  in  follicular  maturation  was  observed  in  a repeat  toxicity  study.  The  effects were reversible  following 4  weeks  recovery  period. Developmental  toxicities were  observed in  rats given dabrafenib, and in rats and rabbits given trametinib. These effects occurred at exposures below those in patients receiving recommended doses and were considered to be related to pharmacology.

## 2.2.2. Pharmacology

Two additional primary pharmacodynamics studies have been performed. These in vivo studies examined the effect of combination dosing in a mouse BRAF mutant human melanoma xenograft model.

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

Anti-tumour effect of dabrafenib and trametinib in melanoma xenografted mice (study 2012N152372)

Female CD -1 nude mice were xenografted with the A375P F11 cell line, encoding a mutation BRAF V600E .  The xenografted mice (n=15/group) were administered trametinib (0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day), dabrafenib (30 mg/kg/day) or a combination thereof orally by gavage for 14 or 28 days.

addition

Female  athymic  nude  mice  were  xenografted  with  the  A375P  F11  cell  line,  encoding  a  mutation for BRAF V600E .  Mice were treated with 1 mg/kg/day trametinib and 30 mg/kg/day dabrafenib with or without 1  mg/kg/day dexamethasone for 28 days. Treatment was interrupted due to overt toxicity at day 6 and continued at day 15 through day 28. From day 15, mice were treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day trametinib, 30 mg/kg/day dabrafenib and 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone on a five days on/two days off schedule. The anti -tumour efficacy of the trametinib and dabrafenib combination was not affected by dexamethasone.

Addition  of  dexamethasone  also  induced  a  body  weight  loss  of  more  than  20%.  Due  to  the  weight  loss observed  with  triple  combination  therapy,  a  dosing  holiday  was  given  for  all  groups  on  Day  6.  Body weights recovered, and dosing resumed on D15 with trametinib and dabrafenib.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The non- clinical data for the combination treatment of dabrafenib and trametinib was previously presented  and  assessed  as  part  of  the  monotherapy  application  for  trametinib.  In  order  to  support  the combination therapy, the MAH submitted two new pharmacology studies that showed that the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib inhibited the growth of tumours in in vivo models. Exposure to the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in xenograft V600 mutant mice models showed an increase in tumour  response  as  compared  to  the  monotherapy  of  either dabrafenib or trametinib alone.  The tumour response observed was not influenced by the use of the inflammatory  anti- and immunosuppressant c orticosteroid dexamethasone. Therefore, the   combination of trametinib with dabrafenib showed anti-tumour activity in BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma cell lines in vitro and delays the emergence of resistance in vivo in BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma xenografts.

There were no new toxicity findings in the studies submitted compared to the non -clinical data presented in the trametinib and dabrafenib initial marketing authorisation applications. Toxicity studies in dogs have shown some increase in to xicity  compared  to  monotherapy  where  trametinib and  dabrafenib  were  given in  combination  for  4  weeks,  signs  of  gastrointestinal  toxicity  and  decreased  lymphoid  cellularity  of  the thymus were observed at lower exposures than in dogs given trametinib alone. Otherwise, similar toxicities were observed as in comparable monotherapy studies.

initial

Development  toxicity was observed in the monotherapy  for dabrafenib and trametinib. The findings suggest  a  risk  for  human embryofoetal  development,  including  teratogenic  ef fects.  It  is  reasonable  to presume that the effect of the combination treatment on developmental toxicity would not differ from the monotherapy. This has already been addressed previously in the trametinib and dabrafenib applications, where  develo pment toxicity was identified as  an important potential  risk  or as missing information  and will be monitored as an important potential risk through routine risk minimisation measures.

The  updated  data  submitted  in  this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  signific ant  increase  in  environmental exposure  further  to  the  use  of  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib.  Considering  the  above  data, trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.2.5. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The  non- clinical  studies  were  considered  adequate  and  acceptable  for  the  assessment  of  non -clinical aspects  of  an  application  for the  extension  of  indication  for  the  combination  therapy  of  trametinib  with dabrafenib.

PK data for the combination were obtained from th e Phase I/II, open -label, dose -escalation Study BRF113220,  and  the  pivotal  Phase  III,  randomized,  doubleblinded  Study  MEK115306.  In  part  A,  the effect  of  repeat  doses  of  trametinib  2  mg  once  daily  on  single  dose  dabrafenib  was  investigated,  part  B was  a  d ose  escalation  and  cohort  expansion  of  combination  dabrafenib  and  trametinib,  Part  C  was  a randomized Phase II part of the study including dabrafenib 150 mg BID as monotherapy combination  with  trametinib  1  and  2  mg  once  daily,  and  in  Part  D,  PK  and safety  of  dabrafenib  75  and 150 mg BID administered as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or hypromellose (HPMC) capsules monotherapy and in combination with trametinib 2 mg once daily was assessed.

## Study BRF113220 Part A: interaction between trametinib and dabrafenib

Trametinib had shown inhibitory potential against CYP2C8 in vitro , with a concentration resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition (IC50) of 0.34 µM. In vitro studies demonstrated that the oxidative metabolism of dabrafenib was mediated by CYP2C8 and could potentially be affected by CYP2C8 inhibitors.

A total of 8 subjects were included in Part A. GLS means ratios of dabrafenib plus trametinib dabrafenib  alone  (90%  CI)  were  1.03  (0.79,  1.34),  1.01  (0.85,  1.19),  and  0.94  (0.82,  1.08)  for  Cmax, AUC(0-t) and AUCinf, respectively. The 90% CI for AUCs were contained within the 80 to boundaries. Median tmax was 2.5 and 2.0 hours with administration of dabrafenib alone and trametinib, respectively. Similar results were noted with dabrafenib metabolites including hydroxy,carboxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib with GLS mean dabrafenib plus trametinib to dabrafenib alone ratios ranging from 0.92 to 1.03 for the different PK parameters.

Study BRF113220 Part B: dose escalation and cohort expansion of combination dabrafenib and trametinib

The initial dose of the combination was half the recommended dose of each agent. Doses of trametinib 1, 1.5,  and  2  mg  once- daily  were  administered  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  (75  or  150  mg  BID,  gelatin capsules) using a dose escalation procedure. The dose proportionality of trametinib was evaluated using a power model.

Dose  escalation  proceeded  until  the  recommended  single  agent  doses  of  dabrafenib  (150  mg  BID)  and trametinib (2 mg once daily). One subject experienced  a dose limiting toxicity of neutrophilic panniculitis in Part B, at a dose of dabrafenib 150 mg BID and trametinib 2 mg once daily. A total of 79 subjects were treated.

Dabrafenib : The  geometric mean  AUCinf  following  administration  of  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID (gelatin capsule) in combination with trametinib 1, 1.5, or 2 mg trametinib ranged from 3539 to 5187 ng*hr/mL on Day 15 (n=13) and from 4528 to 5518 ng*hr/mL on Day 21 (n=28).

Trametinib : At doses of 1, 1.5, and 2 mg once-daily, geometric mean trametinib AUC(0-8), AUCinf, Cmax and  Cτ  on  Days  15  (n  =  20)  and  21  (n  =  35)  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner.  Following administration  of  trametinib  2  mg  once -daily  doses,  geometric  mean  (%  between  subject  coefficient  of variability [CVb]) Cmax, AUCinf and Cτ were 22.4 ng/mL (30%), 394 ng*hr/mL (35%), and 12.4 ng/mL (42%),  respectively,  on  Day  15  and  22.6  ng/mL  (36%),  351  ng*hr/mL  (34%),  and  10.8  ng/mL  (34%), respectively, on Day 21.

Trametinib and dabrafenib PK parameters obtained in combination were generally consistent throughout studies BRF113220, BRF113683 and BRF 113771.

The  final  validated  models  developed  for  the  combination  were  used  to  evaluate  data  obtained  in  the Phase  III  study  MEK115306  and  provide  post  hoc  estimates.  Individual  post  hoc  estimates  for  CL/F  and Vc/F are listed in Table 5.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Pop-PK: exposure-response

## Response Rate (Study BRF113220, Part C)

The  relationship  between  response  rate  and  exposure  was  explored  graphically  by  binning  data  into quartiles of exposure (Study 2012N144949\\_02). Figure 3 shows an increase in response rate with higher trametinib  average  exposure  (≥10  ng/mL).  These  data  support  selection  of  combination  dose  with trametinib 2 mg once daily.

Figure 3: Proportion  of  responders  as  a  function  of  trametinib  exposure  from  subjects enrolled - Study BRF113220 Part C

There  was  no  relationship  between  response  rate  and  dabrafenib  or  dabrafenib  metabolites  exposure across dabrafenib monotherapy and combination cohorts.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Progression-Free Survival (Study MEK115306)

The relationship between PFS and quartiles of exposure was explored based on results from the Phase III study  MEK115306 (Study 2013N184875\\_00). Results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 for  dabrafenib and trametinib, respectively.

## Adverse Events

The relationship between pyrexia and exposure was explored by plotting the safety data against quartiles of  exposure  in  Study  MEK115306  (Study  2013N184875\\_00) or tertiles  of  exposure  in  S tudy  BRF113220 Part C (Study 2012N144949\\_02). The analysis was performed on pyrexia events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Higher  rates  of  pyrexia  were  noted  when  dabrafenib  was  administered  with  trametinib  (Figure  6).  The incidence of pyrexia tended to be higher with higher trametinib exposure when administered combination.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology char acteristics of dabrafenib and trametinib when administered monotherapy, as well as the clinical pharmacology characteristics of dabrafenib and administered  in  combination  have  been  well  characterized  and  have  been  described  previously  in  the monotherapy applications (EMEA/H/C/2604 and EMEA/H/C/2643).

as trametinib

When  given  in  combination,  the  recommended  dose  of  the  combination  is  150  mg  twicedaily  (BID)  of dabrafenib  with  2  mg  oncedaily  of  trametinib,  administered  under  fasting  conditions.  These  doses in combination are equal to the doses applied for the individual drugs dabrafenib and trametinib when given as monotherapy.

Based on the data obtained from Study BFR113220, co-administration of repeat dosing of trametinib and dabrafenib  resulted  in  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  trametinib  or  dabrafenib  C max  and  AUC  with increases of 16 and 23 %, respectively.  A small decrease in trametinib bioavailability, corresponding to a decrease in AUC of 12 %, was estimated when trametinib is administered in combination with dabrafenib, a CYP3A4 inducer, using a population PK analysis. Therefore, administration of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of trametinib or of dabrafenib relative to administration of either compound alone.

With dabrafenib and trametinib given in combination at a 150 mg BID and 2 mg OD dose, there was no apparent relationship between PFS and dabrafenib or trametinib exposure but there was a noted increase in responses with higher exposure to trametinib.

When trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib, concurrent administration of strong inhibitors or strong  inducers  of  CYP3A4  or  CYP2C8  should  be  avoided  (see  section  4.4 and  4.5  of  dabrafenib  and trametinib SmPC).

An increase in the proportion of subjects experiencing pyrexia was noted with administration of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib, compared to administration of dabrafenib as monotherapy.  Incidence of pyrexia tended to be higher with higher trametinib exposure when administered in combination. Although rate of pyrexia was not related to dabrafenib concentrations, a trend toward higher rates of pyrexia was noted with higher hydroxy -dabrafenib concentrations upon combining dabrafenib 150 mg and trametinib

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2 mg. Pyrexia is a known important identified risk with dabrafenib which is already addressed in the RMP and monitored through routine minimisation measures.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The data provided is considered sufficient to characterise the PK and PD of an application for  the extension of indication for the combination therapy of trametinib with dabrafenib.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

The  clinical efficacy for  the  combination  of  trametinib  and  dabrafenib  treatment  in  unresectable  and metastatic  melanoma patients  in  melanoma  patients  with  tumours  harbouring  BRAFV600  mutation  was supported  by  the  submission  of  an  update  to  the  phase  II  study  BRF113220  and  by  the  two  phase  III studies, MEK115306 which evaluated the treatment of dabrafenib in combination trametinib vs dabrafenib in  untreated  melanoma  patients  and  study  MEK116513,  which  evaluated  the  treatment  of  dabrafenib  in combination trametinib vs vemurafenib in untreated melanoma patients with BRAFV600 tumours. Headline  results  for  study  MEK115306  have  been  evaluated  in  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  for trametinib.

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

## 2.4.2. Dose response study BRF113220 on the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib

Study BRF113220 was performed to determine the optimal dosage of trametinib when applied n combination with dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive stage IIIc or IV melanoma.

## Study participants

- Key inclusion criteria included the following:
- ≥18 years of age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Histologically  confirmed  cutaneous  melanoma  that  is  either  Stage  IIIC  (unresectable)  or  Stage  IV (metastatic), and determined to be BRAF V600E/K mutation -posi ve using the bioMerieux Investigational Use Only (IUO) THxID BRAF Assay (In vestigational Device Exemption [IDE]: G120011).  The  assay  will  be  conducted  by  a  central  reference  laboratory.  Subjects  with  ocular  or mucosal melanoma are not eligible
- Measurable disease (i.e., present with at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST, version 1.1).
- All prior anti- cancer treatment -related toxicities (except alopecia  and  laboratory  values )  must  be ≤Grade  1  according  to  the  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events,  version  4  (CTCAE version 4.0; [NCI, 2009]) at the time of randomization.
- Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to randomization  and  agree  to  use  effective  contraception  throughout  the  treatment  period,  and  for  4 months after the last dose of study treatment.

Key exclusion criteria included the following:

- Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (including but not limited to dabrafenib, vemurafenib, LGX818, and  XL281/BMS-908662)  or  a  MEK  inhibitor  (including  but  not  limited  to  trametinib,  AZD6244,  and RDEA119).
- Prior systemic anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, vaccine therapy, or investigational treatment) for Stage IIIC (unresectable) or Stage IV (metastatic) melanoma.

## Treatments

Dabrafenib and trametinib were administered orally at the recommended doses of 150 mg twice daily and 2 mg once daily, respectively. Subjects in the combination therapy arm received both active agents, while subjects  in  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  received  dabrafenib  at  the  recommended  dose  of  150  mg twice daily with a placebo.

Patients  were  to  be  treated  until  disease  progression,  unacceptable  toxicity  or  patient  refusal.  Up  to  2 dose  reductions  due  to  toxicity  were  allowed.  Of  note,  after  protocol amendments  1,  4  and  6,  patients experiencing disease progression were allowed to continue treatment beyond progression at discretion of investigator if they had achieved an objective (partial or complete) response. Cross -over from the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dabrafenib + placebo arm to the combination arm was not allowed.

## Objectives

Primary:

To establish the superiority of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy over dabrafenib placebo (dabrafenib monotherapy) with respect to progression -free survival (PFS) for subject s with advanced/metastatic BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma.

Secondary:

The secondary objectives of this study were:

- To compare dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy with dabrafenib monotherapy for overall survival (OS) (key secondary), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response
- To characterize  the  safety  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  combination  therapy,  including  incidences  of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and other proliferative cutaneous lesions; and
- To  characterize  th e  concentrations  of  trametinib  and  of  dabrafenib  and  its  metabolites  in  subjects  in the combination arm and of dabrafenib and its metabolites in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  endpoint  was  Progression-Free  Survival (PFS) defined  as the  time  from  randomisation  until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause.

Secondary endpoints were as follows:

- Overall survival (OS) as defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.
- Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] at any time per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid [RECIST], version 1.1.

Tumours

- Duration  of  response  was  defined  as  the  time  from  first  documented  evidence  of  CR  or  PR  until disease progression or death due to any cause among subjects who achieve an overall response.
- Safety  as  measured  by  clinical  assessments  including  vital  signs  and  physical  examinations,  12 -lead electrocardiograms  (ECG),  echocardiogram  (ECHO),  chemistry  and  haematology  laboratory  values, incidence of squamous cell carcinoma, and adverse events (AEs).

dabrafenib

- Concentrations of trametinib and of dabrafenib and its metabolites (GSK2285403, GSK2298683, and GSK2167542) in the combination arm and dabrafenib and its metabolites in the monotherapy arm.

Exploratory endpoints were as follows:

- Changes  from  baseline  in  HRQOL  measures  assessed  using  the  European  Organisation  for  Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D).

of

- Apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F), volume of distribution (V/F), and the effect combination therapy on CL/F, exposure -response with tumour size, and other clinical/safety measures, as warranted.

and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Tumour DNA, RNA, and protein content, other tumour tissue aberrations, clinical outcome, and tumor response.
- BRAF mutations in cfDNA, tumour tissue mutations, other mutations in circulating cfDNA and tumour response.
- Genetic variants, safet y measures (as listed under secondary endpoints), frequency of modifications and/ or interruptions, and tumour response.

## Sample size

The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 70% increase in PFS (i.e., HR: 0.5889, median PFS of 5.3 and 9 months in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm and the combination therapy respectively). Assuming one-sided overall alpha of 0.025, power of 90%, and a randomization ratio of 1:1 a total of 155 events (progression or deaths) were estimated to be required. Ac cording to the statistical plan  (SAP),  with  155  events  it  would  have  been  possible  to  detect  an  improvement  as  low  as  37.7% (HR=0.726 which equates to median PFS of 7.3 and 5.3 months, respectively) with significance.  At  the  time  of  the  final  P FS  analysis  an  interim  OS  was  planned.  According  to  the  SAP, patients were to be followed for survival until 70% of the total enrolled population died or lost to follow -up. Given a projected recruitment of 18 subjects per month over the first 6 months, and 75 subjects per month thereafter resulting in enrolment duration of approximately 9 months, 340 patients were originally planned.

dose arm,

statistic

According to the Applicant due to 24% over -enrolment (423 patients instead of the planned 340), it was decided to perform the final  PFS  analysis  after  193 events  (instead  of  the  originally  planned  155)  which represents the same  percentage  (45.6%)  of  total enrolment  as originally planned. This  change  was expected to increase the overall power from 90% to 95%.

## Randomisation

A total of 423 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either dabrafenib 150 mg BID plus trametinib 2 mg  QD  or  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID  plus  placebo  dabrafenib.  Randomis ation was  stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (&gt; the upper limit of normal (ULN) versus ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E vs V600K).

## Blinding (masking)

The study was designed as a double-blinded study.

## Statistical methods

Time to event-endpoints were analysed using Kaplan -Meier methods, the stratified log -rank test and the Pike  estimator  for  the  hazard  ratio  and  its  confidence  interval  were  used.  A  stepwise  Cox  regression explored  for  PFS  the  influence  of 1.  Prior  immunotherapy  (Yes  vs.  No),  2.  Baseline  ECOG  performance status (0 vs. 1), 3. Stage at Screening (III, IVM1a, IVM1b vs. IVM1c), 4. Visceral Disease at Baseline (yes vs.  no), 5. Number of disease sites at baseline (&lt;3 vs. ≥3), 6. Gender (Male vs. Female), and 7. Age (continuous).

- Censoring rules were as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Death between adequate assessment visits                                    | Date of death                                                                               | Progressed |
| Death or progression after more than two or more missed visits              | Date of last 'adequate' assessment of response2 prior to missed assessments                 | Censored   |

2 An adequate assessment is defined as an assessment where the ivestigator determined response is CR, PR, or SD.

3 If PD and New anti-cancer therapy occur on the same day assume the progression was documented first. e.g. outcome is progression and the date is the date of the assessment of progression). If anti-cancer therapy is started prior to any adequate assessments, censoring date should be the date of randomization.

- Sensitivity  analyses included:  symptomatic  progression  as  events,  considering  start  of  new  an ticancer therapy as an event, considering radiological progression after extended loss to follow -up or start of new anti-cancer therapy as an event, and stratified Cox regression analysis.
- Over-enrolment was expected to induce more censorings and therefor e  bias  in  the  estimation  of the  median  in  the  combination  arm  if  the  original  timing  (155  events  out  of  340  patients,  so  at 45.6% of total sample size) was kept.  Therefore the timing was changed proportionally to 45.6% of 423, so 193 events.

Key secondary endpoints: OS.

ORR was per investigator and were tabulated based on the number and percentage of subjects attaining an overall confirmed CR  or PR  in subjects with measurable  disease at baseline. Subjects with  non -evaluable best response were imputed as non-responders.

QLQ-C30 and EQ5D were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measurements.

Multiplicity: OS was tested hierarchically after PFS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recruitment

A total of 423 patients were enrolled at 103 centres in 14 countries, including Germany (25 centres), the US (12 centres), and the UK (10 centres ) as well as Argentina, Australia, Canada, Spain, France, Greece, Italy,  Netherlands,  Russian  Federation,  Sweden  and  Ukraine).    Patients  were  included  from  February 2012 and the data cut-off for this study was 12 January 2015.

## Conduct of the study

An external independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) monitored the conduct of the periodically  assessed  safety  information,  and  also  reviewed  efficacy  data  of  the  interim  analyses.  The original MEK115306 Protocol, date 08 February 2012, was amended 8 times. The lates t amendment was at  12  August  2014.  The  purpose  of  this  amendment  was  to  increase  the  time  to  study  closure  to  obtain longer-term survival  data;  provide  drug- specific  instruction  in  cases  where  a  dose  is  missed;  update  list of concomitant medications; modify and/or clary dose modification guidelines for LVEF, hypertension, QTc prolongation, hand -food skin reactions, cuSCC, pyrexia, renal insufficiency, visual changes, pneumonitis; add guidelines for new primary melanoma, non -cutaneous malignancies, pancr eatitis, hyperglycaemia,  and  retinal  pigment  epithelia  detachment;  remove  blood  sample  collection  for  cytokine analysis  during  a  pyrexic  event;  clarify  treatment  of  study  treatment  overdose  regarding  haemodialysis; add a descriptive analysis of PFS, DoR and ORR at the final analysis; add final OS analysis, based on US FDA feedback, to be performed at 220 events rather than 275 and descriptive OS update at 275 events; add  text  to  allow  eligible  patients  to  crossover  to  combination  therapy  if  a  statistically significant  and clinically meaningful OS benefit is observed at the final OS analysis.

## Secondary Endpoints

## Overall Survival

With the final OS analysis a statistically significant reduction in risk of death for the combination therapy arm  compared  with  the dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  was  reported  (HR  0.71,  95%  CI:  0.55,  0.92; p=0.011).  The  medi an  OS  was  25.1  months  for  the  combination  therapy  arm  and  18.7  months  for  the dabrafenib monotherapy arm.

## Ancillary analyses

Analysis including Symptomatic Progressions: PFS  is  analyzed  the  same  as  the  primary endpoint with the addition that symptomatic progressions are also considered as events.

Considering start of new anti-cancer therapy as an event: PFS is analyzed the same as the primary endpoint  with  the  addition  that  the  start  of  new  anticancer therapy  is  considered  as  an  event,  even  if radiological progression was not documented.

Analysis ignoring extended loss to follow up and start of new anti-cancer therapy: Progression (based  only  on  radiologic  evidence)  or  death  is  considered  an  event  regardless  of whether  it  occurred after extended  lost to follow -up or initiation of a new  anticancer therapy. If a subject has neither progressed nor died, then PFS is censored at the date of the last 'adequate' assessment.

Study MEK116513: A Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the combination of the BRAF  inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK  inhibitor trametinib to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in subjects with unresectable (stage  IIIc)  or  metastatic  (stage  IV)  BRAF  V600E/K  mutation  positive cutaneous melanoma

## Methods

## Study participants

The  MEK116513  study  population  included  with  histologically  confirmed  cutaneous  melanoma  that  was either  Stage  IIIC  (unresectable)  or  Stage  IV  (metastatic)  and  who  were  determined  to  be  V600E  or V600K mutation positive.

Key inclusion criteria were:

- ≥18 years of age
- Histologically  confirmed,  stage  III  unresectable  (Stage  IIIC)  or  metastatic  (Stage  IV)  cutaneous melanoma, which is also determined to be BRAF V600E/K mutation -positive, using the bio Merieux  investigational  use  only  (IUO)  THxID  BRAF  Assay .  The  assay  was  tested  in  a  central reference laboratory. Patients with ocular or mucosal melanoma were not eligible.

## Treatments

Patients  were  randomized  to  receive  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID  plus  trametinib  2  mg  daily  or  vemuraf enib 960 mg BID.

Patients received study treatment until disease progression, death or unacceptable AE, hematologic or other non-hematologic toxicity, and/or meeting stopping criteria for liver chemistry.

including as

Furthermore,  patients  received  full  supportive  care  during  the  study,  including  transfusion  of  blood  and blood products and treatment with antibiotics, antiemetics, anti diarrhoeals and analgesics, appropriate. Use of anticoagulants such as warfarin was permitted provided that international  normalized ratio (INR was monitored in accordance with local institutional practice.

## Objectives

The primary objective of study MEK116513 was to establish the superiority of dabrafenib and trametinib combination  therapy  over  vemurafenib  monotherapy  with  respect  to  overall  survival  (OS)  for  patients with advanced/metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma.

The secondary objectives were to compare dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy vemurafenib monotherapy for the following:

- Progression-free survival (PFS)
- Overall response rate (ORR)

with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Duration of response

Furthermore a secondary objective was to characterize the safety of dabrafenib and combination therapy, including incidences of squamous  cell carcinoma (SCC) and other proliferative cutaneous lesions.

trametinib

An exploratory objective was to evaluate and compare changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients in the dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy arm with those in the vemurafenib monotherapy arm.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint of MEK116513 was Overall Survival, defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.

Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  PFS  as  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  until  the  earliest date  of  disease  progression  by  investigator  per  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  In  Solid  Tumors  v1.1  or death due  to any cause; ORR  as  defined as the percentage  of subjects with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any time per RECI ST v1.1; Duration of response as defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause among  subjects  who  achieved  an  overall  response  (i.e.,  confirmed  CR  or  PR);    ORR  defined  as    the percentage of patients with a confirmed CR or PR at any time  and Duration of response defined as the time  from  first  documented  evidence  of  CR  or  PR  until  disease  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause among patients who achieved an overall response (i.e., confirmed CR or PR).

Disease progression and response evaluation were determined according to the definitions established in RECIST, version 1.1.  At baseline, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis or MRI of  the  abdomen/pelvis  and  any  area  of  kn own  disease,  skin  lesion  photography,  and  clinical  disease assessment for palpable lesions were performed.  If clinically indicated a CT or MRI scan of affected bone areas was required at baseline. Lesions, if present, continued to be followed consistently throughout the study until disease progression, death or withdrawal of consent.

At each post-baseline assessment (Week 8 and every 8 week thereafter through Week 56 and then every 12  weeks  thereafter),  evaluation  of  the  sites  of  disease  identified  by  thes e  scans  and/or  by  medical photography or direct measurement was required.  If the last radiographic assessment was more than 8 weeks  prior  to  study  withdrawal  and  progressive  disease  (PD)  had  not  been  documented,  a  disease assessment was obtained at the time of withdrawal.

disease

All patients who permanently discontinued dabrafenib + trametinib or vemurafenib without progression  continued  to  radiographic  disease  assessment  according  to  the  study  protocol  until  disease progression,  death  or  withdrawal  of  consent,  whichever  was  documented  first.  In  addition,  all  patients who permanently  discontinued  study  treatment  were  followed  for  survival  and  new  anticancer  therapy. Follow-up continued until study completion/withdrawal or death, whichever occurred first.

Other  secondary  endpoints  included,  safety  measurement  by  assessment  of  AEs,  clinical  assessment including  vital  signs  and  physical  examination,  ocular  examination,  12 -lead  electrocardiograms  (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), chemistry and hematology laboratory values.

Health-related  quality  of  life  measures  were  assessed  by  the  European  Organization  for  Research  and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30, the EuroQol-5D and the melanoma subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Melanoma.

## Sample size

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Under the assumptions that PFS was exponentially distributed, 1:1 randomization, 0.05 type I error, the study needed 288 deaths in the final analysis to detect a HR= 0.675 with 90% power (median OS times of 13.5 and 20 months in the vemurafenib arm and the combination therapy arm, respectively). Given an accrual  rate  of  18  subjects  per  month  over  the  first  6  months,  and  75  subjects  per  month  thereafter resulting in enrollment duration of approximately 13 months, an estimated total of 694 subjects (i.e., 347 subjects in each of the arms) would need to be enrolled.

## Randomisation

Before randomization eligible patients were stratified by LDH (above ULN vs. equal to or below ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K).  Patients with bot h V600E and V600K mutations were included in the V600K count for the stratification.

Patients were centrally randomized (randomized phase) through the Registration and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS) (Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]) in a 1:1 ratio  to  receive  either dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy or vemurafenib monotherapy.

## Blinding (masking)

This study was designed as an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Overall  survival  was  summarized  using  the  Kaplan -Meier  method,  and  su rvival  curves  were  compared between  treatment  arms  using  a  stratified  log -rank  test  stratifying  for  BRAF  mutation  status  (V600E versus V600K) and baseline LDH (&gt;ULN versus ≤ULN).

The statistical methods were the same as in study 115306 with the following alterations:

- OS (instead of PFS) was primary; no multiplicity for secondary endpoints (such as PFS, ORR)
- interim  analysis  OS  at  70%  of  required  events  (i.e.,  202  of  the  288  events  for  the  final  OS analysis) with Lan and DeMets version of the O'Brien -Fleming alpha -spending function for efficacy and a Rho beta-spending function (Rho = 3) for futility:
- a 70% of expected events: α =0.007 (one-sided)
- stop for efficacy if one-sided p-value &lt;0.0074 (HR&lt;0.6992):
- stop for futility if one-sided p-value &gt;0.1733 (HR&gt;0.8710)
- b 100% of expected events: α=0.025 (one-sided)
- claim success if one-sided p-value &lt;0.0228 (HR=0.7822)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conduct of the study

The  original  study  protocol  dated  15  March  2012  was  amended  4  times.    The  main  changes  to  the protocol were as follows:

- Amendment 01: included new requirements for subjects that remained on study treatment after radiographic disease progression, required treatment interruption for any treatment -related AE of grade 3, required that rash of grade  ≥3 must resolve to grade ≤1 before study treatment could resume, enhanced monitoring for ophthalmic toxicities and some additional changes to eligibility criteria and clarification to the protocol in relation to safety
- Amendment 03: changes to the protocol included revision of table for dose modifications for LVEF decrease, monitoring guidelines for new cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies and revisions to clarify the guidance on the management of patients and ADRs during the study.
- Amendment 04: revision to the management and dose modification guidelines for particular ADRs and added new guideline for pancreatitis and hyperglycaemia.

The  study  was  stopped  early  as the adjusted stopping boundary  for efficacy at the interim (p&lt;0.0214) was crossed and the study was stopped for efficacy by the IDMC.

a.   Subjects may have received more than 1 type of anti-cancer therapy.

## Numbers analysed

All  704  randomized  patients  were  included  in  the  ITT  population.  The  majority  of  patients  (89%)  had BRAF  V600E  mutation -positive  melanoma.  BRAF  V600E  and  BRAF  V600K  mutation -positive  populations are  subsets  of  the  ITT  population.  These  subsets  do  not  include  the  6  patients with both  V600E  and V600K, or the 1 patient with wild type BRAF.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint: Overall survival

The  results  for  OS  are  presented  in  Table  20.  Median  OS  has  not  been  reached  in  the  combination therapy  arm  and  was  17.2  months  in the  vemurafenib  monotherapy  arm  with  a  HR  of  0.69  (95%  CI: 0.53, 0.89; p=0.005).

The  median  follow -up time  (defined as time  from  randomization  to  death  or  last  contact)  was  11.0 months in the combination therapy arm and 10.0 months in the vemurafenib monotherapy arm.

- Considering start of new anti-cancer therapy as an event
- Considering radiological progression after extended loss to follow -up and start of new anti -cancer therapy as an event
- Cox regression proportional hazards regression model
- Using derived responses from investigator lesion assessments.

Results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the result observed for the overall ITT analysis.

## Progression Free Survival

The  Kaplan -Meier  curves  for  PFS  representing  the  combination  arms  for  study  MEK115306  and  study MEK116513 are presented in Figure 18.  The median PFS for the combination arms was approximately 11 months.

The  median  for  the  combination  therapy  arm  of  MEK115306  with  additional  duration  of  follow -up  and additional events was consistent with that of Study MEK116513 (11.0 months and 11.4 respectively).

## Supportive study(ies)

The  study BRF113220 is was  an open-label 4  part  study  designed  to  assess  the  saf ety,  clinical  efficacy, and pharmacokinetic activity of combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib.  Part B of this study evaluated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  escalating  doses  of  dabrafenib  (75  and  15 0  mg  twice  daily)  and trametinib  (1,  1.5,  and  2  mg  once  daily)  and  26  patients  had  a  prior  BRAFi  therapy.  Part  C was  a randomized,  three-arm  portion  of  the  study  where  patie nts  were  assigned  at  a  ratio  of 1:1:1 to  receive dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily as monotherapy or in combination with either trametinib 1mg once daily or 2mg once daily; 45 patients were randomized to dabrafenib monotherapy and subsequently crossed over to the combination therapy.

BRF113220 Part C was considered a supportive study for the proposed indication for the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib. Data on response rate and PFS have been previously presented pharmacology section as well as the dose response section. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has  demonstrated  limited  efficacy  in  patients  who  have  progres sed  after  a  prior  BRAFi  monotherapy  in study BRF113220.

The efficacy of combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib for patients previously  treated with a BRAFi alone before enrolment (BRAFi -resistant portion of part B) and for  those who received dabrafenib monotherapy in this study who then crossed over to  combination therapy at disease progression (crossover portion of part C) were assessed.

disease

The efficacy of combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib for patients previously  treated with a BRAF inhibitor alone  before  enrolment  (BRAFi -resis tant  portion  of  part  B)  and  for  those  who  received dabrafenib monotherapy in this tudy who then crossed over to combination therapy at progression (cross-over portion of part C) were assessed.

Patients from Part B had a confirmed response rate of 15% (4/26) and in Part C the patients who crossed over after progression on dabrafenib monotherapy had a confirmed response rate of 13% (6/45). M edian progression free survival was 3.6 months for both parts (Part B 95% CI 2-5 m and Part C 95% CI 2-4m).

There were  22  patients receiving dabrafenib monotherapy  for  &lt;6  months  and  23  patients receiving dabrafenib from ≥ 6 months.

Patients that had been treated with dabrafenib monotherapy for ≥ 6 months prior to developing progressive  disease,   had  a  better  clinical  outcome  with  the  combination  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib where response rate of 26% with a median PFS of 3.9 months (95% CI, 3-7m) for patients treated longer than  6  months compared  to response  rate  of  0%  and  median  PFS  of  1.8  months  (95%  CI,  24m) for patients who rapidly progressed in less than 6 months on their prior dabrafenib monotherapy.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The  MEK115306  study  was  a  randomized  controlled  phase  III  study.  Progression  free  survival  was  the primary  efficacy  endpoint  whereas  OS  was  a  secondary  endpoint.  The  design  and  conduct  of  the  study were considered acceptable. The CHMP noted that there was an over-enrolment of almost a quarter of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

planned study size. To assess  whether the  key results were  possibly impacted  because  of the over enrolment,  the MAH  provided an analysis  on  the  original  sample  size  (i.e.,  a  PFS -analysis  timed  at  the 155 PFS event of the first 340 recruited patients ) and the data confirmed the statistically significant PFS benefit  of  combination  therapy  when  compared  with  monotherapy  BRAF  inhibitor  in  the  original  dataset as planned in the SAP.

The MEK116513 study was an open -label randomize d Phase III study comparing dabrafenib and trametinib  combination  therapy  with  vemurafenib  monotherapy.  The  primary  endpoint  of  this  study  was OS  and  no cross over was  allowed following discontinuation. Only 12 patients of the vemurafenib monotherapy arm and 5 of the patients in the combination arm discontinued treatment upon decision of the  patient,  suggesting  that  the  open  label  design  did  not introduce  a  bias  to  the  study  results .    Other systemic  therapies  were  only  allowed  after  study  treatment  discontinuation.    The  design  and  conduct  of the study were considered acceptable.

The  patient  population  included  in  the  MEK115306  study  and  the  MEK116513  study were  comparable. The demographic characteristics and baseline  characteristics for  the treatment  arm  in  study  M EK115306 and in study MEK116513 were reasonably balanced, with the exception of a higher occurrence of visceral disease  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  compared  with  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm  in  the  study MEK115306 and more patients with &gt;3 sites in the combination arm compared with the vemurafenib arm in the study MEK116513. However, these imbalances did not affect the reliability of the study results. The stratification  factors  of  LDH ≤ ULN  versus  LDH&gt;ULN  and  V600E  versus  V600K,  the treatment  arms  were considered balanced.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses MEK115306

In the updated PFS analysis submitted with the application, 71.2% of the events for the PFS analysis (by investigator) had occurred. The HR= 0.67 (95% CI 0.53, 0.84; p&lt;0.001) was  in favour of the combination therapy with a median PFS of 11.0 months compared with 8.8 months for the monotherapy dabrafenib.

In  the  final  OS  analysis,  47%  of  the  patients  in  the  combination  arm  had  died  whereas  58%  of  the patients  in  dabrafenib  monothe rapy  arm  had  died.  For  the  whole  study  population,  52.4%  of  the  death events  had occurred  and  thus  the  OS  data  could be  considered  reasonably  mature.    The  Kaplan -Meier curves for overall survival separated between the 2 and 3 months and remained separate until 24 months of follow up. The median  OS  for the combination therapy was  25.1 months  and  for  monotherapy dabrafenib was 18.7 months with a HR of 0.71, (95% CI: 0.55, 0.92, p=0.011). The difference in OS of 6.4 months for the combination therapy was statistically significant and is considered clinically relevant.

The reported overall response rate (ORR; CR and PR) for the combination arm was higher than the ORR for the monotherapy arm (69% vs 53%, respectively) , suggesting a higher anti-tumour activity with the combination treatment.

## MEK116513

At the time of data lock  point, the median time of follow up was above 10 months. The Kaplan -Meier OS curves separated early in the 3 to 4 month range and remained separate throughout the time of median follow-up.  The  median  OS  was  18.0 months  for  vemurafenib  and  was  25.6  months for  the  combination treatment  with  an  estimate  HR=0.6 6 (95%  CI:  0.53,  0.81 ;  p&lt;0.001)  which was  statistically  significant. The updated OS analysis for Study MEK116513 was based on 349 (50%) of  events, which is very similar to the final  OS  analysis for Study  MEK115306,  which  was  based  on  222  events  (52%). The  median  PFS for the combination therapy was 11.4 months compared to 7.3 months for monotherapy with a HR=0.56 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.69; p&lt;0.001) that was statistically significant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The OS data for the combination therapy dabrafenib and trametinib obtained in studies MEK115306 and MEK116513 were comparable to each other. The OS results of the phase II study BRF113220 part C were supportive  and  sho wed  a  slightly  shorter  survival  for  patients  treated  with  dabrafenib  and  trametinib combination therapy.

The PFS results were consistent with the positive OS results for the combination therapy, which are less susceptible for performance and assessment bias than PFS results.

The ORR was higher for the combination arm than for the monotherapy arms for both studies MEK116513 study and study BRF113220 Part C (MEK116513; 64% vs 51% and BRF113220 76% respectively) suggesting a higher anti-tumour activity with the combination treatment.

vs

The QoL assessment shows for both phase III studies, at least until disease progression, a better health related  quality  of  life  for  patients  treated  with  dabrafenib+trametinib  than  for  patients  treated  with  a BRAF inhibitor monotherapy.

## Subgroup analyses

No PFS or OS subgroup analysis was conducted for patients with a history of brain metastasis.  Due to the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria of the studies, fewer than 20 patients with a history of metastases were treated in the clinical trials.  Therefore the efficacy of combination therapy for patients with a history of brain metastasis in not known and a statement in the SmPC in section 4.4 and 5.1 has been  included  to  inform  the  prescriber  of  the  lack  of  data in  this  patient  population.    In  addition,  the effect  of  the  combination  therapy  in  melanoma patients  with  brain  metastasis  will  be  evaluated  in  study BRF117277,  a  phase  II  open  label  study  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  in  subjects  with  BRAF  mutation positive melanoma that has metastasised to the brain.

brain study

have

The  CHMP  noted  that  in  the  two  phase  III  studies  only  patients  with  BRAF  V600  mutation  tumours who were  treatment  naïve  were  included.  The  efficacy  of  combination  therapy  as  second  line  therapy  for patients who had been treated with BRAF inhibitors was not investigated. In the phase II BRF113220, responses with the combination treatment were seen only in a limited percentage of patients (around  10%)  who  were  previously  treated  with  dabrafenib  monotherapy .  Response  to  the  combination therapy  was  observed  in  patients  who  had  achieved  relative  longlasting  (&gt;6  months)  response  during treatment with dabrafenib monotherapy. Because of the lack of robust data in patients that progressed on BRAF inhibitor therapy, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC highlighting that there is limited data in this patient population and recommending prescribers to consider other treatment options before treatment with the combination in patients that have h ad prior treatment with BRAF inhibitors.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The results of the two phase III studies for dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy were generally consistent with each other and the results of the Phase II study BRF11 3220 part C were supportive. The benefits  of  dabrafenib  and  trametinib  combination  therapy  in  patients  with  advanced  melanoma  with BRAFV600 mutation were considered statistically significant and clinically  relevant  in  terms  of  prolonged OS,  PFS  and  increas ed  response  rates.    The  updated  results  from  study  MEK115306  and  MEK116513 provided reassurance of the durability of the OS in the treated patient population.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

54%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety data include comparisons of combination dabrafenib+trametinib treatment to dabrafenib monotherapy in the Phase III Study MEK115306, and comparisons of combination dabrafenib+trametinib treatment to vemurafenib monotherapy in the Phase III Study MEK116513.

Data cut-off dates for the studies were as follows:

- MEK115306 (COMBI-d): 12 January 2015 (final overall survival [OS] analysis)
- MEK116513 (COMBI-v): 17 April 2014 (primary analysis)

The  safety  results  of  the  phase  II  study  BRF113220  Part  C  are  considered  as  supportive  to  the  results obtained in the phase III studies and have been described in the initial marketing application for Mekinist.

The median times on study treatment were similar for the combination arms in both studies, and longer than for  the  respective  monotherapy  arms.  At  the time  of the  data -cut-off  almost  half  of  the  patients  in MEK115306  and 25%  of patients in the MEK116513 study had received more than 12 months combination therapy.

## Adverse events

Almost  all  patients  in  all  treatment  arms  in  both  studies  experienced  an  AE,  and  more  than  85%  of patients had an AE considered related to study treatment.

AEs leading to a dose modification (dose discontinuations, reductions or interruptions) were common in the combination therapy arm compared with the dabrafenib monotherapy arm in MEK115306.

AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  occurred  in  1113%  of  patients  in the combination treatment, which was comparable to what was  seen in the comparator arms of vemurafenib treatment (12%) but higher than for the dabrafenib arm, 7%.

AEs leading to dose reduction were reported for 28- 33% of patients on the combination treatment, which was lower than for the comparator vemurafenib arm (39%) but higher than for the dabrafenib arm, 14%.

Any  SAE  was  reported  for  3742%  of  patients  on  the  combination  arm s,  which  was  roughly  similar  to what was noted for both comparator arms (vemurafenib arm, 35% and dabrafenib arm, 37%).

Fatal  SAEs  were  uncommon  for  all  treatment  arms  (&lt;1% -2%  in  the  combination  arm s  and  &lt;1%  in patients on the comparator arms).

AEs  that were  more  commonly  reported  in  the  combination  arms  in general vs the dabrafenib  arm included  pyrexia,  nausea,  chills,  diarrhoea,  v omiting,  hypertension,  oedema  peripheral,  dizziness,  ALT increased,  AST  increased,  urinary  tract  infection,  neutropenia and muscle  spasms  and  blood  creatinine increased. In contrast, AEs that were less commonly reported were alopecia, palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia and terms related to hyperproliferative states of the skin.

AEs  that  were  more  commonly  reported  in  the  combination  arms  in  general  vs  the  vemurafenib  arm included pyrexia, chills, vomiting, cough, neutropenia and muscle spasms. In contrast,  the AEs that were less commonly reported were rash, decreased appetite, pruritus, alopecia, -plantar  palmar erythrodysaesthesia, terms related to hyperproliferative states of the skin, dysgeusia, weight decreased, blood creatinine increased, photosensitivity reaction, conjunctivitis and sunburn.

of

Approximately half of the patients in the combination therapy arms in both studies had pyrexia that was considered related to study treatment which was 2 to 3 times higher incidence than either monotherapy  arms. The next most common AEs (≥20%) considered related to study treatment in the combination arms of both studies were chills, fatigue, and nausea (Table 30).

The  most  common  AEs  reported  in  the  combination  therapy  group  in  study  BRF113220  Part  C  were pyrexia, chills, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and the incidences of these AEs the combination  therapy  group  were  higher  than  the  incidences  in  the  dabrafenib monotherapy  group. Among the 5 most common AEs in the dabrafenib monotherapy group (fatigue, rash,  arthralgia, alopecia and  headache), the incidence of alopecia  was  higher  (&gt;10%) than the  incidence in the combination therapy group.

and

The  list  of  grade  3  and  4  events  in  the  combination  arm s compared  with  dabrafenib  or  vemurafenib  is presented in Table 31. Grade 3 events occurred in the combination therapy arms in 40% of the patients in study MEK115306  and approximately onehalf of the patients in study MEK116513. Pyrexia hypertension  were  the  most  common  Grade  3  events  in  the  combination  therapy  arms  of  both  studies. Grade 4 events occurred in 5% of the patients in the combination therapy arms of both studies.

Grade 4 events were reported for 5%, 4% and 7% of patients treated with the combination treatment in both  studies ,  dabrafenib  and  vemurafenib  arm  respectively.  Thus,  grade  4  events  were  slightly  more commonly reported  for  vemurafenib  than  for  the  other  treatments  and  dominated  by  hepatic  laboratory events.

(9%), with

events

Grade  3  events  were  reported  for  4048%  of  subjects  in  the  combination arms,  46%  in  the  dabrafenib arm,  and  57%  in  the  vemurafenib  arm.  The  preferred  terms  ( PTs) reported  in ≥ 5%  of  subjects in  at least 1   study arm were pyrexia (4 -7%), hypertension (614%) and neutropenia (35%) for the combination  treatment  compared  to  hypertension  (6%),  basal  cell  carcinoma  (6%)  and  squamous  cell carcinoma of skin (5%) for the dabrafenib monotherapy arm, and rash (9%), hypertension squamous cell carcinoma (9%), squamous cell carcinoma of skin (5%) and keratoacanthoma (9%) for the vemurafenib arm. Thus, grade 3 events were more commonly reported for patients treated vemurafenib. Monotherapy with either dabrafenib or vemurafenib was associated with more related to hyperproliferative states of the skin than combined BRAF and MEK inhibition therapy.

In  the  combination  therapy  group  in  study  BRF113220  Part  C,  neutropenia  was  the  most  frequently reported Grade ≥3 AE. In the dabrafenib monotherapy group, the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 AEs were SCC (cutaneous) and fatigue.

Table 32 summarises the adverse events for which it was considered that there is sufficient  e vidence to suggest a causal relationship with the administration of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

SAEs including  protocol  specified  events  occurred  in  approximately  40%  of  patients  in  the  combination therapy  arms  of  both  studies. The  incidence  of  SAEs (35-42%)  and  SAEs  considered  related  to the investigational  product  by  the  investigator  (25-30%) were  similar  across  all  4  treatment  arms  for  both studies.

Pyrexia was  the most  common  SAE  in  the  combination therapy arms, followed by ejection decreased and chills for both studies.

a. Events were reported under either preferred term, both denote squamous cell cancer occurring in the skin

## Deaths

Fewer  patients  died  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  compared  with  the  respective  monotherapy  arm  in both studies. The primary cause of death in all treatment arms was disease under study, and most of the deaths occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

No patients in the combination therapy or vemurafenib arms had fatal SAEs that were considered related to study treatment by the investigator, the 1 fatal SAE in the dabrafenib arm was considered related by the investigator.

a. A subject in Study MEK115306 was initially reported as having a cerebrovascular accident, which was identified as cerebral haemorrhage as the admission CT scan and on later autopsy b. this event has been updated to 'unknown' post data cut-off

- c. a subject in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm of MEK115306 had an SAE of bile duct adenocarcinoma that was considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment; this event was corrected to a fatal SAE post data cut-off

4

In study BRF113220 Part C, four fatal SAEs were reported for the combination therapy arm (vs 0 in the dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm): 2 patients with intracranial  haem orrhage (in 1 patient with grade thrombocytopenia  and  1  patient  likely  on  post  pulmonary  embolism  treatment),  1  with  cerebrovascular accident, and 1 with pulmonary embolism.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

Adverse events of special interest and additi onal events of interest include events that are either known class  effects,  were  identified  preclinically  or  in  prior  clinical  studies,  or  are  potentially  life  threatening. The AEs of special interest are presented in Table 35.

Adverse events of special interest and additional events of interest in both treatment arms in MEK115306 and MEK116513 were primarily Grades 1 and 2 with the exception of malignancies and PE/DVT.

The AEs of special interest and additional events of interest with the highest inciden ce of Grade 3 events (defined as ≥5% difference to  the  monotherapy  arm)  in  the  combination  arm  of  either  or  both  studies were hypertension, pyrexia, hepatic events and neutropenia. In study MEK115306, the incidence of Grade 3 events for pyrexia and hepatic events were higher (≥5% difference) in the combination arm than in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. In study MEK116513, pyrexia, hypertension and neutropenia reported more frequently in the combination arm than in the vemurafenib monotherapy arm.

c. includes a subject who upon subsequent clinical review was identified as having carcinoma in situ of skin

Pyrexia was the most common AE reported for the combination treatment. Median time to onset for the first  occurrence  was  29 -38  days  with  a  med ian  duration  of  3  days;  the  event  occurred  at ≥ 3  events  in 22-33% of subjects on the combination arm vs 2-7% of the monotherapy BRAF inhibitor arms. No grade 4  event  was  reported  but  1114%  of  patients  on  the combination  were  hospitalised  due  to  pyrexia, compared to 5% for dabrafenib monotherapy and 1% for vemurafenib.

Median  time  to  onset  for  the  first  occurrence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was  139-223 days with combination treatment vs 60-63 days with the monotherapy BRAF inhibitor arms. The incidence of  Grade  3  events  was  higher  (≥5%  difference)  for  cuSCC  in  the  dabrafenib  arm  compared  with  the combination  therapy  arm  in  MEK115306.  In  MEK116513  the  incidences  of  Grade  3  events  were  higher (≥5%  difference)  for  cuSCC  and  skin-related toxicities in  the vemurafenib arm compared with the combination therapy arm.

New primary  melanoma was  reported  in  2%  of  patients  in  the  monotherapy  arms  vs ≤ 1%  in  the combination population.

Other  treatment-emergent  malignancies were reported in 3% of patients on the monotherapy dabrafenib arm vs ≤ 1-1% of patients on the other arms with median time to onset of 239 -330 days for the combination, 160 days for dabrafenib  monotherapy and 88 days for vemurafenib. In to tal, 1 patient on combination treatment was discontinued from therapy due to the event.

Bleeding events were  more  commonly  reported  on  dabrafenibcontaining  regimens; combination  1819%,  monotherapy  dabrafenib 15% and 7% for vemurafenib with epistaxis grade &lt;3 being the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

predominant PT for all dabrafenib-containing arms. Grade 3 events were reported for 1-2% of patients on combination treatment.  Median  time  to  onset  of  1st  event  was  94  days  for  the combination.  Of  note,  3 fatal  events  were  reported  for  the combination in  each  of  the  MEK115306  and MEK116513  studies, all intracranial  haemorrhage,  vs  none  in  the monotherapy  treatment  arms.  For  5  of  the  6  fatal  cases  of intracranial  haemorrhage  there  were  confounding  factors  including  the  use  of  anticoagulant  therapy  (2 subjects), presence of brain metastases (2 subjects), and cerebral haemorrhage after a fall in a setting of grade 3 thrombocytopenia (1 subject).

Cardiac-related events ,  all  due  to  EF  decreased  or  LV  dysfunction/cardiac  failure,  were  more  common in the dabrafenib-containing treatment arms (5-8%) than in the vemurafenib arm (&lt;1%) but no grade 4 event  occurred.  Median  time  to  first  occurrence  was  88-1 57  days  for  the  combination  and  123  days  for dabrafenib monotherapy with a duration of first occurrence of  24-27 days and 43 days, respectively. One or  both  study  treatments  were  withdrawn  due  to  cardi c-related events  for ≤ 3%  of  subjects  in  the combination therapy arms and for &lt;1% in the dabrafenib arm. Regarding EF, higher fractions of patients on  the  combination  than  on  dabrafenib  monotherapy  met  dose  interruption  criteria  (EF  decrease  &gt;10% from baseline and below the institutional LLN), 5-7% vs 2%.

Hypertension was  more  common  on  combination  treatment  (26 -27%)  and  vemurafenib  (26)  than  on dabrafenib  (17%)  with  grade  3  events  occurring  in  614%  of  patients  on  combination  treatment;  no grade  4  event  was  reported  for  dabrafenibcontaining  therapy.  Median  time  to  onset  of  first  occurrence was  56-58  days for the combination, with a median  duration of 27-29  days; ≥ 3 occurrences were reported for 3%  of patients; no treatment discontinuation due to the event was reported for the combination therapy arms or the dabrafenib monotherapy arm.

Ocular events were  reported  at  similar  frequencies  for  all  study  arms,  1113%,  with  grade  3  events occurring  in  up  to  1% in  the  combination  and  vemurafenib  arms ;  no  grade  4  events  were  reported; discontinuation of study treatment was reported for &lt;1% of patients.

Six  patients (1%), whereof 1 grade 3, in the combination therapy arms, 1 patient (&lt;1%) in vemurafenib arm, and no patients in the dabrafenib arm had pneumonitis events reported.

the

Skin-related  toxicities ,  mainly  rash,  were  more  common  in  the  vemurafenib  arm  (77%;  grade  3  in 16%) than in the combination arms (45-48%; grade 3 in &lt;1- 2%) and the dabrafenib monotherapy arm (53%; grade 3 in 2%). Study treatment discontinuation due to the event was noted in the vemurafenib arm, 1%.

Diarrhoea was more common in the vemurafenib arm (38%) and the trametinibcontaining study arms (30-32%)  than  in  the  dabrafenib monotherapy  arm  (16%).  With  combination  treatment,  the  median duration  of  the  first  event  was  3  d ays  and ≥ 3  events  were  recorded  in  35%  of  t hese  patients;  dose reduction was reported for up to 1% of patients.

Regarding hepatic  events , GGT was not routinely collected in the MEK115306 study, most likely contributing  to  the  higher  incidence  of  hepatic  events  noted  in  the MEK116513  study.  Grade  3  events were reported for 79% of patients on combination treatment, 1% of patients on dabrafenib monotherapy, and 10% of patients on the vemurafenib arm; the corresponding figures for grade 4 events were 0-&lt;1%, &lt;1% and 2%. Study treatment was discontinued due to the event in up to 2% of patients on combination treatment, and dose reduction noted in up to 4% of patients. None of the 6 patients with concurrent specified increases of ALT and bilirubin on combination treatment fulfilled Hy ' s law vs 3/12 in the vemurafenib arm. Out of 10 patients on combination  treatment that developed ALT ≥ 8x ULN (stopping criterion) 3 were negatively re-challenged.

No patient on combination treatment discontinued treatment due to hypersensitivity .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Oedema was more common with combination treatment (18-25%; grade 3 &lt;1- 1%; median time to 1st occurrence 113-130 days, median duration of 1st occurrence 37  29days) than with dabrafenib monotherapy (11%)  or  vemurafenib  (13%).  Discontinuation due  to  the  event  and  dose  reduction  were reported in &lt;1% of patients on combination treatment.

Neutropenia was more common with combination treatment (14%; grade 3 in 4- 7%; grade 4 in &lt;1%; median  time  to  1st  occurrence  50153  days,  median  duration  of  1st occurrence  19-27  days)  than  with dabrafenib  monotherapy  (4%)  or  vemurafenib  (3%).  Treatment  discontinuation  due  to  the  event  was reported for 1 patient on combination therapy, dose reduction for up to3% and dose interruption for up to 7%.

Pancreatitis was reported for 3 patients (&lt;1%) on combination treatment whereof 1 of grade 4; no dose adjustments were required.

PE and DVT were reported in 2-3% of patients on combination treatment (grade 3 in 1-2%; grade 4 in 1 patient;  median  time  to  1st  occurrence  169280  days,  median  duration  of  1st  occurrence  2931  days), higher  than  noted  for  the  monotherapy  arms  (&lt;1%).  While  dose  interruption  due  to  the  event  was reported for 3 patients on combination treatment, no patient had the dose reduced or discontinued study treatment.

Renal insufficiency was  reported  in  4- 7%  of  patients  on  combination  treatment  (grade  3  in  &lt;1- 1%; grade 4 in 1 patient; median time to 1st occurrence 108- 147 days, median duration of 1st occurrence 4 16 days) and 2% for patients on the dabrafenib  arm, lower than noted for the vemurafenib arm (12%). Four patients on combination therapy discontinued treatment due to the event.

For  the  combination  therapy,  AE  of QTc prolongation was  reported  in  no  patient  in  the MEK115306 study and in 5 patients in the  MEK116513 study,  whereof  4  with  an  increase  to ≥ 501 msec including 2 that  also  had  an  increase  &gt;60  msec  from  baseline  that  subsequently  resolved .  QTc  prolongation  was reported for 5 patients in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm and 12 patients in the vemurafenib arm.

## Laboratory findings Clinical chemistry assessments

In MEK115306, a higher percentage of subjects in the combination therapy arm had 'any increases in hypoalbuminemia (53%, with 1% grade 3, vs 27%), hypokalemia (13%, with 2% grade 3, vs 10%) and hyponatremia (24%, with 6% grade 3, vs 14%) than in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. For the combination arm 1 grade 4 event was reported, hyperglycaemia.

grade'

In MEK116513, a higher percentage of subjects in the combination therapy arm had 'any grade' changes from baseline in hypoalbuminemia (45%, with &lt;1% grade 3, vs 15%) and hypophosphatemia (39%, with 7%  grade  3  and  1  grade  4  event,  vs  23%)  than  in  the  vemurafenib  monotherapy  arm,  and  a  lower percentage  of  subjects  had  'any  grade'  change  from  baseline  in  creatinine  in  the  combination  therapy arm compared with vemurafenib monotherapy (12% vs 35%). For the combination arm 6 grade 4 events were reported; creatinine increase (n=1), hyperglycaemia (3), hyponatremia (1), and hypophosphatemia (1).

## Haematology assessments

In MEK115306, the percentage of patients with increases of any grade and to Grade 3 neutropenia from baseline was  higher in the combination therapy arm  than  in  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  arm.  The percentage of patients with increases to Grade 3 or Grade 4 in haemoglobin, lymphocyte decreased, platelets, and leukocytes from baseline were similar between the treatment arms.

## Gender

The incidence of the most common AEs in the combination therapy arms were generally similar between male and female patients, with the exception of nausea, vomiting, rash, arthralgia, and cough which were more common (≥5% difference) in female patients compared with male patients for both studies, and hypertension, which was more common (≥5% difference) in male patients compared with female patients for both studies.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The MAH did not submit studies related to drug-drug interactions (see safety discussion).

Administration of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination had no clinically relevant fect  ef on the exposure of trametinib or of dabrafenib monotherapy (see pharmacology section).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

The incidence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment was higher combination  therapy  arm  compare d  with  the  dabrafenib  arm  for  MEK115306  of  study.  The  proportions were similar for the treatment arms in MEK116513.

in

AEs leading to discontinuation in ≥1% of the patients were pyrexia and ejection fraction decrease in the combination therapy arms, ejection fraction decrease in the dabrafenib arm, and arthraligia, increased, and aspartate aminotransferease (AST) increased in the vemurafenib arm.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The  safety of trametinib in combination  with  dabrafenib  has  been  evaluated  in  2  Phase  III  studies, MEK115306 and MEK116513,  where an analysis of the  safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib was conducted in 209 and 350 patients, respectively, with BRAF V600 mutation positive unresectable or  metastatic  melanoma receiving  trametinib (2  mg QD) and  dabrafenib (150  mg BID) combination  therapy  (see  section  5.1  combination  therapy).  The  most  common  adverse  reactions  seen for  combination  therapy  in  both  studies  at ≥ 20 %  include  pyrexia,  fatigue,  nausea,  chills,  diarrhoea, cough, headache, hypertension, rash, vomiting and arthralgia. In study MEK115306 an additional adverse reaction seen at ≥ 20 % includes oedema peripheral. The safety of the combination therapy as  reported for the phase III studies are supported by the safety results of the combination therapy obtained with the phase II study BRF113220 part C. S ee section 4.8 of the SmPC for the full list of ADRs and description of selected ADRs.

vs

Some ADRs were found to be less frequent in the combination therapy compared to monotherapies. For study  MEK115306,  the  most  common  AEs  that  occurred  more  often  in  the  dabrafenib  arm  than  in  the combination therapy arm, were hyperkeratosis (35% vs 7%) and arthralgia (31% respectively),  alopecia,  PPES  (hand -foot  syndrome),  palmoplantar  keratoderma  and  skin  pa pilloma.   In MEK116513,  arthralgia,  r ash  and  alopecia  occurred  in  ≥30%  of  the  patients  in  the  vemurafenib  arm compared  to  the  combination  therapy  arm  ( 51%  vs  24%, 43%  vs  22%  and  39%  vs  6%,  respectively) and  skin  papilloma,  PPES,  hyperkeratosis,  keratosis  pilaris,  pruritus,  dry  skin,  photosensitivity  reaction, sunburn and  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cutaneous)  were  also  reported  more  often  in  the  monotherapy arm  than in  the  combination  therapy  arm.  The  majority  of the  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cutaneous) events resolved following excision without dose modification or withdrawal of study drug.

26

In  addition,  grade  3  and  4  events  occurred  in  similar  proportions  of  patients in both  treatment  arms  in MEK115306 (40% vs 46%; 5% vs 4%, respectively ). In both MEK115306 and MEK116513 pyrexia (7%, 4%  respectively) and  hypertension (6%,  14%  respectively) were among the  most  commonly  reported grade 3 events for patients treated with combination therapy.  However, the incidence of grade 3 events for squamous cell carcinoma (cutaneous) in both studies, and rash and keratoacanthoma in MEK116513, was lower for combination therapy in comparison to monotherapy BRAF.

with with

Pyrexia was the most common SAE in the combination arms in both phase III studies (14 -17%) but was not  fatal,  and  most  events  resolved  without  dose  changes,  around 35%  of  the  patients  had  a  dose interruption and in 14% of the patients dosage was reduced because of pyrexia  (see section 4.2 for dose reduction  recommendations).   When trametinib is  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  and  the patient's temperature  is  ≥ 38.5 o C  please  refer  to  the  dabrafenib  SmPC  (section  4.2)  for  dose  modifications  for dabrafenib.  No  dose  modification  of  trametinib  is  required  when  taken  in  combination  with  dabrafenib. Fever has been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in combination dabrafenib  (see  section  4.8).  The  incidence  and  severity  of  pyrexia  are  increased  with  the  combination therapy (see dabrafenib SmPC sectio n 4.4). In patients receiving trametinib in combination dabrafenib,  pyrexia  may  be  accompanied  by  severe rigors,  dehydration,  and  hypotension  which  in  some cases can lead to acute renal insufficiency.

was

Another commonly  reported SAE  for patients treated with combination therapy in both studies  was ejection fraction decrease (4 -7%).  Trametinib has been reported to decrease LVEF, when used as monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  (see  section 4.8).  In  clinical  trials,  the  median  time  to onset of the first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac failure and LVEF decrease between  2  and  5 months.  No  dose  modification  of  dabrafenib  is  required  when  trametinib  is  taken  in combination with dabrafenib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If  during  treatment  the  QTc  exceeds  500 msec, please  refer  to  the  dabrafenib  SmPC  (section  4.2)  for dose modifications for dabrafenib. No dose modification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib. If during treatment the QTc exceeds 500 msec, please refer to dabrafenib SmPC section 4.4.

the

Also, in the phase II study BRF113220 Part C two (incidence of 4%) fatal intracranial haemorrhages were reported. Like in the intracranial haemorrhage events in the phase III studies, also in these cases of fatal SAEs in the BRF113220 study they were not considered drug- related, however the phase II study was an open label study which might bias the determination of drug -related AEs  Haemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events and fatal haemorrhages, have occurred in patients taking trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8). The majority of bleeding events were mild. Fatal intracranial haemorrhages have occurred for trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in 1% (3/209) of patients in study MEK115306 and in &lt;1% (3/350) of patients in study MEK116513.  In these clinical  studies,  the  median  time  to  onset  of  the  first  occurrence  of  haemorrhagic  events  was 94 days in both studies for the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib. The pot ential for these events in patients with  unstable  and/or  symptomatic  brain  metastases  not  established  as  patients  with  these  conditions were  excluded  from  clinical  trials.  The  risk  of  haemorrhage  may  be  increased  with  concomitant  use  of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. If haemorrhage  occurs,  patients  should  be  treated as clinically indicated. Haemorrhagic events are currently included as an identified risk for the combination therapy in the RMP and will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. In addition,  the risks of haemorrhagic events will be monitored through additional pharmacovigilance activities where the results of study BRF115532  (COMBI-AD),  a  randomised  double  blind  study  of  dabrafenib  in  combination  with  trametinib versus two placebos in the adjuvant treatment of high risk BRAFV600 mutation positive melanoma after surgical resection will provide further longterm safety and study BRF117277, a phase II open label study of dabrafenib and trametinib in subjects with BRAF mutation positive  melanoma that has metastasised to the brain. Both studies will focus on safety of patients with haemorrhagic events (see RMP).

Elevations  in  blood  pressure  have  been  reported  in  association  with  trametinib  as  monotherapy  and  in combination with dabrafenib, in patients with or without pre -existing hypertension (see SmPC section 4.8). In  addition,  safety  in  patients    with  treatment  refractory  hypertension  defined  as  a  blood pressure of systolic  &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg which cannot be controlled antihypertensive  therapy  were  excluded  from  study  MEK115306  and  have been included  in  the  RMP  as missing information related to trametinib. This will be monitored through routine risk minimisation measures.

Pulmonary  embolism  or  deep  vein  thrombosis  has  been  identified  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  potential risk that can occur when trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib. If patients d evelop symptoms  of  pulmonary  embolism  or  deep  vein  thrombosis  such  as  shortness  of  breath,  chest  pain,  or arm or leg swelling, they should immediately seek medical care. Permanently discontinue trametinib and dabrafenib for life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

Pulmonary embolism and DVT will be monitored through routine risk minimisation measures.

In the phase III studies MEK115306 (n=209) and MEK116513 (n=350) with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma,  56 patients  (27 %)  and 77 patients  (22%)  respectively  were  ≥ 65 years  of  age;  11  patients  (5  %)  and  21  patients  (6%) respectively were ≥ 75 years of age. The proportion of patients experiencing AEs was similar in those aged  &lt; 65 years  and  those  aged  ≥ 65 years  in  both  studies.  Patients ≥ 65 years  were  more  likely  to experience SAEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of medicinal product, dose reduction and dose interruption than those &lt; 65 years.

Neutropenia and related events was found to be more common with combination treatment (14%) and in some patients more severe (grade 3 in 4-7%; grade 4 in 0-&lt;1%) than compared with dabrafenib (4%) or by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vemurafenib (3%) monotherapy. Therefore, neutropenia has been included as an important identified risk for combination therapy in the RMP and will be monitored through routine risk minimisation measures.

New malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when trametinib is used  in combination with dabrafenib.

Cases  of  cuSCC  (including  keratoacanthoma)  have  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  trametinib  in combination with dabrafenib. Cases of cuSCC can be managed with excision and do not require treatment modification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4).

New  primary  melanoma  was  reported  in  patients  receiving  trametinib  in  combination  with  dabrafenib. Cases of new primary melanoma can be man aged with excision and do not require treatment modification. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4).

Based on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may increase the risk of non -cutaneous malignancies when RAS mutations  are  present.  When  trametinib  is  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib please  refer  to  the dabrafenib  SmPC (section 4.4). No dose modification of trametinib is required for RAS mutation positive malignancies when taken in combination with dabrafenib. Consider the benefits and risks bef ore continuing treatment with dabrafenib in patients with a  non -cutaneous malignancy that has a RAS mutation.

Dose  modifications  are  not  recommended  for  adverse  reactions  of  cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinoma (cuSCC) or new primary melanoma  (see dabrafenib SmPC for further details). If treatment related toxicities  occur  when  trametinib  is  used  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  then  both  treatments  should  be simultaneously dose reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions, where dose modifications are necessary  for  only  one  of  the  two  treatments,  are  detailed  below  for  pyrexia,  uveitis,  RAS  mutation positive non cutaneous malignancies and QT prolongation (primarily related to dabrafenib), ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), retinal pigment  epithelial detachment (RPED) and interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (primarily related to trametinib).

left

The risks of non -cutaneous malignancies will be monitored through additional  pharmacovigilance activity where  the  r esults  of  study  BRF115532  (COMBI -AD),  a  randomised  double  blind  study  of  dabrafenib  in combination with trametinib versus two placebos in the adjuvant treatment of high risk BRAFV600 mutation  positive  melanoma  after  surgical  resection  will  provide  further longterm  safety data with  focus on non-cutaneous malignancies.

No  dose  modifications  are  required  for  uveitis  as  long  as  effective  local  therapies can  control  ocular inflammation.  If  uveitis  does  not  respond  to  local  ocular  therapy,  withhold  dabrafenib  until  resolution  of ocular  inflammation  and  then  restart  dabrafenib  reduced  by  one  dose  level.  No  dose  modification  of trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.4).

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED):

In patients who are diagnosed with RVO, treatment with trametinib, whether given as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, should be permanently discontinued. No dose modification of dabrafenib is required when trametinib is taken in combination with dabrafenib.

If  uveitis  is  diagnosed,  please  refer  to  dabrafenib  SmPC section 4.4. In patients who are diagnosed with RVO, treatment with trametinib should be permanently discontinued. No dose modification of dabrafenib is  require d  when  taken  in  combination  with  trametinib  following  diagnosis  of  RVO  or  RPED. No  dose modification  of  trametinib  is  required  when  taken  in  combination  with  dabrafenib  following  diagnosis  of uveitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Disorders  associated  with  visual  disturbance,  including RPED  and  RVO,  may  occur  with  trametinib  as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib. In clincial trials uveitis and iridocyclitis have also been reported in patients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib.

No  dose  modification  of  dabrafenib  is  required  when  trametinib  is  taken  in  combination  with  dabrafenib for cases of ILD or pneumonitis.

In  a  Phase  III  trial,  2.4 %  (5/211)  of  patients  treated  with  trametinib  monotherapy  developed  ILD  or pneumonitis;  all  five  patients  required  hospitalisation.  The  median  time  to  first  presentation  of  ILD  or pneumonitis was 160  days (range: 60 to 172 days). In studies  MEK115306  and  MEK116513 &lt; 1 % (2/209) and 1% (4/350), respectively, of pati ents treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib developed pneumonitis or ILD (see section 4.8). If trametinib is being used in combination with dabrafenib then therapy with dabrafenib may be continued at the same dose.

Trametinib  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  hepatic  imp airment  when administered as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib.

Hepatic adverse events have  been  reported in clinical trials with trametinib as  monotherapy  and  in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8).

Rash has been observed in about 60  % of patients in trametinib monotherapy  studies and in about 25% of patients in trametinib and dabrafenib combination studies MEK115306 and MEK116513 section 4.8).

Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib (see section 4.8) and has been included in the RMP as an important identified Rhabdomyolysis will be monitored through routine risk minimisation measures.

(see risk

Renal  failure  has  been  identified  in  patients  treated  with  trametinib in  combination  with  dabrafenib  in clinical studies. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4).

Pancreatitis has  been  reported  in patients treated with trametinib in combination  with  dabrafenib  in clinical studies. Please refer to the dabrafenib SmPC (section 4.4).

In non- clinical studies, the monotherapies have been shown to have developmental toxicity teratogenic effects. In addition, the u se of dabrafenib may render hormonal contraceptives less effective and  therefore  an  alternative  method  of  contraception,  such  as  barrier  methods,  should  be  used  when trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC f or further information. Effects on spermatogenesis have been observed in animals given dabrafenib. Male patients taking trametinib in combination with dabrafenib should be informed of the potential risk for spermatogenesis, which may be irreversible. Refer to the dabrafenib SmPC for further information.

and impaired

The percentage of patients treated with combination therapy who discontinued treatment due to AEs was 11%  in  the  MEK115306  and  13%  in  the  MEK116513  study  suggesting  that  the  combination  therapy  is well tolerated.  Recommendations on treatment adjustments and man agement of ADRs that require dose reduction,  treatment  interruption  or  treatment  discontinuation,  are  included  in  the  SmPC  section  4,2 (Table 1 and 2.

In clinical trials with the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib 11 patients reported trametinib overdose (4mg); no SAEs were reported.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The  safety  data  submitted  do  not  show any  serious unexpected  adverse  reactions  with  the  combination treatment dabrafenib/trametinib compared with dabrafenib and/or vemurafenib. The ADRs were in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

general  comparable to  monotherapy,  althoug h  slightly  higher  than  the  adverse  events  observed  for  the MEK and BRAF inhibitors in monotherapy and were manageable either through dose interruption or dose reduction. The  greatest differences in incidences were  seen  for pyrexia  and  chills,  which  were  mo re frequently  reported  for  patients  treated  with  dabrafenib and trametinib  combination  therapy  than  with dabrafenib  or  vemurafenib  monotherapy.  In  contrast  the  incidence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cuSCC) and  keratoacanthoma  was  lower  in  the  combination  therapy  arm  than  in  the  monotherapy  arm  of  both studies. The risk of and actual occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma is an important additive burden for patients.  Therefore a decrease of the incidence of this AE is considered an advantage of the combinatio n therapy.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted RMPs.

## Overall comment

The proposed risk minimisation measures for both trametinib or dabrafenib monoterapy combination therapy remain sufficient to minimise the risks of the products in the proposed indication.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient grou ps on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

- As the MEKINIST PL from initial MAA contained language for the co- administration of both trametinib and dabrafenib when the readability testing was conducted and was found to be acceptable, there is no further consultation with target patient groups is required for the PL included.
- The  TAFINLAR  PL  was  approved  with  initial  MAA  on  26th  August  2013.  The  information  proposed  in the  PL  submitted  with  this  variation  contain  minimal  changes,  maintaining  the  currently  approved layout and format and is not considered to require further consultation with target patient groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The study MEK115306 showed a PFS with a HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.53, 0.84; p&lt;0.001) and a prolongation of  median  PFS  of  2.2  months  (11.0  months  for  the  combination  therapy  arm  and  8.8  months  for  the monotherapy arm).  The updated OS results also showed a statistically significant diference with a HR = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.92, p=0.011) for OS in favour of the combination therapy. The PFS and OS results and

the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  considered  clinical  relevant.  Subgroup  analysis  and  sensitivity  analysis  (OS  and  PFS  analysis  with Cox  model  accounting  for significant prognostic factor like ECOG  score,  visceral disease,  number  of disease  sites  and  gender)  demonstrated consistent  results  in  the  ITT  population. The  robustness  of  the data was supported by the study MEK116513, which showed similar results (see clinical discussion).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

In  both  phase  III  studies,  patients who  did  not  receive  previous  treatment  for  metastatic  disease  were included in  the  study  population .  Phase  II  study  BRF113220  included  a  low  num ber  of  patients  who  had progressive  disease  on  dabrafenib  monotherapy.    Of  these  patients  (cross  over  population)  around  10% showed responses on combination therapy after they had progressive disease with monotherapy.   It was  noted  that  the  efficacy  observed  in  pretreated  patients with  BRAF  inhibitors was lower  than  in  naïve  patients  who  had  not  received  prior  BRAF  inhibitor  therapy.  Therefore,  the  CHMP considered  that  the  efficacy  data  for  combination  therapy  in  patients  that  progressed  on  prior  BRAF inhibitor monotherapy was too limited to draw any conclusion . However, it is acknowledged that patients may still  derive  some  benefit  from  the  combination  therapy.  Therefore,  the  indication  was  not  restricted but a warning statement on the lower eff icacy in this patient population has been included in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

dabrafenib

It  is  uncertain  which  sequencing  of  treatment  may  be  best  for  melanoma  patients  a s  new   emerging treatments for melanoma (eg immunotherapies) have been recently been approved that may change the landscape of treatment strategies and clinical paradigms in the management of melanoma patients. Thus, a  statement  has  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  to  advise  prescribers  that  other  treatment options  could  be  considered  before  treatment  with  the  combination  in  this  prior  BRAF  inhibitor  treated population  and  that  sequencing  of  treatments  following  progression  on  a  BRAF  inhibitor  therapy  has  not been established.

Patients  with  brain  metastases  were  not  included  in  the studies  MEK115306  and  MEK116513  and  no further  data  is  available.  There  is  a  study  ongoing  which  will  examine  the  efficacy  of  the  combination therapy  in  patients  with  active  brain  metastases  (COMBI -MB)  and  this  has  been  included  as  a  post -authorisation  commitment  in  the  RMP.  The  SmPC  has  been  updated  to  include  a  warning  in  section  4.4 and information on the lack of patients with brain metastases in section 5.1.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Pyrexia  was  the  most  common  AE  in  the  combination  therapy  arms  and  this  adverse  event  occurred  in approximately one half of the patients receiving combination therapy in both studies.

non

Nausea, chills and diarrhoea also occurred in ≥30% of the patients in the combination therapy arm of both MEK115306 and MEK116513 with comparable incidences.  ADRs that required special warning in the SmPC  were new malignancies (cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, new primary melanoma, -cutaneous  malignancies),  haemorrhage,   LVEF  reduction/left  ventricular  dysfunction,  pyrexia,  deep  vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), hypertension, visual impairment, rash, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure,  pancreatitis,  QT  prolongation  and  hepatic  events.  These  ADRs  are  managed  through  appropriate recommendations in the SmPC and monitored with routine risk minimisation measures.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (cuSCC) was reported more frequently in the  BRAF inhibitor monotherapy arms than in the combination therapy arms (4 -10%  for dabrafenib monotherapy and vemurafenib  monotherapy  vs  &lt;1%  for  the  combination  therapy).    The  incidence  of  Grade  3  events  for rash, squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) and keratoacanthoma was  also lower in the combination therapy arms  in comparison  to  monotherapy  arms  (rash  0 -15  vs  2 -13%,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  1  vs  5 -10%, keratoacanthoma  1  vs  2 -9%).  The  majority  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (cutaneous)  events  resolved

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

following excision without dose modification or withdrawal of study drug.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Six  patients  in  the  phase  III  studies  treated  with  combination  therapy  died  due  to  bleeding  events  and two  cases  (4%)  were  also  reported  in  the  phase  II  study  BRF113220  Part  C. Although  none  of  these events  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigator ,  the  contribution  of  trametinib and/or dabrafenib to haemorrhages could not be ruled out. Therefore, haemorrhagic events are included in the RMP as identified risks and management of these events will be performed recommendations in the SmPC and monitoring through routine risk minimisation measures.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The prognosis of patients with advanced  melanoma  is still poor, in spite of recently  approved  new therapies. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in the treatm ent  of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation has demonstrated clinical benefit in a patient  population  with  a  high  unmet  need.  The  results  for  OS  and  PFS  were  statistically  significant  and clinically relevant. This is supported by ORR and DoR data.

Overall,  combination  treatment is  associated  with  a  higher  incidence  of ADRs,  including  grade  3  events . However, the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment is considered acceptable manageable. In addition,  the percentage of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) keratoacanthoma seemed to be lower than that observed with monotherapy treatment. The risk and the actual occurrence of cuSCC is an important additive burden for patients. Therefore the decreased incidence of such squamous cell carcinoma is considered a benefit of the combination therapy.

## Benefit-risk balance

The CHMP considers that the benefits of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation outweigh the risks. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit risk balance is positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The combination of trametinib and dabrafenib is supported by non -clinical and clinical data where blocking the MAPK kinase pathway at two separate levels is expected to improve efficacy. The strength of the  evidence has  been shown in  the  two  pivotal  studies  MEK115306  and  MEK116513  where  a  clinically relevant improvement in PFS and OS has been demonstrated. Both studies included patients who had not been  previously  treated  with  BRAF  inhibitors.  For  patients  who  were  treated  with  a  BRAF  inhibitor  as monotherapy  (dabrafenib  or  vemurafenib),  only  limited  efficacy  data  exist  and  the  respon se  rates  in patients who had progressed after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor was lower than for patients that were previously untreated. Taking into account that in clinical practice, a proportion of patients will have been previously treated with other BRAF or MEK inhibitors, the CHMP highlighted that the combination treatment may not provide the same clinical benefit in those patients as what has been observed in the clinical  trials  which  enrolled  naïve  patients  not  previously  treated  with  MAPK  kinase  pathway  inhibitors and that clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in this patient population. Nevertheless, the indication was  not  restricted  as  it  was  considered  that  patients  previously  treated  with  BRAF  inhibitors  could  still derive some benefit from the combination therapy.

New therapeutic options have been approved recently for melanoma , some targeting the immune system instead  of  the  melanoma  cancer  cells.  Immunotherapeutic  agents  such  as  ipilimumab,  pembrolizumab and nivolumab are not thought to interfere with the RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK signalling pathway and with the BRAF mutation status. However, based on the current data and information available, no recommendation can be given over the sequencing of therapies.

The safety and tolerability of the combination therapy appears to be manageable and there were no new unexpected ADRs observed in the safety database during the conduct of the two pivotal studies.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  variation  acceptable  and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                          | Type       | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of approved one | an Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension  of  indication  to  add  a  new  therapeutic  indication  for  the  use  in  combination  of  trametinib  and dabrafenib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  with  a  BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. An updated RMP was also provided.

The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## · Periodic Safety Update Reports

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product accordance  with  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  list  of  Union  reference  dates  (EURD  list)  )  provided  for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## · Risk management plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the same time.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever  the  risk  management  system  is  modified,  especially  as  the  result  of  new  information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Additional risk minimisation measures

The  PRAC  considers  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  will  be  necessary  for  the  safe  and effective use of the medicinal products. The CHMP endorsed this advice.

## · Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

No conditions are necessary.

## Market exclusivity

Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  data  submitted  by  the  MAH,  taking  into  account  the  provisions  of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication for both Mekinist and Tafinlar brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision  for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension  of  indication  to  add  a  new  therapeutic  indication  for  the  use  in  combination  of  trametinib  and dabrafenib  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma  with  a  BRAF V600  mutation (see  sections  4.4  and  5.1).  As  a  consequence,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.5,  4.6,  4.8,  5.1, 5.3  of  the  SmPC  are  updated.  The  Package  Leaflet  was  updated  accordingly.  Furthermore,  an  updated Mekinist (trametinib) RMP version 11.1 and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) RMP version 7.1 was approved as part of the application.
