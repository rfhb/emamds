## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

Tracleer (bosentan) is an endothelin receptor (ETA and ETB) antagonist and thus competes with the binding  of  ET-1  and  other  ET  peptides  to  both  ETA  and  ETB  receptors.  Bosentan  decreases  both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance resulting in increased cardiac output without increasing heart rate.

In  February  2002,  the  CPMP  recommended  the  granting  of  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the medicinal product TRACLEER 62.5 mg and 125 mg film-coated tablet. The approved indication is:

Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with grade III functional status. Efficacy has been shown in:

- primary (idiopathic and familial) PAH
- PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease.
- PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger's physiology

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied to extend the indication to reduce the number of new ischemic digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and active digital ulcer disease based on results from two pivotal studies (RAPIDS-1 and RAPIDS-2).

In addition, an update to sections 4.2 (posology and method of administration), 4.4 (special warnings and  special  precautions  for  use),  4.8  of  the  SPC  (undesirable  effects)  to  describe  the  incidences  of aminotransferase  elevation  and  haemoglobin  concentration  changes  seen  in  the  proposed  patient population  in  these  studies  and  section  5.1  (pharmacodynamic  properties)  has  been  proposed  to describe the clinical findings from the two pivotal studies.

The proposed posology is that Tracleer treatment should be initiated at a dose of 62.5mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then increased to the maintenance dose of 125mg twice daily.

## 2. Clinical aspects

## 2.1 Introduction

Systemic  sclerosis  (SSc)  is  a  multisystem  disorder  of  unknown  etiology  involving  autoimmune mechanisms,  which  contribute  to  vascular  damage,  mainly  to  small  arteries  and  arterioles,  and excessive  accumulation  of  collagen  and  other  extracellular  matrix  components  in  skin  and  internal organs.  The  disease  is  characterised  by  progressive  vascular  damage  (Raynaud's  phenomenon  and digital ulcers, hypertensive renal failure, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension) and organ fibrosis (skin thickening, pulmonary fibrosis, gastrointestinal dysmotility, myocardial fibrosis).

There are two types of skin involvement: limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis with skin thickening confined  to  the  distal  extremities  and  diffuse  cutaneous  systemic  sclerosis  with  skin  thickening involving the entire extremity frequently associated with visceral organ involvements.

Current management of SSc focuses on the organ manifestations of the disease, since no therapy has been  shown  to  improve  the  overall  course  of  SSc  in  blinded  placebo-controlled  trials.  A  common manifestation of the small-vessel vasculopathy in SSc is Raynaud's phenomenon, defined as episodic vasoconstriction of small arteries in the fingers. In some patients, ischemic ulcers develop on finger tips and in nail folds. Digital ulcers may develop together with other systemic manifestations of SSc (notably PAH and pulmonary fibrosis) or appear in patients with skin involvement only.

The MAH has performed a review of the available, published literature relating to digital ulcers (DU) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and their complications, and has in addition explored one US health  care  database  and  three  hospital  databases  from  the  US  and  Europe.  The  review  can  be summarised as follows :

Estimation  of  the  frequency  of  DU  complications  and  therapeutic  interventions  is  difficult  due  to several  limitations  inherent  to  the  nature  of  the  data  available,  but  the  consistency  in  the  range  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

estimates from the different sources of information provides some confidence in the reliability of the findings :

- -A DU infection is estimated to occur annually in between 3 to 8% of DU patients, based on reported  DU  infections  and  incidence  of  antibiotic  therapy  for  DU.  Osteomyelitis  of  a phalanx is expected to occur annually in around 0.5% of these DU patients. The annual rate of DU patients hospitalised for antibiotic therapy is estimated to be 1% for those who have persistent or recurrent DU.
- -Critical finger ischaemia is estimated to occur annually in 2 to 3% of DU patients.
- -The annual incidence of SSc patients with DU having digital gangrene is estimated to be around 2-3% overall, with a range of 1 to 6%.
- -The rate of DU patients hospitalised for their DU condition is estimated to be in the range of 5 to 10% per year. The frequency of hospital admissions is higher in SSc patients with persistent DU than in SSc patients without DU.
- -The rate of DU patients hospitalised for the prevention or treatment of DU complications with parenteral prostanoids is estimated to be about 5% per year.
- -Ten percent of DU patients may require chronic administration of opioids and dependency has been reported in up to 40% of these patients.
- -The rate of DU patients that have to undergo sympathectomy is estimated to be in the range of 0.5 to 1% per year.
- -Finger amputation may occur annually in between 0.5 and 1.5% of DU patients referred to hospital  as  in-  or  outpatients.  In  addition,  auto-amputation,  which  is  preferred  as  a conservative approach, may occur in up to 4% of DU patients every year.
- -Arthrodesis to facilitate healing of ulcers overlying inter-phalangeal joints and to prevent sepsis is required in about 0.5% of DU patients per year.
- -Additional morbidity is associated with the therapeutic means themselves, such as opioids, parenteral  prostanoids,  or  digital  sympathectomy.  Furthermore  these  strategies  do  not prevent  subsequent  digital  amputations  due  to  the  progressive  nature  of  the  obstructive vasculopathy.

In conclusion, all these complications, although affecting a low absolute number of patients within the rare disorder of SSc, contribute to serious suffering for the individual and have as their basis the DU.

A medication that can reduce the number of new DU during periods of disease activity could be of added value for the patient.

Digital  ulcers  are  painful,  slow  to  heal  (3  to  15  months),  and  can  be  complicated  by  secondary infections (superficial infection in 50% of cases, osteomyelitis in 1%). Recurring ulcers can be a major source of disability, interfering with the capacity to work and the activities of daily life that depend on hand  function.  Digital  ulcers  can  also  lead  to  the  chronic  use  of  analgesics  and  antibiotics,  and sometimes to hospitalisation and surgery (including digital amputation). Few therapies have shown an effect  on  the  evolution  of  digital  ulcers.  Results  of  studies  suggest  that  intermittent  intravenous iloprostol improves healing of digital ulcers and prevents episodes of digital ischaemia.

## 2.2. Overview of the clinical development programme

The  clinical  development  to  determine  efficacy  and  safety  of  bosentan  in  patients  with  ischaemic digital ulcers secondary to SSc consisted of two similar multicentre (Studies AC-052-401and AC-052331),  randomised  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  studies  and  were  conducted  in  a total of 312 patients.

The first study (AC-052-401/RAPIDS-1) consisted of a 16-week double-blind treatment phase (N = 122), followed by an optional 12-week open-label phase.

The primary endpoint was the number of new digital ischemic ulcers during the 16-week doubleblind treatment period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  second  study  (AC-052-331/RAPIDS-2)  consisted  of  a  24-  to  36-week  double-blind  treatment period (N = 190) and an 8 week post-treatment follow-up period.

The Co-primary endpoint is defined as total number of new digital ulcers per patient up to Week 24 and time to complete healing of the cardinal ulcer (CU) up to Week 24 in patients whose CU healing was maintained 12 weeks.

Patients  in  the  two  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  had  the  opportunity  to  continue  in following  extension  studies  of  RAPIDS-1  and  RAPIDS-2.  An  interim  report  from  the  open  label extension study AC052-333 is provided as additional information.

The table 1 below gives an overview of the therapeutic studies conducted in patients with digital ulcers secondary to systemic sclerosis.

† Two patients from one center that did not follow Good Clinical Practice regarding data recording were excluded from all analyses.

b.i.d. = twice daily, CU = cardinal ulcer, DB = double-blind phase, OL = open-label phase.

A total of 312 patients with a history of active ischemic digital ulcers secondary to SSc were enrolled in these two placebo controlled studies. Because digital ulcers associated with SSc may be precipitated by cold temperature, these studies were initiated during the coldest months of the year.

Most  patients  in  both  groups  were  female  (76.7%  and  82.0%  in  bosentan  and  placebo  groups, respectively) and Caucasian (92.0% and 84.2%, respectively), with mean ages of 50.9 and 49.8 years, respectively.

No new clinical pharmacology studies were conducted for the programme in digital ulcers.

In  addition,  no  specific  dose  finding  study  was  considered  necessary  by  the  Applicant  for  the indication of digital ulcers in patients with SSc.

The dose regimen (initial dose of 62.5 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks followed by up-titration to the target dose of 125 mg b.i.d.) proposed by the Applicant for the claimed indication is only based on benefit risk assessment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  patients.  The  safety  profile  of  bosentan,  the potential for birth defects and particularly hepatotoxicity, were not assessed for other dosage regimen in  the  proposed  indication.  Lower  bosentan  doses  may  have  been  effective  and  have  better  safety profile.

## 2.3 Study AC-052-401- RAPIDS-1

## a) Methodology-study design

The primary objective of study AC-052-401/ RAPIDS-1 was to show a preventive effect of bosentan on  the  number  of  new  ischemic  digital  ulcers  occurring  over  the  16-week  double-blind  treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

period. The study consisted of a 16-week double blind treatment phase, followed by an optional 12week open label treatment phase for patients who completed the double blind phase and could receive possible benefit from continuing in the study.

Figure 1 Study design for the double-blind treatment phase

<!-- image -->

The patient population had history of documented digital ischemic ulcers (deep denuded areas of skin at least 1 mm wide with full epidermal loss) due to systemic sclerosis within the past year. Evolving digital  ulcers,  scars  due  to  digital  ulcers,  and/or  a  history  of  gangrene/amputation  were  permitted. Efforts  were  to  be  made,  however,  not  to  include  patients  with  digital  ulcers  due  to  extrusion  of  a calcification,  particularly  for  patients  with  CREST  syndrome  defined  as  Calcinosis,  Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia (syndrome).

Eligible patients had also Raynaud's phenomenon and a diagnosis of either limited or diffuse systemic sclerosis using the American College of Rheumatology criteria (one major or two minor - see below). Patients with limited systemic sclerosis must have had Raynaud's phenomenon and at least 2 of the following: calcinosis, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, or telangiectasia.

| Major   | Proximal scleroderma         | Tightness, thickening, and non-pitting induration changes proximal to the metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joints, affecting other parts of the extremities, face, neck, or trunk.   |
|---------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minor   | Sclerodactyly                | Tightness, thickening, and non-pitting induration changes distal to metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joints, limited to fingers and toes                                             |
| Minor   | Digital pitting scar         | Depressed areas at tip of digit as a result of digital ischemia                                                                                                                                |
| Minor   | Bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis | Bilateral reticular pattern of linear or lineonodular densities that are most pronounced in basilar portions of the lungs on standard chest roentgenogram                                      |

Patients with either a history of ischaemic digital ulcers within the previous year, or with active digital ulcers at baseline were randomised, therefore they may have or may not have digital ulcer at baseline. However, almost all included patients had mainly skin manifestations of SSc .

## · Primary and secondary endpoints:

The primary endpoint was the number of new digital ischemic ulcers during the 16-week double-blind treatment period.

Patients were evaluated on an outpatient basis at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 or at premature withdrawal  and  at  optional  visits  for  patients  with  new  digital  ulcers  occurring  between  scheduled visits. Patients in the EU were also evaluated 2 weeks after dose up-titration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary endpoints are listed below:

-  Evaluations of digital ulcers:
- -Percentage of patients with new digital ulcers from baseline to week 16.
- -Time from baseline to onset of new digital ulcers.
- -Change in ulcer surface area over time.
- -Percentage  of  patients  with  complete  or  partial  healing  of  digital  ulcers  during  the  16-week study period.
- -Time from baseline to complete healing of digital ulcers.
-  Quality of life as assessed by:
- -Vascular visual analogue scale to evaluate pain and Raynauds phenomenon
- -Disability index of the scleroderma health assessment questionnaire
- -Time to failure of therapy and reasons for failure of therapy.
-  Safety and tolerability
- -clinical findings
- -vital signs
- -laboratory assessments
- -recording of adverse events

##  Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Raynaud's phenomenon

The  vascular  VAS  assessment  for  scleroderma  encompassing  the  six  VAS  of  the  Scleroderma Health  Assessment  Questionnaire  (SHAQ)  was  to  be  completed  at  each  visit  except  for  the screening  visit.  Patients  were  instructed  to  respond  to  a  question  for  each  scale  :  pain  scale, vascular scale, ulcer scale, GI scale, lung scale and scleroderma disease scale.

##  Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire

The  SHAQ was to  be  completed  at  baseline,  at  the  end  of  the  double-blind  phase  of  the  study (Week 16 or at premature withdrawal), and at the end of the open-label phase of the study. Patients were  instructed  to  rate  their  capacity  to  perform  selected  activities  of  daily  living  within  the previous 7 days. Missing values were considered missing, rather than zero, in the calculation.

## · Study treatment

During  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  patients  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  one  of  two treatments:

- -Bosentan 62.5 mg b.i.d. for the first 4 weeks, followed by up-titration to bosentan 125 mg b.i.d. for 12 weeks
- -Placebo for 16 weeks

During the open-label treatment phase, all patients were to receive bosentan 62.5 mg b.i.d. for the first 4  weeks  followed  by  bosentan  125  mg  b.i.d.  for  8  weeks  without  unblinding  treatment  during  the double-blind phase.

Down-titration  to  or  maintenance  at  62.5  mg  b.i.d.  was  available  at  any  time  for  reasons  of intolerability.

## · Statistical Methods

The sample size was estimated conservatively assuming that the between-treatment comparison would be  made  using  a  Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon  two-sample  test  under  the  assumptions  of  a  two-sided probability of 0.05, a power of 80%, and an expected distribution of patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 new digital ulcers in the bosentan and placebo groups.

The protocol and analysis plan stipulate that the primary endpoint was to be analyzed on the intent-totreat  (ITT)  population  using  a  Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon  two-sample  test  ( α =  0.05, β =  0.20,  main analysis) and using the Poisson regression with adjustment for overdispersion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  analysis  plan  for  the  double-blind  phase  included  several  changes  (protocol  amendments) described in the protocol:

1) An all-randomized population was included, and the definition of the ITT population was altered to include only those patients who had a valid post baseline assessment of new digital ulcers. A second analysis of the primary endpoint was planned using the Poisson regression.

2)  After  completion  of  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  several  alternative  analyses  of  efficacy variables to further explore the robustness of results were suggested during meetings with regulatory authorities.

It was concluded that neither the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test specified in the protocol nor the Poisson regression added in the analysis plan was the most appropriate test, given the nature of the data.  Consequently  a  post  hoc  analysis  was  performed,  data  were  additionally  analyzed  using  the permutation test with stratification  by  randomization  block,  in  order  to  address  deficiencies  in  both prespecified analyses.

This  post  hoc  analysis  could  be  acceptable  as  the  permutation  test  demonstrated  that  the  bosentan treatment effect was statistically significant as well as the Poisson regression

## 3) An additional analysis population was defined in order to appropriately analyze secondary endpoint based on digital ulcer healing.

Healing could only be assessed in patients who had digital ulcers present at baseline. In addition to parameters based on healing, all other efficacy parameters based on digital ulcers were also analyzed on this population for exploratory purposes, although this was not foreseen in the analysis plan

According to analysis plan all patients who prematurely discontinue treatment due to treatment failure as  well  as  patients  who  are  lost  to  follow  up  were  assigned  'worst  rating'.  Failure  to  treatment occurred in placebo group and analysis plan was respected

## b) Efficacy results

122 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (79 bosentan and 43 placebo) at 17 centers in Europe and North America.

Nineteen patients were prematurely discontinued from the study during the double-blind phase (13 on bosentan and 6 on placebo), most often because of an adverse event.

## · Summary of baseline information

In this study, all patients were supposed to have Raynaud's phenomenon but only 48.1% and 48.8%, respectively in bosentan and placebo groups were recorded to suffer from it at baseline.

The Raynaud's phenomenon is generally defined as episodic attacks of vasoconstriction of the small arteries  precipitated  by  cold  or  emotional  stress,  occurs  in  over  90%  of  patients  with  systemic sclerosis.

In view of the high risk population included, defined as documented digital ischemic ulcers within the past year, patients entering in the study were allowed to continue treatment with oral vasodilatating drugs  and  other  oral  medications  for  Raynaud  syndrome,  including  ACE  inhibitors  and  calcium channel blockers.

Possible  drug  treatments  for  digital  ulcers  include  oral  vasodilators  (calcium  channel  blockers, serotonin antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme  [ACE]  inhibitors and intravenous (i.v.) prostaglandins.

However, only 36.7% and 48.8% patients, respectively to bosentan and placebo had selective calcium channel blocker treatment at baseline, and only 14.0% of patients and 17.7% of bosentan group had ACE-inhibitors as previous/concomitant treatments at baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  is  no  clear  data  on  digital  ulcer  management  (topical  treatments,  surgery,  grafting,  local infection) in bosentan vs placebo group and a possible difference in DU management might represent a major bias on efficacy assessment (healing).

It is considered that the two groups are not comparable for several criteria at baseline. Several baseline data suggest milder skin involvement (as regards digital ulcers) in bosentan group as compared to placebo :

a) In both treatment groups, more patients were classified as having limited than diffuse skin disease, but limited systemic sclerosis occurred in a larger proportion of patients on bosentan than on placebo.

b) The times from diagnosis of systemic sclerosis and of digital ulcers were greater in the bosentan group than in the placebo group; 64.5(placebo) vs 98(bosentan) months. In addition, total number of digital  ulcers  per  patient,  ulcers  interference  with  daily  activity,  Raynaud  interference  with  daily activity and pain, were less important in bosentan group.

The impact of these factors on primary endpoint is addressed later in the discussion part.

Patients  to  be  included  may  have  or  may  not  have  digital  ulcer  at  base  line.  67.1%  of  patients  in bosentan group and 55.8% in the placebo had digital ulcers at baseline.

## 1) Overall ITT population (number of new digital ischemic ulcers during the 16-week) :

Overall ITT population including both patients with and without digital ulcers showed that patients on bosentan had fewer new digital ulcers than did those on placebo, means 1.4 vs 2.7, respectively, but the  difference did not reach significance in the analysis based on ranks (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.1748).

However,  using  the  Poisson  regression  with  correction  for  overdispersion,  the  treatment  difference obtained in the ITT population was statistically significant (p = 0.0083). The more general permutation test  with  stratification  by  randomization  blocks  showed that the mean number of new digital ulcers was significantly less with bosentan than with placebo (p = 0.0042).

## 2)  Subgroup population of patients with digital ulcers at baseline (number of new digital ischemic ulcers during the 16-week):

A separate analysis was performed with patients with digital ulcers at baseline. This subgroup was thought to be at greater risk  for  the  development  of  new  ulcers.  This  analysis,  patients  with  digital ulcers  at  baseline,  showed  differences  on  efficacy  results  according  to  methodologies  used  for substitution  of  missing  variables  (LOCF,  Trend  carried). The  predetermined  method  of  handling missing values assigned the 'worst' rating to patients who were discontinued due to treatment failure or were lost to follow up. For all other cases, missing values were replaced by trend carried forward, using  carry  forward  of  the  last  observed  post-baseline  value  with  correction  for  the  missing  time period.

DU = digital ulcers, ITT = intent to treat, SD = standard deviation.

The difference observed, 3.6 new ulcers in the placebo group vs 1.8 new ulcers in the bosentan group (p=0.0391;  mean  difference,1.8  new  ulcers)  is  statistically  significant  only  when  'Trend  carried forward' methodology is applied but is not statistically significant when LOCF methodology is used (1.8  new  ulcers  in  bosentan  group  vs  2.8  new  ulcer  in  placebo  group,  (p=0.135  ;  mean  difference, 1new ulcer ).

In addition, if mean numbers of ulcers at baseline for the whole population are 1.9 for bosentan group and 2.2 for placebo group (0.3 mean difference), mean number of new ulcer for patients with digital ulcers at baseline can be approximately estimated at 2.8 new ulcers for bosentan group and 3.9 for placebo group, with then a mean difference of 1.1 new ulcers.

Consequently,  the  effect  observed  with  the  subgroup  population  of  patients with  digital  ulcers  at baseline is less important and varies then not from 0.3 to 1.8 but only from 1.1 to 1.8 new ulcers.

The method for replacing missing values might have affected results particularly when missing values were replaced by \"trend carried forward\", using carry forward of the last observed post baseline value with time adjustment based on the number of new digital ulcers per unit time over the period observed. This could favour the arm in which withdrawals occur early (first month).

For 3 placebo-treated patient, and for 6 bosentan-treated patient, substituted value was \"0\" new ulcers. Four patients withdrew within first month in the bosentan arm (last assessment dated on D15, D22 and D29 (2 patients) while only one (D 29) withdrew in the placebo group and were considered as having no ulcers for the missing time period.

Even if the unbalanced 2:1 randomisation is taken into account, the difference could have favoured bosentan arm.

In conclusion, the Rapids 1 efficacy results are questionable particularly considering that groups are not comparable at baseline for several criteria and also when handling of missing data could have been in  favour  of  bosentan  group.    Moreover,  the  secondary  endpoint,  vascular  visual  analogue  scale assessment for pain, is not either convincing. Patients were instructed to mark on a continuous 15-cm scale, where 0 was none and 100 was the most severe. The visual analogue scale for pain at baseline was at 6.5 for both groups.

As secondary endpoint, pain decrease would have indicated a simple clinical benefit for the patient. the  mean difference observed respectively -1.2 in placebo group and -1.6 in bosentan group is not statistically significant and not clinically relevant and which further establish that a clinical benefit, if any, would be slight.

The company provided an additional analysis of subgroups of patients with 0, 1-3 or with 4 or more ulcers at baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No difference was observed for subgroups of patients with 0 or 1-3 ulcers at baseline independently of the methodology used. Preventive effect of bosentan seems to be of clinical interest only in a subgroup of  patients  having  more  than  4  digital  ulcers  at  baseline,  but  differences  were  observed  between bosentan  and  placebo  groups  depending  on  the  methodologies  used  for  missing  variables  (LOCF, Trend carried).

Decrease in number of new digital ulcers in patients with 4 or more ulcers at baseline were significant only when missing values were replaced using the trend carried forward method (5.1 vs 2.7, mean difference  2.4),  but  not  when  using  the  last  observed  value  carried  forward  (3.5  vs  2.7.,  mean difference 0.8) (see table above). This sub category of the subgroup population corresponds to only 15 patients with bosentan treated group and 11 patients treated with placebo.

Several concerns were raised during the assessment regarding handling of missing data, robustness of the effect and its clinical relevance. They are addressed later in the discussion section of this report.

## · Secondary endpoints

Quality  of  life  was  assessed  by  vascular  visual  analogue  scale  to  evaluate  pain  and  Raynauds phenomenon.

## Visual analogue scale for pain

As secondary endpoint, pain decrease would have indicated a simple clinical benefit for the patient. The mean difference observed, respectively -1.2 in placebo group and -1.6 in bosentan group, is not statistically significant and not clinically relevant and which further establish that a clinical benefit, if any, would be slight.

In order to assess specific effects of digital ulcers on hand functionality, a hand disability index was introduced  that  comprised  the  dressing,  hygiene,  and  grip  scores  of  the Scleroderma  Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) .

Summary  of  the  change  from  baseline  to  Week  16  in  selected  SHAQ  components  assessing  hand functionality, ITT set

| SHAQ component (mean ± SD)   | Placebo (n = 41)   | Bosentan (n = 76)   |   p-value (Mann-Whitney U-test) |
|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| Dressing and grooming        | 0.20 ± 0.81        | -0.09 ± 0.73        |                          0.0176 |
| Hygiene                      | 0.27 ± 0.92        | -0.09 ± 0.59        |                          0.0263 |
| Grip                         | 0.15 ± 0.76        | -0.09 ± 0.68        |                          0.1555 |

* Hand functionality is a composite of the three components (dressing, hygiene, and grip).

ITT = intent to treat, SD = standard deviation, SHAQ = Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire.

The composite of SHAQ components related to hand functionality showed an improvement in favour of bosentan group compared with those on placebo (p = 0.0041; Table above).

## c) Safety results

The most frequently reported adverse event was headache,(17.7% and 16.3%, respectively). Clinically relevant  marked  elevations  in  liver  aminotransferases  (&gt;  3  ×  upper  limit  of  normal)  were  more frequent  among  bosentan-  than  placebo-treated  patients  (14.1%  vs  0%),  and  an  abnormal  liver function test result was the main reason for discontinuation of bosentan therapy (5 patients vs none on placebo among the 12.7% and 9.3%, respectively, who were discontinued due to an adverse event). A small mean decrease in blood pressure (-3.0 mmHg systolic, -2.6 mmHg diastolic) was similar to that observed with placebo (-3.9 and -3.1 mmHg, respectively), and there was no relevant change in pulse rate. The small mean decrease in blood pressure observed at Week 4 either remained stable or returned towards  baseline  with  continued  treatment  and  was  not  associated  with  events  of  hypotension  or postural hypotension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The elevations in liver aminotransferases were asymptomatic, and had incidence, severity, and timing similar to what has been reported in other indications. LAT decreased with treatment discontinuation, interruption, and/or dose reduction .

No  deaths  on  bosentan  and  placebo  occurred  during  the  double-blind  phase.  However,  a  patient subsequently died from severe pulmonary hypertension on 77 days after discontinuation of bosentan ie beyond  the  28-day  follow-up  period.  The  investigator  assessed  the  death  as  unrelated  to  bosentan treatment.

The SAEs that occurred during double-blind treatment or within 28 days after the end of treatment are summarized in table below. Five patients in total experienced an SAE, comprising 2.5% of patients on bosentan  and  7.0%  on  placebo.  Of  the  two  patients  on  bosentan,  one  experienced  ventricular tachycardia,  and  the  other  experienced  dyspnea,  aspiration  pneumonia,  ventricular  tachycardia,  and palpitations.  In  both  patients,  the  events  were  likely  related  to  the  underlying  disease  (pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiac condition, respectively).

The  preferred  term  'DISEASE  PROGRESSION'  was  associated  to  each  of  the  symptoms/diagnosis  terms reported together with it.SAE = serious adverse event, pts = patients.

Fourteen patients (12.7% of patients on bosentan and 9.3% on placebo) were prematurely discontinued from double-blind treatment because of an adverse event. Five patients on bosentan were discontinued due  to  an  abnormal  liver  function  test  (including  increased  ALT  and/or  AST  and  increased transaminases),  and  two  patients  on  bosentan  were  discontinued  due  to  gastro-esophageal  reflux disease.

## 2.4 Study AC-052-331- RAPIDS-2

## a) Methodology - Study design

In this study, the primary objectives were to evaluate the effect of bosentan both on prevention and on healing of ischemic digital ulcers in patients with SSc suffering from active ischemic digital ulcers.

## The following definitions have been used for the study:

Digital ulcer : A digital ulcer was defined as a painful area with visually discernable depth and a loss of continuity of epithelial coverage, which could be denuded or covered by a scab or necrotic tissue. If denudation  was  not  clearly  visible,  loss  of  epithelialization,  epidermis,  and  dermis  was  to  be determined  by  the  investigator.  If  the  area  was  denuded,  the  ulcer  was  pronounced  active.  If denudation could not be judged because of the presence of a scab or necrotic tissue, the ulcer was pronounced indeterminate. This definition did not include fissures, paronychia, extrusion of calcium, or  ulcers  over  the  metacarpophalangeal  joints  or  elbows.  Only  digital  ulcers  from  the  proximal interphalangeal joints distally were to be assessed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cardinal ulcer : A CU was defined as a digital ulcer distal to the proximal interphalangeal joint, volar to the equator of the finger, and not localized in the proximal or distal interphalangeal creases, which was  vascular  in  origin,  painful,  possibly  triggered  by  trauma,  and  was  without  bone  infection  or calcinosis. It was to be at least 2 mm in size and de-epithelialized with clear 'depth' (loss of epidermis and dermis). The CU was to be selected by the investigator based on the clinical judgment that it could both heal and be evaluated for healing. If several digital ulcers were qualified, the CU could be either the  largest  or  the  most  painful  ulcer,  or  the  ulcer  that  disturbed  the  patient  the  most  (within  the definition of the CU). For each patient, only one digital ulcer was to be identified by the investigator as the CU. Patients with SSc felt to be at high risk for digital ulcers were to be identified duringthe screening period but were not eligible for enrolment until a CU developed. The status of each digital lesion was to be rated as 'U', a current digital ulcer according to the definition, 'H', a completely healed  digital  ulcer,  or  'I',  an  ulcer  with  indeterminate  status  between  a  current  digital  ulcer  by definition and a completely healed ulcer.

* The treatment period could be extended for an additional 4, 8, or 12 weeks for patients whose cardinal ulcer healed at Week 16, 20, or 24, respectively. In such case, healing maintenanee was assessed at the end of treatment.

Patients who completed RAPIDS-2 and still had digital ulcers or who developed a digital ulcer after the end of the follow up period could continue treatment in AC-052-333.

## · Study population

Eligible patients were:

- -Patients with SSc  according to the classification criteria of the American  College  of Rheumatology as defined by the presence of one major or two minor criteria (see definition in RAPIDS-1 study).
- -SSc patients with at least one DU at baseline qualifying as a CU CU occurred &lt; 3 months and &gt; 1 week prior to randomization The subset of patients with SSc felt to be at high risk for Dus will be identified in the screening period but will not be eligible for enrolment until a CU has developed.

Patients with severe PAH (World Health Organization class III and IV) were excluded from the study as well as those receiving antibiotics or inhaled oral or parenteral prostanoids for infected ulcers.

## · Primary and secondary endpoints:

The primary endpoints were as follows: (Co-primary endpoints):

- New digital ulcers: Total number of new digital ulcers that were observed by the investigator at planned visits up to Week 24
- Time to  complete  healing: Time to complete healing of the  CU  up  to  Week  24  in  patients whose CU healing was maintained for 12 weeks

The co-primary objective of both prevention and healing was requested by FDA based on the need for healing in the treatment of the disease. In order to evaluate the treatment effect on healing, a baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CU that might be amenable to healing during the time frame of the study was defined during meetings with the Steering Committee. The maintenance of a healing effect for 12 weeks of continued treatment was considered appropriate to the assessment of healing by the FDA.

As a consequence, all patients were to have active digital ulcers at baseline, and the investigator was to identify at baseline a CU of recent onset that was considered amenable to healing and which could be evaluated for healing during the study.

It  should  be  noted  that  in  RAPIDS-2  'prevention'  and  'treatment'  designs  are  mixed  although  the designs are not similar:

In  the  'prevention  trial',  the  primary  endpoint  is  'no  new  ulcer'.  In  the  healing  trial,  the  primary endpoint  is  complete  healing.  These  endpoints  address  different  questions  and  should  be  analysed separately. However, taken into account this multiplicity, an alpha spending correction rule has been applied.

The Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows:

-  Prevention endpoints:
- -Proportion of patients without a new digital ulcer up to Week 24
- -Proportion  of  patients  who  do  not  develop  any  new  digital  ulcers  after  the  first  4  weeks  of treatment up to Week 24.
-  Healing endpoints:
- -Proportion of patients with complete healing of all digital ulcers (baseline and new) at Week 24
- -Time to complete healing of each of the baseline digital ulcers up to Week 24.
-  Overall evaluation of digital ulcers:
- -Change from baseline to Week 24 in the total number of observed digital ulcers
-  Quality-of-life endpoints:
- -Change  from  baseline to Weeks  12  and  24 in hand disability index (composite of dressing/grooming, grip, and hygiene components of the SHAQ)
- -Change from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 in overall hand pain as assessed by a VAS
- Study treatment

Patients were randomized to either bosentan or placebo with an initial dose of bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for the first 4 weeks and a target dose of bosentan 125 mg b.i.d. for the rest of the 24- to 36-week treatment period.

Down-titration  to  or  maintenance  at  62.5  mg  b.i.d.  was  available  at  any  time  for  reasons  of intolerability with possible subsequent up-titration to the target dose.

## b) Rapids 2 study Efficacy results

A total of 190 patients were randomized to bosentan (n = 100) and placebo (n = 90) in 42 centers in Europe and North America.  Two patients from were excluded from the study analyses because the center  failed  to  comply  with  GCP  guidelines  regarding  study  documentation  and  the  data  were considered unreliable. 188 patients remained in the study (98 bosentan, 90 placebo). The disposition of patients is presented in the figure below:

AE = sdverse event.

## · Summary of baseline information

The placebo group had a larger proportion of patients who were current smokers (21.6% vs 12.8% in the bosentan group). It appears that standard management care has not been taken into account in this study design. Smoking is one of the factors known to be associated with severity of disease. Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are at high risk for digital vascular complications. Moreover groups at baseline is not well matched. The Applicant addressed all the aspects of baseline imbalances during review, and a discussion appears later in this assessment.

Patients entering in the study were allowed to continue treatment, however, only 52.0% and 55.6% patients,  respectively  to  bosentan  and  placebo  had  selective  calcium  channel  blocker  treatment  at baseline,  and  only  14.4%  of  placebo  groups  and  16.3%  of  bosentan  group  had  ACE-inhibitors  as previous/concomitant treatments at baseline.

Moreover, it should be noted that around 2% of patients used nasal preparation with vasoactive effect.

Concomitant  treatments  at  baseline  were  not  comparable  between  bosentan  and  placebo  groups. Antibacterials for systemic use, psychotropic agents with vasoactive effect, antiseptics and emollients were  more  important  in  bosentan  group  than  in  placebo  group.  On  the  other  hand  smokers, immunosuppressive agents, opioids and other analgesics were more important in the placebo group.

(4) substitution method: Best observed outcome

In  RAPIDS-2  trial  two  endpoints  were  investigated,  one  for  prevention  and  one  for  treatment.  No effect  on  healing  was  observed  with  bosentan  compared  with  placebo,  including  in  the  time  to complete healing of the CU.

During 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients on bosentan had fewer new digital ulcers than did those on placebo (1.9 vs 2.7 new digital ulcers).

However, in order to keep the alpha risk at 0.05 for the whole trial, a multiplicity correction must be applied. This correction would necessarily make the only positive conclusion (prevention) no longer significant.

In  Rapids-2,  the  difference  between  groups  is  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.0351)  even  after adjustment for ulcers at baseline (p=0.0497).

The difference between groups at baseline of mean number of new ulcer for patients with digital ulcers at  baseline  was  approximately  estimated  at  1.1  new  ulcers.  According  to  methodologies  used  for substitution of missing variables (LOCF, Trend carried) the difference between groups was 1 or 1.8 new ulcers. The effect observed was considered by the rapporteur to be not significant and the results questionable  in  term  of  robustness.  The  issue  of  robustness  was  discussed  at  length  in  the  Oral Explanation (see later in this report) and the CHMP concluded that indeed the treatment effects were robust.

## · Secondary endpoints results

Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed by the number of digital ulcers at baseline and number of ulcers at baseline (&lt;= 3 or &gt; 3 digital ulcers).

The company provided an additional post hoc analysis of subgroups of patients with less or &gt; 3 digital ulcers at baseline

This  sub  category  of  the  subgroup  (patient  with  digital  ulcers  at  baseline)  showed  same  trend  than those observed in subgroup analysis of RAPIDS-1 study.

## VAS: Changes from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 in overall hand pain, all-treated set

As secondary endpoint, pain decrease would have indicated a simple clinical benefit for the patient. The mean difference observed respectively -24 in placebo group and -26 in bosentan group is not statistically significant and not clinically relevant and which further establish that a clinical benefit, if any, would be slight.

In order to assess specific effects of digital ulcers on hand functionality, a hand disability index was introduced  that  comprised  the  dressing,  hygiene,  and  grip  scores  of  the  Scleroderma  Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ).

## Summary of the change from baseline to Week 24 in selected SHAQ components assessing hand functionality, all treated set

† n = 86.

SEM = standard error of the mean,

The hand functionality one component of SHAQ showed improvement from baseline with bosentan therapy  at  Weeks  12  and  24  (Table  above).  However,  improvement  in  hand  functionality  was  also seen  in  the  placebo  group,  and  unlike  in  RAPIDS-1,  the  treatment  effect  for  bosentan  was  not statistically significant. However, a treatment effect was observed for dressing activities, the SHAQ remains most reflective of fingertip function.

Secondary  endpoints  assessing  the  quality  of  life  were  also  evaluated  in  subgroups  defined  by  the number  of  digital  ulcers  at  baseline.  In  general  some  composite  showed  a  trend  of  improvement. Compared with placebo, patients on bosentan showed improvements in most SHAQ assessments, but the differences were small in most cases in the pooled analysis.

## c) Safety results

The most frequently reported adverse event was headache, which occurred with similar incidence in the two treatment groups (16.5% and 16.3%, respectively). Clinically relevant marked elevations in liver aminotransferases (more than three times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) were more frequent among bosentan- than placebo-treated patients (14.1% vs 0%), and an abnormal liver function test was the main reason for discontinuation of bosentan therapy (five patients vs none on placebo among the 12.7%  and  9.3%  of  patients,  respectively,  who  were  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event).  These laboratory abnormalities were asymptomatic, had an incidence, severity, and timing similar to those in bosentan-treated PAH patients, and decreased with treatment discontinuation, interruption, and/or dose reduction.

The  small  mean  decreases  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressures  with  bosentan  (-3.0  and  -2.6 mmHg, respectively) were similar to those observed with placebo (-3.9 and -3.1 mmHg, respectively), and there was no relevant change in pulse rate. The small mean decreases in blood pressures and small mean increase in body weight observed at Week 4 with bosentan either remained stable or returned towards  baseline  with  continued  treatment  and  were  not  associated  with  symptomatic  or  postural hypotension.

In  bosentan-treated  PAH  patients,  elevations  in  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  and/or  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to &gt; 3 × ULN have been observed in approximately 11% of patients (vs 2% on placebo) and associated increases in bilirubin to &gt;3 × ULN in 0.3%. The clinical database shows that  the  incidence  of  elevations  in  aminotransferases  associated  with  bosentan  treatment  are  dose dependent, and that the elevations are typically asymptomatic,  usually occur early in treatment and progress slowly, and to date have reversed spontaneously on continued treatment or decreased after dose reduction, interruption, or permanent discontinuation of bosentan treatment. Bosentan treatment is also associated with dose-related decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit, considered to  be  related  to  hemodilution.  There  is  no  evidence  for  hemorrhage,  hemolysis,  or  bone  marrow toxicity  of  bosentan.  In  patients  with  severe  chronic  heart  failure,  fluid  retention  (weight  gain,  leg edema) was observed during the first weeks of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No deaths on bosentan and placebo occurred during the treatment but some occured up to 56 days after the end of study treatment.

One  patient  died  due  to  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  36  days  after  completing  placebo treatment.

One patient died due to a general deterioration in physical health 58 days after bosentan treatment was prematurely  discontinued  due  to  pneumonia.  The  general  worsening  of  the  patient's  condition  was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study treatment but began on an unknown date that could have been within the 56-day follow-up period.

Two additional deaths were known to occur after the 56-day cut-off for the safety follow up.

Suspected  pulmonary  hypertension  and/or  pneumonia  were  unconfirmed,  but  the  investigator  felt pulmonary hypertension could have been the result of stopping study treatment (i.e., potentially related to study medication).

Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  were  less  frequent  in  patients  on  bosentan  than  placebo  (9.4%  vs 16.7%) during the treatment period and similar in the two groups during the 56-day safety follow-up (4.2% and 4.4%). However, two Pneumonia were experienced by bosentan-treated patients vs none on placebo  group,  one  episode  of  diplopia,  one  case  of  severe  anemia  and  one  case  of  dyspnea. Imputability  of  pneumonia  cases  is  not  clearly  established  as  well  as  respiratory  adverse  events observed with bosentan treatment.

## 2.5 Uncontrolled trials

Patients  in  the  two  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  had  the  opportunity  to  continue  in following extension studies of RAPIDS-1 and RAPIDS-2.

## 2.5.1 Open-label follow up RAPIDS-1 study

Patients who completed the Week-16 assessments RAPIDS-1 study entered the open-label part. Irrespective of the previous double-blind study medication, all patients were to be started on bosentan 62.5 mg b.i.d., up-titrated after 4 weeks to bosentan 125 mg b.i.d., and treated for the remainder of the open-label phase (Figure below).

Figure 14 Study design for the open-label treatment phase

<!-- image -->

The 88 patients who continued in the open-label phase represented 72.1% and 72.2% of the original randomized bosentan and placebo groups, respectively. The open-label treatment was started, without knowledge of treatment in the previous controlled trial. Patients who did not continue with open-label treatment did not have digital ulcers at the end of the double blind phase, did not feel they needed treatment, and/or did not continue for reasons of convenience.

The incidence of new digital ulcers was evaluated during the 12-week open-label treatment phase and also in the subgroups consisting of patients with or without digital ulcers at baseline. During the 12week open label treatment phase, patients had a 0.5 mean number of new digital ulcers in the placebo group versus 0.8 mean number of digital ulcers in the bosentan group.

The proportions of patients who had no new digital ulcer during the 12 weeks of open label treatment were  similar  in  bosentan  and  placebo  groups  respectively  57.1%  and  56.6%.  Therefore  the  minor difference observed on number of new ulcers is not clinically relevant.

## · Safety results :

The most frequent event, headache, was more frequent among ex-placebo patients newly treated with bosentan during the open-label phase (12.9% vs 8.8% in ex-bosentan patients). Also more frequent among ex-placebo patients were diarrhoea (9.7% vs 5.3% on bosentan) and nausea (9.7% vs none). Events of arthralgia, exacerbated dyspnoea, infected skin ulcer, and peripheral oedema were reported only in the ex-bosentan group (8.8%, 7.0%, 7.0%, and 5.3%, respectively).

SAEs were reported by 12.5% of patients during the open-label phase. All SAEs during the open-label phase were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to bosentan treatment. No deaths occurred during or within 28 days of the end of open-label treatment.

## 2.5.2 Open-label follow up RAPIDS-2 Study (AC-052-333) :

This  study  enrolled  patients  who  completed  the  24-  to  36-week  treatment  period  and  the  8-week follow-up period of RAPIDS-2 (AC-052-331) and who still had digital ulcers or who developed a new digital ulcer after the last follow-up visit.

Eligible patients must have met all of the following inclusion criteria before study treatment initiation :

·  Completed  the  full  study  period  (24-  to  36-week  treatment  period  and  8-week  follow  up)  of  the RAPIDS-2 study

·  Presented  with  digital  ulcers  at  the  end  of  the  RAPIDS-2  study  or  developed  new  digital  ulcers thereafter until the RAPIDS-2 study results were released to the investigators

The  MAH  submitted  data  from  an  interim  report  intended  to  summarize  the  limited  safety  data available  as  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date  (19  May  2005).  Only  the  information  on  demographics, premature withdrawals, and serious adverse events (SAEs), including those with fatal outcome, has been included.

## · Study Treatments

Bosentan: bosentan 62.5 mg b.i.d. for the first 4 weeks, followed by up-titration to bosentan 125 mg b.i.d.  for  the  remainder  of  the  study.  Tablets  were  to  be  administered  orally,  irrespective  of  food intake, in the morning and approximately 12 hours later.

This  open-label  extension  study  for  patients  who  had  been  exposed  to  a  24-  to  36-week  treatment period  in  RAPIDS-2  was  requested  by  Health  Authorities  (US  Food  and  Drug  Administration)  to document  the  long-term  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  bosentan  in  the  treatment  of  SSc  patients  with ischemic digital ulcers. The results of final report will provide information to verify if the small effect observed is sustained over.

## 2.6 Discussion on the clinical efficacy data provided to support the new indication

## · Baseline characteristics

The CHMP  requested during the procedure additional information regarding the baseline characteristics for both bosentan and placebo groups.

Several concerns were addressed:

1) The included population appears to be less severely affected as compared to what would have been expected.  In  RAPIDS-1,  only  48.1%  and  48.8%  respectively  in  bosentan  and  placebo  groups  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recorded  to  have  Raynaud's  phenomenon  while  all  patients  were  supposed  to  have  Raynaud's phenomenon as an inclusion criteria.

In  RAPIDS-1 study, in both treatment groups, more patients were classified as having limited than diffuse  skin  disease,  but  limited  systemic  sclerosis  occurred  in  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  on bosentan  than  on  placebo.  Also  in  RAPIDS-2,  more  patients  had  limited  than  diffuse  form,  which reflects the general pattern of the disease. However, in RAPIDS-2, the bosentan and placebo groups were balanced at baseline regarding the sub-type of Systemic Sclerosis.

## 2) Concomitant treatments at baseline and ulcer management

In view of the high risk population included, defined as documented digital ischaemic ulcers within the past year, patients entering in the study were allowed to continue treatment with oral vasodilatating drugs  and  other  oral  medications  for  Raynaud  syndrome,  including  ACE  inhibitors  and  calcium channel blockers (CCB). However, only 14.0% of patients and 17.7% of bosentan group had ACEinhibitors as previous/concomitant treatments at baseline. In addition, only 36.7% and 48.8% patients respectively  to  bosentan  and  placebo  had  selective  calcium  channel  blocker  treatment  at  baseline. Respectively in RAPIDS-2 only 14.4% of placebo groups and 16.3% of bosentan group had ACEinhibitors as previous/concomitant treatments at baseline. In addition, only 52.0% and 55.6% patients respectively to bosentan and placebo had selective calcium channel blocker treatment at baseline. The low representation (around 50%) of patients treated with ACE and CCB in the trial appears much lower than what would have been expected in a population suffering from Raynaud disease. This also limits the robustness of the results as they might not be obtained in a representative population.

There  is  no  clear  data  on  digital  ulcer  management  (topical  treatments,  surgery,  grafting,  local infection) in bosentan vs placebo group. A possible difference in DU management might represent a major bias on efficacy assessment (healing).

The low representation (around 50%) of patients treated with ACE and CCB in the trial appears much lower than what would have been expected in a population suffering from Raynaud disease. This also limits the robustness of the results as they might not be obtained in a representative population.

Differences in baseline characteristics in control and treatment arms in both trials could have led to a more pronounced benefit in treatment groups.

- -For  RAPIDS-1 this applies to the times from diagnosis of systemic sclerosis and of digital ulcers,  total  number  of  digital  ulcers  per  patient,  ulcers  interference  with  daily  activity, Raynaud interference with daily activity and pain.
- -For  RAPIDS-2  this  applies  to  patients  who  were  current  smokers,  concomitant  disease (history  of  digital  amputation,  history  of  hypothyroidism,  concomitant/previous  treatments (psychotropes with vascular effects, systemic antibiotherapy, antiseptics, cicatrisant, emollients

The MAH was asked to discuss the impact of the imbalance between the active group and the placebo group  in  disease  classification,  and,  for  RAPIDS-1,  the  potential  importance  of  the  differences  in concomitant treatment.

Despite numerous studies on the management of Raynaud's phenomenon, definitive guidelines have not  been  established,  and  good  scientific  evidence  for  treatment  is  often  lacking  (Hummers  LK, Wigley  FM.  Management  of  Raynaud's  phenomenon  and  digital  ischaemic  lesions  in  scleroderma. Rheum Dis Clin North Am 2003; 29(2): 293 -313).

A meta-analysis reviewed all the studies of calcium channel blockers that are used for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon in patients who have SSc, and showed only a moderate reduction in mean number of Raynaud's attacks and a 35% improvement in severity. This modest improvement in SSc was less robust than the one reported in studies of primary Raynaud's phenomenon (Thompson AE, Shea  B,  Welch  V,  Fenlon  D,  Pope  JE.  Calcium-channel  blockers  for  Raynaud's  phenomenon  in systemic sclerosis. Arthritis Rheum 2001;44(8):1841-7.).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  treatments  used  for  Raynaud's  phenomenon  and  digital  ulcers  in  SSc  include  mainly  calcium channel  blockers,  ACE  inhibitors,  Angiotensin  II  antagonists,  ketanserin,  sympatholytics  such  as prazosin, and peripheral vasodilators such as pentoxifylline or buflomedil.

The  use  of  these  different  classes  was  different  across  countries  in  RAPIDS-1  and  RAPIDS-2. Calcium channel blockers were less often used in France and the UK than in the USA, Canada, Italy or Germany. ACE inhibitors  were  used  more  frequently  in  the  UK,  France  and  Canada  than  in  other countries.  Angiotensin  II  antagonists  were  used  more  frequently  in  the  UK  than  in  other  countries. Peripheral vasodilators such as pentoxifylline were predominantly used in France.

Most of the patients were exposed to vasodilators, making it unlikely that nasal preparations with a vasoconstrictive effect used in both groups in a very small subset of patients (2%) could have had any influence on the overall treatment outcome.

Smoking cessation should be a first step in the treatment of DU and the included population does not appear to be representative as regards this recommendation. This reinforces the concerns related to the robustness of the results, as these results are really relevant only for patients who do not smoke. Although the number is very small it could also impact (even if marginally) on the results. Robustness is discussed in more details later in this document.

Taken all together, patients' baseline characteristics suggest that the population included in the trials might not exactly fit the population to be treated (high proportion of smokers, relatively low frequent use of ACE and CCB). This limits the extrapolability of the observed results.

The  MAH  argued  that  the  investigators  were  informed  that  they  should  not  list  the  components  of  the Systemic  Sclerosis  condition  in  the  medical  history.  There  was  however  an  over-reporting  of  formal inclusion criteria such as Raynaud's phenomenon or Systemic Sclerosis in the medical history page and by cleaning convention over-reporting was kept in the database.

The analysis of the primary endpoint 'number of new DU' in RAPIDS-2 according to the SSc sub-type as a pre-defined co-variable showed that the treatment effect was similar in both sub-types (Figure below).

Note: The heading \"Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon\"is a truncation, and should read \"Dose adjustment of treatmentofRaynaud'sphenomenon\"

The fact that, in RAPIDS-2, proportion of limited and diffuse SSc was balanced in the two arms and that  this  trial  resulted  in  effect  size  similar  to  what  had  been  obtained  from  RAPIDS-1  (where  an imbalance was observed) is an indirect demonstration that RAPIDS-1 results are not affected by this imbalance. In addition, the variable limited/diffuse SSc does not appear to affect the treatment effect in RAPIDS-1 when a subgroup analysis is performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · End points/ effect size and its robustness

As the study design of RAPIDS-1 was a 'prevention trial', the CHMP highlighted that the primary endpoint that may have been used is 'no new ulcers' as it is more stringent for a better assessment of the benefit for the patient. The secondary endpoint should have been 'percentage of patients with 50% less new ulcers'.  If the aim of the company is to study also the healing properties of bosentan, then in a  'treatment  trial',  the  primary  endpoint  should  have  been  'complete  healing';  and  as  secondary endpoint 'twice more of healed ulcers' and 'pain'.

It is acknowledged that the reduction in the number of new ulcers has been recognized as a possible endpoint for clinical trials in SSc during a scientific advice meeting with the Rapporteur. However, during this advice, a 40% (or even 50%) reduction was recognized as the lower limit to consider such an effect as relevant.  In addition, importance of other possible indicators of a clinical benefit have been highlighted. Pain reduction  (especially overall pain of the hand) was particularly mentioned.

In the design phase of these studies, possible alternative endpoint definitions were explored, including the definition 'occurrence of at least one new (or no new) ulcer. However, the MAH pointed out that the following should be taken into account :

· DU in SSc reflect one consequence of an ongoing, chronic obstructive vasculopathy, characterised by  immune-mediated  endothelial  damage,  platelet  activation,  disruption  of  the  balance  between endothelial-derived vasodilators and factors favouring vasoconstriction, including endothelin-1 (ET1),  as  well  as  by  vascular  and  perivascular  fibrosis  and  inflammation.  Apart  from  being  a  potent vasoconstrictor, ET-1 is a mitogen for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, and a mediator for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

·  The potential benefit of the ET-1 receptor antagonist bosentan in this condition was thought to be related not to vasodilation per se , which is not prominent in systemic blood vessels, but, rather, to an effect on the underlying processes of fibrosis and vascular remodelling. This effect would not be of immediate  onset,  as  is  also  shown  by  the  experience  with  bosentan  in  the  structurally  similar vasculopathy of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Therefore, the MAH considered not possible, or even pathophysiologically relevant, to power the trials for the outcome measure of incidence of no new ulcers, given the target population of patients with active  DU  disease.  The  incidence  of  patients  with/without  new  DU  was  evaluated  in  both  trials (secondary  endpoint  in  RAPIDS-1,  exploratory  endpoint  in  RAPIDS-2).  A  nominal  benefit  of bosentan versus placebo was seen in both trials. In the pooled dataset, the incidences of patients with no  new  ulcers  up  to  study  endpoint  in  the  placebo  and  bosentan  groups  were  32.6%  and  37.6% respectively (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84;1.58).

On the other hand, the finally selected endpoint of number of new DU, if assessed over a reasonable time-span, was considered a realistically achievable measure of an effect of bosentan that could also translate into relevant benefit for the patient, reducing  the  accretion  of  new  DU  and  their consequences, through modification of the activity of the underlying of SSc vasculopathy.

The co-primary healing endpoint used in trial RAPIDS-2 was specifically requested by the FDA. The CHMP acknowledged that an effect of bosentan on healing of established ulcers would be unlikely, considering  the  known  pharmacological  properties  of  bosentan.  Retrospectively,  the  Applicant considered  the  inclusion  of  a  healing  endpoint  as  a  mistake,  which,  from  a  formal,  methodological viewpoint weakened trial RAPIDS-2. However, and as acknowledged by the CHMP, this should not detract from the possibility of assessing the effect of bosentan on the primary endpoint of number of new  DU  in  both  studies.  The  analysis  of  ulcer  healing  in  trials  RAPIDS-1  and  RAPIDS-2  also provided  consistent  evidence  regarding  the  neutral  effect  of  bosentan  on  the  healing  of  established DU.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Robustness of the efficacy findings

The  overall  conclusion  of  an  effect  on  new  digital  ulcers  was  questioned  by  the  CHMP  due  a withdrawal pattern and imputation rules that may have favoured the active treatment. The applicant presented upon request of the CHMP,  alternative analyses of RAPIDS-1 as well as of the pooled data, using the post hoc imputations rules applied to RAPIDS-2, i.e. one analysis with the inter-group cross method (replacing a missing value in one with a random value from completers in the other group), one analysis assigning the worst observed outcome to non-completers in both groups and one analysis assigning the best observed outcome to non-completers in both groups (it should be noted that even this  method  was  more  conservative  than  the  primarily  specified  method  in  RAPID-2).  Finally, alternative analyses were also requested, applying a modified inter-group cross method (replacing a missing value in one group with the average value among completers in the other group).

The MAH was asked to discuss the claimed effect in relation to the different imputation rules for missing data and address the baseline imbalances between the treatment groups.

Most analyses show a benefit associated with bosentan albeit of small size (see table above and figure below). This is a strong clue indicating that bosentan has an activity in the included population. The robustness of the primary efficacy findings were extensively discussed at the CHMP during the oral explanation thus the benefit of the treatment.

The different analyses presented by the MAH were reviewed during the oral explanation, especially the  robustness  of  the  efficacy  findings.  A  detailed  explanation  of  the  different  analyses  with substitution principles and rationale is presented below:

In terms of statistical significance, the effect on the primary endpoint, number of new digital ulcers, is not robust to all possible methods of imputation for missing data. For the MAH, this is related to the limitations of the database that could be made available in this orphan indication. From the additional analyses  done,  it  is  clear  that  a  true  treatment  effect  is  present,  however,  and  that  the  imputation method used in the protocol-specified analysis did not bias the overall conclusions of the two trials in favour of bosentan (see figure below). Compared with placebo, bosentan treatment was also associated with a larger proportion of patients with no new DU, smaller proportions of patients with multiple new DU, and a longer time to each successive new DU. In some cases the treatment differences were small, but the findings consistently indicated a preventive effect with bosentan treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among the several analyses performed, the worst observed outcome analysis (non significant results), was considered not relevant and not adapted to the real clinical experience. Indeed, the worst outcome considered was from the placebo group 16 new ulcers, is not expected to happen in clinical practice in this period of time (16-24 weeks).

Different results are observed depending on the analysis performed. The CHMP considered mainly the main analysis and the analysis where missing data are replaced by the mean completers of the other group. In both analyses no real difference in the point estimate was observed. This is due to the fact the  missing  data  represented  a  low  number  of  patients.  (7%  in  the  bosentan  group  and  5%  in  the placebo group.)

Finally,  the  CHMP, based on the discussion at the oral explanation, was convinced by the efficacy analyses and considered that an effect, although limited in size, was present.

A post hoc ,  exploratory analysis in trial RAPIDS-1, focusing on the relationship between number of ulcers  at  baseline  and  the  number  of  new  ulcers  during  the  study  period  has  been  performed. Obviously, and as illustrated by the small numbers of patients per group, the trial was not powered for this analysis.

It  is  acknowledged  that  no  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  was  observed  for  subgroups  of patients with 0 or 1-3 ulcers at baseline, independently of the imputation method used.

However,  regardless  of  the  imputation  method,  patients  on  placebo  developed  consistently  higher numbers  of  new  DU,  compared  with  the  bosentan  group.  The  figures  also  illustrate  that  disease severity/activity expressed as number of DU at baseline predicts the tendency to form new DU during the observation period. .

A  potential  subpopulation  benefiting  from  the  treatment  was  difficult  to  determine,  based  on  the results from the two studies. The MAH presented convincing data about the use of the treatment in the population initially proposed, without further restriction. However, it was highlighted by the CHMP that the prospective registry will enable to define the best use of the product in patients with digital ulcers with systemic sclerosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical relevance

The  MAH acknowledged that the  effect  on  the  primary  endpoint,  number  of  new  digital  ulcers,  is limited but argued that there was a high, unmet medical need in this orphan indication.

DU are estimated to develop in around 50% to 60% of SSc patients at some time in the course of the disease. Approximately 10 -25% of SSc patients are likely to have DU at any one time. Since SSc is a chronic,  currently  incurable  disorder,  the  majority  of  afflicted  patients  will  experience  repeated episodes of DU.

DU impact  on  day-to-day  functioning,  and  may  cause  serious  complications.  Infection,  ischaemia, pain and gangrene are such important complications of DU and, apart from suffering, lead to frequent pharmacological and surgical interventions, and to repeated hospitalisations.

Thus,  DU  represents  a  severe  manifestation  of  SSc,  contributing  significantly  to  morbidity  and resource-consuming medical and hospital care in this disease.

The  CHMP specifically  raises  the  suggestion  that  a  decrease  in  hand  pain  would  have  indicated  a simple clinical benefit to the patient. Pain is a multifactorial event and it is acknowledged that DU treatment is not expected to completely control pain. This is well confirmed that, at a given time of observation, pain intensity is not strongly correlated with the number of DU.

A prolonged  trial  might  have  evidenced  a  benefit  on  pain.  However,  pain  is  an  early  event  in  the disease and should be reduced early by an efficient DU prevention. One likely explanation for the lack of effect on pain observed in the submitted trials is that the preventive effect of Bosentan on DU is too small to make a pain improvement possible, at least on the time span explored by these trials.

However  an  effect  of  bosentan  on  the  hand  functionality  components  of  the  Scleroderma  Health Questionnaire (SHAQ) VAS and, especially, the effect on the domain considered most reflective of fingertip function, i.e., dressing, for which a consistent response to treatment with bosentan was seen in both trials and in pooled data (Figure below).

.

Figurel SHAQ:Placebo-corrected changes from baseline to study endpoint in hand disability and component scores in trials RAPIDS-1and RAPIDS-2,pooled ITTset

<!-- image -->

The  CHMP finally  considered  that  although  no  effect  on  pain  was  demonstrated,  which  limits  the benefit for the patient, the effect on prevention of new ulcers could be sufficient and clinically relevant in this population where there is a high unmet need in terms of medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.7 Discussion on Clinical Safety

Toxicology  studies  revealed  no  concern  for  the  clinical  use  of  bosentan,  except  for  a  teratogenic potential in humans.

In  reproductive  studies,  teratogenicity  appears  to  be  a  class  effect  for  endothelin  antogonists  and appropriate precautions have been taken for women of childbearing potential.

There was no finding in the non-clinical studies that would be of specific concern to the new target population.

The CHMP agree that no new pre-clinical concerns have been identified in the new target population.

## 2.7.1 Overview of the human safety experience with bosentan

The safety  and  tolerability  of  bosentan  have  been  extensively  studied  in  a  variety  of  indications  in clinical  trials  and  in  the  post-marketing  experience  in  PAH  patients.  Twenty-eight  clinical  trials, mainly  in  PAH  and  chronic  heart  failure  (CHF)  exposed  2,214  patients  to  bosentan  at  dose  levels ranging from 100-2,000 mg/day. Including post-marketing experience, at least 26,500 patients have been exposed to bosentan, with continuous treatment exceeding 4 years in some patients.

The post-marketing safety experience in the EU was enhanced through the Tracleer PMS (previously TRAX)  surveillance  programme  during  the  first  2.5  years  following  EU  marketing  approval.  Key safety data, entered into the system by the prescribing physicians, were gathered from a total of 4,994 patients between May 2002 and November 2004, representing 79% of patients prescribed Tracleer in the EU during that period. Of these, 4,623 patients, previously naïve to Tracleer treatment, had a mean exposure  time  of  38.6  weeks  (by  the  most  conservative  calculation),  representing  more  than  3,400 patients years of exposure.

This overview is based on the aggregate information from the above sources, in which bosentan has shown a consistent safety profile in all studied populations.

The  primary  safety  concern  with  bosentan  therapy  is  hepatotoxicity,  manifesting  primarily  as  an increased  incidence  of  elevated  liver  aminotransferases.  In  placebo-controlled  trials,  elevations reaching at least three times the upper limit of the normal range (3 × ULN) occurred in about 10% to 14% of patients, generally within the first 26 weeks of therapy. However, they can also occur late in treatment,  as  demonstrated  in  post-marketing  experience.  The  elevations  usually  develop  gradually, are asymptomatic (90%), and return to pre-treatment levels, without sequelae, within a few days to 9 weeks, either spontaneously or after dose reduction or discontinuation. In rare cases, resolution has occurred only several months after treatment interruption or cessation.

Uncommonly, elevated aminotransferases have been associated with hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) and/or jaundice. In the post-marketing period and in the setting of close monitoring,  an  exacerbation  of  superimposed  acute  on  chronic  hepatitis  has  been  reported  in occasional cases with pre-existing liver disease. Rare cases of unexplained hepatic cirrhosis have been reported  after  prolonged  (&gt;  12  months)  therapy  in  patients  with  multiple  comorbidities  and  drug therapies.  There  have  also  been  rare  reports  of  liver  failure.  In  some  of  these  infrequent  cases,  the contribution of bosentan treatment could not be excluded.

As a result of the potential for hepatotoxicity of bosentan, stringent treatment guidelines, incorporated into  the  approved  SPC,  include  monthly  liver  test  monitoring  for  the  duration  of  bosentan  therapy, monitoring  2  weeks  after  any  up-titration  or  resumption  of  therapy,  and  an  algorithm  for  the  dose reduction,  temporary  interruption,  or  permanent  discontinuation  of  bosentan  treatment  based  on  the degree of the liver enzyme elevation. From preclinical studies, the elevations in liver aminotransferases are thought to be due to the inhibition by bosentan of  bile salt transport.

Bosentan therapy is also associated with a decrease in haemoglobin concentration, thought to be due to fluid shift. Haemoglobin concentration stabilises after the first 4 to 12 weeks of bosentan treatment, and clinically relevant decreases (&gt; 15% decrease from baseline resulting in values &lt; 11 g/dL) have been reported in 5.6% of patients on bosentan, compared with 2.6% of patients on placebo in previous clinical studies. Anaemia required blood transfusions in a few cases, and although each of the patients was receiving medications such as platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, aspirin, and steroids that could contribute to bleeding and therefore anaemia, a relationship to bosentan could not be completely ruled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

out.  There  is  no  evidence  for  increased  haemolysis,  bleeding,  or  bone  marrow  depression  among bosentan-treated patients.

In patients with CHF, bosentan treatment has been associated with fluid retention, as evidenced by an increase in mean body weight, a decrease in mean haemoglobin concentration, and an increase in the incidence  of  leg  oedema.  This  increase  in  fluid  retention  with  bosentan  in  patients  with  systolic dysfunction is likely to be the reason for the increased incidence of worsening CHF seen during the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment in clinical studies in this population. In addition to abnormal hepatic function  of  note  include  nausea  (common),  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  vomiting,  hypersensitivity reactions  such  as  dermatitis  and  rash  (uncommon),  and  changes  in  international  normalised  ratio (INR). Despite bosentan's effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and 2C9 that would suggest a possible need to up-titrate anticoagulants to maintain the patient's INR, most reported postmarketing changes in INR have been elevations, sometimes associated with gastrointestinal or other haemorrhage.  Thrombocytopaenia  and  decreased  platelets  have  also  been  reported  uncommonly. Confounding factors such as lupus or scleroderma were frequently present, but, as before, in rare cases a contribution by bosentan could not be excluded. Rarely, anaphylaxis and/or angioedema have been reported,  as  has  pulmonary  oedema  in  patients  who  had  a  suspected  diagnosis  of  pulmonary  venoocclusive disease.

Blood  pressures  generally  remained  stable  or  normalised  with  continued  bosentan  treatment.  No clinically meaningful changes in other safety or tolerability parameters have been observed.

Most  adverse  experiences  reported  during  the  post-marketing  period  have  been  similar  to  those observed  during  clinical  trials.  Apart  from  the  rare  late  liver  reactions  discussed  above,  additional related  adverse  events  of  note  include  nausea  (common),  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  vomiting, hypersensitivity  reactions  such  as  dermatitis  and  rash  (uncommon),  and  changes  in  international normalised ratio (INR). Despite bosentan's effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and 2C9 that would suggest a possible need to up-titrate anticoagulants to maintain the patient's INR, most reported post-marketing changes in INR have been elevations, sometimes associated with gastrointestinal  or  other  haemorrhage.  Thrombocytopaenia  and  decreased  platelets  have  also  been reported uncommonly. Confounding factors such as lupus or scleroderma were frequently present, but, as before, in rare cases a contribution by bosentan could not be excluded. Rarely, anaphylaxis and/or angioedema have been reported, as has pulmonary oedema in patients who had a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.

Teratogenicity  appears  to  be  a  class  effect  for  endothelin  antagonists,  and  studies  in  animals  have shown bosentan to have reproductive toxicity. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown, but Tracleer is contraindicated for pregnancy. There have been uncommon post-marketing reports of pregnancy  in  patients  taking  Tracleer,  including  some  patients  taking  hormonal  contraceptives. Oestrogens and progestogens are partially metabolised by CYP isoenzymes, and bosentan has been shown to  decrease  exposure  to  norethisterone  and  ethinyl  oestradiol.  Thus,  women  of  childbearing potential must practise an additional or alternative reliable method of contraception during treatment with, and for at least 3 months after stopping, Tracleer. These precautions are clearly set out in the approved  SPC,  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  and  Patient  Reminder  Card.  Many  endothelin  receptor antagonists have induced atrophy in the seminiferous tubules of the testes and reduced sperm counts and male fertility in rats. Where studied, these effects appear irreversible. Small decreases in systolic and  diastolic  blood  pressures  were  observed  during  the  first  2  weeks  of  bosentan  treatment,  which were usually asymptomatic.

Actelion  acknowledges  the  need  for  continued  efforts  to  prevent  pregnancy  during  treatment  with Tracleer, as specified in the approved SPC, and also acknowledges that the target population proposed in the current application may include a higher proportion of women of child-bearing potential, and with  fewer  disease-related  contraindications  to  pregnancy,  compared  with  the  currently  approved population.

As previously requested following the last PSUR, the MAH committed to provide an action plan on pregnancy covering all indications.

## 2.7.2 Safety experience with bosentan in patients with digital ulcer disease

The integrated safety set from the clinical trials in this indication (RAPIDS-1, RAPIDS-2 and openlabel extensions) comprises 308 patients. Of these, 175 and 133 patients respectively were exposed to bosentan and placebo in double-blind treatment. The mean duration of exposure to bosentan was 19.5 weeks in double-blind treatment phases. Including open-label extension phases, overall 206 patients received a mean 21.8 weeks of bosentan treatment, and 116 patients received bosentan for at least 24 weeks.

The population enrolled in these trials had, on average, long-standing SSc, which was classified as diffuse  in  39%  of  patients.  Consistent  with  this,  the  integrated  population  consisted  primarily  of females (79%), with a mean age of about 50 years (range 22 to 84 years). Eighty-nine percent (89%) were Caucasian. Baseline characteristics were similar to those previously reported for patients with SSc and digital ulcers in the published literature. A wide range of concomitant medications were used. A  summary  of  adverse  events  during  the  placebo-controlled  treatment  phase  is  given  in  the  table below.

The preferred term'DISEASE PROGRESSION'was associated to each of the symptoms/diagnosis terms reported together with it. All AEs with an overall bosentan incidence &lt; 5* are pooled under 'Other'. AE = adverse event.

The safety  profile  of  bosentan  in  these  trials  was  consistent  with  that  in  other  indications.  No  new events were identified.

Elevated liver aminotransferases to ≥ 3 × ULN occurred in 11.3% of patients on bosentan versus 0.8% on  placebo.  The  elevations  were  asymptomatic  in  all  but  one  patient  (associated  with  fatigue), associated with an increase in bilirubin to ≥ 2 × ULN in one patient, and reached &gt; 8 × ULN in four patients.  The  abnormality  was  transient  during  continued  treatment  in  one  patient,  and  in  all  other cases resolved or returned to &lt; 2 × ULN following a decrease in the bosentan dose, or a temporary interruption or permanent discontinuation of bosentan treatment.

Although events denoting anaemia were more frequent among bosentan- than placebo-treated patients (5.1% versus 2.3%), marked decreases in haemoglobin concentration and marked decreases to &lt; 10 g/dL  were  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups  (placebo-subtracted  differences  of  0.6%  and  1.1% respectively).

The early onset of peripheral oedema coincided with a small mean increase in body weight by Week 4 among bosentan-treated patients. These events did not worsen with longer treatment duration, and are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

likely to be related to fluid retention at the start of bosentan treatment. A small mean decrease in blood pressure was observed by Week 4 and did not worsen with continued treatment, and there were no reports of hypotension among bosentan-treated patients.

## 2.7.3 Limitations of the human safety database

The data in the currently targeted indication, active digital ulcer disease in patients with SSc, are from two  adequate,  well-controlled  studies  and  their  extensions,  and  represent  the  largest,  controlled database ever presented in this rare disease. As detailed in the study reports and integrated summaries, these trials enrolled a typical population of patients with SSc, characterised by long-standing disease, female/Caucasian  predominance,  and  multiple  concomitant  medications.  The  safety  data  generated with Tracleer in this population are further supported by previous study data generated in patients with SSc and PAH, who comprised 21% of patients in the pivotal registration studies for Tracleer in the PAH indication, as well as by post-marketing surveillance data from the Tracleer PMS programme. The Tracleer PMS programme reported safety outcomes for 1,017 patients with PAH secondary to SSc, treated with Tracleer for a median of 28.9 weeks (ranging up to 131 weeks). Eighty-four percent (84%)  of  these  patients  were  female,  and  the  median  age  was  63  years.  The  reporting  rates  for potential  safety  signals  within  the  Tracleer  PMS  programme  for  this  population  did  not  differ  from those of the overall Tracleer PMS  population. Specifically, the reporting rate for elevated aminotransferases  (&gt;  3  ×  ULN)  was  9.4%.  These  findings  have  previously  been  assessed  by  the CHMP.

## 2.7.4 The Tracleer PMS programme (formerly TRAX) and related activities

In addition to routine pharmacovigilance activities, a post marketing surveillance project, the Tracleer PMS (formerly TRAX) was established in order to provide pharmacovigilance data related to the main safety concern with bosentan, i.e., hepatotoxicity.

Further  to  the  assessment  of  2  years  of  TRAX  PMS  reports,  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  MAH's request to terminate the post-marketing surveillance programme in September 2004.

A component of the Tracleer PMS programme that remains in operation is the system of controlled distribution  of  Tracleer.  This  system  allows  the  ready  identification  of  prescribers  of  Tracleer, including new prescribers. The Tracleer Prescriber Kit is distributed to all new prescribers of Tracleer, identified through the controlled distribution system within the EU. The Prescriber Kit includes:

- Information  for  the  prescriber/pharmacist,  explaining  the  controlled  distribution  system  for Tracleer and the specific monitoring requirements for liver enzymes and pregnancy testing, as well as the need for use of reliable contraception by women of childbearing age
- The SPC and PIL
- A patient information booklet

New prescribers are approached on an ongoing basis to be given information and education on the safety concerns related to the use of Tracleer, and especially on the need for strict adherence to the regular monitoring of liver function tests for the duration of treatment with Tracleer, as detailed in the approved SPC.

The Tracleer Patient Reminder Card, which facilitates the patient's awareness of the need for regular blood tests, contains important information about the need for regular blood tests for liver unction test monitoring, and warnings relating to pregnancy and the special requirements for reliable contraception and monthly pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential.

As part of its risk management plan, the MAH committed to set up a surveillance programme/registry to collect information on the demographics, safety and outcome data from patients prescribed Tracleer to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease. The data to be collected shall be agreed with the CHMP.  Details of the operation of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

surveillance programme/registry shall be agreed with the National Competent Authorities in each Member State.

In addition, the extension of use of the indication into a new target population, requires the need for more frequent safety updates.  Therefore, the CHMP asked the MAH to provide 6 monthly PSURs including liver safety reports.

## 3. Summary of product information changes

The modifications of the product information agreed in this variation are detailed below:

## SPC changes

## · Section 4.1

Tracleer is also indicated to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease (see section 5.1).

## · Section 4.2

Systemic sclerosis with ongoing digital ulcer disease

Treatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of systemic sclerosis.

Tracleer treatment should be initiated at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then increased to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily. Tablets are to be taken orally morning and evening, with or without food.

Controlled clinical trial experience in this indication is limited to 6 months (see section 5.1).

The patient's response to treatment and need for continued therapy should be re-evaluated on a regular basis. A careful risk/benefit assessment should be made, taking into consideration the liver toxicity of bosentan (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

….

Systemic sclerosis with ongoing digital ulcer disease

There are no data on the safety and efficacy in patients under the age of 18 years.

## · Section 4.4

Tracleer has not been shown to have a beneficial effect on the healing of existing digital ulcers.

## · Section 4.8

## Placebo-controlled trials in digital ulcers

Note: only AEs with onset from start of treatment to 1 calendar day after end of treatment are included. One patient could have had more than one AE.

## Liver abnormalities

In the two studies in patients with digital ulcers the incidence of elevated liver aminotransferases (&gt; 3 × ULN) was 11.3% in bosentan-treated patients (N = 168) compared with 0.8% in placebo-treated patients (N = 129). Elevations to &gt; 8 × ULN were seen in 2.4% of bosentan-treated patients with digital ulcers.

## · Section 5.1

## Systemic sclerosis with ongoing digital ulcer disease

Two randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trials have been conducted in 122 (Study AC-052-401, RAPIDS-1) and 190 (Study AC-052-331, RAPIDS-2) adult patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease (either ongoing digital ulcers or a history of digital ulcers within the last year). In study AC-052-331, patients had to have at least one digital ulcer of recent onset, and across the two studies 85% of patients had ongoing digital ulcer disease at baseline. After 4 weeks of Tracleer 62.5 mg twice daily, the maintenance doses studied in both these trials were 125 mg twice daily. The duration of double-blind therapy was 16 weeks in study AC-052-401, and 24 weeks in study AC-052-331.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Background treatments for systemic sclerosis and digital ulcers were permitted if they remained constant for at least 1 month prior to the start of treatment and during the double-blind study period.

The number of new digital ulcers from baseline to study endpoint was a primary endpoint in both studies.  Treatment with Tracleer resulted in fewer new digital ulcers for the duration of therapy, compared with placebo. In study AC-052-401, during 16 weeks of double-blind therapy, patients in the bosentan group developed a mean of 1.4 new digital ulcers vs . 2.7 new digital ulcers in the placebo group (p = 0.0042). In study AC-052-331, during 24 weeks of double-blind therapy, the corresponding figures were 1.9 vs. 2.7 new digital ulcers, respectively (p = 0.0351). In both studies, patients on bosentan were less likely to develop multiple new digital ulcers during the study and took longer to develop each successive new digital ulcer than did those on placebo. The effect of bosentan on reduction of the number of new digital ulcers  was more pronounced in patients with multiple digital ulcers.

No effect of bosentan on time to healing of digital ulcers was observed in either study.

## Changes to Annex II:

## · CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

The MAH shall agree the details of a controlled distribution system with the National Competent Authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that prior to prescribing all health care professionals who intend to prescribe and/or dispense Tracleer are provided with a Prescriber Kit containing the following:

- Information about Tracleer
- Patient Information Booklet/Patient Reminder Card

The MAH shall set up a surveillance programme/registry to collect information on the demographics, safety and outcome data from patients prescribed Tracleer to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease. The data to be collected shall be agreed with the CHMP.  Details of the operation of the surveillance programme/registry shall be agreed with the National Competent Authorities in each Member State.

The information provided about Tracleer shall contain the following key elements:

- That Tracleer is teratogenic in animals
- o Use in pregnant women is contraindicated
- o The need for effective contraception
- o That there is an interaction with hormonal contraceptives
- o Monthly pregnancy tests in women of child bearing potential are recommended.
- That Tracleer is hepatotoxic
- o Tracleer should not be used in Child Pugh Class B or C, ie moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
- o Need for liver function tests to be measured:
-  Prior to initiation of treatment
-  At monthly intervals during complete course of the treatment
-  Two weeks after any dose increase.
- o Need for close monitoring and dosage adjustment if levels rise above 3 x upper limit normal (ULN):
-  &gt;3 and ≤ 5 x ULN: Confirm levels and if confirmed, reduce the daily dose or stop treatment and monitor liver function at least every 2 weeks.
-  &gt;5 and ≤ 8 x ULN: Confirm levels and if confirmed stop treatment and monitor liver function at least every 2 weeks.

In the above circumstances, if the levels return to pre-treatment values, continuing or re-introducing Tracleer may be considered.

-  &gt; 8 x ULN or any of the above with associated clinical symptoms of liver injury: Treatment must be stopped and re-introduction of Tracleer is not to be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- That treatment with Tracleer is associated with a decrease in haemoglobin.
- o Need for blood monitoring
-  Prior to initiation of treatment
-  Monthly during the first 4 months
-  Quarterly thereafter.
- That co-administration of Tracleer with cyclosporine is contraindicated.
- That the safety database of Tracleer in the indication to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease is limited and physicians are encouraged to enrol patients in the surveillance programme/registry to further increase knowledge about the product. The surveillance programme/registry should prompt doctors to report adverse reactions.

The patient information shall contain the following information:

- That Tracleer is teratogenic in animals
- That pregnant women must not take Tracleer
- That women of child bearing potential must use effective contraception
- That hormonal contraceptives on their own may not be effective
- The need for regular pregnancy tests
- That Tracleer causes a decrease in haemoglobin and the need for regular blood tests
- That Tracleer is hepatotoxic and the need for regular monitoring of liver function

## · OTHER CONDITIONS

The MAH commits to performing the additional Pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance plan.

An updated Risk Management Plan should be provided as per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products of human use.

The MAH will submit 6-monthly PSURs including liver reports, unless otherwise specified by the CHMP.

## Patient leaflet changes

Tracleer tablets are also indicated in digital ulcers (ulcers of the fingers) in people with a condition called scleroderma. Tracleer reduces the number of new finger ulcers that appear.

## 4. Benefit / risk assessment

Based  on  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  efficacy  provided  was sufficiently  robust.  The  effect  size,  although  limited,  was  considered  relevant  for  this  orphan population with a high unmet need.

In addition, upon request from the CHMP, the proposal from the company to establish a prospective surveillance program/registry was ackknowledged.

The  CHMP  reinforces  the  need  to  implement  a  controlled  distribution  system  as  proposed  by  the MAH in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcers.

In conclusion, the CHMP is of the opinion, that the benefit/risk is positive and agreed to extend the indication to reduce the number of new ischemic digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. Conclusion

On 22 March 2007, the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II,  and  Package Leaflet.
