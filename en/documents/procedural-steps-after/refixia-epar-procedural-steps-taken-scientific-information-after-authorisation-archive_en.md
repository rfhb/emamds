| II/0032 | Extension of indication to include treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in children below 12 years of age with haemophilia B including previously untreated patients for Refixia based on results from studies NN7999-3774 and NN7999-3895. NN7999- 3774 is a multicentre, open-label, non-controlled study evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of nonacog beta pegol in previously treated children with haemophilia B, while NN7999-3895 is a multicentre, open-label, single- arm, non-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of nonacog beta pegol in previously untreated patients with haemophilia B. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Version 5.2 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
