## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Introduction

Eculizumab is being evaluated for the treatment of patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) based on the documented role of uncontrolled complement activation in these patients and the mechanism of action of eculizumab to effectively block activation of terminal complement.

Eculizumab  is  currently  approved  in  the  treatment  of  paroxysmal  nocturnal  haemoglobinuria  (PNH) which  has  many  similarities  with  aHUS.  Both  aHUS  and  PNH  are  complement  inhibitor  deficiency disorders characterised by uncontrolled complement activation. aHUS is a very rare, serious and lifethreatening disorder characterised by the diagnostic triad of thrombotic thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolysis and impaired renal function as well as other ischemic complications. Most cases  of  aHUS  are  secondary  to  mutations  in  genes  which  encode  components  of  the  alternative pathway  of  the  complement  cascade.  Similar  to  observations  in  PNH,  uncontrolled  complement activation  may  contribute  to  the  thrombotic  microangiopathy  (TMA)  process  in  aHUS  by  causing inflammation and prothrombotic activity. Patients with aHUS currently face a very poor prognosis with high likelihood of kidney failure, dialysis and/or death within one year from the time of diagnosis.

While aHUS is a very rare disorder, the incidence of aHUS has been poorly characterised. From the sparse  epidemiologic  data  in  the  literature,  reports  indicate  that  most  patients  develop  the  disease before 10 years of age.  Data derived from the European HUS registry indicate that only 167 patients have been identified across Europe, and prevalence was estimated at approximately three per million in children less than 18 years of age. The prevalence in adults is expected to be lower.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with aHUS have uncontrolled complement activation, and in approximately half of aHUS cases mutations  have  been  identified  in  the  alternative  pathway  of  the  complement  cascade,  including mutations  in  genes  encoding  complement  regulatory  proteins  and/or  patients  with  the  presence  of neutralising antibodies to these proteins. Mutations have been identified in at least 10 different genes to date. Because of the heterogeneity of different complement defects contributing to clinically severe aHUS, and because only approximately 50% of aHUS patients have observed mutations, identification of  a  specific  mutation  is  not  required  for  aHUS  diagnosis.  While  many  patients  with  aHUS  report  a prodrome of feeling unwell, including fever, malaise, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or neurologic symptoms, patients with aHUS are generally only clinically identified when they present with an  abrupt  onset  of  signs  and  symptoms.  If  they  survive  this  initial  disease  presentation,  they  are typically  burdened  with  a  chronic  thrombotic  and  inflammatory  state  characterised  by  platelet  and endothelial  cell  activation  which  carries  a  life-long  elevated  risk  of  sudden  blood  clotting,  renal insufficiency with ensuing dialysis, and other severe complications of TMA. Severe TMA complications in  patients with aHUS, in addition to renal TMA complications, include seizures, CNS infarcts, coma, cardiomyopathy,  myocardial  infarction,  pancreatitis,  pulmonary  distress,  diffuse  vasculopathy,  and multi-organ TMA. These complications frequently lead to premature mortality in aHUS.

Presently there are very limited treatment options for patients with aHUS. Therapy is empirical and aimed primarily at stabilising the patient and mitigating irreversible kidney damage through the use mostly of plasma therapy (PT) and can include the use of immunosuppressant drugs and supportive care. The rationale for the use of PT in aHUS patients is to remove plasma, which contains mutated complement regulatory proteins or auto-antibodies to complement regulatory proteins, and replace it with  fresh  frozen  plasma  (FFP)  from  healthy  donors  in  an  attempt  to  transiently  restore  control  of complement activity. However, there are limited data which support the long-term benefit of PT and no controlled clinical trials have been performed to establish its safety or efficacy in patients with aHUS. In addition, PT is a laborious procedure leading to a poor quality of life for patients who receive it. It is also associated with a risk of infection, allergic reactions, thrombosis, and loss of vascular access and provides  incomplete  reversal  of  TMA.  Kidney  transplant  has  been  undertaken  in  aHUS  patients, however, despite the best supportive care, recurrent aHUS causes kidney transplant failure in up to approximately 60 to 90 percent of patients.

Eculizumab  is  a  high  affinity  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that  binds  uniquely  to  human complement  component  C5.  Eculizumab  blocks  the  cleavage  of  C5  into  the  proinflammatory,  prothrombotic and lytic C5a and C5b-9 complement components, while leaving the upstream components of  complement,  most  notably  C3b,  intact  to  preserve  opsonisation  of  pathogens  and  clearance  of immune complexes.

Eculizumab has been approved as the first safe and effective treatment for patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH).

This medicinal product was designated in atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/09/653 on 24 July 2009.

The purpose of this type II variation application (C.I.6.a) is to seek approval for Soliris (eculizumab) in the treatment of atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome.

The MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). In addition the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to reflect additional vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis recommendation in sections 4.4 and 6.6 of the SmPC and to update the product information with the latest version of the QRD template. The PL has been updated accordingly.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (P/224/2010) for the following condition(s):

- Treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
- Treatment of atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome

On the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP)

The PIP is not yet completed

## 3.2. Non-clinical aspects

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

According  to  the  CHMP  guideline  'Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal Products for Human  Use' (ref. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  dated 01 June 2006), 'Vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are unlikely  to  result  in  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  Similarly,  vaccines  and  herbal  medicinal products are also exempted due to the nature of their constituents'.

Eculizumab  is  a  natural  substance  (protein),  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, eculizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 3.3. Clinical aspects

## 3.3.1. Introduction

Alexion  has  conducted  two  prospective  open-label  single-arm  clinical  trials  (Study  C08-002A/B  and Study  C08-003A/B)  in  adult  and  adolescent  patients  with  aHUS  and  a  retrospective  data  collection study  (Study  C09-001r)  to  capture  the  information  on  adult  and  paediatric  patients  who  received eculizumab outside of the prospective clinical trials, to support the registration of eculizumab in the treatment of aHUS.

## CHMP guidelines/Scientific Advice

The MAH did not seek CHMP scientific advice for this application.

## GCP aspects

According to the MAH, the clinical trials included in this application were conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization. All  studies  were  performed  to  meet  the  ethical  requirement  of  Directive  2001/20/EC  and  FDA  GCP regulations.

## 3.3.2. Clinical Pharmacology

The  formulation,  presentation  and  administration  of  eculizumab  in  studies  C08-002A/B  and  C08003A/B were identical to those described in the SmPC. These have been previously described in the original PNH submission.

Data  from  PNH  clinical  studies  in  adults  have  shown  that  eculizumab  serum  concentrations  greater than  35  μg/mL  blocked  serum  terminal  complement  activation  and  resulted  in  a  rapid  reduction  in intravascular hemolysis in the majority of patients. The targeted eculizumab concentration of 35 μg/mL is  consistent  with  its  stoichiometric  binding  to  C5,  since  eculizumab  and  human  C5  are  similar  in molecular weight, eculizumab binds two molecules of C5 and endogenous concentrations of C5 had been previously reported to range from approximately 70 to 90 μg/mL.

However, elevated LDH levels, indicating breakthrough hemolysis and incomplete terminal complement inhibition, were occasionally observed in patients with PNH being treated with the PNH specific dose regimen.

Due to the potential rapid loss of kidney function that can occur in patients with aHUS experiencing TMA, breakthrough from terminal complement inhibition was considered clinically unacceptable. In fact, it was considered critically important to optimise the induction and maintenance dose of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS patients to maintain complete and sustained terminal complement inhibition and to address the higher free C5 levels observed in patients. Therefore, a target trough level was chosen (e.g., 50-100 μg/mL), which also accounts for sufficient eculizumab levels in patients with higher endogenous C5 levels or for patients with a higher drug clearance rate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  order  to  develop  an  optimal  dosing  strategy  for  aHUS,  meta-analysis  was  performed  using  data from  all  PNH  studies  (C02-001,  C04-001,  C04-002,  E05-001  and  C07-001)  to  assess  the  PK  of eculizumab in PNH patients, establish the relationship between plasma concentrations of eculizumab and  the  percent  of  haemolytic  activity  and  ultimately  identify  sources  of  variability  in  PK/PD parameters of eculizumab. Of the 224 PNH  patients exposed to eculizumab during clinical development, a total of 177 patients provided samples for PK and PD analyses. A total of 85 male and 92 female patients were included in the analysis. A one-compartment PK model parameterized with clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vc) fitted the plasma concentration profiles of eculizumab adequately. Results from the current population PK analysis suggest that the proposed dosing strategy in  PNH  resulted  in  a  close-to-full  inhibition  of  haemolytic  activity  in  PNH  patients.  Furthermore, eculizumab treatments were well tolerated during the induction and maintenance treatment phases. The  above  population  PK  model  was  used  to  support  the  proposed  eculizumab  dosing  strategy  for aHUS patients with a targeted trough level of 50-100 μg/mL.

Dosing simulations were conducted for adults, adolescents and paediatric patients leading to a weight based dosing recommendation for aHUS patients.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were collected from the 37 patients included in the two prospective controlled  studies  (C08-002A/B  and  C08-003A/B). In addition, selected pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic  data  were  performed  on  a  voluntary  basis  without  a  specific  schedule  of collection from 20 patients who participated in the retrospective study (C09-001r).

## 3.3.2.1. Pharmacokinetic data

A pharmacokinetic simulation was conducted to model the target eculizumab dose in aHUS patients in order to maintain a trough level 50-100 μg/ml.

The target Cmin eculizumab serum concentration was set at 50-100 μg/mL to provide adequate drug exposure  for  complete  and  sustained  inhibition  of  terminal  complement  activity  throughout  the  26 week  dosing  treatment  period.  The  target  Cmax  was  set  at  &lt;700  μg/mL  which  was  the  highest concentration observed during the conduct of the PNH clinical trials and proved to be a safe level of exposure to eculizumab. A trial simulation model was used to define the optimal dosing regimen in adult  patients.  This  model  was  repeated  for  various  weight  groups.  Based  on  the  results  of  these simulations,  the  following  weight-based  doses  and  dose  schedules  were  recommended  for  aHUS patients:

A  similar  PK  simulation  was  performed  to  assess  the  effect  of  plasma  therapy  on  eculizumab concentration. In the population PK model, PT interventions resulted in a marked increase in systemic clearance of eculizumab and a marked reduction in the elimination half-life. Based on the PK modelling, it was estimated that a supplemental eculizumab dose of 600 mg was required within 60 minutes prior to  each  2  units  of  fresh  frozen  plasma  or  within  60  minutes  after  each  plasmapheresis  or  plasma exchange.

The analysis of Cmin and Cmax from the two prospective controlled studies and the retrospective data collection validated the dosing scheduled derived from the PK modeling in aHUS patients at all ages (Table 3). During the induction dosing phase, the mean Cmin concentration ranged from 90 μg/mL to 171 μg/mL. During the maintenance dosing phase, the eculizumab mean Cmin concentration range was maintained between 94 and 234 μg/mL. During both the induction and the maintenance phase mean Cmax remained under the set target value of &lt; 700 μg/ml.

Within the adult and adolescent groups, PK parameters were consistent across all three studies. PK parameters  were  also  consistent  across  all  age  groups  although  Cmin  tended  to  be  higher  in  the paediatric patients during the induction phase than in adult and adolescent aHUS patients.

3.3.2.3. Two Pharmacokinetic (PK) assay methods were used to measure total serum eculizumab: the original method described in BTM-0013 and an updated method described in SOP-G-BTM-0056. The assay range of 10 - 320μg/mL associated with BTM-0013 led to a relatively high number of Above Limit of Quantitation (ALQ) concentration values in postdose samples of patients from the aHUS clinical trials, possibly reflecting the higher doses of eculizumab that these patients received in comparison to patients with PNH. To address this, the assay dynamic range was widened in SOP-G-BTM-0056. These changes allow a significantly expanded assay range with the reliability to measure eculizumab sample concentrations ranging from 9.4 to 600μg/mL. This range spans most of the peak concentration values of eculizumab in patient samples. SOP-G-BTM-0056 was validated and reported in BTMV-0020FR , and was used to measure eculizumab concentrations for several of the patients from the C09-001r trial.Population PK modelling using pooled data from prospective and retrospective studies

A  population  PK  analysis  was  performed  using  all  the  available  data  from  the  prospective  and retrospective  studies.  The  model  parameters  for  the  pooled  data  were  estimated  using  a  structural model.

In  order  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  retrospective  study  data  on  population  PK  parameters  of eculizumab collected in prospective trials, a 'study effect' on CL and Vc of eculizumab was tested and was found to be not significant  at  the  5%  level  (P-value&gt;0.05).  These  results  suggest  that  the  PK parameters  of  eculizumab  in  aHUS  patients  from  the  prospective  and  retrospective  studies  were similar.

## 3.3.2.4. Pharmacodynamics

Eculizumab  is  a  high  affinity  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that  binds  uniquely  to  human complement  component  C5.  Eculizumab  blocks  the  cleavage  of  C5  into  the  proinflammatory,  prothrombotic and lytic C5a and C5b-9 complement components, while leaving the upstream components of  complement,  most  notably  C3b,  intact  to  preserve  opsonization  of  pathogens  and  clearance  of immune complexes.

No additional clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted in this application.

## 3.3.2.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The threshold of 35 µg/ml as the minimum level that blocked serum terminal complement activation is considered  acceptable,  however  a  complete  complement  inhibition  cannot  be  ensured.  The  MAH´s proposal to increase the trough concentration of eculizumab (50-100 µg/ml) in aHUS in order to get a better efficiency of the pharmacodynamic appears well motivated to the CHMP.

According to the data from the prospective studies, overall, the objective of 50-100 µg/ml has been achieved in the induction and maintenance phase. The mean Cmin was shown to be clearly superior. Interestingly,  the  plasmatic  levels  were  higher  in  the  induction  phase  in  paediatric  patients  than  in adults.

Reliability of the estimation of systemic exposure in paediatric patients taking into account the inclusion of age in the population-PK model as a categorical covariate has been discussed by the Applicant. Age as a categorical Covariate was demonstrated to influence significantly the variability of Clearance and Volume of distribution. However, the effect of weight was identified as the most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant covariate explaining the clearance of eculizumab since it resulted in the lowest ΔMOF (i.e., 79.343). Other alternative dosing scheme could have been tested in order to optimise the use of eculizumab in paediatric patients. It is acknowledged that a dose-response study might have helped in the selection of the optimal dose. Unfortunately this has not been done and no other doses have been tested in the studies conducted.  Therefore, the question is whether the proposed dosing regimens can be accepted on the basis of their benefit/risk balance. The relatively high dose proposed in this indication may not be optimal particularly for long term side effects that could be avoided with a reduced posology. The applicant agreed to discuss the feasibility of a further study investigating efficacy and safety of lower doses at post-approval.

Data  from  paediatric  population  are  scarce,  due  mainly  to  limited  number  of  children  recruited.  In order to better characterise the PK profile and its relationship with efficacy and safety in this population, further evidence from the ongoing study should be provided in future updates. A controlled prospective study in paediatric aHUS patients is currently enrolling.

Regarding the analytical method, due to the issues detected with the one used in PNH, another method was  developed  to  measure  higher  concentrations  of  eculizumab  in  aHUS  patients.  In  spite  of  the limitation of the old method, it seems that the repercussion on the PK data is acceptable. In any case, the new method should be used in the ongoing trials, allowing a more reliable comparison between different  samples and methods. Therefore, the applicant agreed to carry out all the analyses of the samples in the ongoing studies using the new analytical method. These results will be submitted in the next updates of the trials, comparing these results with PK data from studies C08-002, C08-003 and C09-001r.

A model for the mechanisms leading from impaired regulation of the alternative pathway to thrombotic microangiopathy has been described (Noris et al. in N Engl J Med 2009;361:1676-87).

## 3.3.3. Clinical efficacy

## 3.3.3.1. Dose response studies

No dose-response studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).

## 3.3.3.2. Main studies

Data from 67 patients in two prospective controlled studies and one retrospective study were used to evaluate  the  efficacy  of  eculizumab  in  the  treatment  of  aHUS.  The  impact  of  chronic  eculizumab treatment on the TMA process, TMA events, TMA interventions, kidney insufficiency, quality of life and anemia  was  examined.  The  two  prospective  clinical  studies  (C08-002A/B  and  C08-003A/B)  were conducted in two distinct populations of aHUS patients with clinically different baseline characteristics and different  expected  clinical  outcomes.  Study  C08-002A/B  accrued  patients  in  the  early  phase  of aHUS with evidence of severe TMA manifestations with acute worsening of renal function.  In  these patients eculizumab is expected to control the TMA process, prevent further severe TMA manifestations, and reverse kidney damage.

Study C08-003A/B accrued patients with long term aHUS with apparent control of the TMA process due to chronic PT. Those patients had a long, sustained renal impairment prior to entering the trial. In this population eculizumab is expected to control the TMA process despite discontinuation of PT and also maintain kidney function.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both studies were divided into Part A for adults and Part B for adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old. For both of the prospective studies, primary efficacy analyses are presented for the combined adult and adolescent cohorts.

Therefore,  these  studies  are  reported  separately  without  integration  in  the  efficacy  analyses.  In addition,  the  retrospective  study  (C09-001r)  included  a  group  of  aHUS  patients  with  multiple  age categories and a wide range of disease history (see Table 6). These data were also reported separately without integration into the two prospective controlled clinical studies.

The prospective studies were designed for 26 weeks of eculizumab dosing with additional treatment available through the extension phase of each protocol. All patients included in the submission had a minimum of 26 weeks follow-up (unless they were discontinued early). Primary efficacy endpoints were assessed through week 26. The durability of effect was also assessed through data cut-off including the additional follow-up from the extension phase of the studies. Since the two prospective, controlled studies provided comparison to baseline, each patient was further used as an historical control in a time-matched analysis of specific measures of clinical efficacy.

The retrospective study provided safety and efficacy data especially with regard to paediatric aHUS patients.

Two additional clinical studies in aHUS patients have been initiated: one in adult patients (C10-004) and one in paediatric patients (C10-003). Descriptions of these studies are provided in Table 7. At the time of the cut-off for this analysis (November 30, 2010) two patients were enrolled in the study C10004 and none were enrolled in the study C10-003. These patients had minimal follow up and no data were available.

## Study C08-002

## Design

This was an open-label, non-randomised, single-arm multi-centre, controlled clinical trial of eculizumab in adults (≥18 years; protocol C08-002A) and adolescents (between ages from 12 and up to 18 years weighing  ≥40  kg;  protocol  C08-002B)  with  PT-resistant  aHUS  (that  is,  aHUS  patients  who  did  not respond or insufficiently responded to, or were intolerant to aggressive PT), managed in 2 different protocols.

This was an open-label study and no prospective control groups were used. Each patient's historical experiences and data, collected during the pre-eculizumab treatment period, were used as comparators in several statistical analyses.

## Study Participants

Main inclusion/exclusion criteria included:

1. Male  or  female  patients  ≥  18  years  (C08-002A)  or  between  ages  12  and  up  to  18  years weighing ≥ 40 kg (C08-002B) and diagnosed with aHUS. Patients were either newly diagnosed, experienced a relapse of the disease, or had a post-transplant recurrence of the disease.
2. Exhibited  a  decrease  in  platelet  count  despite  at  least  4  PT  treatments  in  the  1  week immediately prior to screening. At screening, platelet count must have been &lt; 150 x 10 9 /L and at least 25% lower than the average of 3 platelet counts obtained during the most recent TMA remission and at least 1 month apart during that remission prior to screening (designated the 'average remission platelet count').
3. If historical counts were not available, platelet count at onset of the current aHUS exacerbation must be ≤ 75 x 10 9 /L, and platelet count at screening must have been ≤ 100 x 10 9 /L despite PT treatment administration of at least 4 PT treatments in the 1 week immediately prior to screening.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4. Known  complement  regulatory  protein  genetic  abnormality,  i.e.,  a  mutation  in  Complement Protein  3,  factor  H  or  associated  factor,  factor  I,  MCP,  known  Factor  B  gain-of-function mutation, or known anti-CFH antibody ('aHUS lesions').

Patients diagnosed with aHUS were eligible and were assigned to one of the following parallel categories during the treatment period of the trial:

- Category  1:  Factor  H  or  Factor  I  functional  deficiency,  abnormal  factor  interaction (CFH/CFI FFP Group), or deletions of the CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes;
- Category 2: Complement Protein 3, abnormal factor interaction (C3) or Factor B Gain of Function;
- Category 3: Anti-CFH Antibody (Anti-CFH Group);
- Category 4: MCP deficiency (MCP Group).
1. Patients diagnosed with aHUS without documented complement mutation or known anti-CFH antibody were eligible if other aetiologies of HUS were ruled out as confirmed in the Exclusion Criteria (i.e., including Shiga-toxin negative, non-infectious, non-drug exposure- related [i.e., cyclosporine]), no known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity, and antiphospholipid antibody negative). Patients meeting these conditions were assigned to Category 5. In addition, these patients underwent genetic testing to determine if a mutation could be identified. If a mutation was identified, the patient was reassigned to the appropriate category.
2. Lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  level  ≥  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  unless  the  patient  was receiving PE and LDH at the onset of the current aHUS exacerbation was at least the ULN. If LDH was normal at screening, other markers indicative of ongoing haemolysis were evaluated, such as haptoglobin, schistocytes, and discussed with the Sponsor;
3. Creatinine level ≥ ULN for age (patients who required acute dialysis for acute renal failure were also eligible).
4. Typical HUS (known Shiga toxin +) (exclusion criteria)

Patients who experienced an aHUS exacerbation or disease progression during the study that, in the opinion  of  the  investigator,  required  intervention  with  immunosuppressive  therapies  such  as  mTOR inhibitors  or  tacrolimus  were  to  be  discussed  between  the  Investigator  and  the  Sponsor  for consideration of study discontinuation. If patients who were status post (s/p) kidney transplant and had developed AMR (C4d positive renal biopsy), and for whom Rituximab and/or IVIg were deemed the appropriate therapy, then these patients would have been required to withdraw from the study and receive standard of care therapy. Patients were also required to undergo the 8-week follow-up period after discontinuation of eculizumab therapy.

## Treatments

Patients received the first dose of eculizumab between 1 and 6 hours after the completion of the PT session administered closest to the point in time eligibility was confirmed (known as the Qualifying PT Episode).

Eculizumab 600 mg, 900 mg or 1200 mg was administered intravenously according to the following regimens:

- Induction Period: patients received eculizumab 900 mg via IV infusion over approximately 35 minutes once a week (every 7 ± 2 days) for four weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Week 5: patients received 1200 mg eculizumab via IV infusion over approximately 35 minutes for the 5th dose (7 ± 2 days after 4th dose).
- Maintenance Period: after the fifth dose, patients received eculizumab 1200 mg via IV infusion over approximately 35 minutes every two weeks (every 14 ± 2 days).

If the physician administered PPH, PE, or FFP, 600 mg eculizumab was to be administered (i) within 60 minutes  after  each  PPH  or  PE  and  (ii)  within  60  minutes  prior  to  each  2  units  of  FFP  infusion, respectively.

The  Treatment  Period  commenced  with  the  first  eculizumab  dose.  The  first  26  weeks  of  treatment defined  the  time  period  for  assessments  of  the  endpoints.  Additionally,  when  available,  all  data collected in the extension period were also included in the assessment of efficacy and safety endpoints (up to data cut-off date), as detailed in the final SAP, Amendment 1. Patients were allowed to continue to  receive  eculizumab  treatment  until  the  product  was  registered  and  available  to  treat  patients diagnosed with aHUS (in accordance with country specific regulation).

The treatment with IVIg and Rituximab were prohibited during the study:

Patients previously treated with IVIg were required to have an 8-week washout period and patients previously  treated  with  Rituximab  were  required  to  have  a  12-week  washout  period  prior  to  being enrolled in this study.

If patients who were status post kidney transplant had developed AMR (C4d positive renal biopsy), and for  whom  Rituximab  was  deemed  the  appropriate  therapy,  then  these  patients  would  have  been required to withdraw from the study and receive standard of care therapy.

The  following  concomitant  medications  and  therapy  during  the  study  were  allowed  under  certain circumstances and restrictions:

- Patients receiving other immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (mTOR) inhibitors or tacrolimus were allowed under the following circumstances ONLY IF: (1) part of an established post-transplant anti-rejection regime and dose of such medications must have been unchanged for at least four weeks prior to screening, or (2) patient confirmed antiCFH antibody requiring immunosuppressive therapy and dose of such medications must have been unchanged for at least four weeks prior to screening or (3) patient experienced an acute aHUS  relapse immediately after transplant. In addition, a stable dose of these medications was  to  be  maintained  during  the  Treatment  Period  unless  there  was  a  discussion  and agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor.
- Patients receiving ESAs were allowed if the patient had been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to screening, or a washout period of at least 2 weeks from the last dose of ESA therapy. In addition, a stable dose of these medications must have been maintained during the Treatment Period unless there was a discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor.
- Use of any other investigational drug or device was prohibited beginning four weeks prior to screening and throughout the entire trial

After  entry  into  the  trial,  patients  were  not  permitted  to  receive  PT  within  the  first  96-hour  period following the first eculizumab dose or new dialysis within the first 48-hour period following the first eculizumab dose unless there was compelling medical need. Exceptions to the rescue criteria were to be approved prior to administration on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor.

## Objectives

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective of the study (per protocol) was to assess the effect of eculizumab to reduce TMA as measured by platelet count change from baseline during the eculizumab treatment period to the first 26 weeks in patients with PT-resistant aHUS, including assessment of the proportion of patients who experience platelet count normalization from baseline through 26 weeks as well as through data cut-off date.

If the protocol specified primary endpoint of platelet change from baseline was statistically significant, another  primary  objective  was  to  estimate  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  Haematologic Normalization from baseline through 26 weeks as well as to the data cut-off date.

## Statistical Methods and Sample size

The  ITT  population  was  defined  as  all  patients  who  received  any  amount  of  eculizumab,  and  were considered evaluable for safety and efficacy analyses. The first dose of eculizumab in the Treatment Period was considered as study Day 0. The study day was presented and calculated relative to the first dosing day.

For all efficacy endpoints, the primary analysis was based on the ITT population, and missing data was imputed; additional details  are  provided  in  the  final  SAP  Amendment  1  (Appendix  16.1.9).  The  last patient data recorded for this interim report occurred on or before September 8, 2010, which afforded a minimum of 26 weeks in the Treatment Period for all patients who continued in the study.

The main analysis for this study was based on the pooled data of the two protocols for adult patients (C08-002A) and a similar protocol for adolescent patients (C08-002B).

With at least  12  patients  enrolled  between  the  two  protocols  and  assuming  a  null  hypothesis  of  no post-dose change from baseline in mean platelet count, the study had approximately 88% power to detect as statistically significant an effect size (mean change from baseline / standard deviation) of at least 1 when using a one sample t-test with a two-sided α = 0.05. Up to approximately 15 patients were to be enrolled between the protocol of adult patients (C08-002A) and the protocol of adolescent patients (C08-002B).

## Efficacy endpoints

- Platelet Count Change from Baseline and Platelet Count Normalization

Platelet count change from baseline (Platelet Count Pre-PT baseline Set-point value) at each postdose day of measurement (excluding days 1 to 4) to the first 26 weeks of treatment was assessed using a repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Statistical significance of a positive or negative increase in the change from baseline was assessed at the 5% level at each time point.

The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  platelet  count  normalisation  (protocol  defined secondary endpoint of TMA remission rate) was assessed from baseline through 26 weeks as well as  through  data  cut-off  date.  This  was  reported  for  the  entire  population  and  for  patients  with abnormal baseline platelet count (&lt;150 x 10 9 /L).

- Haematologic Normalisation

Haematologic Normalisation was defined as normalisation of both platelet count and LDH sustained for at least two consecutive measurements which span a period of at least four weeks. Counts and proportions were produced for the patients in a state of Haematologic Normalisation at each day starting from week four after the first eculizumab dose. This analysis was performed for all patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as well as for the subgroups defined by presence or absence of identified complement regulatory factor mutations. Exact binomial CIs were produced for the analysis which combines all patients into a single group.

The time to Haematologic Normalisation was calculated from Day 0 until the two components of Haematologic Normalisation had met the conditions which lead to the confirmation of Haematologic Normalisation. For example, platelet count may already have been ≥150 x 10 9 /L and LDH was just starting to decrease to ≤ULN [i.e., the first of two consecutive normal measurements which span a period  of  at  least  four  weeks]).  The  CDF  of  the  time  to  Hematologic  Normalization  was  also generated. The time represented on the CDF plot represented target windows.

The duration of Haematologic Normalisation was based on the longest interval in days between the time of occurrence and the last response day or study day (data cut-off date) in which the patient was  in  the  state  of  haematologic  normalization.  The  last  response  day  was  the  day  when  the patient no longer met criteria for hematologic normalization. The survival plot of the duration of Haematologic  Normalization was  generated  excluding those patients who  did not achieve Haematologic  Normalization  during  the  study  (responders  only).  The  time  presented  on  the survival plot represents two-week interval.

- Secondary endpoints:

Evaluate additional endpoints from baseline through 26 weeks and/or from baseline through data cutoff date, including the last visit for early termination, such as the effect of eculizumab on:

-  TMA  Intervention  Rate  (#  PT  and  #  Dialysis  Events/Patient/Day)  in  the  eculizumab  treatment period (from baseline through 26 weeks and through data cut-off date) compared with the TMA Intervention Rate during the pre-eculizumab treatment period.

- TMA Event-Free status defined as the absence for at least 12 weeks of (1) decrease in platelet count  of  &gt;25%  from  the  Platelet  Count  Pre-PT  Baseline  Set-Point;  (2)  PT  while  the  patient  is receiving eculizumab, and (3) new dialysis.

- Quality of Life measures.
- Renal function measures.
- Hemoglobin (at least 20 g/L)

-  Complete  TMA  Response  (analysis  requested  by  the  regulatory  authorities.).  Complete  TMA Response was defined as Haematologic Normalization plus improvement in renal function (25% reduction from baseline in serum creatinine, which was sustained for two consecutive measurements which span a period of at least four weeks)

- Characterize the overall safety and tolerability of eculizumab.
-  Describe  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  properties  of  eculizumab  in patients with aHUS

## Results Participant flow

There were a total of 17 patients enrolled between the protocol for adult patients (C08-002A, 16 adult patients enrolled) and the separate protocol for adolescent patients (C08-002B, one adolescent patient enrolled). For efficacy and safety analyses, all 17 patients were included in the ITT population. At the time  of  data  cut-off  date,  4  of  17  patients  (24%)  were  no  longer  on  eculizumab  treatment.  Two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  completed the 26-week treatment period, but did not continue in the extension period. One patient  discontinued from the study 6 weeks from the first eculizumab dose due to adverse events which were not related to eculizumab. One patient  was discontinued due to a protocol violation (was diagnosed with SLE one week following dosing with eculizumab). Thus, a total of 13 (76%) patients continued into the extension treatment period.

Observations collected from the 8-week follow-up for the two patients who discontinued early and one of the two patients who did not continue in the extension treatment period showed that, at data cut-off date,  1  of  these  3  patients  (33%)  who  were  no  longer  on  study  drug,  had  an  ongoing  aHUS exacerbation post-transplant prior to study enrolment. One of the two patients who did not continue in the extension period, data were not collected during the 8-week follow-up period as the patient refused to continue participation in the study.

## Baseline disease characteristics

All patients initiated treatment rapidly after the aHUS exacerbation leading up to eculizumab therapy. Patients  were  experiencing  the  current  aHUS  exacerbation  for  a  median  (min;  max)  of  0.75  (0.23; 3.70) months prior to screening (Table 10). Seven patients (41%) had a history of kidney transplant. No  patient  had  a  history  of  nephrectomy.  Seven  patients  (41%)  were  experiencing  their  first presentation of aHUS.

As noted in Table 11, the median time from the aHUS diagnosis to screening that led to enrollment in the  study  was  9.70  months  (min;max:  0.26;  236  months).  Thus,  the  majority  of  patients  were receiving PT for an extended period of time for their aHUS exacerbation. Patients received an average of 5 ± 2 PT sessions in the 7 days prior to the first dose of eculizumab. All but one patient had at least 4  PT  sessions  in  the  week  prior  to  screening.  One  patient    had  to  discontinue  PT  after  2  sessions because of intolerance to PT (allergic reaction) and had no PT in the 7 days prior to eculizumab. Six patients (35%) required dialysis within 56 days of the first dose of eculizumab

## Primary endpoint:

## 1. Platelet Count Change from Baseline and Platelet Count Normalisation

The ANOVA of change from baseline platelet count at each post-dose day of measurement demonstrated a statistically significant ( P &lt;0.05) increase in platelet count as early as Day 7 and through 26 weeks (except Day 21). The point estimate change from baseline through 26 weeks was 72.7 x 10 9 /L (95% CI: 40.1-105.2; P =0.0001) (Table 13).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Day 7           |  17 |            42.2 |    0.0271 |
| Through Week 26 |  15 |            72.7 |    0.0001 |

Results of platelet count normalisation and the proportion of patients achieving first occurrence of normal platelet count (≥150 x 10 9 /L) from baseline through 26 weeks compared with those from baseline through data cut-off date were identical.

Overall, platelet counts increased and were within normal limits in 14 of 17 patients (82%; 95% CI: 57%-96%) during the eculizumab treatment period. As of the data cut-off date, the time to first occurrence of normal platelet count (≥ 150 x 10 9 /L) occurred as early as one day following the first eculizumab dose, with a median time of 7 days to achieve a first occurrence of platelet count normalisation (Figure 1).

Two of the 17 patients enrolled in this study had a platelet count ≥150 x 10 9 /L at baseline. Of the 15 patients with abnormal platelet count at baseline, 13 patients (87%) achieved platelet count normalisation (Table 14). Among patients with normalization of platelet count, the maximum duration of platelet count normalisation ranged from 14 to 64 weeks (98 to 448 days) after the first eculizumab dose, as of the data cut-off date (Figure 1).

## 2. Haematologic Normalisation

Haematologic Normalisation was achieved in the majority of patients. Overall, 13 of 17 patients (76%) achieved Haematologic Normalisation (95% CI: 50%-93%) (Table 15). Of the 10 patients with both abnormal platelet count and LDH at entry, 9 patients (90%) achieved Haematologic Normalisation. A similar proportion of patients achieved Haematologic  Normalisation with or without identified complement regulatory factor mutations or auto-antibodies.

## TMA Event-Free Status

15 patients (88%) achieved TMA Event-Free status, a key secondary endpoint. As of the data cut-off date, the median time to attain TMA Event-Free status was 12 weeks. The maximum length of TMA Event-Free status was sustained for a median duration of 38 weeks (14 to 64 weeks).

## Quality of life

A large proportion of patients (80% through 26 weeks and 87% through data cut-off) achieved an MID of 0.06 in the EuroQol 5D measurements, which did not seem to be affected by complement regulatory factor mutation status. Similar results were obtained with the VAS index scores, with both test results reflecting a positive improvement in health outcome and quality of life of the study patients.

## Subgroups analyses

Analyses of patient subgroups for the presence of complement regulatory factor mutations, duration of plasma therapy, dialysis, first clinical manifestation of TMA, age, sex, and race indicate that generally similar benefits were observed with eculizumab treatment in regard to the specific variables assessed within  these  subgroups  including  change  in  platelet  count,  TMA  event  free  status,  hematologic normalization,  complete  TMA  response,  change  in  eGFR  ≥15  mL/min/  1.73  m 2 ,  and  change  in hemoglobin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One important subgroup is the cohort of patients with a history of kidney transplant. Patients with and without prior kidney transplant have a similar response to eculizumab treatment with regard to change in  platelet  count,  TMA  event  free  status,  hematologic  normalization,  and  change  in  hemoglobin. Patients  with  a  prior  kidney  transplant  may  be  less  likely  to  demonstrate  a  clinically  meaningful improvement in kidney function compared to patients without a prior history of kidney transplant. Only 1 of 7 (14%) patients with a history of kidney transplant improve their renal function by at least 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2  compared to 7/10 (70%) patients without a history of transplant and 8/17 (47%) patients in the entire study population. Patients who have previously undergone kidney transplant, and thus are reduced to depending on only a single functioning kidney, may be more vulnerable to the post transplant  TMA  insult  and  therefore  less  able  to  experience  a  recovery  in  renal  function  when eculizumab is commenced following intensive PT as compared to patients with two functioning kidneys.

## Study C08-003A/B

## Design

This was an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-centre, controlled clinical trial of eculizumab in adults (≥ 18 years; Protocol C08-003A) and adolescents (between ages from 12 and up to 18 years weighing ≥ 40 kg; Protocol C08-003B) with aHUS receiving chronic PT.

This  study  was  an  open-label  study  and  no  prospective  control  groups  were  used.  Each  patient's historical experiences and data collected during the Observation Period were used as comparators in several statistical analyses

## Study Participants

Main inclusion/exclusion criteria included:

1. Male  or  female  patients  ≥  18  years  (C08-003A)  or  between  ages  12  and  up  to  18  years weighing ≥ 40 kg (C08-003B) and who have been diagnosed with aHUS..
2. Patients must have been receiving PT for aHUS and must have been observed to receive ≥ 1 PT  treatment  every  two  weeks  and  no  more  than  3  PT  treatments/week  (at  an  unchanged frequency) for at least 8 weeks before the first dose of eculizumab.
3. Platelet  Count  Pre-PT  Baseline  Set-Point  (collected  in  the  hours  before  the  Qualifying  PT Episode) was within 75% of the average of the Pre-PT platelet counts collected at screening and during the Observation Period.
4. Known  complement  regulatory  protein  genetic  abnormality,  i.e.,  a  mutation  in  Complement Protein  3,  factor  H  or  associated  factor,  factor  I,  MCP,  known  Factor  B  gain-of-function mutation, or known anti-CFH antibody ('aHUS lesions').

Patients diagnosed with aHUS were eligible and were assigned to one of the following parallel categories during the treatment period of the trial:

- Category 1: Factor H or Factor I functional deficiency, abnormal factor interaction (CFH/CFI FFP Group), or deletions of the CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes;
- Category 2: Complement Protein 3, abnormal factor interaction (C3) or Factor B Gain of Function;
- Category 3: Anti-CFH Antibody (Anti-CFH Group);
- Category 4: MCP deficiency (MCP Group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Patients diagnosed with aHUS without documented complement mutation or known anti-CFH antibody were eligible if other etiologies of HUS were ruled out as confirmed in the Exclusion Criteria  (i.e.,  including  Shiga-toxin  negative,  non-infectious,  non-drugexposure-  related  [i.e., cyclosporine]), no known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity, and antiphospholipid antibody negative). Patients meeting these conditions were assigned to Category 5. In addition, these patients underwent genetic testing to determine if a mutation could be identified. If a mutation was identified, the patient was reassigned to the appropriate category.
2. Lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  level  ≥  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  unless  the  patient  was receiving PE and LDH at the onset of the current aHUS exacerbation was at least the ULN. If LDH was normal at screening, other markers indicative of ongoing hemolysis were evaluated, such as haptoglobin, schistocytes, and discussed with the Sponsor;
3. Creatinine level ≥ ULN for age (patients who required acute dialysis for acute renal failure were also eligible).
4. Typical HUS (known Shiga toxin +) (exclusion criteria)

Patients who experienced an aHUS exacerbation or disease progression during the study that, in the opinion  of  the  investigator,  required  intervention  with  immunosuppressive  therapies  such  as  mTOR inhibitors  or  tacrolimus  were  to  be  discussed  between  the  Investigator  and  the  Sponsor  for consideration of study discontinuation. If patients who were status post (s/p) kidney transplant and had developed AMR (C4d positive renal biopsy), and for whom Rituximab and/or IVIg were deemed the appropriate therapy, then these patients would have been required to withdraw from the study and receive standard of care therapy. Patients were also required to undergo the 8-week follow-up period after discontinuation of eculizumab therapy.

## Treatments

Patients received the first dose of eculizumab between 1 and 6 hours after the completion of the PT session administered closest to the point in time eligibility was confirmed (known as the Qualifying PT Episode).

Eculizumab 600 mg, 900 mg or 1200 mg was administered intravenously according to the following regimens:

- Induction Period: patients received eculizumab 900 mg via IV infusion over approximately 35 minutes once a week (every 7 ± 2 days) for four weeks.
- Week 5: patients received 1200 mg eculizumab via IV infusion over approximately 35 minutes for the 5th dose (7 ± 2 days after 4th dose).
- Maintenance Period: after the fifth dose, patients received eculizumab 1200 mg via IV infusion over approximately 35 minutes every two weeks (every 14 ± 2 days).

If the physician administered PPH, PE, or FFP, 600 mg eculizumab was to be administered (i) within 60 minutes  after  each  PPH  or  PE  and  (ii)  within  60  minutes  prior  to  each  2  units  of  FFP  infusion, respectively.

The  Treatment  Period  commenced  with  the  first  eculizumab  dose.  The  first  26  weeks  of  treatment defined  the  time  period  for  assessments  of  the  endpoints.  Additionally,  when  available,  all  data collected in the extension period were also included in the assessment of efficacy and safety endpoints (up to data cut-off date), as detailed in the final SAP, Amendment 1. Patients were allowed to continue

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  receive  eculizumab  treatment  until  the  product  was  registered  and  available  to  treat  patients diagnosed with aHUS (in accordance with country specific regulation).

The treatment with IVIg and Rituximab were prohibited during the study:

Patients previously treated with IVIg were required to have an 8-week washout period and patients previously  treated  with  Rituximab  were  required  to  have  a  12-week  washout  period  prior  to  being enrolled in this study.

Patients  who  were  status  post  kidney  transplant  who  newly  developed  antibody  mediated  rejection (AMR) (C4d positive renal biopsy) and for whom Rituximab was deemed the appropriate therapy were required to withdraw from the study and received standard of care therapy.

The  following  concomitant  medications  and  therapy  during  the  study  were  allowed  under  certain circumstances and restrictions:

- Patients  receiving  other  immunosuppressive  therapies  such  as  steroids,  mTOR  inhibitors  or tacrolimus  were  allowed  to  participate  in  the  study  under  the  following  circumstances:  [1] therapies  were  part  of  an  established  post-transplant  anti-rejection  regime  and  dose  of  such medications were unchanged for at least 4 weeks prior to screening, or [2] patient had confirmed anti-CFH antibody requiring immunosuppressive therapy and dose of such medications must have been unchanged for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and throughout the Observation Period or [3] patient was experiencing an acute aHUS relapse immediately after transplant. In addition, a stable dose of these medications was maintained during the Treatment Period unless there was a discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor.
- Patients receiving erythrocyte stimulating agents (ESAs) were allowed to participate in the study if the patient had been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and throughout the Observation Period, or a washout period of at least 2 weeks after the last dose of ESA therapy. In addition,  a  stable  dose  of  these  medications  must  have  been  maintained  during  the  Treatment Period unless there was a discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor
- Use  of  any  other  investigational  drug  or  device  was  prohibited  beginning  four  weeks  prior  to screening and throughout the entire trial

After entry into the trial, patients were not permitted to receive PT during the time intervals specified in Table 21 (based on the Pre-Treatment PT Regimen), nor were they permitted to receive new dialysis within the first 48-hour period following the first eculizumab dose unless there was compelling medical need, as assessed by (i) a new decrease in platelet counts &gt; 25% below the Platelet Count Pre-PT Baseline Set-point value and to a level less than 150 x 10 9 /L; or (ii) a new decrease in platelet count below  40  x  10 9 /L;  or  (iii)  an  emergent  and  new  neurological,  renal,  or  other  clinical  event  as prospectively defined for each patient. If one of these conditions applied, then the physician may have, at his or her discretion, instituted PT sessions based on the clinical assessment of the patient and after discussion with the Sponsor. If the physician administered PPH, PE, or FFP, 600 mg eculizumab must have been administered (i) within 60 minutes after each PPH or PE and (ii) within 60 minutes prior to each 2 units of FFP infusion, respectively.

Patients who required chronic dialysis prior to entry into the study may have continued this treatment throughout the 48-hour period following the first dose of eculizumab. Exceptions to the rescue criteria were to be reviewed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis prior to administration on a case-bycase basis by the Sponsor.

Table 21: Plasma therapy as rescue therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Pre-TreatmentPTRegimen   | RescuePT Regimen                                                    |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| One PT per week          | No PT therapy within first 2 weeks following first eculizumab dose  |
| Two PTs per week         | No PT therapy within first 1 week following firsteculizumabdose     |
| Three PTs per week       | No PT therapy within first 96 hours following first eculizumab dose |

Patients were not permitted to receive PT after the first eculizumab dose unless there was a compelling medical need.

During  the  treatment  period,  PT  was  administered  in  response  to  a  confirmed  decrease  in  platelet count of &gt; 25% from the Platelet Count Pre-PT Baseline Set-Point value and a platelet count &lt;150 x 10 9 /L.

If,  at  any time during the treatment period, platelet counts decreased below 40 x 10 9 /L and/or new neurological, renal, or other clinical signs arose as prospectively defined for each patient, PT may have been administered at the Investigator's discretion to maintain a platelet count above the Platelet Count Pre-PT  Baseline  Set-Point  utilizing  the  same  regimen  employed  prior  to  initiation  of  eculizumab therapy.

Patients were not permitted to receive new dialysis within the first 48-hour period following the first dose  of  eculizumab  unless  there  was  compelling  medical  need  as  assessed  by  (i)  hypervolemia unresponsive to diuretics (ii) refractory electrolyte imbalance, or (iii) new-onset uremic encephalopathy, and after discussion with the Sponsor. Patients who required chronic dialysis prior to entry into the study may have continued this treatment throughout the 48-hour period following the first dose of eculizumab.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this study were to:

- Assess the effect of eculizumab on TMA Event-Free status during the treatment period through the first 26 weeks, defined as the absence for at least 12 weeks of [1] decrease in platelet count of &gt; 25% from the Platelet Count Pre-PT (Plasma Therapy) Baseline Set-Point; [2] PT while the patient is receiving eculizumab, and [3] new dialysis.
- If the primary study objective was met, then another primary objective was to assess the number of patients who achieved a Haematologic Normalization from baseline (BL) through 26 weeks as well  as  to  the  data  cut-off  date.  Haematologic  Normalization  was  defined  as  normalization  of platelet count and LDH sustained for at least two consecutive measurements for at least 4 weeks. This analysis was requested by the regulatory authorities.

The secondary objectives were as follows:

- Evaluate additional efficacy endpoints during the treatment period to the first 26 weeks as well as to the data cut-off date, such as the effect of eculizumab on:

-  TMA  Intervention  Rate  (#  PT  and  #  Dialysis  Events/Patient/Day)  at  the  end  of  the  first  26 weeks of the Treatment Period compared with the TMA Intervention Rate during the Observation Period to the first eculizumab dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Reduction of TMA as indicated by thrombocytopenia and measured by platelet count change from baseline during the first 26 weeks of the treatment period
- Quality of Life measures
- Renal function measures
- Hemoglobin levels
- LDH Response
- Complete TMA Response (analysis requested by the regulatory authorities)
- Characterize the overall safety and tolerability of eculizumab.
- Describe  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  properties  of  eculizumab  in patients with aHUS.
- Perform a series of exploratory efficacy analyses on the following by using the available data from the  pre-eculizumab  treatment  and  eculizumab  treatment  periods  to  quantify  differences  once patients begin treatment with eculizumab

## Statistical Methods and Sample size

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was used for all efficacy and safety analyses. The ITT population was defined as all patients who received any amount of eculizumab, and were considered evaluable for safety analyses. The first dose of eculizumab in the Treatment Period was considered as study Day 0. The study day was presented and calculated relative to the first dosing day.

The patient's data cut-off date for this study occurred on or before 18 October 2010, which afforded a minimum 26-week Treatment Period for all patients who continued in the study.

The main analysis for this study was based on the pooled data of the two protocols: the protocol for adult patients (C08-003A) and the protocol for adolescent patients (C08-003B).

With  a  total  of  20  patients  enrolled  between  both  protocols  and,  assuming  that  the  true  expected probability of TMA Event-Free exacerbation for eculizumab-treated patients is 40%, then the study had approximately 93.5% statistical power to detect a statistically significant difference from a minimum probability  (Ho:  P=Pmin  v/s  Ha:  P&gt;Pmin)  when  Pmin=10%,  80.8%  when  Pmin=15%,  and  61.0%  when Pmin=20%. Up to approximately 30 patients were to be enrolled between the protocols of adult and adolescent patients.

## Efficacy endpoints

For all efficacy endpoints, the main analyses were based on the pooled data from the two protocols: from protocol C08-003A for adult patients with aHUS and from protocol C08-003B, a similar protocol, for patients &lt;18 years of age for adolescent patients with aHUS

Although this study had two primary endpoints, they were not 'co-primary endpoints'. If the protocolspecified primary endpoint of TMA Event-Free status from baseline was statistically significant, then an additional efficacy primary endpoint of Hematologic Normalization was also evaluated. Hematologic Normalization was added as a primary efficacy endpoint after discussions with the regulatory authorities while TMA Event-Free status was mandated by the protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · TMA Event-Free Status

The point estimate and exact 95% CIs for the proportion of patients attaining a TMA Event-Free status from baseline through 26 weeks were calculated. This proportion (without 95% CIs) was calculated with and without identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibodies.

The time from Day 0 until the first occurrence of TMA Event-Free status was calculated and the CDF of the  time  to  first  occurrence  of  TMA  Event-Free  status  was  generated.  The  time  on  the  CDF  plot represents the target window Data points for individual patients were censored on the CDF plot if the response was sustained as of the date of study discontinuation or early termination.

Of note, TMA Event-Free status was defined as a state in which the patient did not have a PT session, new dialysis, and decrease in platelet count of &gt; 25% from baseline for at least 12 weeks (84 days) and the duration to attain this status is  at  least  84  days.  Therefore,  the  time  that  the  patient  first entered into a TMA Event-Free status is 84 days less than the time when the status is confirmed.

Duration of response is based on the interval in days between the time of  occurrence and the last response day or study day (data cut-off date) in which the patient is in TMA Event-Free status. The last response day was the day when the patient no longer met criteria for TMA Event-Free.

## · Haematologic Normalization

## · Secondary endpoints:

- TMA Intervention Rate (# PT and # Dialysis Events/Patient/Day) at the end of the first 26 weeks of the Treatment Period compared with the TMA Intervention Rate during the Observation Period to the first eculizumab dose

- Reduction of TMA as indicated by thrombocytopenia and measured by platelet count change from baseline during the first 26 weeks of the treatment period

- Quality of Life measures
- Renal function measures
- Hemoglobin levels
- LDH Response
- Complete TMA Response (analysis requested by the regulatory authorities)
- Characterize the overall safety and tolerability of eculizumab.

- Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) properties of eculizumab in patients with aHUS

## Results Participant flow

A total of 23 patients were enrolled in this study. Two patients  failed the screening process and one patient withdrew due to personal reasons (Alexion Note to File 02 Feb 2011). Therefore, twenty patients were treated with eculizumab between the protocol for adult patients (C08-003A, 15 adult patients) and the separate protocol for adolescent patients (C08-003B, 5 adolescent patients). All 23 patients were included in the individual data listings. For efficacy and safety analyses, the 20 patients who received at least one dose of eculizumab were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol for Study C08-003A/B was finalised on 05 Nov 2008 and was subsequently amended four times:

Key changes from the initial Protocol C08-003A/B included:

- Changes in the inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Inclusion of additional efficacy endpoints
- Change from PP analysis to ITT analysis
- Analysis based on the adolescents and the adult protocols alone were not performed
- Changes to the Planned Analyses as Described in the Final SAP

Several patients had normal LDH at the time of screening due to frequent PT administration. The original protocol (Inclusion Criterion 6) required that LDH level be &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening. Protocol (Version 1) was subsequently amended (Version 2) to allow normal LDH levels at time of screening with requirement that patient had been receiving PE and LDH at the onset of the current aHUS episode was at least ULN or other markers indicative of ongoing hemolysis were present, such as low haptoglobin levels or presence of schistocytes.

Most patients were on immunosuppressant medications and/or Erythrocyte Stimulating Agents (ESAs). Exclusion Criteria 32 and 33 of the protocol required that the dose of immunosuppressant and ESAs remained unchanged in the 4 weeks prior to screening. The changes in dosing were made according to the patients' medical condition. These changes in dosing in the 4 weeks prior to screening did not confound the efficacy endpoints of the study.

## Baseline disease characteristics

As shown in Table 24, most patients in this study had a long history of aHUS with a median time from first diagnosis to screening of 48 months. Of the 20 patients treated with eculizumab, 8 patients (40%) had at least one kidney transplant.

The majority of patients had platelet count ≥ 150 x10 9 /L (17/20, 85%) and normal LDH (16/20, 80%) at entry as these parameters were maintained by the ongoing chronic PT. As might be expected as a consequence of chronic PT, all patients had various degrees of renal insufficiency and 10 patients (50%) had either severe or very severe renal insufficiency (CKD Stage 4 and 5), including 2 patients on chronic dialysis.

## Primary endpoint:

## 1. TMA Event-Free Status

A substantial majority of patients receiving eculizumab in the study (16 of 20 patients [80%; 95% CI: 56- 94]) achieved the primary endpoint of TMA Event-Free Status through Week 26, which was sustained for a median time duration of approximately 40 weeks (280 days) as of the data cut-off date. The median time to attain a confirmed TMA Event-Free status was 12 weeks (84 days).

The four patients who did not achieve TMA event-free status had normal platelet count at study entry and maintained these levels (≥ 150 x 10 9 /L) during the Treatment Period. However, at certain time points, these patients had changes in their platelet count that exceeded the strict criteria of less than 25% change from baseline required for achieving a TMA event-free status.

The cumulative incidence, i.e., the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), of the TMA Event-Free status was also estimated and plotted and shown in Figure 1 below. Duration of response is based on the interval in days between the time of occurrence and the last response day or study day (data cut-off date) in which the patient is in TMA event-free status. As of the data cut-off date, the duration of response in patients ranged from 126 to 364 days

## 2. Hematologic Normalisation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Haematologic normalisation was achieved in almost all patients, demonstrating maintenance of normal platelet count after discontinuation of PT and start of eculizumab therapy. As shown in Table 28 below, a total of 18 out of 20 patients (90%; 95% CI: 68-99) achieved Hematologic Normalization, including 1 of the 3 patients who had baseline platelet count &lt;150 x 10 9 /L. Similar proportion of patients achieved Hematologic Normalisation with or without identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody.

| Positive for Complement Regulatory FactorMutation or Auto-Antibody(n=14)  | 13/14 (93)                                             | 13                        | 294 (181; 336)            |
| No Identified Complement Regulatory FactorMutation or Auto-Antibody (n=6) | 5/6 (83)                                               | 5                         | 203 (154; 363)            |

Platelet count and LDH responses to eculizumab, as of the data cut-off date, are summarised as follows:

- For the 2 of the 3 patients with abnormal platelet count at baseline, platelet count normalization was achieved in 1 and 7 days following the first eculizumab dose (Figure 10). Only one of these 2 patients achieved the platelet count normalization state required for Hematologic Normalization  and maintained it for 301 days.

- For the 4 patients with abnormal LDH at baseline, the time to first occurrence of LDH normalization occurred between 3 and 14 days following the first eculizumab dose, with a median time of 7 days to achieve the first occurrence of LDH normalization (Figure 11). LDH normalization was sustained from 28 to 48 weeks (196 to 336 days) after the first eculizumab dose (Figure 11).

The median time to the first occurrence of Hematologic Normalisation was 1 day (Figure 9). Maximum length of Hematologic Normalisation was sustained for a median duration of approximately 38 weeks (267 days) and ranged from 22 to 52 weeks (154 to 363 days). All patients who achieved Hematologic Normalisation while on eculizumab continued to show normal platelet count or normal LDH levels at the date of the last record (as of the data cut-off date) (Figure 9).

## Key Secondary endpoints TMA Intervention Rate

The TMA Intervention Rate was reduced from a median of 0.23 events/person/day to 0 events/person/day (Table 29). The difference in the TMA intervention rates prior to eculizumab treatment versus the eculizumab treatment period, as assessed using the signed rank test, was statistically significant (P &lt;0.0001).

## Complete TMA Response

Complete TMA Response (analysis requested by the regulatory authorities.), was defined as Hematologic Normalisation plus improvement in renal function (25% reduction from baseline in serum creatinine, which was sustained for two consecutive measurements which span a period of at least four weeks)

Complete TMA Response was observed in 5 out of 20 patients (25%; 95% CI: 9-49) (Table 30). One (out of five patients treated for their first presentation of aHUS achieved a Complete TMA Response. This might be expected considering the chronic status of these patients and, particularly of the renal impairment. The question remains on how many patients decreased renal function while on eculizumab treatment. Complete TMA Response rates were similar in patients with or without identified complement regulatory factor mutations or auto-antibodies

## Platelet Count Change From Baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The ANOVA of change from baseline platelet count at each on-treatment day of measurement through 26 weeks (Day 182) demonstrated a statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) increase on Days 14 and 21 after the start of eculizumab treatment

Table 31: Statistical assessment of change from baseline platelet counts

| Study Day         |   N |   PointEstimate | D %≤6        |   P-value |
|-------------------|-----|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Day 14            |  20 |           32.18 | 9.44; 54.92  |    0.0066 |
| Day 21            |  20 |           32.08 | 9.34:54.82   |    0.0067 |
| Week 26 (Day 182) |  20 |            5.28 | -17.46:28.02 |    0.6424 |

Platelet count normalization (≥150 x 10 9 /L) was achieved in 18 out of 20 (90%) patients. Patients with normal platelet count at baseline maintained that level after PT was discontinued and the switch to eculizumab treatment initiated. Platelet count remained stable with a minimal mean increase of 5.3 × 10 9 cells/L by Week 26.

*Sustained is defined as two consecutive visits spanning at least four weeks

## Quality of life

Results  from  the  EuroQol  5D  Quality  of  Life  instrument  comparing  scores  between  baseline  and  26 weeks indicated statistically significant (P &lt;0.0001) improvements in QoL with eculizumab. Improvements  were  also  statistically  significant  (P&lt;0.05)  in  the  EuroQol  5D  scores  from  baseline through the data cut-off date. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of evaluable patients, 8 out of 11 patients (73%) achieved a minimally important difference (MID) of 0.06 in the EuroQol 5D to the data cut-off date and Week 26.

## Other secondary endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From  baseline  to  the  data  cut-off  date,  10  of  20  patients  (50%;  95%  CI:  27-73)  experienced  an improvement in hemoglobin of at least 20 g/L and a large majority of patients, 19 of 20 patients (95%, 95% CI: 75-100), experienced decreased LDH levels below the ULN during the eculizumab treatment period.

Prior  to  the  start  of  eculizumab  treatment  (pre-treatment  or  Observation  Period),  all  20  patients required PT and all 20 patients (100%) did not require PT during eculizumab treatment through to the data  cut-off  date  (at  least  26  weeks).  The  comparison  of  the  PT  rates  from  the  signed-rank  test showed  a  statistically  significant  (P-value=  &lt;0.0001)  decrease  in  the  PT  rates  during  eculizumab treatment

## Subgroups analyses

There  were  no  apparent  differences  in  any  of  the  endpoints  between  patients  with  complement regulatory  factor  mutations  or  auto-antibodies  compared  with  those  with  no  identified  complement regulatory  factor  mutations  or  auto-antibodies.  There  was  no  examination  of  efficacy  or  safety  by demographic (e.g., race, age) characteristics for this study report

## Updated results from studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B

To  further  support  the  sustained  efficacy  and  demonstrate  the  long-term  benefit  of  eculizumab treatment  in  aHUS  patients,  Alexion  conducted  an  updated  analysis  of  the  prospective  trials  with approximately 6 months of additional follow-up. All patients from studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B who were on treatment at the time of the submission data cut-off remained on treatment at the time of this follow up analysis (Table 1). All efficacy data were collected until March 15, 2011. The median follow-up was 64 weeks in study C08-002A/B and 62 weeks in study C08-003A/B. A total of 5 patients (4 in study C08-002A/B) and 1 in study C08-003A/B) had discontinued eculizumab therapy at the time of the initial submission and none discontinued therapy during the extended follow-up period. In study C08-002A/B, 13/13 patients who remained on therapy have a follow-up period of at least 52 weeks. In study C08-003A/B, the corresponding number was 15/19 patients.

## Study C08-002A/B

With  longer  follow-up,  a  sustained  improvement  in  some  of  the  clinical  response  parameters  was observed including platelet count normalization, haematologic normalization, complete TMA response, decrease  in  creatinine  ≥25%,  CKD  improvement  and  haemoglobin  improvement  (Table  2).  These efficacy  measures  illustrate  that  although  responses  usually  occur  rapidly  as  demonstrated  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

original  submission,  some  patients  required  longer  duration  of  treatment  before  achieving  key improvements in haematologic and renal function despite early control of the TMA process.

The duration of response to eculizumab treatment has been remarkable. At the time of this update, all patients maintained their response with the exception of one patient  who lost TMA event-free status due to 5 plasma therapy sessions after 9 months of eculizumab therapy. All patients who achieved platelet normalisation, improvement in renal function, haematologic normalisation and complete TMA response maintained that response at the time of the last follow-up.

## Study C08-003A/B

With the additional follow-up period, there was evidence that patients who were on chronic eculizumab continue to derive important clinical benefit over time (Table 3). Overall, we observed an increase in the  rate  of  complete  TMA  response  as  well  as  a  significant  improvement  in  renal  function  in  some patients over this extended treatment duration (Figs. 6 and 7).

## 3.3.3.3. Clinical studies in special populations

## Study C09-001r

## Design

This was a retrospective data collection trial consisting of male or female patients with a diagnosis of aHUS  and  who  fulfilled  the  predefined  parameters  (had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  eculizumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outside of an Alexion-sponsored controlled clinical trial between 2007 and Dec 2009). These patients had  never  participated  in,  nor  were  concurrently  participating  in  a  controlled  trial  of  eculizumab. Alexion  contacted  the  physicians  of  the  pre-identified  patients  to  discuss  the  nature,  design  and objectives of the study trial and their willingness to participate in the retrospective trial. Subsequently, the pre-identified patients (or legal guardian, if patient was a minor) were contacted by their treating physician and provided an ICF or IA.

This  retrospective  study  consists  of  30  patients  (paediatric,  adolescent  and  adults)  who  had  been treated  with  eculizumab  for  de  novo  or  recurrent  aHUS  outside  of  an  Alexion-sponsored  controlled clinical  trial.  The  C09-001r  is  a  retrospective  study  with  no  control  groups.  In  several  statistical analyses, each patient's historical experiences (if available) and data collected prior to the first dose of eculizumab treatment were used as comparators to the data collected during eculizumab treatment.

## Study Participants

Inclusion/exclusion criteria included:

1. Male or female patients of any age who had been diagnosed with aHUS.
2. Received at least one dose of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS between 2007 and 2009 outside of an Alexion-sponsored clinical trial.
3. Patients  who  had  participated  or  who  were  concurrently  participating  in  a  controlled  clinical trial of eculizumab. (exclusion criterium)

## Treatments

This  is  a  retrospective  data  collection  study  and  therefore  no  treatments  were  prescribed.  The treatment period described below refers to the physicians' use of commercial Soliris and structure of the data collection.

This study was divided into four periods of retrospective observation (Initial Pre-Treatment, 30 DayPre-Treatment, Treatment and the Post Treatment Period whenever data was available). The type of treatment  received  for  aHUS  prior  to  the  treatment  period  may  have  included  plasma  therapy, immunosuppressant  therapy,  kidney  transplant,  nephrectomy,  dialysis,  and/or  supportive  care.  The Treatment  Period  commenced  with  the  first  eculizumab  dose  administered  intravenously.  The  total duration of the eculizumab treatment varied for each patient, ranging from a single dose to chronic therapy.

The treatment or the time of the last eculizumab dose or the signing of ICF/IAF for this trial (if the patient is continuing on drug at the signing of the ICF/IAF) defined the time period for assessments of the study endpoints attributed to eculizumab.

For patients in this study, the eculizumab regimen administered was determined at the discretion of the  Investigator/treating  physician.  Physicians  treating  patients  in  the  off-label  setting  generally requested dosing suggestions from Alexion. The dosing regimen recommended for all adolescent and adult patients weighing at least 40 kg was that specified in the prospective aHUS clinical studies (C08002A/B  and  C08-003A/B).  The  dosing  regimen  recommended  for  pediatric  and  adolescent  patients weighing  less  than  40  kg  was  defined  based  on  body  weight.  The  dose  levels  of  eculizumab administered to patients by the physicians were provided by Alexion and based on recommendations according  to  PK-PD  modeling.  The  actual  dose  administered  to  some  patients  in  this  retrospective study may have been different from the recommendations since treatment was outside of a controlled clinical trial setting. Dose levels used on this study were 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg and 1200 mg.

## Objectives

The objective of this retrospective trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in aHUS patients  treated  with  at  least  one  dose  of  eculizumab  outside  of  an  Alexion-sponsored  controlled clinical trial.

## Statistical Methods and Sample size

Descriptive statistics of efficacy parameters were presented for 30 Day-Pre-Treatment and during the Treatment period (whenever data were available). Changes in parameters occurring during treatment were compared to the baseline value.

The  platelet  count  change  from  baseline  was  evaluated  by  a  model  which  used  target  day  as  a classification variable. Time and baseline (BL) were the main effects. Patient entered the model as a random  effect.  Repeated  measurements  made  in  time  within  each  patient  were  modelled  using  an appropriate variance-covariance matrix structure.

The difference in the pre- and during treatment TMA intervention rates was calculated for each patient using a five-step algorithm. The P-value for this test came from a two-sided signed rank test.

Renal function parameters, creatinine and eGFR, were assessed by frequency counts, proportions, and exact 95% CI's for obtained pre-treatment and during treatment and change from baseline to the end of study were produced. Shifts in CKD stage by Target Day were generated to determine whether renal function improved or worsened. Additional analyses on patients whose eGFR improved by at least 15 mL/min/(1.73 m 2 ) from baseline, whose creatinine decreased at least 25% from BL through and who improved at least one stage in CKD from baseline  through 26 weeks and until the date of the last record  were  produced.  Analyses  for  renal  function  was  performed  for  all  patients  as  well  as  for subgroups  defined  by  presence  or  absence  of  complement  factor  mutations.  Exact  95%  CI's  were produced only in the analysis where all patients were grouped together.

Frequency  counts,  proportions,  and  exact  95%  CI's  for  patients  whose  hemoglobin  improved  by  at least 20 g/L and whose LDH was below the respective ULN from baseline through 26 weeks and at until the date of the last record were produced and categorized by with or without identified complement mutation.

Efficacy endpoints and endpoints requested by the regulatory authorities (Haematologic Normalisation and Complete TMA Response) were based largely on analyses that were planned for the prospective studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B.

For inferential statistics of efficacy, the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method of imputation of  missing  values  was  performed  for  platelet  count  until  Week  26.  For  patients  with  missing  values observed after at least one post-baseline measurement, the last post- baseline assessment observed prior  to  the  particular  missing  observation  was  used  as  the  LOCF  value  for  that  observation.  For patients where only a baseline value existed, no LOCF imputation was performed.

In this retrospective study, patients were assessed for change in platelet count from baseline, platelet count  normalization,  the  TMA  Event-Free  status  and  the  TMA  intervention  rates  including  the proportion  of  patients  who  successfully  discontinued  PT.  Additional  endpoints  were  also  assessed. Given the nature of a retrospective data collection, extent of dosing, frequency of laboratory testing and  tests  performed  were  variable.  Some  of  the  pre-specified  analyses  (also  used  in  the  two prospective studies), in particular the composite endpoints of Hematologic Normalization and Complete

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TMA Response, had important analytical limitations. Due to these limitations, a sponsor assessment was performed using criteria similar to those which were applied in the prospective studies.

The available PK and PD results for some patients where PK/PD tests were requested by their treating physicians were tabulated. A population PK/PD analysis of eculizumab was performed using data from adult and adolescent patients with plasma therapy-resistant aHUS (C08-002A/B) and plasma therapy sensitive  aHUS  (C08-003A/B)  patients,  and  data  from  paediatric,  adolescent  and  adult  patients collected on a retrospective basis (C09-001r).

## Efficacy endpoints

## • Platelet count

The platelet count change from baseline will be evaluated using two different classes of models which are differentiated by the use of study day as either a classification variable or as a continuous variable.

• Difference in TMA intervention rates pre- and postdose

TMA  intervention  rate  is  defined  as  the  number  of  Plasma  Therapy  or  Dialysis  Events  per  day  per patient.  The  TMA  Intervention  Rate  during  the  Treatment  Period  will  be  compared  with  the  TMA Intervention Rate in the one month (four weeks) prior to the first dose of eculizumab.

• TMA event-free status

TMA Event-Free status is defined as the absence for at least 12 weeks of [1] decrease in platelet count of &gt;25% from the baseline platelet count; [2] PT while the patient is receiving eculizumab, and; [3] new dialysis while the patient is receiving eculizumab. The time to start of first TMA Event-Free state and the average maximum duration of TMA Event-Free status will be calculated.

• Hemoglobin

Frequency  counts,  proportions,  and  exact  95%  CI's  for  patients  whose  hemoglobin  improved  by  at least 20 g/L at the end of study involvement will be produced.

· Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Frequency counts, proportions, and exact 95% CI's for patients whose LDH was below the respective Upper Limit of Normal will be produced.

• Parameters associated with renal function

Frequency counts, proportions, and exact 95% CI's for patients who improved at least one CKD stage from BL to the end of study will be produced. Additional analyses on patients whose eGFR improved by at least 15 mL/min/(1.73 m^2), and whose creatinine decreased at least 25% will be produced.

• Parameters associated with intravascular hemolysis

Markers  of  intravascular  hemolysis  include  assessments  such  as  haptoglobin  levels  and  presence  of schistocytes. Any of these measurements which exist in the data will be listed.

• Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures as available

Since PK and PD tests were performed on some patients at the requests of their treating physicians the available PK and PD results from those patients will be listed and summarized.

• Major adverse vascular event (MAVE) rate

All MAVE events that occur pre-treatment and during treatment periods will be listed and tabulated. Any MAVE events that occurred prior to this study and are recorded in the data base will be listed and tabulated.

Following the analyses in the prospective studies, two post-hoc efficacy endpoints have been added to this study. Assessing these post-hoc efficacy endpoints involve determining if certain lab parameters are  in  normalized  states.  Time  in  the  Post-Treatment  period  will  be  included  in  the  calculation  of duration of these states.

- Hematological Normalization

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hematological Normalization requires normalization of both platelet count and LDH.

- Complete TMA Response

Complete TMA Response is defined as hematological normalization plus improvement in renal function

## Results Participant flow

Alexion was able to identify 36 patients who were diagnosed with aHUS and treated with eculizumab between 2007 and Dec 2009 outside the two Alexion-sponsored controlled clinical trials. Data were compiled retrospectively for aHUS patients undergoing treatment with eculizumab in an uncontrolled clinical setting.

Of the 36 patients identified, 30 patients agreed to participate. The remaining six patients were not included in the trial for the following reasons: two patients declined participation and the treating physicians for four other patients declined participation in this retrospective trial. Data from 30 patients were collected and presented in this report. The disposition of the 30 patients whose data has been collected is presented below in Table 34.

Four of the 30 patients were not evaluable to assess the efficacy of eculizumab to control TMA associated with aHUS. One adult patient had a TMA episode following bone marrow transplant, and another adult patient had stable disease and did not require PT intervention prior to eculizumab treatment. The remaining two patients were without evidence of clinical manifestations of aHUS disease.

## Baseline disease characteristics

Patients were diagnosed with aHUS for a median (Min; Max) of 10.9 (0.23; 175.90) months prior to the first eculizumab dose. Fourteen of 30 patients (47%) in this retrospective study had at least 2 aHUS exacerbations since initial diagnosis including kidney transplant in 11 patients (37%). Twelve patients (40%) were experiencing their first aHUS presentation. Patients were experiencing the current aHUS exacerbation for a median (min; max) of 1.28 (0.07; 15.77) months prior to the first dose of eculizumab.

Twenty-eight of the 30 patients had a disease history consistent with PT-resistant and chronic PT populations. The remaining two patients exhibited no clinical manifestations of aHUS; one patient was treated with eculizumab following kidney transplant and the other patient was being prepared for kidney transplant but died of complications of vascular surgery of the carotid artery. Twenty patients enrolled in this study with aHUS were assessed by the Sponsor to be PT resistant (similar to the prospective study C08-002A/B) based on a current duration of aHUS exacerbation of ≤ 2 months. Eight patients enrolled in this study with aHUS were assessed by the Sponsor to be chronic PT (PT-sensitive) patients (similar to the prospective study C08-003A/B) based on a current duration of aHUS exacerbation of &gt;2 months.

Patient aHUS disease history is summarised in Table 36.

Eleven patients (37%) required dialysis for renal failure prior to receiving eculizumab. The majority of patients (24 of 30 patients) received at least one PT session within 28 days prior to the first dose of eculizumab. An average of eight PT sessions was recorded per patient prior to the administration of eculizumab.

Patient current aHUS exacerbation/presentation history is summarised in Table 37.

Thirteen of 30 patients (43%) had low platelet count (&lt;150x10 9 /L) at baseline, and 20 of 30 patients (67%) had an LDH level above the ULN at baseline.

Overall nine patients had both abnormal platelet count and LDH level at entry, which included six of 12 patients (50%) experiencing their first aHUS presentation. A total of 24 patients (80%) had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The eGFR was consistent with Stage 4 or Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 13 patients. Baseline laboratory values for the patients in this retrospective trial are summarised in Table 38.

## Efficacy endpoints:

## 1. Platelet Count Change From Baseline and Platelet Count Normalization

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean change from baseline platelet count at each on-treatment target day of measurement demonstrated a statistically significant increase in platelet count as early as 14 days (P=0.0007) and up to 364 days (52 weeks) after the first eculizumab dose. By Week 52, the mean increase from baseline was 84x10 9 /L (P=0.0173). Overall, the results of the mean change from baseline platelet count analysis using the LOCF imputation method were similar to the results of the analysis without LOCF

Overall, platelet counts increased and were sustained within normal limits in 25 of 30 patients (83%; 95% CI: 65%-94%) during the eculizumab treatment period (Table 39). Of the 13 patients with abnormal platelet count at baseline, 10 patients (77%) achieved platelet count normalization as shown in Table 39. The first occurrence of normal platelet count ( ≥ 150x10 9 /L) was observed on the same day as the first eculizumab dose (Figure 14). This included patients who had normal platelet count at baseline and maintained normal platelet count as well as those who normalized their platelet count from an abnormal baseline count. Among responders, the maximum duration of platelet count normalization ranged from five to 92 weeks (32 to 646 days) after the first eculizumab dose, as of the data cut-off date

## 2. TMA Intervention Rate

Prior to the initiation of eculizumab (within 28 days prior to the first dose), 24 of 30 (80%) patients required PT and 11 of 30 patients (37%) received dialysis for renal failure.

There were only two patients (7%) who required a TMA intervention with new dialysis during eculizumab treatment. One patient received dialysis 3 times weekly from Days 14 to 30, and another patient received dialysis on Days 18 and 19 and started receiving new dialysis three times weekly for approximately 1 month, starting on Day 48.

Dialysis was still ongoing at the time of the last record for the first patient. A total of 9 patients (30%) received a TMA intervention with PT during treatment with eculizumab.

The median TMA intervention rate significantly decreased from 0.34 PT events/patient/day to 0 PT events/patient/day. The difference in the TMA intervention rates prior to eculizumab treatment compared to the eculizumab treatment period, as assessed using the signed rank test, was statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001).

## 3. TMA Event-Free Status Data

Twenty of 30 patients [67%, 95% CI: 47%-83%] achieved TMA Event-Free status. The proportion of patients achieving TMA Event-Free status appeared to be higher in patients with identified complement regulatory factor mutations or auto-antibodies (71%), as compared to patients without mutations in complement regulatory factor (44%).

As of the end of study involvement date, the median time to attain TMA Event-Free status, as assessed using the cumulative incidence, was 14 days and the median time to attain a confirmed TMA EventFree status was 88 days. Maximum length of TMA Event-Free status was sustained for a median duration of 31 weeks (214 days) and ranged from 18 to 92 weeks (123 to 646 days). Furthermore, there was no apparent difference in the maximum number of days of TMA Event-Free status between patients with or without identified complement regulatory factor mutations or auto-antibodies

## 4. Changes in Hemoglobin

Nineteen of 30 patients (63%) showed at least an improvement in hemoglobin of 20 g/L or more during the study (Table 42). Sustained improved in hemoglobin by at least 20 g/L for at least 4 weeks was reported by 13 of 30 patients (43%; 95% CI: 25%; 63%). Patient's with or without identified complement regulatory factor mutations or auto-antibodies showed similar frequencies of sustained hemoglobin improvement.

## 7. Sponsor Assessment: Haematological Normalisation and Complete TMA Response

In this retrospective study, extent of dosing, frequency of laboratory testing and tests performed were variable.  Some  of  the  pre-specified  analyses  used  in  the  two  prospective  studies  (in  particular  the composite  endpoints  of  Hematologic  Normalization  and  complete  TMA  response)  had  important analytical  limitations.  Due  to  these  limitations,  a  sponsor  assessment  was  performed  using  criteria similar to those which were applied in the prospective studies.

Five categories of responses were used:

- Hematologic  normalization:  Normalization  of  platelet  count  and  LDH  levels  in  patients  who  had abnormal platelet counts at baseline or immediately prior to baseline. The LDH criterion was waved if no LDH measurement was reported during eculizumab therapy.
- Complete TMA response: Hematologic normalization and improvement in renal function, defined as a ≥ 25% decrease in serum creatinine from baseline.
- Stable biologic parameters: Stable platelet counts (no more than 25% decrease) and, stable LDH levels (no more than 25% increase) during eculizumab therapy and during the period immediately preceding eculizumab therapy while on PT.
- No response
- Not  evaluable:  Patients  whose  disease  could  not  be  evaluated  due  to  confounding  factors  or concomitant disease. Reasons for the not evaluable status were recorded

Twenty patients were categorized as plasma therapy resistant (durations of current TMA manifestation &lt;2 months) and eight patients were categorized as plasma therapy sensitive (duration of current TMA manifestations ≥ 2 months). Two patients were not categorized as either PT-resistant or PT-sensitive because they did not have evidence of active TMA manifestations at baseline. One adolescent patient who had a nephrectomy,  started  on  eculizumab  as  a  preparation  for  kidney  transplant  but  died  of complication  of  vascular  surgery;  the  other  pediatric  patienthad  a  kidney  transplant  and  started eculizumab 11 days after transplantation.

Based on sponsor assessment, ten patients achieved Haematologic Normalization and Complete TMA Response. In these 10 patients the median duration of current episode was 31 days (range 2-60). Ten other  patients  achieved  stable  biological  parameters  while  on  PT.  While  on  eculizumab,  these parameters remained stable after discontinuation of PT.

## Conclusion on retrospective paediatric study (C09-001r)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data  from  the  retrospective  study  appear  to  demonstrate  that  the  efficacy  of  eculizumab  in  the paediatric population is similar to that seen in adult patients. In the paediatric population, as in the adult  population,  there  were  important  differences  between  patients  with  a  short  duration  of  aHUS clinical complication (similar to patients included in study C08-002A/B) and patients with long duration of clinical aHUS complication (similar to patient on chronic PT). Almost all patients exhibited a reduced TMA process without the support of plasma therapy as illustrated by the observation of platelet count normalization  and  the  achievement  of  TMA  event-free  status  (Table  2).  As  seen  in  adult  patients, improvement in renal function was seen in patients with a short duration of aHUS reflecting the acute injury  of  the  TMA  process  on  the  kidney.  A  long  duration  of  current  aHUS  episode  can  lead  to irreversible kidney damage and no improvement in renal function was documented despite achieving control of the TMA process in these patients.

## Preliminary Data from ongoing paediatric Study C10-003

In  September  2010,  following  the  recommendation  of  Paediatric  Committee  (PDCO)  as  written  and agreed upon in the PIP, Alexion initiated a prospective study in paediatric aHUS patients from ages 1 month to less than18 years old. As of today, four patients have been accrued (data not shown).

## 3.3.3.4. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The  MAH  did  not  carry  out  any  statistical  integration  or  comparison  of  the  two  prospective  studies although a comparison and analyses of results across studies has been performed.

## 3.3.3.5. Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

To support this indication, the company presented 2 clinical trials and 1 retrospective study in aHUS patients.

Both clinical trials, Study C08-002A/B and Study C08-003A/B, share a similar design:  open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm multi-center, controlled clinical trial of eculizumab in adults and adolescents (between 12 to 18 years weighing ≥40 kg). They mainly differ in the studied population and in the selection of the primary endpoint, although all in all both studies assessed the same parameters. Study C08-002 included a population refractory to plasma therapies defined as aHUS patients who did not respond or insufficiently responded to, or were intolerant to aggressive PT. Study C08-003 included a less severe population stable on chronic PT.

The  primary  endpoint  of  platelet  normalization  is  relevant  to  the  patient  and  the  magnitude  of  the observed  effect  (82%;  95%  CI:  57%-96%)  is  considered  clinically  significant.  These  results  are supported by the results of Haematologic Normalisation that was achieved by 76% of patients (95% CI:50-93%). Of relevance is also the accomplishment of the secondary endpoints of TMA intervention rate, TMA event free status and Complete TMA response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results in those patients sensitive to PT, Study 003A/B, also showed that eculizumab might also provide  some  benefit  in  this  subset  of  patients.  Outcomes  from  the  PT-resistant  study  were  very relevant  in  the  context  of  a  population  which  did  not  improve  with  the  usual  treatment  (ie  PT). However, the population recruited in this trial (003, PT-sensitive) achieved some clinical benefit from the PT. In this regard, it should be noted that these patients underwent a mean of 1.5 PT sessions within 7 days prior to the first dose of eculizumab and most patients had normal platelet count and normal LDH at entry. On the contrary, in the study C08-002, the patients received 5 ± 2 PT sessions in the  7  days  prior  to  the  first  dose  of  eculizumab  and  all  but  two  patients  had  an  abnormal  platelet count.  Having  said  that,  the  use  of  eculizumab  in  this  setting  (PT-sensitive  patients)  could  be interpreted as an alternative pharmacological therapy to PT, and also hampering further renal damage. The results from study C08-003 (PT-sensitive population) could not show outstanding results in this regard  but  it  has  to  be  acknowledged  that  the  results  from  some  patients  stress  some  grade  of improvement in the renal function and even there appear to be some data that could suggest a better prognosis  in  renal  transplant  recipients.  Nonetheless,  no  conclusive  data  are  available  and  the uncertainties  on  the  potential  long-term  renal  function  protection  remain.  However,  the  available results in this population are considered sufficiently relevant to support a broad indication in the aHUS population.

Regarding the update from the prospective studies C08-002 and C08-003 (until 64-62 weeks), it is worth highlighting that the efficacy of Soliris, in the maintenance of the platelet count and replacement of plasma therapy in PT-sensitive patients, continues and even increases the renal outcomes with this treatment.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  use  of  eculizumab  in  aHUS  patients  is  so  far,  an  effective treatment in these patients.

Until  now,  there  was  the  concern  about  the  maintenance  of  the  effect,  but  considering  the  data submitted by the company, a relevant clinical effect can be concluded (normalization of platelet count, maintenance of platelet levels, TMA event-free status).

The available evidence in the paediatric aHUS population shows similar results to those seen in adults. A clinically relevant benefit in the PT-resistant population is demonstrated. There is normalization in the platelet count and a real improvement in the renal function. As in adults, this clinical benefit is less pronounced in the PT-sensitive subset, since the platelet count could not be a good variable to show the efficacy in this population and the renal function is not significantly improved, given the status of the kidney at this stage of the disease. However, eculizumab has demonstrated so far to be a valid and convenient alternative to PT in the subset of PT-sensitive paediatric aHUS patients. Although further evidence in support of the potential long-term renal protection might be welcomed, the difficulties are acknowledged and the available evidence are deemed sufficiently relevant so as to support the broad claimed indication.

## 3.3.4. Clinical safety

The evaluation of the safety of eculizumab in the treatment of patients with aHUS is based on data from  all  clinical  studies  included  in  this  application  up  to  their  respective  data  cut-off  dates.    The analyses of patients in the two phase 2 prospective clinical trials (C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B) forms the basis for the primary safety analysis (Table 50). These two studies accrued a total of 37 patients who received at least one dose of eculizumab.  In addition, safety information on patients with aHUS treated  with  eculizumab  outside  the  two  prospective  clinical  trials  will  be  summarized  for  the retrospective  data  collection  (C09-001r).    These  data  will  be  analyzed  separately  from  the  two prospective studies due to the difference in methodologic approaches and safety assessments.  Safety

## Patient exposure

The analysis of exposure was limited to exposure to eculizumab. The total duration of exposure at each dose  level  was  calculated  for  each  patient.  This  was  summarized  by  study  and  presented  by  the following duration categories:

- &lt; 12 weeks
- 12-&lt;26 weeks
- ≥26 weeks

The total duration of exposure was calculated as (last dose date - first dose date +1) for each patient. For patients who received a single dose of eculizumab the exposure was set to14 days based on the known half-life of eculizumab

The median duration of treatment for patients in C08-002A/B was 38 weeks (range 2-64 weeks) and for  patients  in  C08-003A/B  was  40  weeks  (range  26-52  weeks)  (Table  51).  Ninety-five  percent  of patients were treated for at least 26 weeks.

Regarding the dose modifications, one of the 37 patients included in the two prospective studies (C08002A/B and C08-003A/B) had a dose reduction. One patient received one 900 mg dose instead of 1200 mg during the maintenance. No other dose increases or decreases were reported. However two patients in study C08-003A/B  had an infusion interrupted prior to its completion without additional dose given. One patient received 2 additional 600 mg doses of eculizumab at the time of concomitant use of PT and one patient received an additional 900 mg dose at the time of kidney transplant.  For both prospective studies, most patients received doses as prescribed, within a protocol-specified interval of 14 days ± 2 days. Overall 3/145 (2%) doses during the induction phase and 21/672 (3%) during the maintenance phase were delayed. Only two patients had a dosing interval of &gt; 9 days (dosing on day 10-12) during the induction phase due to a delay in drug delivery to the hospital. Seven patients in study C08-002A/B study and five in study C08-003A/B had dosing intervals of &gt; 16 days (total of 21 doses).  In these patients the range of dosing was 17 days to 29 days.  The administration of drug to two patients was delayed because they were hospitalized for SAEs and it was delayed for 1 patient because the patient was on vacation.  For the other four patients, no reason was recorded.  Five patients in study C08-003A/B had dosing intervals &gt; 16 days.  For one patient, the study medication was not delivered on time for administration. It was delayed for another patient because the patient was on vacation and for an additional patient because of a train strike in the country of residence.  For the other two patients, no reason was recorded.

## Adverse events

## Overview of Adverse Events in Prospective Studies

Nearly all patients experienced a treatment emergent adverse event (AE) while on study (Table 54). A total of 43% of patients had an AE that was considered by the Investigators to be study drug-related (reported as definite or probable or possible). Study drug-related AEs occurred in 59% of patients in study C08-002A/B and 30% of patients in study C08-003A/B.  SAEs were reported more frequently in study C08-002A/B (88%) than in study C08-003A/B (25%)

A total of 32% of patients experienced a severe AE. Severe AEs were more commonly noted in patients enrolled in study C08-002A/B than in patients enrolled in study C08-003A/B.  Five patients had a drug related SAE.

One patient from study C08-002A/B discontinued treatment because of AEs, which were not considered study drug-related.

a  A second patient was reported with an AE of Lupus Erythematosus which was counted as a protocol violation rather than an AE leading to discontinuation.

Nearly all patients experienced at least one AE.  All adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients are included in Table 55. Overall, 73% of patients reported gastrointestinal disorders, with the most frequent individual AEs being diarrhea (32%) and vomiting (22%).  Although not as frequent, nausea (19%) and abdominal pain (11%) were also reported.  Other frequently reported AEs included headache (30%), anemia (24%), and hypertension (24%). Events classified as infections and infestations occurred in 65% of patients, with nasopharyngitis occurring in 22% and upper respiratory tract and urinary tract infections occurring in 19% and 16%, respectively.  General disorders and administration site conditions occurred in 51% of patients. Musculoskeletal and nervous system

Regarding the retrospective study, twenty two of the 30 patients included in study C09-001r experienced at least one AE.  Adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients, and selected AEs reported in less than 10% of patients are included in Table 56. Overall, 57% of patients reported infections, with the most frequent individual AEs being upper respiratory tract infection (17%), nasopharyngitis and flu (10% each).  Gastrointestinal disorders occurred in 40% of patients, with the most frequent events reported as diarrhea (27%) and vomiting (23%).  Although not as frequent, abdominal pain (10%) was also reported.  General disorders occurred in 40% of patients, with pyrexia reported in 30% of patients. Respiratory disorders both occurred in 37% of patients, with cough (23%) and nasal congestion (13%) being the most frequently-reported events.

## Deaths

No deaths were reported in the C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B prospective studies.  There were two deaths  in  study  C09-001r.    One  thirteen  year  old  female  received  eculizumab  in  preparation  for  a kidney  transplant. She  underwent  angioplasty  for  severe  carotid  artery  stenosis  which  was complicated  by  artery  dissection.    She  subsequently  developed  a  stroke  and  died  5  days  after  the surgical procedure. The second patient was a 47 year-old male whose cause of death was attributed to multi-organ failure due to uncontrolled graft versus host disease and pulmonary aspergillosis.

## Other Serious Adverse Events in Prospective Studies

Serious AEs were reported in 20 (54%) patients treated in studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B. They were considered drug-related in four patients (3 in study C080-002A/B and a single patient in study C08-003A/B).  SAEs reported in greater than 5% of patients are reported in  Table 58. There were more SAEs reported  for  patients  enrolled  in  study  C08-002A/B  (88%)  than  for  patients  enrolled  in study C08-003A/B (35%).  The most commonly reported SAEs were hypertension, infections and renal impairment including renal failure, renal impairment and hematuria. There were five SAEs of infection consisting of upper respiratory infections (two patients), varicella infection (one patient), gastroenteritis  (one  patient)  and  Clostridium  difficile  diarrhea  (one  patient).    All  infections  were considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study  drug.    Of  note,  the  patient  with  varicella infection had a history of varicella zoster infection.  All patients recovered after appropriate therapy.

There were 3 SAEs related to central nervous system disorders.  One patient had a seizure, one patient had  reversible  posterior  leukoencephalopahy  syndrome  and  one  had  a  headache.    Seizure  and reversible  posterior  leukoencephalopathy  were  attributed  to  underlying  hypertension.    All  patients recovered.

The four drug-related SAEs consisted of accelerated hypertension (reported in two patients in study C08-002A/B), hypertension (one patient in study C08-002A/B) and peritonitis (one patient in study C08-003A/B).

## Discontinuations.

In study C08-002A/B, two patients discontinued early before completing the 26 week treatment period (one  patient  met  the  exclusion  criteria  and  another  discontinued  because  of  an  adverse  event unrelated  to  study  drug).    In  addition,  two  other  patients  in  study  C08-002A/B  discontinued eculizumab treatment after completing the 26 week treatment period; one patient with an identified MCP mutation was doing well at last follow-up 8 weeks after discontinuation, and the other patient was lost to follow-up although this patient experienced sustained haematologic normalization, TMA event free status and complete TMA response from day 14-182 while on eculizumab.

In  study  C08-003A/B,  there  were  no  early  discontinuations  and  one  patient  discontinued  after receiving  16  doses  of  eculizumab  and  completing  the  26  week  treatment  period.    Following discontinuation  and  completion  of  the  protocol  mandated  8  week  follow-up  period,  this  patient experienced a severe TMA complication 80 days after discontinuation (personal communication from treating physician). Platelet count dropped by more than 25% from baseline and more than 50% from peak while  on  eculizumab  and  worsening  of  renal  function  with  a  nephrotic  syndrome.  This  patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reinitiated eculizumab treatment, did not require further PT and haematologic parameters normalized and renal function returned to baseline.  The patient remains on eculizumab and without PT.

In study C09-001r, thirteen patients discontinued eculizumab treatment.  Of these 13 patients, four patients initially  received only  a  single  dose.  One  patient  received  only  a  single  dose  of  eculizumab while  three  others  received  a  single  dose  and  then  were  restarted  with  eculizumab  treatment  after some period of dosing interruption ranging from 30 days to 1 year. One of these three experienced two dosing interruptions.

The patient in the C09-001r study that received only a single dose of eculizumab experienced a greater than 25% drop in platelet count from baseline and experienced a rapid and severe TMA complication within 30 days after discontinuation leading to chronic dialysis and graft failure.  Three other patients in study C09-001r received an initial dose of eculizumab, experienced a severe TMA complication, and required restart of eculizumab treatment.

Two  other  patients  had  a  treatment  interruption  after  one  dose  of  eculizumab.  Both  of  them experienced  a  rapid  decline  in  platelet  count  and  an  increase  in  creatinine  leading  to  severe  TMA complication  (33  days  and  8  weeks,  respectively)  following  discontinuation.  Both  patients  were restarted on eculizumab although one of them discontinued again and dropped the platelet count by nearly 30% from peak and subsequently discontinued after rapid progression to ESRD.

The third patient received a single dose of eculizumab, was observed to have a decline of platelet count of approximately 35% within 12 weeks post dose, and experienced a new severe TMA complication after approximately 1 year and required intubation with mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress.  This patient was restarted on eculizumab and achieved platelet count normalization and improvement in both hemoglobin and renal function.  Dosing was again interrupted due to patient non-compliance and the patient's platelet count dropped almost 80% from peak and the patient experienced a new severe TMA complication 53 days after the prior dose.  Dosing was restarted and this patient remains on eculizumab and to date is free of PT and dialysis.

There were two additional patients who discontinued eculizumab within five days of the last eculizumab dose. Any TMA complication occurring within one week of the eculizumab last dose is not considered a potential severe TMA complication post eculizumab since the complication actually occurred prior to the missed dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Seven other patients in the C09-001r study also discontinued eculizumab treatment (duration ranged between 7 days and 168 days).  Of these seven patients, two died and the cause of death was not considered drug related.  Two other patients were on chronic dialysis prior to eculizumab and remained on chronic dialysis after discontinuation of eculizumab. In the remaining 3 patients there was no evidence of clinical complication of TMA after follow-up ranging from 5 to 221 days.

## Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome Neisseria meningitidis Infections

## Description of All Cases of Meningococcal Infection

Patients treated with eculizumab are at an increased risk for the development of infection caused by the encapsulated bacteria Neisseria meningitidis.  In the two prospective studies (studies C08-002A/B and  C08-003A/B)  and  the  retrospective  study  (study  C09-001r),  no  instances  of  meningococcal infection have been reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As of 30 Nov-2010, there had been 18 reported cases of Neisseria meningitidis among patients treated with  eculizumab,  three  from  clinical  trials  and  15  during  the  post  marketing  experience  (Table  61). The  first  case  in  clinical  trial  occurred  in  an  unvaccinated  non-PNH  patient.  Two  other  cases  were reported  in  clinical  studies  in  vaccinated  PNH  patients.  During  the  post  marketing  period,  15  cases were reported including one aHUS patient. This patient is included in the retrospective study C09-001r but the infection occurred after the data collection.

| 2010                   | 8                 |

The  number  of  cases  progressively  increased  as  the  total  number  of  patients  exposed  to  Soliris increased. The rate of meningococcal infections has not changed from the clinical trial experience and throughout the post-marketing experience with a consistent rate of less than 0.5 cases per 100 patient years.

Consistent with the epidemiology of both PNH and Neisseria infections, the majority of patients who developed meningococcal infections were young adults with a median age of 23 years (Table 62).  Of the 18 patients, 17 were adults and only one of these adults was older than 30 years (actual age of 54 years).  To date there has been a single report of meningococcal infection in an adolescent patient and none in the pediatric population.  Most patients were female and PNH was the underlying diagnosis in 15 patients. One  19-year-old aHUS  patient treated outside the clinical trials developed a meningococcal infection 18 months after starting treatment with eculizumab. This patient is included in study C09-001r but the meningococcal infection occurred after the data collection.

One patient who developed meningococcal infection was treated with eculizumab prior to the initiation of the PNH program and the current risk management program.  All other 17 patients who developed a meningococcal infection were vaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine according to local availability (Table  63).    Eight  of  these  patients  received  a  tetravalent  vaccine  (Menactra,  Menomune  or Meningovax), six received a vaccine covering either Neisseria subtype C or A/C, and three patients received an unknown vaccine type.  Thirteen of the 18 patients who developed infections underwent subtyping  of  N.  meningitidis.    The  predominant  subtype  was  B  (7  patients).    One  patient  had  an infection caused by subtype C and another patient's infection was caused by subtype Y.  These two infections occurred in patients who were vaccinated with Menactra which includes both serotypes in the target coverage.

In  all  other  patients,  the  infection  was  caused  by  an  N.  meningitidis  subtype  not  covered  by  the vaccine  provided.    In  most  patients,  the  infection  occurred  early  after  the  initiation  of  eculizumab treatment with a median of 5 months. In five of the 18 patients, infection occurred more than 1 year after the initiation of eculizumab. The longest duration between eculizumab initiation and infection was 5 years in a patient who was revaccinated at a time consistent with the manufacturer's guidance.

Fourteen  of  these  18  patients  with  meningococcal  infection  fully  recovered  (Table  64).    Of  those fourteen patients, nine resumed treatment with eculizumab without further problem.  One patient who was not vaccinated recovered with neurological sequelae; this patient was the first to be diagnosed with  meningococcal  infection  in  the  context  of  a  clinical  study.    There  were  three  meningococcal infection-related fatalities in PNH patients.  The age of these patients ranged from 20 to 24 years.  Two had  received  a  bivalent  meningococcal  vaccine  and  one  had  received  a  tetravalent  vaccine.    Fatal infections were due to N. meningitidis type B in two patients and type X in one.  The time from the beginning of eculizumab treatment to the outbreak of infection was 5 months in 2 patients and 10.5 months in the third patient.  Of the 18 patients who developed meningococcal infection, six remain on Soliris  without  further  problem,  9  discontinued  Soliris,  and  information  is  not  available  for  the remaining 3 patients.

## Prophylactic Antibiotics

To  decrease  the  risk  of  possible  infection,  all  patients  were  to  be  vaccinated  with  a  meningococcal vaccine at least 14 days before his or her first eculizumab dose.  In study C08-002A/B, because of the rapid  and  progressive  nature  of  the  aHUS,  most  patients  required  an  immediate  initiation  of eculizumab treatment in order to prevent further severe TMA complications.  Consequently, 14 patients were treated with eculizumab prior to the end of the 14 day post-vaccination period.  Ten patients were vaccinated within 14 days before the first dose and four patients were vaccinated after the first dose.  These 14 patients received prophylactic antibiotics until at least 14 days after the vaccination (Table 65). Two patients received long-term antibiotic prophylaxis with an oral penicillin.  In these two patients,  antibiotic  prophylaxis  was  still  ongoing  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off.    The  most  common prophylactic antibiotics administered were quinolones and beta lactams (penicillin and cephalosporins).

In study C08-003A/B, two patients were treated with eculizumab prior to the 14 days post- vaccination period.  These two patients received prophylactic antibiotics until at least 14 days after the vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis is still ongoing in one of them (Table 66).

In the retrospective study C09-001r, 29/30 patients were vaccinated against N. meningitidis and 13 of those 29 patients were vaccinated at least 14 days prior to eculizumab. One two month-old patient was not vaccinated as there is no current recommendation for meningococcal vaccine in this age group.  Of the 17 patients who were not vaccinated, or who were vaccinated less than 14 days prior to eculizumab, 15 patients (9 paediatric patients and 6 adults) received antibiotic prophylaxis (Table 67). In patients below the age of 2, three patients received a meningococcal vaccine and prophylactic antibiotics, one receive only prophylactic antibiotics and one received only a meningococcal vaccine. Antibiotic prophylaxis was still ongoing in four of these patients at the time of data cut-off. All three patients aged between 2 and &lt;5 years received a meningococcal vaccination and two of them received antibiotic prophylaxis which was ongoing at the time of data cut-off in one of these patients. All seven patients between the age of 5 and 12 received a meningococcal vaccine and two of them also received antibiotic prophylaxis.  In one patient in this age group, eculizumab was started 12 days after vaccination but no antibiotic prophylaxis was given. Six adult patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. In one patient, antibiotic prophylaxis was not started although meningococcal vaccination occurred only 10 days prior to the initiation of eculizumab. The choice of antibiotic used during prophylaxis was guided by local practices.

Regarding the retrospective study, (study C09-001r) 18 of the 30 patients had an infection. Overall, the pattern of infections was similar to what was observed in the prospective studies and there was no apparent increased risk of infection by encapsulated bacteria. Upper respiratory tract infections were noted in six patients, and influenza and nasopharyngitis were noted in three patients each. The rate of infections and the pattern of infections were similar across the various age groups. Sixty seven percent of paediatric patients had at least one infection.  The most common were respiratory infections and otitis.  Three of them had a catheter-related infection.

## Hypertension

Hypertension is a common problem in aHUS patients. With progressive kidney damage related to an ongoing  TMA  process,  most  aHUS  patients  develop  hypertension  which  can  become  severe  and commonly requires aggressive use of multiple antihypertensive drugs. Thirty three patients, or 89%, (15 in study C08-002A/B and 18 in study C08-003A/B) were on various antihypertensive drugs prior to enrolling in this aHUS development program.

Eculizumab treatment of patients with a different form of a genetic uncontrolled complement activation disorder, PNH, has been reported to be associated with significant reductions in arterial and diastolic pressure compared to placebo-treated PNH patients. In patients with PNH, this reduction in systemic arterial pressure has been related to inhibition of complement activation and the subsequent increase in nitric oxide levels.

In prospective studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B, thirteen (35%) patients experienced at least one hypertension-related event including six SAEs (Table 69). Although the majority of these events were related to worsening of hypertension while on eculizumab, these hypertension events were generally mild or moderate in severity and generally determined to be unrelated to study drug. In three patients (8%) these events were considered severe (hypertension in two and malignant hypertension in one). Three events (accelerated hypertension in two patients and severe hypertension in one patient) were considered drug related.

Adverse events of hypertension occurred at any time during the eculizumab treatment period with a median of 112 days. These events occurred as early as the first dose and as late as 252 days.  In nearly half of the patients, the event of hypertension occurred on the day of the infusion but in some patients was reported as late as 28 days post infusion.  Despite the temporal relationship with eculizumab administration, in most cases, these events were not considered drug-related.

## Laboratory findings

Laboratory assessments were performed on the data pooled across both prospective controlled studies including all 37 patients. A total of 27 patients had normal white blood cell (WBC) counts while 9 patients had leukopenia at baseline (Table 71).  Twenty of the 27 patients with WBC counts in the normal range at baseline developed leukopenia during the course of the studies. In five of these 20 patients, leukopenia was related to the use of immunosuppressive agents to prevent graft rejection in transplanted patients. In the remaining 15 patients, leukopenia was transient and of short duration. Lymphocytopenia was transient and neutropenia was also transient and occurred in only a few patients with normal baseline value.

## Hepatic findings

The vast majority of patients had normal liver enzymes at baseline (Table 72).  Among patients with normal baseline values, none worsened during eculizumab treatment.  Three out of 4 patients with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at baseline normalised those enzymes during treatment. Five of the 35 patients with normal albumin at baseline had a single reading of low albumin during the study which returned into the normal range at the subsequent measurement. Fourteen of the 27 patients with normal protein at baseline experienced a low value during study period.  In four of these fourteen patients the low value was a result of a single measurement and transient changes were observed in the remaining 10 patients.  In all patients, total protein returned to normal and remained in the normal range. Also, albumin levels did not appear to change measurably.

## Other serum chemistries

A total of 32 patients had elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at baseline which normalized in 11 reflecting improvement in renal function.  Twenty-one patients had normal uric acid at baseline and one patient's uric acid minimally worsened during treatment.  One patient developed a transient elevation of serum glucose which promptly returned to normal value and remained in the normal range for the duration of the treatment period.

## Electrolytes

Electrolyte abnormalities were observed (Table 73). These abnormalities were usually minimal and mostly transient in nature.

## Safety in Special Groups and Situations

Subgroup analyses of AEs and SAEs as a function of intrinsic factors (age, sex, race, and geographic location) and extrinsic factors (prior kidney transplant, presence or absence of complement factor mutation, and baseline renal function expressed as eGFR) were conducted for studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B

- Age

The majority of patients enrolled in studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B were between 18 and 45 years of age, and six patients were adolescents. Due to the limited number of patients enrolled in the &lt; 18 and &gt;45 years age groups, no clinically meaningful comparisons for these studies can be made based on age.

In the retrospective study certain adverse events were noted to be more prevalent in the paediatric population than in the adult population.  Tachycardia was noted in 27% of paediatric patients and no adult patients. Likewise, pyrexia was reported in 53% of paediatric patients and no adult patients. Thirty three percent of paediatric patients also reported upper respiratory tract infections compared with 9% of adults.  Other AEs were reported with similar frequencies in both populations.

## · Sex

Overall, there were no major differences in the incidence of AEs, SAEs and drug-related AEs based on sex.

- Race

Based  on  the  limited  number  of  patients  enrolled  in  other  race  categories,  no  clinically  meaningful comparisons can be made based on race for AEs, SAEs and drug-related AEs

- Geographic Region

There were no differences in AE reporting between the two subgroups.  There were a higher proportion of patients who had an SAE among North American patients mostly related to the rate of hypertensionrelated SAEs

- Kidney Transplant Status

Approximately 41% of patients enrolled in studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B were prior recipients of  a  kidney  transplant.  Overall,  there  were  no  major  differences  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  based  on transplant status. Adverse events related to blood and lymphatic system disorders were more frequent in transplanted patients.  Specifically lymphopenia and leukopenia were reported only in transplanted patients  reflecting  the  use  of  immunosuppressive  agents  in  this  patient  population.    As  discussed previously, hypertensive events were somewhat lower in transplanted patients than non-transplanted patients, however, there were no major differences in terms of drug-related AEs and SAEs.

- Presence of Mutations in Complement Regulatory Factors (CRF) or Auto Antibody to CRF(s)

Overall, there were no major differences in the incidence of AEs between patients with or without an identified  complement  regulatory  factor  genetic  mutation  or  autoantibodies  against  complement regulatory factor proteins.

- Baseline Renal Function

Overall, there was no evidence of any differences in the rate of adverse events between the various subgroups based on baseline eGFR. The rate of SAE reporting was however higher in patients with a baseline eGFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73m2 and to a lesser extent among those with a baseline eGFR 15-&lt;29 mL/min/1.73m2 which was mostly related to the reporting of hypertension events.

- Drug Interactions

Drug interactions were not studied in C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B or C09-001r.

## HAHA Results

No neutralizing HAHA responses were observed in any of the 37 aHUS patients treated with eculizumab in  the  C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B studies, some of whom have been treated for up to 64 weeks. Consequently, there has  been no apparent impact of HAHA on the PK/PD parameters evaluated for eculizumab. There was no detectable HAHA response in the 20 patients in the C08-003A/B study. Of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the 17 patients in the C08-002A/B study, one patient showed evidence of a HAHA response in both the screening  assay  and  the  confirmatory  assay.  This  patient  received  one  dose  of  eculizumab  and discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  a  diagnosis  of  systemic  lupus  erythematosus.  There  was  no evidence  of  neutralization  or  intolerance  in  this  patient  as  confirmed  by  the  Neutralizing  Anti-Drug Antibodies Assay Method (BTM-0047). Although the presence of antibodies has not been detected yet, it cannot be fully excluded. The MAH is initiating a study (reflected in the RMP) to collect data on the development of HAHA associated with long-term use of eculizumab (M07-003).

## Update of safety data.

Further  to  the  CHMP  request,  the  applicant  has  provided  data  on  long-term  safety  in  the  target population for the two prospective studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B. No update was obtained in the retrospective study (C09-001r) as data could only be collected up to the date of signature on the informed consent form. All safety data were collected up to March 15, 2011 corresponding to a median follow-up of 64 and 62 weeks respectively in study C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B. Overall, 28 (76%) of the 37 patients included in the two prospective studies had a minimum follow-up of 1 year.

Despite the increase in follow-up period, the overall safety profile remains similar in each prospective study and in the pooled analysis of safety. There were very limited differences between the original submission and the current update (Table 75). The most notable change was the increase in the total number of reported serious adverse events (SAEs) which were mostly attributed to study C08-003A/B, despite that, PT sensitive patients showed lower rates of drug-related AEs, severe AEs, SAE and drugrelated SAEs compared to PT-resistant AHUS patients. All patients experienced at least one adverse event.  Most  adverse  events  were  not  drug-related  and  only  3  patients  experienced  a  severe  drugrelated event.

Adverse events were generally similar in the original submission and the current update (Table 76). The most notable difference was the increased reporting of hypertension and infections, which were observed in both studies. Hypertension increased from four (24%) to eight (47%) in study C08-002A/B and from 5 (25%) to 7 (35%) in study C08-003A/B. Infectious increased from 65% to 82% in PT-

resistant and from 65% to 85% in PT-sensitive patients. Both are risks are mentioned in the SPC and will  be  closely  followed  up  in  the  postmarketing.  Nausea,  vomiting,  hypotension,  headache  and nasopharyngitis were the only AEs for which an increase by four patients or more were noted. All other changes  were  minimal  (≤  3  patients)  and  consistent  with  what  would  be  expected  with  additional follow-up  in  patients  with  a  severe  chronic  disease.  Diarrhea,  upper  respiratory  infection,  sinusitis, gastroenteritis,  fatigue  and  asthenia  were  reported  by  three  additional  patients.  The  change  in  the number of patients reporting other AEs was ≤ 2 patients between submission and the safety update. Of  note,  one  patient    reported  pharyngolaryngeal pain  in  the  initial  submission.  In  the  update,  this event was reclassified as upper respiratory tract infection by the investigator.

Thirteen AEs were reported by &gt;10% of patients at the update but reported by ≤ 10% of patients at submission  and  include:  asthenia,  gastroenteritis, sinusitis, hypotension,  pain,  hypersensitivity, bronchitis, herpes zoster, muscles spasms, dizziness, epistaxis, rhinorrhea and rash.

A total of 16 (43%) patients (10 in study C08-002A/B and 6 in study C08-003A/B) had at least one severe AE at the safety update compared to 12 (32%) at submission (Table 77). Two patients in each prospective study (C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B) accounted for this increase in the reporting of severe AEs.

Overall,  each  adverse  event  classified  as  severe  occurred  in  one  patient  with  the  exception  of hypertension and anaemia which was each reported by a total of two patients (5%).

Ten AEs were reported as severe at the update but not during submission. These AEs include pain reported by one patient in study C08-002A/B, and impaired gastric emptying, influenza, pneumonia, dialysis device complication, malnutrition, peripheral sensory neuropathy, depression, renal mass, and embolism venous each reported by one patient in study C08-003A/B. Of note, one patient (Patient 3197-001) reported severe vomiting and severe diarrhoea) in the initial submission. In the update, this event was reclassified by the investigator as severe dialysis device complication.

At the update, adverse events considered related to the study drug were reported by a total of 19 (51%) patients compared to 16 (43%) at submission (Table 78). Drug-related AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity as only three patients reported four severe drug-related AEs. The most notable difference was for the number of patients who reported a possibly drug related infection (7 vs. 4). The infections  which  were  considered  possibly  drug-related  included  asymptomatic  bacteriuria  (C08002A/B)  and  influenza  infection  and  nasopharyngitis  (C08-003A/B).  Drug-related  AEs  which  were reported  for  the  first  time  during  this  update  included:  fatigue,  asymptomatic  bacteriuria,  influenza infection, nasopharyngitis, nasal congestion and hypotension.

Of note, one patient in study C08-003A/B reported vertigo in the initial submission that was judged by the Investigator to be drug related. The relationship of this event was reclassified by the Investigator as unrelated and is no longer included in this table.

Three patients (1 in study C08-002A/B and 2 in study C08-003A/B) reported a total of 4 severe and possibly drug-related adverse events (influenza, peritonitis, hypertension and vein disorder). The only difference  compared  to  the  original  submission  was  one  patient  in  study  C08-003A/B  who  had  a possibly drug-related episode of influenza which occurred on Day 406 of eculizumab treatment. This patient's influenza resolved within two months of onset with medical treatment.

In the current update, seven additional patients reported at least one SAE (Table 79). All patients in study C08-002A/B reported at least one SAE while only half of patients in study C08-003A/B reported an SAE.

The largest number of patients reporting SAEs at the safety update was for infections. Five patients (all in  study C08-003A/B) reported additional SAEs of infection. These infections included influenza (one

patient),  pneumonia  (one  patient),  norovirus  (one  patient),  chronic  hepatitis  E  (one  patient)  and  Q fever (one patient). All infections with the exception of influenza were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug. Of note, the patient with chronic hepatitis E had a history of hepatitis E infection and the patient with Q fever had their immune system compromised after renal transplant. Other additional SAEs reported during the extended follow-up included: pericardial effusion, transplant rejection, venous embolism and venous thrombosis.

## Other safety concerns

During the additional follow-up, there were no deaths and no AEs leading to discontinuation. During the additional follow-up, there was no report of any meningococcal infections in aHUS patients treated in the two prospective studies or in patients included in the retrospective trial.

## Additional safety information

Studies  C08-002A/B  and  studies  C08-003A/B  are  currently  on-going.  Additional  safety  updates  on those patients will be provided at the time of the conclusion of this study (target 2012). In addition, Alexion  will  implement  a  long-term  follow-up  study  for  all  patients  who  were  included  in  all  aHUS studies (prospective and retrospective). This protocol is targeted to be implemented after the approval of the aHUS indication by competent authorities. This protocol will continue to collect additional safety information  on  targeted  safety  concerns  including  meningococcal  infections,  serious  infections  and severe clinical TMA complications of aHUS after discontinuation of eculizumab.

## Post marketing experience

The cumulative post-marketing exposure is estimated to be approximately 2030 patient years.  During 6 months preceding this report approximately 1232 patients (vast majority PNH patients) were treated with Soliris.  A total of 828 AEs possibly related to Soliris were reported and 292 of these 898 AEs were medically confirmed.  The majority of these AEs were previously reported in PNH clinical trials.

## 3.3.4.1. Discussion on Clinical Safety

The aHUS database is very limited, but so far, the AEs associated to the use of eculizumab are not different  from  the  ones  observed  for  PNH.  Interestingly,  though  the  presence  of  antibodies  to Eculizumab  has  not  been  detected  yet,  although  it  cannot  be  fully  excluded.  In  this  regard,  the Applicant is requested to include in their periodic safety update reports, a special section about the presence of antibodies to Eculizumab.

Nearly all patients experienced a treatment emergent adverse event. Generally speaking, the safety profile in both PNH and aHUS indications is similar. There have been some AEs frequently described in aHUS  indication  (hypertension,  insomnia  and  vascular  disorders)  that  were  not  described  with  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

same  frequency  in  the  PNH  patients.  Of  note,  the  incidence  of  leucopoenia  in  16%  of  patients  is remarkable and although a relationship to eculizumab cannot be fully ruled out, the leucopoenia seems to be related to immunosuppressant agents. In any case, this AE is currently reflected in SmPC and will be closely monitored post-approval.

Importantly, there is a clearly different safety profile between the two populations studied, being worst for the PT resistant setting.

Serious AEs were reported in 20 (54%) patients treated in studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B. The most  expected  SAEs  are  those  related  to  the  immune  systems.  There  were  five  SAEs  of  infection consisting of upper respiratory infections (two patients), varicella infection (one patient), gastroenteritis  (one  patient)  and Clostridium  difficile diarrhea  (one  patient).  Regarding  renal  and urinary disorders as SAEs, the course of the disease likely has had an important contribution.

There were 3 SAEs related to central nervous system disorders.  One patient had a seizure, one patient had  reversible  posterior  leucoencephalopahy  syndrome  and  one  had  a  headache.    Seizure  and reversible  posterior  leucoencephalopathy  were  attributed  to  underlying  hypertension.    All  patients recovered.

The four drug-related SAEs consisted of accelerated hypertension, hypertension and peritonitis.

Again there was a different profile in regards to the SAES depending on what type of population was treated, being worst for the PT resistant setting.

Two patients had cardiac disorders considered as serious. These two subjects represent 12% of the patients treated in the study C08-002 (both of them were in that study). Specifically, the SAEs were defined as bradycardia and pericardial effusion. The investigators did not judge these events as related to  the  study  medication.  The  patient  who  underwent  the  pericardial  effusion  was  considered  as recovered with sequelae. Another patient with bradycardia was considered recovered.

The discontinuation of the treatment appears to induce a worsening of the disease, in many cases from an improved situation. This has been reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.4).

A total of 38 AEs related to infections other than due to Neisseria meningitidis were reported in 21 aHUS patients in the prospective clinical studies. Five infection events were considered as serious AEs. One additional  event,  gram  positive  peritonitis,  also  was  reported,  and  was  deemed  serious  due  to hospitalization.

AEs of special interest not previously noted, hypertension and leukopenia were a new drug-related AE and the most commonly reported study drug-related AE, respectively.

Unfortunately, due to the limited sample size, it is not possible to obtain any reliable conclusions about different  safety  profile  in  specific  subset  of  patients,  although  there  seem  to  be  some  differences according to the age. The following adverse events were noted to be more prevalent in the paediatric than in the adult population: Tachycardia (27% vs 0%), eye disorders (27% vs 9%), Diarrhea (33% vs 18%) and Pyrexia (53% vs 0%).

The overall prevalence of infection in paediatric patients was 67% (N =10/15 patients) which was also similar to that observed in the adult patient group studied in the prospective studies (65%, N=24/37 patients)

The frequency of the most commonly reported AEs appears to increase in the long term, particularly in the  PT-sensitive  population,  although  it  is  noted  that  the  majority  of  AEs  described  in  the  updated report  are  non  serious,  and  of  easy  management  in  the  clinical  practice.  The  relationship  with eculizumab is difficult to be established, as no direct comparison exists. Some of the AEs are probably

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

influenced by other baseline medicinal products, i.e. infections and infections by immunosuppressant. On the contrary, other AEs could be attributed to the experimental drug. In this regard, it should be noted  the  increase  in  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  fatigue,  headache,  hypertension,  and  infections might increase over time.

The overall safety profile appears acceptable and manageable in clinical practice. However, the limited database makes necessary a continuous follow-up and reassessment of the benefit/risk balance in the light  of  the  available  evidence  and  the  better  knowledge  of  eculizumab  in  the  treatment  of  aHUS patients.  In  this  respect,  the  MAH  has  agreed  to  perform  a  prospective  long-term  follow-up  study (C11-003)  which  will  include  aHUS  patients  previously  treated  with  eculizumab  in  the  MAH  clinical studies. In addition, a draft aHUS registry protocol (M11-001) has been included in the RMP and will collect and evaluate safety data specific to the use of eculizumab in aHUS as well as long-term effects.

In addition the MAH should submit half-yearly PSURs until otherwise agreed by the CHMP.

## 3.4. Summary of the EU RMP

An updated EU-RMP version 5.4 has been submitted to assess the new indication proposed by the company: Atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS).

The summary of the EU-RMP of the updated version submitted is as follows:

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that the amended risk minimisation activities as described in the conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product (Annex II) and those to be addressed to the member states (Annex 127a) are adequate for the proposed new indication.

## 3.5. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the product information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:

## 4.1 Therapeutic indication:

Soliris (eculizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with:

- -
- Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). Evidence of clinical benefit of Soliris in the treatment of patients with PNH is limited to patients

with history of transfusions.

- -Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (see section 5.1).

[…]

## 4.3 Contra-indications

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## […]

Do not initiate Soliris therapy (see section 4.4) :

- in PNH patients:with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection.
- who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis
- who have known or suspected hereditary complement deficiencies.

## in aHUS patients:

- with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection.
- who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis or  do  not  receive  prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination.

[…]

- 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Meningococcal Infection:

[…]

Patients  less  than  2  years  of  age  and  those  who  are  treated  with  Soliris  less  than  2  weeks  after receiving  a  meningococcal  vaccine  must  receive  treatment  with  appropriate  prophylactic  antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination

## […]

Immunogenicity: Infrequent,  low  titre  antibody  responses  have  been  detected  in  Soliris  -treated patients across all PNH and non-PNH studies. In placebo controlled studies low titre responses have been reported with a frequency (3.4%) similar to that of placebo (4.8%).

[…]

Immunization:  Prior  to  initiating  Soliris  therapy,  it  is  recommended  that  PNH  and  aHUS  patients should  receiveinitiate  immunizations  according  to  current  immunization  guidelines.  Additionally,  all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcus at least 2 weeks prior to receiving Soliris.  Patients less than 2 years of age and those who are treated with Soliris less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. If available, tetravalent, conjugated vaccines are recommended (see meningococcal diseaseinfection).

Patients  less  than  18  years  of  age  must  be  vaccinated  against  haemophilus  influenzae  and pneumococcal infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group.

## […]

## aHUS Laboratory Monitoring

aHUS  patients  receiving  Soliris  therapy  should  be  monitored  for  thrombotic  microangiopathy  by measuring platelet counts, serum LDH and serum creatinine, and may require dose adjustment within the recommended 14±2 day dosing schedule during the maintenance phase (up to every 12 days).

[…]Treatment  Discontinuation  for  aHUS:  Severe  thrombotic  microangiopathy  complications  were observed  after  Soliris  discontinuation  in  the  aHUS  clinical  studies.  If  aHUS  patients  discontinue

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment with Soliris they should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications.

Severe  thrombotic  microangiopathy  complications  post  discontinuation  can  be  identified  by  (i)   any two, or repeated measurement of any one, of the following: a decrease in platelet count of 25% or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during Soliris treatment; an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during Soliris treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during Soliris treatment; or (ii)  any  one  of  the  following:  a  change  in  mental  status  or  seizures;  angina  or  dyspnoea;  or thrombosis.

Monitor  any  patient  who  discontinues  Soliris  for  at  least  12  weeks  to  detect  severe  thrombotic microangiopathy complications.

If  severe  thrombotic  microangiopathy  complications  occur  after  Soliris  discontinuation,  consider reinstitution of Soliris treatment, supportive care with PE/PI, or appropriate organ-specific supportive measures  including  renal  support  with  dialysis,  respiratory  support  with  mechanical  ventilation  or anticoagulation.  In aHUS clinical studies, 18 patients (5 in the prospective studies) discontinued Soliris treatment.  Seven (7) severe thrombotic microangiopathy complications were observed following the missed dose in 5 patients and Soliris was re-initiated in 4 of these 5 patients.

## Educational guidance

All physicians who intend to prescribe Soliris must ensure they are familiar with the physician's guide to  prescribing.  Physicians  must  discuss  the  benefits  and  risks  of  Soliris  therapy  with  patients  and provide them with a patient information brochure and a patient safety card.

Patients should be instructed that if they develop fever &gt; 39°C, headache accompanied with fever and/or stiff neck or sensitivity to light, they should immediately seek medical care as these signs may be indicative of meningococcal infection.

Other changes to the PI have been introduced to sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.6 as highlighted in the annex 1 to the CHMP AR.

The PL has been updated accordingly. Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to update the product information with the latest version of the QRD template.

## User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3.6. Benefit-risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Treatment with Eculizumab in the PT-resistant population (Study C08-002A/B) improved or stabilised the kidney function, haematological parameters and systemic manifestation as measured by QoL. The results  were  robust  and  compelling  in  these  patients  without  therapeutic  alternatives,  since  these

patients were considered resistant to the usual treatment in aHUS (Plasma therapy). Overall, platelet counts increased and were within normal limits in 14 of 17 patients (82%; 95% CI: 57%-96%) during the eculizumab treatment period. The time to first occurrence of normal platelet count (≥ 150 x 10 9 /L) occurred as early as one  day following the first  eculizumab dose,  with  a  median  time  of  7  days  to achieve  a  first  occurrence  of  platelet  count  normalization.  Regarding  Haematologic  Normalization,  it was achieved by 76% of patients (95% CI:50-93%) and in up to 90% of the 10 patients with both abnormal platelet count and LDH at entry. Importantly, the duration of response continues into the extension phase, with a median duration of response limited only by the current data cut-off and is currently 258 days (range 196-431) for hematologic normalization and 267 days (range 217-389) for complete TMA response. Additionally, at the time of the data cut-off, 13 of the 17 patients in study C08-002A/B remained on treatment.

Results  from  the  Study  C08-003A/B,  showed  that  a  substantial  majority  of  PT-sensitive  patients receiving eculizumab in the study (16 of 20 patients [80%; 95% CI: 56- 94]) achieved the primary endpoint of TMA Event-Free Status through Week 26, which was sustained for a median time duration of  approximately  40  weeks  (280  days)  as  of the data cut-off  date.  Regarding  Hematologic Normalization, it was achieved in almost all patients, demonstrating maintenance of normal platelet count  after  discontinuation  of  PT  and  start  of  eculizumab  therapy.  A  total  of  18  out  of  20  patients (90%; 95% CI: 68-99) achieved Hematologic Normalization. 100% of study C08-003A/B patients who obtained  hematologic  normalization  (and  its  components  of  platelet  count  normalization  and  LDH normalization) and complete TMA response indicating, that all patients who achieve an improvement in TMA, maintain that improvement with ongoing treatment. At the time of data cut-off, 19 of the 20 patients in study C08-003A/B also remain on eculizumab treatment.

Although no conclusion can be drawn on any potential benefit in renal function in the long-term, which is the ultimate goal of treatment, the available evidence support the use of eculizumab as an alternative to plasma therapy in the treatment of PT-sensitive population.

Efficacy in the paediatric population has been demonstrated throughout the evidence provided by the retrospective  study  C09-001  which  included  30  patients.  There  were  15  paediatric  patients  and  4 adolescents. The efficacy of eculizumab as determined by measures of platelet count, TMA event free status, TMA intervention rate, haemoglobin and renal improvement was observed in all paediatric age groups  from  2  months  to  11  years.  Almost  all  paediatric  patients  achieved  or  maintained  a  normal platelet  count,  including  6  of  7  patients  who  were  thrombocytopenic  (platelet  count  &lt;150  ×  10 9 /L) before  starting  eculizumab.  Similarly,  11/15  (73%)  of  paediatric  patients  achieved  TMA  event-free status with eculizumab treatment. TMA intervention rate significantly decreased from a median of 0.45 events per patient/day in the 28 days prior to eculizumab to 0 on eculizumab (P&lt;0.0001). None of these patients required new dialysis. Clinically significant improvement in renal function was also noted in eight (53%) pediatric patients, and a clinically significant increase in hemoglobin (&gt;20 g/L) was also observed in 53% of pediatric patients.

Regarding the update from the prospective studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B (until 64-63 weeks), it is worth highlighting that the efficacy of Soliris was maintained, or even improved, in the long term.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Nearly all patients experienced a treatment emergent adverse event. Generally speaking, the safety profile  in  both  PNH  and  aHUS  indications  is  similar.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  the  aHUS indication  were:  diarrhea  (32%  of  patients),  vomiting  (22%),  nausea  (19%)  and  abdominal  pain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(11%),  headache  (30%),  anemia  (24%),  Leukopenia  (16%),  hypertension  (24%),  infections  and infestations  (nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  and  urinary  tract  infections),  insomnia  (14%) general  disorders,  administration  site  conditions,  musculoskeletal  and  nervous  system  disorders (41%),  vascular  disorders  (41%)  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (30%  of patients). There have been some AEs frequently described in aHUS indication (hypertension, insomnia and  vascular  disorders)  that  were  not  described  with  the  same  frequency  in  the  PNH  patients. However, in the CHMP's view the lack of control group precludes to determinate the actual frequency of these AEs and if they were related to the administration of Soliris or if the disease and concomitant therapy received might have contributed.

Serious AEs were reported in 20 (54%) patients treated in studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B. The most expected SAEs are those related to the immune systems. The four drug-related SAEs consisted of accelerated hypertension, hypertension and peritonitis.

The overall prevalence of infection in paediatric patients was 67% (N =10/15 patients) which was also similar to that observed in the adult patient group studied in the prospective studies (65%, N=24/37 patients). The following adverse events were noted to be more prevalent in the paediatric than in the adult population: tachycardia, eye disorders, diarrhoea and pyrexia.

The discontinuation of the treatment appears to induce a worsening of the disease, in many cases from an improved situation. This is considered as safety concern.

The frequency of the most commonly reported AEs appears to increase in the long term, particularly in the  PT-sensitive  population,  although  it  is  noted  that  the  majority  of  AEs  described  in  the  updated report  are  non  serious,  and  of  easy  management  in  the  clinical  practice.  The  relationship  with eculizumab is difficult to be established, as no direct comparison exists. Some of the AEs are probably influenced by other baseline medicinal products, i.e. infections and infestations by immunosuppressant. On the contrary, other AEs could be attributed to the experimental drug. In this regard, it should be noted that AEs like diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, hypertension, and infections might increase over time.

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Treatment with Eculizumab in the PT-resistant population improved or stabilised the kidney function, haematologic parameters and systemic manifestation as measured by QoL. The results were robust and  compelling  in  patients  without  therapeutic  alternatives,  since  these  patients  were  considered resistant to the usual treatment in aHUS (Plasma therapy). The clinical relevance of these outcomes has been convincingly demonstrated. The benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks of eculizumab that in general is well tolerated and the AEs profile of easy management in clinical practice.

In the PT-sensitive population eculizumab has demonstrated to be an effective alternative to plasma therapy. The benefit/risk balance is considered positive.

The  evidence  provided  to  support  the  indication  in  the  paediatric  population  is  limited  and  mainly based on retrospective data so far. However, the available results are consistent to those seen in the adult population, it is considered that these data are sufficient to establish a positive benefit-risk in the paediatric population. The limited database makes necessary a continuous follow-up and reassessment of the benefit/risk balance and therefore the PSUR cycle for the product will follow a yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP.

## Benefit-risk balance and Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment

The benefits showed by eculizumab in the treatment of aHUS (adults and children) outweigh the risk associated  to  this  new  therapy.  The  relatively  high  dose  proposed  in  this  indication  raises  some concerns and it is recommended to the MAH to further investigate the efficacy and safety of lower doses as post approval.

## 3.7. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit  balance  of  Soliris  in  the  treatment  of  atypical  haemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (aHUS)  was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of this extension of indication.

The PI has been brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.0.
