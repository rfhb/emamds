## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION (MODULE 8B OF THE EPAR)

## 1. Introduction

Erbitux contains cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 class that is directed  against  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  EGFR.  Cetuximab  binds  to  the  extracellular  region  of  EGFR,  thereby  inhibiting  ligand  binding.  Cetuximab  is  also  thought  to  induce receptor internalisation and degradation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. EGFR is known to be overexpressed in many human tumours, including head neck cancer where its overexpression has been seen in more than 90% of cases.

Erbitux was approved in June 2004 for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of irinotecan-including cytotoxic therapy.

The MAH now applies for an extension of the indication to include also squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) as follows:

- ¾ Erbitux in combination with radiation therapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.

In  patients  with  locally  advanced  squamous  cell  cancer  of  the  head  and  neck,  cetuximab  is  used concomitantly with radiation therapy. It is recommended to start cetuximab therapy one week before radiation therapy and to continue cetuximab therapy until the end of the radiation therapy period. A  second  indication  for  the  monotherapy  treatment  of  patients  who  have  failed  chemotherapy  for recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck was initially proposed but was withdrawn by the MAH at the time of the responses to the CHMP list of questions.

## 2. Preclinical aspects

In the new proposed indications cetuximab is to be administered in the same way as in the already authorized colorectal cancer (CRC) indication, i.e. once weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion with an initial dose of 400 mg/m 2 in week 1 followed by subsequent weekly doses of 250 mg/m 2 from week 2 on. The maximum duration of treatment with cetuximab is either shorter than in CRC (8 weeks when used in  combination with radiotherapy in SCCHN patients) or of the same length (to be used until progression  of  the  underlying  disease  when  used  as  monotherapy  in  SCCHN  patients).  For  these reasons,  no  new  pharmacology  studies  were  performed,  but  the  MAH  has  provided  a  summary  of published data. Cell proliferation, cell survival, cell motility, cell invasion and tumour angiogenesis have all been shown to be affected by cetuximab in preclinical in vitro and in vivo SCCHN models, and the available data provides a strong basis for testing cetuximab against SCCHN in clinical studies.

## 3. Clinical aspects

Surgery  and  radiotherapy  (RT)  are  the  two  curative  treatment  modalities  available  for  head  neck cancers.  The  total  dose  and  fractionation  are  important  factors  in  determining  outcome  of  RT. 'Standard-of-care' RT for subjects with locally advanced head and neck malignancies is still evolving. Although  RT  is  essential  in  treating  SCCHN,  attempts  have  been  made  to  improve  efficacy  by combining it with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is also used in the recurrent and metastatic situation. Several  large  randomized  trials  have  been  published  comparing  concomitant  chemoradiotherapy (CRT), predominantly using platinum analogues and 5-FU, with RT alone. Survival rates with CRT were  10-20%  higher  than  with  RT  alone.  CRT  also  significantly  improves  loco  regional  control (LRC) rates.

Currently, combined modality therapy with CRT is more frequently used and accepted as standards in spite of the varying degrees of increased local mucosal toxicity resulting in significant morbidity.

## 3.1. Clinical pharmacology

Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on a database including dosing information and plasma concentration data from the different SCCHN studies. The main objectives were to describe the pharmacokinetics in patients with SCCHN compared with other cancer types, to identify predictors of exposure to cetuximab and to estimate inter-patient variability.

The  SCCHN  database  included  2866  observations  from  446  patients,  of  which  412  received  the standard  regimen  of  a  loading  dose  of  400  mg/m2  followed  by  weekly  doses  of  250 mg/m2.  PK sampling  was  performed  in  all  of  the  nine  SCCHN  studies,  although  in  some  studies  only  e.g.  for trough  concentrations,  and  all  patients  who  had  at  least  one  PK  sample  and  available  dosing information were included in the population pharmacokinetic database.

Demographic  data  that  were  included  as  co-variates  were  age,  weight,  height,  body  surface  area (BSA),  sex,  race,  creatinine  clearance  and  different  markers  for  hepatic  function.  Concomitant medication, EGFR status and the manufacturing process for the various cetuximab lots administered in the studies were also included in the dataset as categorical variables.

The  previously  developed  population  pharmacokinetic  model,  which  was  discussed  during  the assessment  of  the  first  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Erbitux  and  comprised  a  twocompartment model with saturable first-order elimination, provided a good prediction of the observed plasma concentration-time data for each of the new SCCHN studies. Given the limited dose range in the  SCCHN  studies,  a  two-compartment  model  with  linear  elimination  adequately  described  the combined SCCHN data. The estimations for Volume of the central and peripheral compartments (3.52 L and 1.86 L, respectively) and for inter-compartment flow, Q (0.0437 L/h), were in good agreement with  the  estimations  obtained  with  the  previous  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  on  data  from other tumour types. Clearance of cetuximab in SCCHN patients was estimated to be 0.322 L/h. BSA was determined to be a significant co-variate for clearance as well as central volume of distribution. Clearance  of  cetuximab  was  found  to  be  approximately  16%  lower  after  administration  of  batches manufactured to intermediate scale.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

As expected, there were no obvious differences in the pharmacokinetics of cetuximab in patients with SCCHN compared  with  the  results  from  the  previous  analysis  of  a  database  containing  data  from various tumour types. The previously observed non-linear elimination of cetuximab was seen at lower doses (&lt;250 mg/m2). In the SCCHN studies, most patients received the standard dose of 400 mg/m2 loading dose and weekly maintenance doses of 250 mg/m2. At these doses cetuximab pharmacokinetics  has  been  shown  to  be  linear,  and  it  is  not  surprising  that  a  model  with  linear elimination  adequately  described  the  SCCHN  data.  As  also  previously  observed,  BSA  had  a significant impact on the clearance of cetuximab. No PK/PD analyses have been submitted EGFR  expression  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  polymorph.  This  may  affect  receptor-mediated clearance of cetuximab. It is assumed that samples for pharmacogenetic analyses are available and will be used to further elucidate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cetuximab.

## 3.2 Clinical efficacy

## Clinical trial EMR 62 202-006: add-on to definitive radiotherapy in patients with SCCHN.

This is  a  multinational  (36  US,  37  non-US  sites  [EU,  South  Africa,  Israel,  Australia,  Switzerland]) open-label, phase III study. Subjects (n=424) were randomized 1:1 to RT alone or RT + cetuximab. Randomization was stratified by Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (60-80; 90-100%), nodal stage (N0; N+), tumour stage (T1-T3; T4 [AJCC]), and RT regimen (once daily; twice daily; concomitant boost) (dynamic allocation according to Pocock). Study period: First/last subject in: April 1999/March 2002. Clinical/survival cut-offs: 30 April/31 August 2004.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Objectives: Primary - Difference in locoregional disease control (LRC). Secondary -Overall survival (OS), tumour response (RR), acute and late toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life; to assess EGFR levels in the treatment groups.

The  primary  evaluation  of  efficacy  endpoints  was  made  by  an  Independent  Clinical  Review Committee (ICRC), which was blinded to treatment group. The ICRC ascertained the dates of first documented locoregional failure, distant metastasis, or second primaries. It also determined the overall response at 8 weeks post-RT.

Main criteria for inclusion were:

- -Measurable disease.
- -Pathologically demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.
- -Stage III or IV disease with an expected survival of ≥ 12 months.
- -Medically able to withstand a course of definitive RT.
- -KPS ≥ 60%.
- -Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10 9 /l; platelets ≥ 100 x 10 12 /l; bilirubin ≤ 25 µM/l; ALAT, ASAT ≤ 2 x the upper limit of normal; serum creatinine ≤ 133 µM/l, or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min; normal serum calcium.
- -Tumour tissue available for immunohistochemical assay of EGFR expression.
- -No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

## Dose and duration of treatment

- -RT (all patients): 6-7 weeks once-daily (70 Gy in 35 fractions), twice-daily (72.0-76.8 Gy in 60-64 fractions), or concomitant boost (72.0 Gy total in 42 fractions).
- -Cetuximab (RT + cetuximab group): 400 mg/m 2 initial dose in week 1, then weekly doses of 250 mg/ m 2 for 7-8 weeks.

## Statistical methods:

Distributions of time-to-event variables were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Median times-to-event and 1-, 2- and (for overall survival) 3-year estimates (including 95% CIs). The  log-rank  test,  stratified  by  randomization  stratum  was  the  primary  analysis  for  treatment comparison. A Cox proportional hazards model, stratified as above, estimated hazard ratios (HR) and their 95%  CIs. Rates were compared  using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusted for randomization stratum as primary analysis.

## Efficacy

Locoregional control (ICRC, ITT, primary endpoint) was defined as 'The time from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease, or death due to any cause. … Primary  analysis  -  ICRC  assessment:  The  event  date  will  be  the  date  of  locoregional  disease progression per ICRC, or the date of death, in the absence of locoregional progression. If no event exists,  then  LRC  will  be  censored  per  the  ICRC  assessment.  LRC  of  living  patients  with  no  ICRC assessment will be censored at randomization.' Results are presented in table 4.

## Tumour response rate

'The overall response to protocol treatment was determined by the investigator at each scheduled visit, using a modified version of the 1978 WHO criteria. A best overall response per patient, with confirmation of responses, will be derived from the investigator-determined overall response at scheduled time-points. The ICRC determined the overall tumor response at the 8-week post RT timepoint only.' (SAP)

## Multivariate analyses

The following  prognostic  factors  (ignoring  region)  were  identified  as  potentially  relevant:  age,  Hb, KPS, neck dissection, RT regimen, quality of RT, tumour stage, site of primary tumour. These factors were  fitted  together  in  a  model  leading  to  removal  of  'neck  dissection'  and  'tumour  site'.  Nodal stage, however, was found informative and was added to the model.

The following interactions were identified: age by tumour stage, Hb by KPS, RT by nodal stage.

Treatment was found to interact with age and KPS. Adding 'region' did not significantly improve the model, p=0.18.

In the final model, the estimates including the treatment-by-factor interactions were used to calculate survivor function estimates based on equal distribution of the factors included with each region, i.e. for each region, the distribution across both treatment groups was used for both treatments separately. The figure below illustrates the results based on the model including the interaction of treatment with KPS and age.

## Patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN on or after platinum-based therapy

A monotherapy indication  for  Patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN on or after platinum-based therapy was based on three non-controlled studies and one retrospective study providing a basis for a historical comparison.

Open European multicenter study EMR 62 202-016 is regarded as 'pivotal'.

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion were:

- ¾ Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of at least 60 %
- ¾ Histologically confirmed diagnosis of AJCC Stage III/IV SCCHN, metastatic or recurrent
- ¾ Progressive disease (PD) documented by CT or MRI on platinum based therapy (2 cycles and not more than 6 cycles of cisplatin ≥ 60 mg/m2/cycle or carboplatin ≥ 300 mg/m2/cycle or AUC ≥ 4) in the 30 days before cetuximab single-agent therapy
- ¾ Presence of at least 1 lesion measurable bidimensionally by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
- ¾ Tumour tissue available for determination of epidermal growth factor receptor expression

Subjects received cetuximab as a single agent for at least 6 weeks until PD, clinical deterioration or unacceptable AEs occurred. In case of PD or clinical deterioration, patients were offered combination therapy with cisplatin + cetuximab. Altogether 103 subjects were enrolled. All received at least 1 dose of  cetuximab  as  single-agent  therapy;  53  subjects  entered  the  combination  therapy  phase  after progression under monotherapy.

Open European multicenter study in 98 subjects EMR 62 202-001 is regarded as 'supportive' by the sponsor.  Diagnosis  and  main  criteria  for  inclusion  were:  KPS  of  at  least  60  %,  histologically confirmed, diagnosis of AJCC Stage III/IV SCCHN, metastatic or recurrent, documented PD after at least  2  cycles  but  not  more  than  4  cycles  of  cisplatin ≥ 60  mg/m2/cycle  or  carboplatin ≥ 250 mg/m2/cycle, Presence of at least 1 lesion measurable bidimensionally by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, or in two diameters by calliper, tumour tissue available for determination of epidermal growth factor receptor, expression

Subjects were treated for at least 2 and up to 12 cycles with cetuximab plus cisplatin or carboplatin at the same dosage on which they had failed. Treatment was continued until progressive disease (PD), clinical deterioration or unacceptable adverse events (AEs) occurred.

## IMCL CP02-9816 is regarded as 'supportive' by the sponsor.

Diagnosis  and  Main  Criteria  for  Study  Entry:  Patients  at  least  18  years  of  age  with  pathologically confirmed  and  bidimensionally  measurable  recurrent  or  metastatic  SCCHN  who  have  failed  a cisplatin-containing regimen within 3 months of study entry.

Methodology:  This  multicenter,  open-label,  non-randomized,  phase  II  US  study  was  originally designed  to  enrol  210  patients  with  metastatic  or  recurrent  SCCHN  (Versions  1.0  through  3.0). Patients  received  two  3-week  courses  of  either  cisplatin/paclitaxel  or  cisplatin/5-FU  and  were evaluated for response.

Patients with a complete or partial response were not eligible for further treatment on this study; if these  patients  subsequently  relapsed  (recurrent  or  metastatic),  they  were  then  eligible  to  receive weekly infusions of cetuximab on CP02-9816C. Concurrent carboplatin was permitted. Patients with stable disease (treatment group 1) or progressive disease (treatment group 2) following treatment with either  cisplatin/paclitaxel  or  cisplatin/5-FU  were  eligible  to  continue  on  the  study  and  receive cetuximab in combination with cisplatin. Nota bene in this assessment report, only the results from treatment  group  2  (n=79,  progressive  disease  on  cisplatin)  are  presented.  Response  assessments  by

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  design  of  the  study  EMR  62  202  006  was  subject  to  CPMP  advice  in  1999.  At  that  time,  the sponsor  proposed  an  add-on  design;  cetuximab  to  concomitantly  administered  chemoradiotherapy (CRT). An exploratory CRT+cetuximab study (IMCL CP02-9813) was terminated early due to safety concerns.  Therefore  the  add-on  activity  to  RT  alone  was  investigated,  but  not  in  comparison  with concomitant  CRT.  Excluding  patients  with  low-volume,  favourable  stage  III/IV  SCCHN,  CRT  is today (but less commonly 1999) the favoured therapeutic option. CRT, however, is associated with considerable toxicity. Locoregional control (LRC) was accepted as primary measure of efficacy. This is  still  a  valid  measure  of  patients  benefit,  but  as  CRT  has  been  shown  to  improve  OS,  favourable effects on OS should be documented.

With respect to gender, age, KPS, nodal stage, etc. the study appears reasonably similar to published confirmatory studies conducted in patients with locally advanced SCCHN and there are no important imbalances, but patients in the test arm tended to be slightly younger.

An  add-on  effect of  cetuximab  to definitive radiotherapy  has  been  demonstrated  as  regards locoregional  control,  PFS  and  OS  and  altogether  efficacy  data  are  considered  sufficiently  robust  to support regulatory conclusions. The difference in OS survival at three years is about 10% absolute and this is considered clinically relevant.

A statistically significant difference between treatment arms was observed also if timing of event was neglected (event rate 63% vs. 52%), 95% CI for difference 1 to 20% (no adjustment for stratification factors).  The results are therefore considered non- sensitive to 'timing of event bias' and the results are  considered  reasonably  convincing  also  for  a  'single  pivotal  trial'.  The  difference  in  two  year recurrence rates, about 10% absolute, is found clinically meaningful.

The long term, relapse-free rate is expected to be &gt;30%. The survival analysis was conducted at an event rate about 50% and is therefore considered mature and stable.

The  overall  impression  of  all  subgroup  analyses  is  that  the  add-on  effect  of  cetuximab  tends  to  be small  or  absent  irrespective  of  outcome  measure  in  patients  with  poor  prognosis  (estimated  from median OS), the exceptions being female and nodal stage N0 and here mainly for survival. These two exceptions are likely to represent spurious findings. Nevertheless, the sponsor will be asked to further analyse the apparent gender-related difference in add-on activity of cetuximab not at least as similar but also rather weak trends were seen in the CRC study (favouring men).

'Poor' performance status was consistently linked to a poor add-on effect. This observation has some face validity and is considered credible.

As discussed already in the scientific advice 1999, the choice of radiotherapy regimen is likely to be partly  governed  by  certain  patient  factors  so  that  more  fragile  patients  with  consequently  less favourable  prognosis  in  the  long  run  are  more  likely  to  be  treated  with  once  daily  RT.  This  might explain the apparent lack of add-on activity in terms of survival while logoregional control appears improved.

The difference in survival (test and control) comparing patients from US sites with non-US sites is to a meaningfully large extent explained by differences in baseline prognostic factors. At the same time, the apparent baseline differences in baseline covariates overall favouring the experimental arm have been addressed. There was also an imbalance within regions so that patients within the experimental arm in the non-US sites had a less favourable prognosis compared with the control (and vice versa for the US sites). In this context it should be noticed that dynamic allocation was used and that region was not an allocation factor. In the final model and based on the figure above, the relative add-on treatment effect  in  the  non-US  sites  appears  to  be  similar  to  the  effect  in  the  US  sites.  This  is  somewhat  in conflict  with  the  impression  based  on  the  univariate  analyses  where  poor  survival  (irrespective  of prognostic factor) appeared to be associated with a poor add-on effect of cetuximab. In conclusion, while this assessor accepts that 'region' is not a major prognostic factor of relevance for the activity of cetuximab, low KPS (and high age) constitutes a concern.

The magnitude of the treatment effect for PFS appears similar to effects on OS (HR about 0.7), while the level of statistical significance is more robust. The open label nature of the trial might introduce bias, but also here the event rate (irrespective of timing) is significantly higher in the control group,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

66.2  vs.  56.4%,  95%  CI  for  difference  +0.5;  19%  (non-adjusted).  This  is  reassuring  and  PFS  (and locoregional control) data provide support for the observed difference in OS.

No effects on distant metastases (2-year rate 16.5 vs 17.3%) were observed, but a seemingly higher event rate was noted in the cetuximab arm as regards 'second primaries' (2-year rate 7.8 vs. 4.7%). No consistent improvement in terms of OS in time-related measures of activity was seen for grade 3 and  4  rash.  The  low  number  of  patients  should  be  noted  as  well  as  the  rather  flat  survival  curves around the median. The overall impression is, however, that there is a relationship between rash and anti-tumour activity, similar to what is observed in colorectal cancer. The sponsor, however, will be asked to discuss 'grade 3 and 4' data further.

Another  issue  of  major  putative  clinical  relevance  is  the  relationship  between  EGFR  genotype  and activity of cetuximab. As availability of tumour tissue for EGFR staining was an inclusion criterion it is assumed  that tumour tissue will be investigated for EGFR  amplification, mutations and polymorphism.  As population PK data are available, this opens for putatively meaningful exploratory PK/PD  analyses.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  further  analyse  tumour  samples  for  EGFR  gene amplifications for EMR 62202-006 / IMCL-CP02-9815 as a post-approval follow-up measure.

Patients  with  advanced  SCCHN  refractory  to  platinum  based  chemotherapies  constitute  a  patient group where there is no evidence-based therapy available. In the draft NfG under revision it is stated: 'If, for a specific target population, there is no regimen with an evidence-based favourable benefit risk  relationship  available,  a  regimen  used  in  clinical  practice  with  a  well-documented  and  benign safety  profile  is  acceptable  as  comparator.  Alternatively,  'investigator's  best  choice'  among  a  few selected regimens with these characteristics (may include BSC) is acceptable. In these cases, superior efficacy has to be shown versus the pooled results in the reference arm.

In many cases, the absence of evidence-based therapies refers to patients who have failed several lines of therapy. In this situation, it might be easier to obtain the data needed for marketing authorisation based  on a properly conducted randomised study in less advanced patients,  supported by 'salvage' studies, compared with conducting a last line, randomised BSC/investigator's best choice comparative study.'

The design of these exploratory studies for the monotherapy was in principle similar to the design of the  phase  II  studies  conducted  in  patients  with  colorectal  cancer  (CRC)  failing  irinotecan  therapy, where add-on of cetuximab to the failing irinotecan regimen appeared to provide better tumour control than cetuximab monotherapy. This was regarded as highly interesting, indicating that inhibiting the binding  of  a  growth  factor  might  render  a  tumour  responsive  to  chemotherapy  where  baseline chemotherapy resistance had been clinically documented.

However,  there  are  no  indications  that  adding  cetuximab  to  platinum  in  patients  with  platinum refractory tumours reverses platinum resistance. One difference of putative interest comparing studies conducted  in  patients  with  CRC  and  patients  with  SCCHN  was  noticed,  however.  In  the  SCCHN studies, the vast majority of patients probably showed primary resistance to chemotherapy while most patients in the CRC studies were pretreated with two or more lines of chemotherapy. This increases the  likelihood  of  secondary  resistance  (resistance  after  a  period  of  tumour  response).  The  MAH undertook a retrospective review (EMR 62 202-005) of the outcome for SCCHN patients refractory to first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy at 7 centres. This is in line with the advice given in 1999. In this  historical  cohort  the  prognosis  appears  worse,  e.g.  with  respect  to  survival,  median  about  100 days. This apparent difference, however, is too small to be convincing. Similarly, the response rate in the  current  cetuximab  studies,  although  higher  than  reported  in  the  sparse  literature,  cannot  be regarded as sufficiently high to be convincing. Altogether currently available data do not support an indication covering platinum resistant SCCHN, but data are sufficiently relevant to be mentioned in section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristiccs (SPC).

A  recent  paper  (Moroni  et  al.  Lancet  Oncol.  2005)  implies  that  EGFR  gene  amplification  is  of importance for  the  activity  of  cetuximab  (and  panitumumab).  These  limited  data  indicate  that  gene amplification is of similar importance for the activity in monotherapy and in combination therapy, but data as regards type of chemotherapy regimen (and prior resistance) were not reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, recent data for EGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefetinib, erlotinib) show a similar pattern, i.e. that the survival benefit seems to be confined to patients with gene amplification. Based on data from the CRC (and the SCCHN) studies, it seems feasible to further test these hypotheses, i.e. is there a difference between tumours showing primary and secondary resistance with respect to reversibility in case of cetuximab add-on therapy and how is activity governed by EGFR genotype?

## Clinical safety

The evaluation of safety focuses on data from studies in which cetuximab was administered at the target dose (initial 400 mg/m² dose followed by weekly doses of 250 mg/m²)

## Patient exposure

Data from 810 patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment have been included in the integrated analyses: 750 from the SCCHN studies.

## Deaths

A number of cases of death are reported (between 5.7% and 21.6% in the integrated database studies), the  vast  majority  assessed  as  being  related  to  disease  progression,  disease  related  complication  or intercurrent,  non-cetuximab  related  events.  One  case  of  fatal  anaphylactic  reaction  to  cetuximab  is reported.  One  case  of  death  in  the  studies  was  deemed  related  to  RT.  In  the  completed  supportive studies,  one  death  (septic  shock)  was  probably  related  to  chemotherapy  (cisplatin  and  5-FU)  and possibly related to cetuximab.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

The frequency of any HSR -AE was within the expected range compared to current labelling. Five patients were re-exposed to cetuximab after having experienced a grade 3 HSR during previous infusions. In 3 of these patients, rechallenge was positive (same toxicity grade during re-exposure). In 2 patients rechallenge was negative and they continued to receive cetuximab without experiencing any further HSRs.

## Acne-like rash and skin reactions

Acne-like rash was similar across the 3 SCCHN patient populations and the incidence of any grade 'acne-like  rash'  was  as  expected,  given  the  previous  data  from  CRC  patients  (81%  in  CRC).  In contrast, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 'acne-like rash' was lower than expected.

## Mucositis, Diarrhea, Thromboembolism, Asthenia, Fever, Nausea

Overall, the incidence and severity of AEs belonging to these groups were within the expected ranges, given the specific patient populations and treatment and the current labelling for the product.

## Respiratory disorders

Dyspnea and increased cough are very commonly seen in this patient population and have also been observed with the administration of other monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the risk of interstitial pneumonia with EGFR inhibitors has been raised with gefitinib, which is an agent that inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase, albeit of a different target and nature from cetuximab.

## Heart failure

Overall, the incidence of AEs belonging to the special AE category 'heart failure' was low and no grade 3 or 4 heart failure occurred.

## Bleeding

Overall,  the  incidence  of  bleeding  may  be  attributable  to  the  underlying  disease,  and  may  be aggravated by concomitant platinum-based therapy (thrombocytopenia).

## AEs with notable differences in frequencies by KPS at baseline

The frequency of dry mouth, dysphagia, and voice alteration was higher in patients with KPS 80 compared to patients with KPS &lt;80.Given the small number of patients with KPS &lt;80 in both treatment groups, caution is required in the interpretation of the differences.

≥

No subgroup analysis by hepatic or renal status at baseline was performed for any of the studies. The abnormal hepatic status subgroup was too small (i.e. less than 10% of patients).

## Use in pregnancy and lactation

Studies in pregnant or lactating women or animals have not been performed to date. It is not known whether and to what extent cetuximab may enter the fetal circulation or is excreted in human milk. It is recommended in current labelling that the time between cessation of cetuximab therapy and start of breast feeding should be extended from 1 month to 2 months.

## Overdose

No new information relevant for the labelling has been gathered.

## Discussion on clinical safety

Adherence to the planned posology for cetuximab in the RT combination study was high indicating acceptable overall tolerability.

Most of the  AEs  were  either  typical  of  the  underlying  disease  or  consistent  with  the  known  safety profiles  of  RT  and  cetuximab.  Skin  reactions  occurred  in  a  higher  frequency  in  the  combination therapy group than in the RT only group. While skin reactions are already labelled as very common for cetuximab it could also reflect an aggravation of a local radiation dermatitis although the similarity in  the  frequencies  of  radiation  dermatitis  may  appear  to  contradicts  this.  Fever  and  headache  are common  findings  when  treating  with  cetuximab.  Other  AEs  that  occurred  more  often  in  the combination group such as anorexia, pharyngitis, dehydration, asthenia, nausea, fever, weight loss and vomiting are typical for the underlying disease and local reactions to the radiotherapy. The data seems to indicate that these problems were aggravated by adding cetuximab to the radiotherapy. While the frequency  of  stomatitis  seems  not  to  differ  much  between  the  treatment  groups  the  frequency  of pharyngitis does. This may be a reflection of the radiated field which of course determines the extent and localisation of a local reaction.  Anaemia was more common in the RT alone group than in the combination  group.  The  reason  for  this  difference  is  unclear  and  maybe  a  chance  finding.  The frequency of leukopenia is similar in the two groups.

The most frequent AEs causing discontinuation of cetuximab are skin reactions (including acne and radiation  dermatitis),  asthenia,  hypersensitivity  reactions/anaphylactiod  rections,  chills,  dyspnea, vomiting. The incidence of any AE causing discontinuation was similar in the RT + cetuximab group and the monotherapy group of the R/M SCCHN studies.

One case of fatal anaphylactic reaction to cetuximab is reported. Cases of fatal anaphylactic reactions to cetuximab should be mentioned in the SPC. No other apparent systematic increase of fatalities due to cetuximab treatment can be detected from this data. Hypomagnesemia (of unknown frequency) has recently  been  introduced  into  the  European  SPC  and  the  patient  leaflet  of  cetuximab.  The  clinical impact of hypomagnesemia  is  still under investigation. Overall the incidence of reports of hypomagnesemia was low in studies where cetuximab was given alone, or in combination with RT or carboplatin. Higher incidences of reports of hypomagnesemia were seen in studies where cetuximab was given in combination with cisplatin, known to cause hypomagnesemia. In the ECOG study, the higher incidence of hypomagnesemia in the cetuximab group may be due to the approximately 25% higher cumulative dose of cisplatin. The incidence of hypomagnesemia and relationship to cetuximab treatment is difficult to establish based on these studies.

With regard to hypersensitivity reactions, the fact that in some patients rechallenge was negative could be worth exploring further in order to include in the labelling (e.g methods of overcoming HSRs) in the future since HSR is a common obstacle in the use of the drug.

Respiratory disorder is a labelled side effect of cetuximab. Whether there is a relevantly increased risk of interstitial pneumonitis for EGFR targeting compounds, including cetuximab is debateable, but is labelled. The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis and lung fibrosis in these studies was low (0.3%) with  just  one  case  reported.  Dyspnea  is  a  labelled  very  common  AE.  Cough  may,  as  the  applicant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

points out be explained by the underlying disease- which is supported by the frequency also being high in the RT only group.

The  frequency  of  anorexia  and  pain  in  the  RT  +  cetuximab  group  was  higher  in  older  patients compared to younger patients as well as compared to older patients in the RT alone group. The risk benefit analysis for the drug in the applied indications is not affected by age differences in AEs. As expected, the frequency of nausea was higher in females compared to males in both treatment groups. In  the  RT  +  cetuximab group the frequencies of the following AEs were notably higher in females compared to males: dry skin, pharyngitis, and rash. For acne the opposite effect was seen. The risk benefit analysis for the drug in the applied indications is not affected by gender differences in AEs.

Lung disorders could be of interest from a benefit risk perspective, but the difference here is apparent also  in  the  RT  alone  group.  The  risk  benefit  analysis  for  the  drug  in  the  applied  indications  is  not affected by putative race-related differences in AEs.

In  conclusion,  the  AEs  observed  in  the  presented  studies,  mainly  reflect  the  AE  pattern  of  the underlying  diseases,  of  the  concomitant  treatment  regimens  and  the  cetuximab  treatment.  No unexpected interactions were identified.

- -The occurrence of fatal HSRs has been addressed in the SPC.
- -Headache, fever, and chills are common side effects of intravenous monoclonal antibody therapy and may be associated with administration of cetuximab. Consequently headache  was included in the SPC.
- -Data indicate that dry skin and pruritus should be considered as cetuximab-related reactions and described in the SPC.
- -Aggravation of local radiation reactions caused by cetuximab can be suspected from the data presented and is mentioned in section 4.8 of the SPC.
- -Late radiation toxicity appears from the data to be increased when combining radiotherapy with cetuximab. This is included in section 4.8 of the SPC.

No new safety data that affects the benefit risk analysis for the already approved indications are presented. There are, however, a number of issues in need for clarification as reflected in the list of questions.

Overall the safety profile of cetuximab is considered reasonably satisfactory for an oncology product as add-on to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

## OVERALL CONCLUSION AND Benefit-risk assessment

Benefit-risk  is  favourable  for  cetuximab  in  combination  with  radiation  therapy  for  the  first-line treatment of locally advanced SCCHN. Relevant improvement in survival and locoregional control has been  demonstrated  and  the  safety  profile  of  add-on  cetuximab  constitutes  no  concern.  No  study directly comparing RT + cetuximab with concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been conducted. Even if the efficacy of cetuximab + radiotherapy were inferior to CRT, the safety profile is relevantly favourable. Therefore this indication is recommended for approval. The add-on effect of cetuximab is small  in patients with poor performance status and this is reflected in the SPC. The importance of EGFR gene amplification should also be investigated as a follow-up measure.

A favourable benefit-risk for cetuximab as a single agent for the treatment of patients who have failed chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN has not been established. The MAH withdrew the claim for the monotherapy indication in this setting.
