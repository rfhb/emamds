## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Privigen (IgPro10) is a liquid formulation of normal human immunoglobulin G (IgG) at a concentration of 10%. IgPro10 is to be administered as an intravenous (i.v.) infusion. It meets the requirements of the Ph. Eur. Monograph: Human Normal Immunoglobulin for Intravenous Administration.

It  is  a  clear  opalescent  solution  with  a  protein  content  of  100  g/L  containing  at  least  98.0% Immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  of  the  total  protein  and  trace  amounts  of  Immunoglobulin  A  (IgA)  and Immunoglobulin M (IgM). More than 90% of the IgG consists of monomers and dimers. IgPro10 is prepared  from  large  donor  pools  and  represents  the  antibody  spectrum  present  in  the  donor population. All IgG subclasses found in normal serum are present in the final product. IgG function (Fc and  Fab  mediated  activity)  is  retained.  Dimer  and  aggregate  content,  as  well  as  anti-complement activity (ACA), of IgPro10 correspond to the requirements of an IVIG. The sterile 10% IgG solution is stabilized with 250 mmol/L of L-proline at pH 4.8. IgPro10 has low sodium content (&lt;1 mmol/L) and the osmolality is approximately 320 mOsmol/kg. The drug product is free of preservatives and sugars.

Privigen  has  been  licensed  in  Europe  via  the  centralized  procedure  since  25  April  2008  for  the indications  as  listed  in  the  Core  SPC  for  IVIg  (CPMP/BPWG/859/95  rev.  2).  In  accordance  with  the Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Normal Immunoglobulin for Intravenous Administration (IVIg) (CPMP/BPWG/388/95 rev.1), these indications were claimed based on 2 pivotal clinical studies in primary immunodeficiencies (Study ZLB03\\_002CR) and primary immune thrombocytopenia (Study ZLB03\\_003CR).

This application seeks to  extend the indication to include immunomodulation in adults, children and adolescents in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP).

## Background information on CIDP

CIDP is characterized by progressive or relapsing motor and/or sensory symptoms and signs in more than  1  limb,  developing  over  at  least  2  months.  Sensory  disturbances  are  usually  slight,  but  are  a common  finding  in  CIDP  subjects.  Proximal  and  distal  parts  of  the  limbs  are  usually  affected symmetrically. Atrophy is less marked than weakness. Loss of reflexes is found in almost all subjects, but may be confined to the ankles. Cranial nerve involvement, sometimes preceding the neuropathy, has been reported infrequently.

CIDP  is  an  orphan  disease.  Epidemiological  studies  suggest  a  CIDP  prevalence  of  up  to  9/100,000 population (Laughlin et al., 2009). Using the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)/Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) consensus guideline criteria for diagnosis of CIDP, an overall prevalence of 4.77 per 100,000 was found (EFNS and PNS joint task force, 2005). The severity of the disease  is  variable,  and  although  some  subjects  have  little  or  no  disability,  most  have  significant symptoms, often including fatigue. CIDP can cause prolonged periods of disability with 54% of subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

becoming severely disabled at some time during the illness. More than 10% remain severely disabled despite treatment. CIDP can occur at any age, with peak prevalence in the sixth and seventh decade.

The diagnosis of CIDP is based on the clinical, electrophysiological, cerebrospinal fluid features and, to a limited degree, on histopathology. Cerebrospinal fluid protein levels are generally elevated without cellular  reaction.  Electrophysiologically,  the  disease  is  characterized  by  reduced  nerve  conduction velocities,  abnormal  temporal  dispersion  and  conduction  block.  The  pathological  findings  include multifocal demyelination, mononuclear cells in close approximation to demyelinated axons, remyelination,  fiber  loss  and  'onion  bulbs'.  Lymphocytic  infiltration  can  be  found  in  sural  nerve biopsies, but, as may  be  expected  from  a  predominantly  motor  neuropathy  with  multifocal involvement, biopsies are frequently normal.

CIDP  is  an  immune-mediated  disorder.  A  beneficial  effect  of  immunosuppressive  therapy  (e.g. corticosteroids) and plasma exchange (PE) has been demonstrated in randomized clinical studies. In addition, there is a large body of evidence that IVIG is effective in improving disability in CIDP.

The exact pharmacotherapeutic mechanisms in auto-immune disorders are unclear, however there is some evidence that IVIGs exert their action in part through up-regulation of the inhibitory Fc γ IIB cell receptor  on  B  cells  in  CIDP  patients  compared  with  healthy  subjects  (Tackenberg  et  al.,  2009).  In addition,  number  of  circulating  CD4+  CD25+  T-  regulatory  cells  was  shown  to  be  reduced  in  CIDP patients. Increased frequency of genotype GA13-16 of the SH2D2A gene encoding for a T-cell-specific adapter protein in CIDP patients may result in a defective control and elimination of autoreactive T cells. IVlg treatment has been shown to increase numbers and function of peripheral CD4+ CD25+ Tregulatory cells in a mouse model. (I. van Schaik 2008).

In  general,  IVIG  targets  various  cellular  (such  as  dendritic  cells,  macrophages,  monocytes,  B  and  T cells) and soluble compartments (cytokines, complements, auto-antibodies, and auto-antigens) of the immune system that are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. These mechanisms are non-exclusive  and  work  synergistically  to  provide  their  therapeutic  effects,  which  is  essentially neutralization of the activated complement, inactivation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, downregulation of Fc receptors, adhesion to molecules on macrophage, and modulation of B-cells.

## Regulatory background

The  Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Human  Normal  Immunoglobulin  for  Intravenous Administration (IVIg) (CPMP/BPWG/388/95 rev.1), acknowledges that published literature indicates a positive effect of IVIG in some auto-immune disorders, in particular in multifocal motor neuropathy, CIDP and myasthenia gravis exacerbations. It also states that in order to license these indications, the efficacy in PID syndromes and ITP should be established and applicants are requested to provide:

- An analysis of existing literature.
- Confirmatory data with the applicant's IVIG, including a justification for the:
- -Scope of the confirmatory dataset (sample size, dose, time frame, study population).
- -Choice of the neurological scale and clinically meaningful differences within the chosen scale.
- -Comparator arm or lack of comparator arm.
- -Wash-out period of previous medication and/or stable co-medication.
- The investigation of these indications should be in accordance with the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With  the  present  submission,  the  MAH  is  providing  confirmatory  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  data  of Privigen  in  CIDP  (Study  IgPro10\\_3001).  Furthermore,  the  confirmatory  clinical  data  from  Study IgPro10\\_3001 are discussed in the context of the existing literature.

There are no orphan drugs authorized in this indication.

Scientific advice was given on the clinical development plan for the use of IgPro10 in CIDP. The final advice  was  provided  to  the  MAH  on  20  May  2010  (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/287087/2010;  procedure  no. EMEA/H/SA/1536/1/2010/II) and was implemented as follows:

- The  MAH's  proposal  was  to  perform  1  open-label,  single-arm  Phase  III  study  to  generate confirmatory data to support an extension to the indication CIDP. At the time of the planning of Study IgPro10\\_3001 the results of the ICE study (detailed in section 2.5.2) had been available and it was judged as not feasible to perform another Placebo-RCT in this indication with an IVIG due to ethical issues. The study planned to encompass IVIG-untreated as well as IVIG-pretreated subjects who  undergo  a  wash-out  period  of  the  previous  IVIG  until  confirmed  deterioration  to  avoid  a potential carry-over effect. This approach was considered adequate by the CHMP to substantiate indication for induction and maintenance treatment, in case of a positive outcome of the study. This also would rule out a possible carry-over effect from the previous IVIG. By using the placebo data from the ICE trial as a historical backdrop, the company would be employing a conservative estimate, which was deemed adequate. The MAH's study IgPro10\\_3001 implemented the advice given.
- The CHMP advised to extend the study duration to 24 instead of 21 weeks. In accordance with this, study IgPro10\\_3001 had a duration of 24 weeks.
- The MAH proposed to use data of the upper limit of the CI of the (historical) placebo response rate (33%)  from  the  ICE  Study,  since  1  successful  uncontrolled,  open-label  study  was  deemed adequate to generate confirmatory data and sufficient to support a label extension to the indication CIDP. This was endorsed by the SAWP/CHMP. In addition, the MAH aimed at obtaining a response rate of about 65%.
- The SAWP/CHMP advised to pre-specify methods for handling missing values in the analysis, which was done in the statistical analysis plan for Study IgPro10\\_3001 (Final Version 1.0, 22 November 2010).

## 2.2. Quality  aspects

N/A

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

The  non-clinical  pharmacologic,  pharmacokinetic,  and  toxicity  profile  of  Privigen  has  been  well characterized  and  no  further  non-clinical  data  has  been  submitted  with  this  application,  which  was considered acceptable.

The active substance is a protein, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, this extension of the indication for Privigen is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

The  objective  of  the  clinical  development  program  for  IgPro10  was  to  demonstrate  that  IgPro10  is efficacious  and  safe  in  CIDP.  The  MAH  conducted Study  IgPro10\\_3001, 'a  single-arm  study  to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Privigen in the treatment of subjects with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)' [EudraCT Number: 2009-017672-24].

GCP. The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

## 2.4.2. Clinical pharmacology

The PK properties of IgPro10 have been determined in subjects with PID. The PK of immunoglobulins are well known and have been described extensively in various diseases (Koleba et al., 2006). Further exploration of PK properties was judged not to be of medical relevance in the CIDP indication.

No pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted for IgPro10 in CIDP in humans. However, findings from  research  on  the  IVIG  mode  of  action  can  be  extrapolated  to  IgPro10  in  this  indication.  IVIG targets various cellular (such as dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, B and T cells) and soluble compartments (cytokines, complements, auto-antibodies, and auto-antigens) of the immune system that are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (Maddur et al., 2009). These mechanisms are  non-exclusive  and  work  synergistically  to  provide  their  therapeutic  effects,  which  is  essentially neutralization of the activated complement, inactivation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, downregulation of  Fc  receptors,  adhesion  to  molecules  on  macrophage,  and  modulation  of  B-cells  (Kieseier  et  al., 2008).

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Main study - Study IgPro10\\_3001

## Methods

Study IgPro10\\_3001 was a prospective, multicenter, open- label single-arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of IgPro10 in the treatment of CIDP. The study planned to enroll both IVIG and IVIG-untreated subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Flow chart for study IgPro10\\_3001

<!-- image -->

A total of 30 subjects were planned to be enrolled, expecting that about 20 subjects would be treated with IgPro10.

IVIG-pretreated subjects were discontinued from their regular IVIG treatment during a washout period of up to 10 weeks until disease deterioration (assessed by the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment Scale [INCAT] disability score). Subjects deteriorating by at least 1 score point (except for an increase from 0 to 1 solely due to upper limb score) during the washout period were eligible for IgPro10 treatment.

IVIG-untreated subjects entered directly into the IgPro10 treatment period after screening.

## Treatment

All subjects were to receive 1 IgPro10 induction dose of 2 g/kg given over 2 to 5 consecutive days, followed by 7 IgPro10 maintenance doses of 1 g/kg administered every 3 weeks.

Infusions were to be started at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min; if well tolerated within 30 minutes, the rate could be increased in a first step to 1.0 mg/kg /min for another 30 minutes and then increased in a stepwise approach to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/min.

CIDP treatments, with the exception of other immunoglobulins, were allowed if the dose and frequency was  stable  during  the  3  months  prior  to  enrollment  and  was  also  kept  stable  during  the  study. Specifically, the other allowed CIDP treatments were steroids or methotrexate/ azathioprine.

## Study duration

The treatment period was 21 weeks; the final assessment was to occur 3 weeks later resulting in an overall assessment period of 24 weeks.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of IgPro10 in subjects with CIDP. Clinical outcome was determined using the adjusted INCAT score, the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score and maximum grip strength.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate based on the adjusted INCAT score. Response was defined as a ≥1 point improvement in the adjusted 10-point INCAT score at endpoint (Week 25 or completion visit) relative to baseline. The primary endpoint in Study IgPro10\\_3001 was based on an 'adjusted' INCAT score that did not consider a change solely in the arm score from 0 to 1 or vice versa.

## Statistical analysis

The total set consisted of all subjects screened. The safety data set (SDS) was based on all treated subjects. The full analysis set (FAS) was used to describe the analysis set that is as complete and as close as possible to the intention-to-treat (ITT) ideal including all treated subjects. The valid cases set (VCS) consisted of all subjects of the FAS without any major protocol deviation, i.e. the set of subjects who participated in the study as intended.

In general, descriptive summary statistics for continuous variables were to comprise number of nonmissing observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum. For categorical variables frequencies and percentages were to be provided.

The  sample  size  calculation  refered  to  a  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  Wilson  Score  confidence interval  for  Privigen  treatment,  based  on  the  INCAT  score.  The  INCAT  score  was  analyzed  as  a responder rate. With a sample size of n=7 subjects and an estimated response rate in the study of 65% (based on the lower number of IVIG-untreated subjects in the study as compared to Hughes et al. 2008), the lower limit of the two-sided 95% Wilson Score confidence interval was estimated to be &gt;35%,  which  is  the  upper  limit  of  the  recalculated  confidence  interval  for  the  ICE  study  Placebo response estimate (Hughes et al. 2008). This resulted in a predicted confidence interval half-width of 0.3, with a conditional probability of the confidence interval to meet the targeted half-width of at most 0.3  of  more  than  90%  (exact  99%).  To  address  a  potential  misspecification  of  the  assumptions regarding the point estimates a total of 30 subjects were to be enrolled to ensure approximately 20 analysable subjects.

Missing  values  for  the  Inflammatory  Neuropathy  Cause  and  Treatment  scale  (INCAT)  score  and  the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score were replaced by last observation carried forward (LOCF) on item basis. For the MRC score, if less than 2/3 of the items were answered, the MRC sum score was set to missing.

## Results

## Participant flow and baseline data

This  multicenter  study  was  conducted  at  13  sites  located  in  Europe.  A  total  of  31  subjects  were screened, and 28 subjects were eligible for the study and were treated with IgPro10. Of the 28 eligible subjects,  13  subjects  were  IVIG-pretreated,  while  15  were  IVIG-untreated.  The  number  of  subjects treated  at  each  site  ranged  from  1  to  4.  Subjects  received  their  first  IgPro10  infusion  between  31 January 2011 and 14 June 2011.

Three subjects were considered to be screening failures and did not receive any study drug (Subject 1701:  IVIG  treatment  had  been  interrupted  for  10  months;  Subject  2403:  neuropathy  caused  by diabetes mellitus; Subject 3603: did not experience deterioration by at least 1 adjusted INCAT score point during the washout period).

A total of  2  subjects  discontinued  the  study  during  the  induction  period  and  1  subject  discontinued during the maintenance period, leaving 25 subjects who completed the study (Figure 1). Reasons for discontinuation  were  AEs  (Subjects  0301  and  1901)  and  other:  insufficient  response  to  treatment (Subject 0303)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Full Analysis Set [FAS], 64.3% of subjects were male; the mean age was 58.7 years (range: 22 -79 years) and mean body weight was 82.3 kg. All subjects were white Caucasians.

23  subjects  (82.1%)  had  a  diagnosis  of  definite  CIDP  and  5  subjects  (17.9%)  had  a  diagnosis  of probable CIDP. The mean time since CIDP diagnosis was 3.71 years (minimum 0.11 years; maximum 13.94 years); 67.9% of subjects had a CIDP history of 1 year or longer. Only 3 subjects (10.7%) had a disease duration of &gt;10 years.

Fourteen subjects had been pre-treated with IVIG, 1 of whom did not deteriorate after IVIG withdrawal (and  thus  was  not  treated  in  the  study).  Previous  IVIG  treatments  included  a  variety  of  different products needing reconstitution (e.g. Sandoglobulin) as well as ready-to-use products (e.g. Privigen and Gamunex). The median dose of pre-study IVIG normalized to a 3-week treatment cycle was 0.50 g/kg.

The mean (SD) INCAT score at baseline was 3.7 (1.39), for IVIG untreated patients it was 3.0 (1.1) and for IVIG pre-treated it was 4.5 (1.27).

In the patients' medical history (previous and concomitant diseases) hypertension (50%), hypothyroidism (14.3%), obesity (14.3%), depression, hypercholesteremia, and neuralgia (all 10.7%) were the most common.

No single type of prior medication had been taken by &gt;2 subjects and the most commonly used were antibacterials, antithrombotic agents, and analgesics.

The  CHMP agreed that the patient  population  can  be  regarded  as  representative  for  an  adult  CIDP population.

The subject population (n= 28) of Study IgPro10\\_3001 (male (55% to 65%), mean age between 50 60  years)  is  in  accordance  with  previous  research.    The  mean  time  since  CIDP  diagnosis  was  3.71 years and mean INCAT score at baseline was 3.7, indicating that subjects were moderately affected by CIDP.  Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  were  IVIG-pretreated  and  half  were  IVIG-untreated.  At baseline the IVIG-pretreated patients had a worse INCAT score than the untreated patients (4.5 vs. 3.0). This INCAT difference between IVIG untreated and treated patients at baseline, is explainable by the  fact  that  pre-treated  patients  were  discontinued  from  their  regular  IVIG  treatment  during  a washout period of up to 10 weeks until disease deterioration by at least 1 score point on the INCAT score.

## Treatment administration

Altogether 259 infusions were administered to 28 subjects during the course of the study (73 infusions during the induction period; 186 infusions during the maintenance period)

## Infusion rate (FAS set)

| Treatnent period   | Numberofinfusions   | Mean (SD)                            | Mean (SD)           |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
|                    |                     | Maxinum infusion rate (ng/kg bw/min) | Duration ofinfusion |
| Induction          | 73                  | 5.7 (1.97)                           | 4.7 (1.46)          |
| Maintenance        | 179                 | 5.9 (1.94)                           | 5.7 (1.54)          |

There was no dose reduction due to any reason in this study. In 1 subject (0302), the infusion rate at induction infusion day 4 was reduced from 4.2 to 3.3 mg/kg/min. At induction infusion day 5, a higher rate of 4.0 mg/kg/min was again tolerated, and the subject received IgPro10 at a maximum infusion rate of 7.3 mg/kg/min at infusion day 9.

## Efficacy Results

## Primary endpoint: INCAT response rate

In the FAS, the overall responder rate was 60.7% (17/28 subjects were responders) with a lower limit of the 2-sided 95% Wilson-Score CI of 42.4%. The primary objective, i.e. a lower limit of the 2-sided 95% Wilson-Score CI of the IgPro10 responder rate higher than 35, was achieved. Thus, the study was regarded as successful for the primary endpoint.

In the VCS, the overall responder rate was 63.6% (14/22 subjects were responders) with a lower limit of the 95% Wilson-Score CI of 43.0%.

There was only 1 subject (Subject 3302) who experienced a change solely in the arm score from to 0 and was consequently regarded as a 'non-responder' according to the 'adjusted' INCAT score. One subject who responded at the Week 19 visit did not maintain his improvement at the Week 25 visit and was therefore regarded as a non-responder.

The response rate was noticeably higher in IVIG-pretreated subjects (76.9% of subjects) than in IVIG untreated subjects (46.7% of subjects).

## Secondary endpoints

## Time to INCAT response

50% of subjects demonstrated a response at the first visit 3 weeks after the IgPro10 induction dose (2 g/kg over 2 to 5 days). 94% of all responders (16 of 17 subjects) experienced their improvement after 1 induction dose and 2 maintenance doses (1 g/kg every 3 weeks).

The overall mean time to response was 10.4 weeks (median 7.5 weeks).

## Change from baseline: INCAT score

The adjusted INCAT score improved from a mean (SD) of 3.7 (1.39) points at baseline to 2.3 (1.49) points at the completion visit (mean change: -1.4 points). For IVIG pretreated vs. previously untreated patients see table below:

## Grip strength

In the FAS group, maximum grip strength of the dominant hand improved from a mean (SD) of 66.7 (37.24)  kPa  at  baseline  to  80.9  (31.06)  kPa,  resulting  in  a  mean  difference  of  14.1  kPa  (i.e.  an improvement of grip strength of 21.1%). Maximum grip strength of the non-dominant hand improved from a mean (SD) of 69.9 (38.35) kPa at baseline to 80.3 (33.87) kPa, resulting in a difference of 10.44 kPa or an improvement in strength of 14.9%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  adjusted  INCAT  responders,  grip  strength  markedly  improved  compared  to  non-responders irrespective of handedness:

| Change from baseline to completion visit | 22.6 [1.99, 43.30]                          | 1.0[-10.62.12.53]                           | 16.9 [-2.74, 36.63]                         | 0.3 [-10.29, 10.93]                         |

The  CHMP  noted  that  the  maximum  grip  strength  response  showed  that  patients  (irrespective  of handedness) who were INCAT responders initially had lower baseline values for grip strength and thus the  difference  to  the  completion  visit  was  larger  than  those  who  were  INCAT  non-responders.  This partially  reflects  the  fact  that  the  average  INCAT  score  at  baseline  was  slightly  lower  in  the  nonresponder  group  (3.18)  compared  to  the  responder  group  (4);  i.e.  the  more  severe  the  baseline values, the more visible on average the response becomes.

Maximum  grip  strength  was  also  assessed  in  relationship  to  IVIG-pretreatment  (pre-treated  vs untreated): both groups showed improvement from baseline to completion visit, however, the values in the untreated group were higher at all-time points.

| Maximum   | grip   | strength   | [kPa]   | in   | relationship   | IVIG-pretreatment   |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------|------|----------------|---------------------|

The CHMP noted that the mean INCAT score at baseline for IVIG untreated patients it was 3.0 and for IVIG  pre-treated  it  was  4.5,  indicating  that  the  pre-treated  group  were  on  average  more  severely affected. This may be an explanation for why the IVIG untreated group has higher grip strengths at alltime points in the study.

## MRC sum score

The MRC sum score improved from a mean (SD) of 66.5 (7.51) points at baseline to 73.4 (7.25) points at the completion visit (mean change of 6.9 points). In adjusted INCAT responders, the MRC sum score increased by 7.9 points [95% CI: 4.08, 11.69] and by 5.5 points [95% CI: 0.64, 10.27] in adjusted INCAT non-responders.

Twenty-three  of  28  subjects  (84.8%)  showed  a  response  (improvement  by  at  least  3  score  points compared to baseline) at the completion visit. Half of the responders (42.9%) responded already after

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

having received the induction dose, as assessed at Week 4. Median time to first response in MRC sum score was 6 weeks.

Adjusted INCAT responders and adjusted INCAT non-responders had similar values for MRC sum score at baseline and this increased in both subgroups by the completion visit (by 7.9 points [95% CI 4.08, 11.69] in adjusted INCAT responders and by 5.5 points [95% CI 0.64, 10.27] in adjusted INCAT nonresponders).

MRC sum score was evaluated in relationship to IVIG-pretreatment. In both the IVIG untreated and pre-treated patients there was an increase from baseline to completion.

## 2.5.2. Supportive studies from literature

CIDP is an orphan disease with a prevalence of less than 1 per 10,000 inhabitants in Europe. Because of  the  small  size  of  the  disease  population  only  small  randomized  studies  had  been  performed  until 2006 with a total population of 118 subjects in 4 studies comparing IVIG with placebo (Eftimov et al., 2009). The studies performed before 2006 were mostly very small, terminated prematurely (Thompson et al., 1996), and had a very short follow-up (maximum up to 6 weeks).

With the publication of the ICE Study by Hughes et al in 2008, the number of study subjects having been treated with IVIG and placebo doubled to 235 subjects. The ICE study is described in more detail below.

Further  evidence  of  efficacy  in  the  literature  is  described  in  a  systematic  review  from  the  Cochrane Library  (Eftimov  et  al.,  2009  and  updated  in  2011),  and  other  studies  (Fergusson  et  al.,  2005).  In addition, 3 studies compared the efficacy of IVIGs with either corticosteroids (RMC Trial Group, 2009; Hughes et al., 2001) or Plasma Exchange (Dyck et al., 1994).

From the Cochrane Review (August 2011, Eftimov F, Winer JB, Vermeulen M, de Haan R, van Schaik IN)  7  randomised  controlled  trials  including  287  participants  were  eligible  for  evaluation.  Five randomised trials proved that intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability more than placebo. Two other  small trials  showed  no  significant  difference  between  intravenous  immunoglobulin  and  plasma exchange  in  one  and  corticosteroids  in  the  other.  Mild  and  transient  side  effects  were  reported  in approximately  half  of  treated  participants;  serious  side  effects  were  reported  in  six  per  cent  of  the treated participants. This did not differ significantly from plasma exchange or corticosteroids treated participants.  Whether  the  improvements  are  equally  clinically  relevant  cannot  be  deduced  from  this analysis  because  each  trial  used  a  different  disability  scale  with  a  unique  definition  of  a  significant improvement. Only one study included in this review had a long-term follow-up. These results suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability more than placebo over 24 and 48 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ICE study

The most recent randomized, controlled study of IVIG in CIDP is the ICE Study (Hughes et al., 2008), which provides definitive and substantial evidence of the efficacy of IVIG in CIDP, both in the short and long term. It included 117 subjects. The ICE Study provides guidance for induction and maintenance dosage  of  IVIG  in  CIDP:  Induction  therapy  is  recommended  as  2  g/kg,  and  maintenance  therapy showed ongoing and continued benefit at 1g/kg every 3 weeks. The results of the ICE study are the basis  of  current  international  guidelines  (e.g.  EFNS/PNS  guidelines  2010)  and  have  confirmed  the usage of IVIGs in sensory and motor CIDP (recommendation level A) and as first-line therapy in pure motor CIDP.

IgPro10\\_3001 has a similarly long-term observation period of at least 24 weeks as the randomized, placebo-controlled ICE Study. In addition, the ICE Study used a 10% formulation of IVIG, i.e. the same immunoglobulin concentration as IgPro10. The comparison of the IVIG arm of the ICE study to Study IgPro10\\_3001 indicates that the findings from Study IgPro10\\_3001 are in line with the results from the ICE  Study.  The  subjects  who  entered  the  ICE  Study  had  to  be  IVIG-free  for  at  least  3  months. Therefore, the results can be best compared with the IVIG-untreated subjects in Study IgPro10\\_3001. (See table below)

| Parameter [SD] (95% CI)                         | ICE (IVIG-arm)            | IgPro10_3001       |

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Study  IgPro10\\_3001  was  a  prospective,  multicenter,  open-  label  single-arm  trial  in  CIDP  adult patients; it is in compliance with the scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/1536/1/2010/II) and in line with the general guidance of the revised IVIG Guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 2.

The patient population was considered as representative for an adult CIDP population. Of 31 subjects screened, 28 subjects were treated with IgPro10, administered as a regimen of a 2 g/kg induction dose and 1 g/kg maintenance doses every 3 weeks. Of those 28 subjects, 13 subjects were IVIG-pretreated and 15 were IVIG-untreated. A total of 2 subjects discontinued the study during the induction period and  1  subject  discontinued  during  the  maintenance  period,  leaving  25  subjects  who  completed  the study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate; response was defined as those patients who had achieved a ≥1 point improvement in the adjusted 10-point INCAT score at Week 25 (or completion visit) relative to baseline. Compared to historic controls (in particular the ICE study) the target lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the response rate was set at &gt;35%; the actual lower limit was 42.4%; thus the primary endpoint was achieved. The overall responder rate was 60.7%. Half of the responders had  responded  after  the  induction  dose  (assessed  at  Week  4)  and  all  responders  (except  2)  had demonstrated response by Week 10. IVIG-pretreated subjects had a higher response rate than IVIGuntreated subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean adjusted INCAT score improved from 3.7 points at baseline to 2.3 points at the completion visit (mean change: -1.4 points). Mean maximum grip strength of the dominant hand improved from 66.7 kPa at baseline to 80.9 kPa at completion (mean change: 14.1 kPa). The mean MRC sum score (0-80 points) improved from 66.5 points at baseline to 73.4 points at completion (mean change: 6.9 points).

## IVIG-pretreated versus IVIG-untreated subjects

On average the IVIG-pretreated subjects showed a greater improvement INCAT scores and slightly less change in grip strength and MRC scores.

| Parameter [SD] (95% CI)                    | IgPro10_3001 IVIG pre-treated N=13   | IgPro10_3001 IVIG untreated N=15**   |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| IVIG responders                            | 76.9%                                | 46.7%                                |
| INCAT scores at baseline                   | 4.5                                  | 3.0                                  |
| Mean change in INCAT score                 | -1.8 (-2.6, -0.9)                    | -1.1 (-1.8, -0.27)                   |
| Mean change in maximum grip strength (kPa) | 10.8 (-2.8, 24.5)                    | 17.0 (-6.7, 40.6)                    |
| Mean change MRC sum score                  | 6.1 (2.7, 9.4)                       | 7.7 (2.9, 12. 4)                     |

## Adjusted INCAT-responders versus adjusted INCAT non-responders

In adjusted INCAT responders, mean maximum grip strength of the dominant hand improved by 22.6 kPa [95% CI 1.99, 43.03 kPa] between baseline and completion. In adjusted INCAT non-responders values for mean maximum grip strength were similar at baseline and at the completion visit (mean change of 1.0 kPa [95% CI -10.62, 12.53 kPa]). Similar results were observed for the non-dominant hand.

Adjusted INCAT responders and adjusted INCAT non-responders had similar values for MRC sum score at baseline and this increased in both subgroups by the completion visit (by 7.9 points [95% CI 4.08, 11.69] in adjusted INCAT responders and by 5.5 points [95% CI 0.64, 10.27] in adjusted INCAT nonresponders).

There is limited evidence available on dose frequency with IVIG for long-term maintenance therapy. The EFNS guideline of 2010 cites only 1 study (ICE) where 1g/kg IVIG every 3 weeks was efficacious for 24 and possibly 48 weeks and the final recommendation is to individualize the appropriate dose and (perhaps) frequency after a patient has become stable on a regimen of intermittent IVIG.  A recent article  by  the  Therapeutics  and  Technology  Assessment  Subcommittee  of  the  American  Academy  of Neurology also comes to the conclusion that IVIG is effective and should be offered in the long-term treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Level A) but that dosing, frequency, and duration of IVIG for CIDP may vary depending on the clinical assessment (Patwa 2012).

The MAH has therefore adjusted the SmPC recommendation on long-term usage of IVIG in CIDP to better reflect these recommendations as follows ' The dose is based on the dose used in the clinical study conducted with Privigen. The duration of treatment beyond 24 weeks should be subject to the physicians  discretion  based  upon  the  patient  response  and  maintenance  response  in  the  long-term. The dosing and intervals may have to be adopted according to the individual course of the disease.'

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Overall  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  efficacy  data  demonstrated  that  IgPro10,  administered  as  a regimen of a 2 g/kg induction dose and 1 g/kg maintenance doses every 3 weeks, was an effective treatment in subjects with CIDP, resulting in INCAT response rates of 60.7%. IVIG pretreated patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

had a higher response rate compared to IVIG untreated patients (76.9% vs. 46.7%) which may be partially  explained  by  the  assumption that the IVIG-pretreated group consisted of patients who had already exhibited a clinical response to immunoglobulins.

The INCAT response rate was supported by similar improvements in the secondary efficacy outcome measures (adjusted INCAT score decrease, increase in maximum grip strength, and increase in MRC sum score). Literature data from other studies done to date with other IVIGs supports this evidence.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The safety profile of IVIg in general is well-known both in children and adults. To support the safety of Privigen in CIDP the MAH presented data from the pivotal Phase 3 study.

## Patient exposure

A total of 259 infusions of IgPro10 were administered to 28 subjects during the course of the study IgPro10\\_3001 (73 infusions during the induction period; 186 infusions during the maintenance period). There were no dose reductions due to any reason. No infusion had to be stopped due to an AE.

## Severity of AEs

Most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity, except 2 severe AEs (AE of headache in Subject 2101; SAE of haemolysis in Subject 0301). Both severe AEs resolved by the end of the reporting period.

## Relatedness of AEs by treatment period

Overall 17 subjects (60.7%) had causally related AEs (AEs at least possibly related to study drug), which occurred at a rate of 0.189 (49 events).

A total of 13 subjects (46.4%) experienced causally related AEs during the induction period and 11 subjects (39.3%) experienced causally related AEs during the maintenance period.

Causally related AEs occurred at a rate of 0.370 (27 events) during the induction period and at a rate of 0.118 (22 events) during the maintenance period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SOC with the highest incidence of at least possibly related AEs was nervous system disorders, both in the induction period (7 subjects [25.0%]) and in the maintenance period (4 subjects [14.3%]).

In  the  induction  period,  the  next  most  commonly  affected  SOCs  were  general  disorders  and administration site conditions (5 subjects (17.9%)) and vascular disorders (4 subjects [14.3%]). In the maintenance period, all other SOCs had ≤2 subjects (7.1%) of subjects with at least possibly related AEs.

The most common AE considered to be at least possibly related during the study was headache, which was reported by 8 subjects (28.6%]) in total (7 subjects [25.0%] during induction period; 4 subjects [14.3%] during maintenance period). Hypertension and asthenia (4 subjects [14.3%] in total for each AE) were the next most common at least possibly related AEs (induction period: 3 subjects (10.7%) with  hypertension  vs  maintenance  period:  2  subjects  (7.1%)  reporting  hypertension  and  1  subject (3.6%) reporting asthenia. Other than this, haemolysis, nausea, and influenza-like illness were each reported by 2 subjects (7.1%) during the induction period whereas only 1 subject (3.6%) for nausea or no subjects reported these events during the maintenance period. Leukopenia was reported by 2 subjects (7.1%) during the maintenance period compared to no subjects during the induction period. All other AEs were only reported by a single subject.

The highest rates per infusion for at least possibly related AEs were reported for headache (0.069 [18 events]  in  total;  0.096  [7  events]  during  induction  period;  0.059  [11  events]  during  maintenance period.

## Infusion rate adjustment

The infusion rate was adjusted once in Subject 0302 who had an AE of hypertension that was probably related to study drug. Of note, hypertension was also part of this subject's medical history.

## Laboratory findings

There were 8 laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs.

5/8 were treatment-emergent AEs (4 subjects with leukopenia [Subjects 2802, 3304, 3601, and 3605; 1 subject with hyperbilirubenaemia [Subject 3302]); (narratives were provided). All of these AEs were mild to  moderate in intensity;  the  majority  was  considered  by the  investigator  to  be  not  related  or unlikely  related  to  study  drug,  and  were  resolved  at  the  final  follow-  up.  None  of  these  led  to discontinuation or modification of study product, to any other intervention, or to discontinuation from the study.

3/8 laboratory values were reported as non-TEAEs, as the abnormal values, were already present prior to the first IgPro10 dose (Subject 2803 with ALAT; Subject 3302 with leukopenia; Subject 3002: with blood CK increased).

## Haematology

Abnormal range changes (shifts) from normal at baseline to low at the completion visit were observed in 7 subjects (25.0%) each for erythrocytes, leukocytes and lymphocytes, in 5 subjects (17.9%) each for hemoglobin and monocytes, in 3 subjects (10.7%) for hematocrit, and in 1 subject each (3.6%) for platelets, reticulocytes, and neutrophils.

None of the hemoglobin values associated with the shifts were classified as clinically significant, and no subject experienced a shift in hemoglobin to &lt;10 g/dL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Abnormal range changes (shifts) from normal at baseline to high at the completion visit were observed in 6 subjects (21.4%) for neutrophils, in 3 subjects (10.7%) each for reticulocytes and basophils, and in 1 subject (3.6%) for monocytes.

Individual clinically significant  abnormal  hematology  values  were  reported  for  neutrophils  (19 subjects), monocytes (13 subjects), basophils (10 subjects), leukocytes (8 subjects), reticulocytes (6 subjects),  eosinophils  (3  subjects),  lymphocytes  (2  subjects)  and  erythrocytes,  hematocrit  and platelets (1 subject each).

## Serum chemistry

Abnormal range changes (shifts) from normal at baseline to low at the completion visit were observed in 2 subjects each (7.1%) for bilirubin and creatinine.

Abnormal range changes (shifts) from normal at baseline to high at the completion visit were observed in 4 subjects (14.3%) for CK, in 3 subjects (10.7%) each for ALAT and ASAT, in 2 subjects (7.1%) each for BUN and alkaline phosphatase, and in 1 subject (3.6%) each for LDH and bilirubin. Six shifts were from normal to '+' and 3 were to '++' none were '+++'.

Individual clinically significant abnormal serum chemistry values were reported for CK (17 subjects), LDH (14 subjects), BUN (11 subjects), ALAT (10 subjects), ASAT (10 subjects), alkaline phosphatase (3 subjects), bilirubin (3 subjects), and creatinine (2 subjects)

The  CHMP  noted  the  explanation  provided  by  the  MAH  for  the  5  treatment-emergent  AEs  (4  x leukopenia  and  1x  hyperbilirubenaemia):  two  patients  had  a  history  of  leukopenia,  two  had  low baseline  leukocytes;  the  one  subject  with  hyperbilirubinaeamia  had  received  azathioprine  as  a concomitant therapy (which is known to cause leukopenia, pancytopenia, and hyperbilirubinaeamia and was therefore discontinued at Week 25.

## Vital signs

Vital signs (diastolic/systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) showed no consistent or  clinically  relevant  changes;  the  mean  and  median  changes  from  pre-infusion  were  low  for  all parameters at all visits.

## Physical examination

Most  findings  of  the  physical  examinations  were  due  to  the  underlying  disease(s).  Any  clinically relevant changes from baseline were recorded as AEs. There were no physical examination findings that were recorded as at least possibly related AEs at the completion visit.

## Discontinuations

Two  subjects  (7.1%)  experienced  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  before  they  received  maintenance treatment (Subjects 0301 and 1901 with SAEs of haemolysis).

## Serious adverse events and deaths

There were no deaths in this study.

No evidence of TEEs was seen in this study.

Four  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  4  SAEs  (haemolysis  in  Subject  0301  and  in  Subject  1901; deterioration of CIDP in Subject 3003; worsening of chronic sigmoid diverticulitis in Subject 1202). The SAE of deterioration of CIDP started prior to first infusion. The 2 SAEs of haemolysis were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug. One SAE was severe in intensity: in patient 0301 hemoglobin decreased from 15.9 g/dL (prior to the first infusion), and to 10.5 g/dL; 1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SAE was moderate in intensity (CIDP in Subject 3003), and 2 SAEs were mild in intensity (haemolysis in Subject 1901; diverticulitis in Subject 1202). All SAEs resolved without sequelae.

## Haemolysis

IVIg products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBC) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction (Coomb's test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration.

Isolated  cases  of  haemolysis-related  renal  dysfunction/renal  failure  or  disseminated  intravascular coagulation have occurred in patients treated with Privigen.

The  following  risk  factors  are  associated  with  the  development  of  haemolysis:  high  doses,  whether given  as  a  single  administration  or  divided  over  several  days;  non-0  blood  group;  and  underlying inflammatory state. As this event was commonly reported in non-0 blood group patients receiving high doses for non-PID indications, increased vigilance is recommended.

Haemolysis has rarely been reported in patients given replacement therapy  for PID.  IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of haemolysis.

There were two cases of haemolysis reported in study IgPro10\\_3001.

## Onset and duration of haemolysis cases in study IgPro10\\_3001

|   Subjectnumber | TinebetweenstartofinfusiontoonsetofAE   | DurationofAE         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|
|            0301 | 38.6 hou1s                              | 792hours s (33 days) |

Patient 0301 had blood group A, Rh+, patient 1901 had blood group AB, Rh-; as stated above both subjects were discontinued from the study.

The MAH has set up a number of measures to increase awareness, minimize the risk and clarify this issue.

The MAH proposed to include haemolysis as uncommon adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Sections  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC  already  contain  warnings  on  the  risk  of  haemolysis;  the  risk  of haemolysis  with  Privigen  is  included  as  an  important  identified  risk  in  the  RMP;  and  the  MAH  will further elucidate this risk within the ongoing post-marketing study IgPro10\\_4001. In addition, the MAH will also change its manufacturing process and conduct a non interventional post-authorisation safety study  to  compare  the  rate  of  haemolysis  before  and  after  the  implementation  of  risk  minimization measures.'

## Assessment of paediatric data

CIDP  in  children  is  a  very  rare  condition.  The  few  epidemiological  studies  available,  suggest  a prevalence  rate  between  0.23/100,000  and  1/100,000.  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  scarce reports of clinical studies.

The MAH claimed that it is reasonable to assume that results of studies in adults apply to children as well, for the following reasons:

- IVIGs have been proven to be effective in the treatment of CIDP in adults.
- The pathogenesis of the disease is similar in children and adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The mechanism of action of the treatment does not differ between different age groups.

A few pediatric studies (Ryan 2000, Simmons et al., 1997; Nevo et al., 1996; Hattori et al., 1986) have studied children CIDP. IVIGs at a dose of 2g/kg bw/day divided over 2 to 5 consecutive days have shown good efficacy in 50% to 88% of pediatric CIDP subjects, improving disability for up to 12 weeks. A proportion of subjects needed recurrent treatment for several years to maintain improvement.

Simmons  (Muscle  Nerve;  1997)  compared  15  children  to  69  adults  with  CIDP  with  the  following results:

Children demonstrated many similarities to adults:

- (1) Antecedent events were uncommon.
- (2)  There  was  a  high  frequency  of  weakness  and  reflex  loss,  a  relatively  high  frequency  of sensory loss, and a low frequency of pain and cranial neuropathies.
- (3) Cerebrospinal fluid protein levels were usually elevated.
- (4)  On  electrodiagnostic  testing,  not  all  nerve  segments  were  abnormal,  and  not  all  children satisfied electrodiagnostic criteria for CIDP.

Children differed from adults with CIDP in several ways:

- (1) The onset of symptoms was usually more precipitous.
- (2) Gait abnormalities were a more frequent presenting symptom.
- (3) Children always presented with significant neurological dysfunction, and not with the minor symptoms initially seen in some adults.

The initial response of children with CIDP to immunomodulating therapy was excellent. In the longterm follow-up (comparing 12 children and 62 adults), children often had more rapidly fluctuating and relapsing courses than adults. The recovery of children from each episode of deterioration was usually excellent,  and  better,  on  average,  than  in  adults.  Multiple  courses  of  IVIg  could  be  given  with continued efficacy.

Hattori  et  al  in  Japan  (Journal  of  the  Neurological  Sciences  Vol.  184,  Issue  1,  15  February  2001) examined clinical features of CIDP in 3 different age groups: juvenile (&lt;20 years); adult, 20 to 64; and elderly, (&gt;64 years) (total n=124). Half of the juvenile group showed subacute progression initially, while  most  patients  in  the  elderly  group  showed  chronic  insidious  progression.  Motor  dominant neuropathy  was  prominent  in  juveniles,  while  sensorimotor  neuropathy  was  frequent  in  the  elderly group. A relapsing and remitting course predominated in the juvenile group. Demyelinating and axonal degenerating features in sural nerve biopsy and in nerve conduction studies were common to three age groups.

Results from a study conducted on 28 patients (7 age&lt;16 and 21 &gt;16) affected by CIDP followed up for more than 1 year support the conclusions of both Simmons and Hattori (Jo et al, 2010). Among 7 children, IVIG was used in 6 patients. The study aimed at characterizing the clinical characteristics of pediatric  patients  enhanced  some  differences  and  some  similarities  between  the  child  and  adult groups. The child group was found to show a more precipitous onset of symptoms, a higher frequency of  gait  abnormalities,  a  tendency  to  present  more  significant  neurological  dysfunctions  and  better response to treatment. No significant difference was observed between the child and adult group in terms of gender, CSF protein level, nerve conduction study, or sural nerve biopsy. All patients in the child group presented a subacute onset of symptoms. On the contrary, adults can be divided in two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups in equal proportions: those with subacute onset and those with chronic progressive onset. The initial  rapid  deterioration  in  children  did  not  have  an  impact  on  the  clinical  severity  with  respect  to adults since neither the Modified Rankin Score (MRS) at times of peak impairment nor the degree of functional  disability  at  the  nadir  was  significantly  different  between  the  2  groups  (p=0.094  and p=0.042). The final functional outcome was better in the child group and 6 patients treated with IVIG (out of the total 7 patients) showed a complete remission of symptoms. Study results also confirmed a higher tendency of relapse in children than in adults, although not statistically significant (p=0.574), probably due to the small number of subjects. A recent review published by Riekhoff (Riekhoff et al, 2012) takes in consideration data from a total of at least 136 children described in literature. Although a systematic meta-analysis was not possible due to the differences in the presentations of the study reports, the Authors concluded that in general and in comparison to adults, children tend to have a more  acute  progressive  onset,  with  more  severe  symptoms.  Children  also  show  a  higher  tendency towards a relapsing remitting course and often show a better and faster improvement after therapy, and  a  more  favorable  outcome,  thus  reaching  the  same  conclusions  reported  in  the  papers  by  Jo, Simmons and Hattori (all included in the review). Based on current knowledge of CIDP pathophysiology,  therapy  is  aimed  at  controlling  inflammation  and  preventing  demyelination  and axonal degeneration through immunomodulation. For this reason IVIG, corticosteroids and plasmapheresis are all considered as first line therapies (Riekhoff, 2012; Connolly, 2001; Simmons, 1997). Children treated with IVIG or corticosteroids usually show a rapid response, sometimes within one week, with partial or complete recovery. (Connolly, 2001; Riekhoff et al, 2012; Jo et al, 2010, Korinthemberg et al, 1999; Vedanarayanan et al 1991).

No prospective and/or controlled clinical studies in childhood CIDP were found.

The CHMP acknowledged that CIDP in children is a very rare condition and that the pathogenesis of the disease is similar in children and adults. In a few studies that have been performed comparing IVIG therapy in children and adults the response was similar in both age groups.

The CHMP requested the PDCO to give its opinion on Privigen's use in the paediatric population and whether it would be acceptable to extrapolate the adult data to the paediatric population, especially when seen in conjunction with data from the initial Privigen studies during the MAA in PID children (31/79 were &lt; 16 years of age). (see annex 7)

The PDCO considered that there is paediatric need in this condition. With regard to treatment options and  the  therapeutic  benefit  of  Privigen  for  CIDP,  data  indicate  a  potential  benefit  for  the  use  of immunoglobulins in both adults and children.

The  data  presented  by  the  company  provided  further  support  for  the  efficacy  of  IVIg  in  CIDPtreatment. The beneficial effect of IVIg-treatment seen so far for Guillain-Barre-syndrome and CIDP was brought forward to support the assumption at this point that efficacy could be extrapolated. Based on  the  assessment  of  this  application,  the  new  study  data  presented  by  the  company  and  further discussions  at  the  Paediatric  Committee,  the  PDCO  recommended  to  accept  at  this  point  the assumption of extrapolation of adult efficacy data to the paediatric population.

Since  Privigen  has  already  received  the  indication  for  the  use  in  PID  and  ITP  in  the  paediatric population and safety information has already been obtained, it was suggested that a possible way to obtain further information on the use of this immunoglobulin's use in CIDP in children could be done via a Post-Authorization Safety Study.

In the context of the Privigen renewal procedure (EMEA/H/C/000831/R/0065) and the discussion about hemolysis  after  administration  of  Privigen,  CSL  Behring  committed  to  perform  a  non-interventional Post-Authorization  Safety  Study  (PASS)  in  order  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  risk  minimisation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

measures (donor screening and manufacturing process change). CSL Behring will design the PASS so that it allows the evaluation of the overall Privigen safety profile in children treated for CIDP.

Overall, the CHMP concluded that the safety profile of Privigen is consistent with other products within this class. The risk of haemolysis is a concern for all IVIgs, although Privigen data seems to show an increase in cases of haemolysis and of its severity.

The following warning in section 4.8 has been slightly amended:

In Privigen clinical studies with paediatric patients, the frequency, nature and severity of adverse reactions did not differ between children and adults. In postmarketing reports it is observed that the proportion of haemolysis cases to all case reports occurring in children is slightly higher than in adults. all reported adverse events that are haemolysis cases is slightly higher in children than in adults Please refer to section 4.4 for details on risk factors and monitoring recommendations.

In  addition,  the  product  information  highlights  that  only  limited  experience  is  available  of  use  of intravenous immunoglobulins in children with CIDP.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety of IgPro10 was evaluated in all 28 subjects enrolled and treated in Study IgPro10\\_3001. The dose applied in the induction period was 2 g/kg and in the maintenance period 1 g/kg.

A total of 259 IgPro10 infusions were administered, whereby 22/28 subjects (78.6%) experienced at least 1 AE. AEs were possibly related to study drug in 19 subjects (67.9%), and temporally associated (i.e. during infusion or within 72 hours after the end of infusion) in 16 subjects (57.1%). Based on the 259 infusions administered, the overall AE rate per infusion was 0.417, the rate of possibly related AEs was 0.189, and the rate of temporally associated (72 hours) AEs was 0.255.

Headache,  pain  in  extremity,  asthenia,  hypertension,  and  leukopenia  were  the  most  common  AEs, each experienced by &gt;2 subjects (&gt;10%). Other common AEs (in ≥2 subjects [≥7.1%]) were nausea, arthralgia, influenza-like illness, oropharyngeal pain, rash, contusion, and haemolysis. Almost all AEs were mild or moderate in intensity.

The  AE  rate  per  infusion  was  slightly  lower  in  the  maintenance  period  (0.387  AEs  per  infusion)  as compared to in the induction period (0.493 AEs per infusion).

No deaths occurred in this study. Four SAEs occurred in 4 subjects (14.3%; 2 cases of haemolysis, 1 case each of deterioration of CIDP and one case of worsening of chronic sigmoid diverticulitis.

The  2  SAEs  of  haemolysis  were  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug  and  led  to discontinuation (these were the only discontinuations). All subjects experiencing SAEs, including those experiencing haemolysis, recovered without sequelae.

The laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs were mild to moderate in intensity; the majority was considered to be not related or unlikely related to study drug, and were resolved at the final follow-up. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs.

The  risk  of  haemolysis  is  of  concern  and  the  origins  of  the  haemolysis  have  not  been  completely elucidated, however the MAH has included a number of warnings in the Product information and has set up a number of steps described in the RMP to minimize this risk.

The are number of new adverse reactions (AR) identified in Study IgPro10\\_3001 that have been added to  the  adverse  reaction  section  of  the  product  information  (haemolysis,  leukopenia,  migraine, dysaesthesia,  vertigo,  peripheral  vascular  disorder,  rash  and  muscular  weakness).  In  addition,  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

frequencies  of  some  labelled  ARs  has  been  modified  from  uncommon  to  common  (hypertension, urticarial, asthenia and influenza-like illness).

The MAH will design the PASS so that it allows the evaluation of the overall Privigen safety profile in children treated for CIDP.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of IVIg in general is well-known both in children and adults.

The safety data of study IgPro10\\_3001 indicate that IgPro10 was safe and reasonably well tolerated when administered as i.v. infusions to subjects with CIDP.

The CHMP and PDCO considered acceptable to extrapolate the adult data to the paediatric population.

## 2.7. Risk management plan

The MAH submitted an updated risk management plan which included a risk minimisation plan.

The following risk factors are associated with the development of haemolysis: high doses, whether given as a single administration or divided over several days; non-0 blood group; and underlying inflammatory state. As this event was commonly reported in non-0 blood group patients receiving high doses for non-PID indications, increased vigilance is recommended. Haemolysis has rarely been reported in patients given replacement therapy for PID. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of haemolysis.

In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered. While these reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many of the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, those containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. In patients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain sucrose may be considered. Privigen does not contain sucrose, maltose or glucose. In patients at risk of acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of infusion and dose practicable.   |

## 2.8. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been  updated.  The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  In  addition,  Annex  II  has  been updated in accordance with version 8.3 of the QRD template.

The detailed changes, to which the CHMP agreed, are described below:

## Under Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Immunomodulation in adults, and children and adolescents (0-18 years) in:

- Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), in patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery to correct the platelet count.
- Guillain-Barré syndrome.
- Kawasaki disease.
- Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Only limited experience is available of use of intravenous immunoglobulins in children with CIDP.

## Under Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)

The recommended starting dose is 2 g/kg bw divided over 2 to 5 consecutive days followed by maintenance doses of 1 g/kg bw over 1 to 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks.

(This is also included in the dosing table)

*The dose is based on the dose used in the clinical study conducted with Privigen. The duration of treatment beyond 24 weeks should be subject to the physicians discretion based upon the patient response and maintenance response in the long-term. The dosing and intervals may have to be adopted according to the individual course of the disease.

## Under Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Paediatric population

Although limited data is available, it is expected that the same warnings, precautions and risk factors apply to the paediatric population.

## Under Section 4.8 Undesirable effects

…..

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Four Three clinical studies with Privigen were performed, 2 two in PID patients, and one 1 in ITP patients and 1 in CIDP patients respectively. In the pivotal PID study 80 subjects were enrolled and treated with Privigen. Of these, 72 completed the 12 months of treatment. In the PID extension study 55 subjects were enrolled and treated with Privigen. The ITP and CIDP studies y were as performed in 57 and 28 patients respectively.

Most adverse reactions (ARs) observed in the 4 three clinical studies were mild to moderate in nature.

The ARs reported in the three 4 studies are presented in the table below according to the MedDRA System organ classification (SOC and Preferred Term Level).

In Privigen clinical studies with paediatric patients, the frequency, nature and severity of adverse reactions did not differ between children and adults. In postmarketing reports it is observed that the proportion of haemolysis cases to all case reports occurring in children is slightly higher than in adults. all reported adverse events that are haemolysis cases is slightly higher in children than in adults Please refer to section 4.4 for details on risk factors and monitoring recommendations.

## Under Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

….

The safety and efficacy of Privigen was evaluated in three 4 prospective, open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies performed in Europe (ITP, and PID and CIDP studies) and the USA (PID study).

In a multicentre open label trial (Privigen impact on mobility and autonomy PRIMA study) patients (who have previously either received IVIG or not) were treated with a Privigen starting dose of 2g/kg bw given over 2-5 days followed by 6 maintenance doses of 1g/kg bw over 1-2 days every three weeks. Previously treated patients were withdrawn from IVIG until confirmed deterioration before start of Privigen. On the adjusted 10 point INCAT (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment) scale an

improvement of at least 1-point from baseline to treatment week 25 was observed in 17 out of 28 patients. The INCAT responder rate was 60.7% (95% confidence interval [42.41, 76.4]). 9 patients responded after receiving the initial induction dose, 16 patients responded by week 10.

Muscle strength as measured by the MRC (Medical Research Council) Score improved in all patients by 6.9 points (95% confidence interval [4.11, 9.75], in previously treated patients by 6.1 points (95% confidence interval [2.72, 9.44]) and in untreated patients by 7.7 points (95% confidence interval [2.89, 12.44]). The MRC responder rate, an increase of at least 3 points, was 84.8% which was similar in previously treated (81.5% [58.95, 100.00]) and untreated (86.7% [69.46, 100.00]) patients.

In patients defined as INCAT non-responders, muscle strength improved by 5.5 points (95% confidence interval [0.6, 10.2]) as compared to INCAT responders (7.4 points (95% confidence interval [4.0, 11.7])

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Paediatric population

No differences were seen in the pharmacokinetic parameters between adult and paediatric study patients with PID. There are no data on pharmacokinetic properties in paediatric patients with CIDP.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The MAH conducted Study IgPro10\\_3001, 'a single-arm study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of  Privigen  in  the  treatment  of  subjects  with  chronic  inflammatory  demyelinating  polyneuropathy (CIDP)'. The study demonstrated that Privigen, administered as a regimen of a 2 g/kg induction dose and  1  g/kg  maintenance  doses  every  3  weeks,  was  an  effective  treatment  in  subjects  with  CIDP, resulting in INCAT response rates of 60.7%.

The INCAT response rate was supported by similar improvements in the secondary efficacy outcome measures (adjusted INCAT score decrease, increase in maximum grip strength, and increase in MRC sum score). Literature data from other studies done to date with other IVIGs supports this evidence

The positive efficacy outcomes confirm data from other studies performed to date with other IVIGs in CIDP and indicate a class-effect.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

IVIG pretreated patients had a higher response rate compared to IVIG untreated patients (76.9% vs. 46.7%). This may be partially explained by the assumption that the IVIG-pretreated group consisted of patients who had already exhibited a clinical response to immunoglobulins.

There is limited evidence available on dose frequency with IVIG for long-term maintenance therapy and a warning on long-term usage of IVIG in CIDP has been introduced in the SmPC highlighting use subject to the physicians discretion based upon the patient response, with the need to adapt dosing and treatment intervals as appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  no  prospective  and/or  controlled  clinical  studies  in  childhood  CIDP  are  available.  The CHMP, however, acknowledged that CIDP in children is a very rare condition and that the pathogenesis of the disease is similar in children and adults. In the few studies that have been performed comparing IVIG therapy in children and adults the response was similar in both age groups, and the available data to  date,  indicate  a  potential  benefit  for  the  use  of  immunoglobulins  in  both,  adults  and  children. Therefore, based on the assessment of this application, the new study presented by the MAH, and the PCDO's opinion, the CHMP accepted the extrapolation of adult data to the pediatrics population.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety of IgPro10 was evaluated in all 28 subjects enrolled and treated in Study IgPro10\\_3001. The dose applied in the induction period was 2 g/kg and in the maintenance period 1 g/kg.

Headache,  pain  in  extremity,  asthenia,  hypertension,  and  leukopenia  were  the  most  common  AEs. Other common AEs were nausea, arthralgia, influenza-like illness, oropharyngeal pain, rash, contusion, and haemolysis. Almost all AEs were mild or moderate in intensity.

Heamolysis is a well-known risk with IVIGs and is part of the core SmPC. However the data available so far seem to suggest that there is a higher rate of serious haemolysis cases with Privigen compared to  other  IVIGs.  As  most  IVIG  products  are  made  by  pooling  ~10.000  donations  (containing isoagglutinins)  and  are  given  to  similar  patient  populations,  it  appears  however  not  completely comprehensible  why  the  frequency  of  haemolysis  should  significantly  differ  from  one  product  to another. Data available to-date suggests that other product-related factors may play a role; this has been adequately addressed in the risk management plan to further elucidate on the uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects.

The are number of new adverse reactions (AR) identified in Study IgPro10\\_3001 that have been added to  the  adverse  reaction  section  of  the  product  information  (haemolysis,  leukopenia,  migraine, dysaesthesia,  vertigo,  peripheral  vascular  disorder,  rash  and  muscular  weakness).  In  addition,  the frequencies  of  some  labelled  ADRs  have  been  modified  from  uncommon  to  common  (hypertension, urticarial, asthenia and influenza-like illness).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

As a higher rate of mild and severe haemolytic reactions has been reported with Privigen the CHMP concluded that this risk needs to be further investigated. As detailed in the Risk Management Plan, the MAH  will  be  searching  for  additional  possible  causative  factors  of  haemolysis  in  the  ongoing  postauthorisation  study  IgPro10\\_4001.  The  MAH  will  also  change  its  donor  pool  and  the  manufacturing process  in  order  to  reduce  the  isoagglutinine  titers  in  the  final  product  and  conduct  a  noninterventional post-authorisation study to compare the rate of haemolysis before and after implementation of these two measures.

The safety profile of IVIg in general is well-known both in children and adults, however no prospective and/or controlled clinical studies in childhood CIDP are available. The MAH will design a PASS so that it allows the evaluation of the overall Privigen safety profile in children treated for CIDP.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The  efficacy  of  Privigen  in  adults  treated  for  CIDP  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated  in  Study IgPro10\\_3001. The limited data available in the paediatric population allow for extrapolation in children in this indication.

In general, the risk profile of Privigen is similar to other IVIGs and the AEs are well described in the current Product Information. Privigen, seems however, to have an increased risk of mild and severe haemolysis which is being investigated by the MAH as part of their RMP and the Product Information contains detailed warnings about this issue.

## Benefit-risk balance

The  benefit/risk  profile  of  Privigen  in  immunomodulation  in  adults,  children  and  adolescents  (0-18 years) in Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is considered to be positive and the CHMP recommends the extension to the currently authorised indications.
