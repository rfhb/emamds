## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

b-Thalassemia  major  (b-TM)  is  a  heritable  blood  disorder  where  the  inability  to  form  functional hemoglobin  (Hb)  results  in  life-threatening  anemia,  requiring  life-long  transfusions  to  maintain  life. Iron  overload  is  one  of  the  major  causes  of  morbidity  in  patients  with  thalassemia  major.  Chronic transfusions invariably lead to rapid accumulation of iron since the human body has no natural ability to actively excrete iron 1 .  The excess iron is mainly stored in the liver (70.0 to 90.0%), but will also redistribute to the heart and endocrine tissues 2,3 . Main causes of mortality are due to sudden cardiac death, arrhythmia, and heart failure from cardiac iron overload. The majority of morbidity stems from liver cirrhosis from hepatic iron overload and endocrine dysfunction. The goal of iron chelation therapy is to reduce iron overload in the susceptible organs and to prevent end-organ damage (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, endocrinopathies), morbidities known to reduce survival in this population.

Three  iron  chelators  are  currently  approved  in  the  EU.  Deferoxamine  (DFO,  Desferal®)  is  a parenterally-administered iron chelator that has been shown to reduce mortality and LIC compared to placebo 4 . Two oral products deferiprone (DFP, Ferriprox®) and deferasirox (DFX, Exjade®) were then approved  for  iron  overload  treatment  in  patients  with  thalassaemia  major.  Oral  chelators,  DFP  and DFX, are conventionally used as monotherapy 5 .

Efficacy  of  iron  chelators  combination  is  the  subject  of  many  research.  However,  based  on  the indications of DFX and DFP, their combination with other iron chelator therapies is considered as an off-label use.

Deferiprone (DFP) is an oral iron chelator that has demonstrated efficacy similar to DFO 6,7 . However, its  side  effects  (neutropenia,  agranulocytosis,  elevation  in  hepatic  enzymes,  and  arthralgia)  have precluded its widespread 6,7 .

In response to the PRAC recommendation, the MAH conducted a review of data in the clinical database and of  the  published  literature  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  combination  of  Ferriprox  with  other chelators which was presented in the last type II variation (EMEA/H/C/236/II/89G). Efficacy and safety data on the use of combination therapy are finally presented in this extension of indication to include a new indication for Ferriprox in combination with another chelator.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The  MAH  provided  a  clinical  overview  with  published  literature  data  on  the  combination  therapy  of deferiprone with deferoxamine and deferiprone with deferasirox. This variation application provides an assessment of this clinical overview in light of results of clinical trials and recent consensus statement from  the  American  Heart  Association.  A  tabulation  of  the  submitted  publications  is  presented  in Appendix A.

## 2.2.2. Clinical pharmacology

Most of the literature on chelators combination describes deferiprone/deferoxamine association.

A shuttling hypothesis 8 whereby synergistic cellular iron mobilization requires one chelator to have the physicochemical properties to enter cells, chelate intracellular iron and subsequently donate iron to a second 'sink' chelator has been proposed.

DFO's metabolism is due almost entirely to various enzymes in plasma, thus hepatic metabolism of oral iron chelators should not be affected. Specific substrate specificities between deferasirox (mostly UGT1AUGT1A1 and to a lesser  extent  UGT1A3)  and  deferiprone  (UGT1A6)  should  not  lead  to  drug interaction 9,10 .

The provided pharmacology studies seem sufficient. At least additive effects can be expected and even some synergy, while pharmacological data (PK and PD) do not theoretically prevent the combination of DFO with DFP.

## 2.3. Clinical efficacy

## 2.3.1. Main studies

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application. The MAH provided a clinical overview with published literature data on the efficiency of deferiprone, deferoxamine, deferasirox in monotherapy and in combination (see Appendix A and B).

In  these  studies,  iron  overload  was  measured  by  multiple  methods  usually  used  in  clinical  practice. Combinations of these different techniques have been used to evaluate chelators efficiency.

Serum ferritin level can be measured frequently via blood testing and is particularly useful to monitor trends in iron burden over time. Elevated liver iron concentration (LIC) has been found to be correlated with total body iron stores in b-TM patients 11 .

Measurement of the amount of iron eliminated in urine and feces provides an equivocal determination of  the  effectiveness  of  an  iron  chelator  in  removing  iron  from  the  body  (normally  urine  and  feces contain negligible amounts of iron (~1 mg/day) 12 .

The proportion of ferritin measurements of &gt;2500 mg/L was established as an important prognostic factor  on  cardiac  disease-free  survival  in  b-TM  patients  on  iron  chelation.  However,  a  ferritin  level below 2500 mg/L does not preclude the presence of severe cardiac iron overload 13 .

Measurement of T2 relaxation time (T2*) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) via gradient recall echo provides a more accurate and highly reproducible assessment of cardiac iron overload 14 .

## Table from Kwiatkowski. Management of transfusional iron overload-differential properties and efficacy of iron chelating agents. J. Blood.Med. 2011:2 135-149.

A clinical trial conducted by Maggio et al. 14 included 144 patients with thalassemia major. Patient were randomly assigned to DFP (75 mg/kg/day) (n = 71) or DFO (50 mg/kg/day) (n = 73) for 1 year. No difference in the reduction of serum ferritin was observed (222 ± 783 ng/ml with DFP and 232 ± 619 ng/ml with DFO; p= 0.81). No difference in the reduction of liver and heart iron content was found by magnetic  resonance  between  the  two  groups.  These  results  demonstrated  no  difference  after  12 months of treatment in serum ferritin levels or liver and heart iron content. However, the assessor observes that the very high variances reported in both groups should prevent any conclusion on similar effects or even non-inferiority and this study is poorly informative.

A  randomized  controlled  trial  was  performed  in  61  patients  previously  maintained  on  subcutaneous deferoxamine 15 . The primary end point was the change in myocardial siderosis (myocardial T2*) over 1 year  in  patients  maintained  on  subcutaneous  deferoxamine  or  those  switched  to  oral deferiprone monotherapy. The dose of deferiprone was 92 mg/kg/d and deferoxamine was 43 mg/kg for 5.7 d/wk. The  improvement  in  myocardial  T2(*)  was  significantly  greater  for  deferiprone  than  deferoxamine (27% vs 13%; P = 0.023). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LEFV) increased significantly more in the deferiprone-treated group (3.1% vs 0.3% absolute units; P = 0.003). The changes in liver iron level (0.93 mg/g dry weight vs -1.54 mg/g dry weight; P = 0.40) and serum ferritin level (-181 microg/L vs 466 microg/L; P = 0.16), respectively,  were  not  significantly  different  between  groups.  Deferiprone monotherapy was significantly more effective than deferoxamine over 1 year in improving asymptomatic myocardial siderosis in beta-thalassemia major.

In  this  last  study,  the  assessor  observes  that  DFP  produces  a  lager  effect  on  all  three  investigated parameters and the relative potency compared to DFO is roughly of a same extent. The fact that only LEVF  change  reached  statistical  significance  may  indicate  that  this  parameter  is  more  powerful  to detect  differences,  not  necessarily  that  DFP  has  a  more  pronounced  effect  specifically  on  this parameter.

A variety of factors differentiate the currently available iron chelators. First, the various pharmacological  properties  (including  the  stoichiometry  of  iron  chelation,  mode  of  administration, dosing schedule, plasma half-life, and route of excretion) of the different chelators are well described in the literature. Second, drug efficacy is variable, particularly with regard to organ-specific (hepatic, cardiac) iron removal. Third, adverse-effect profiles differ among chelators.

It  is  then  acknowledged  that  chelation  therapy  needs  to  be  individualized.  The  three  chelators available  allow  the  physicians  to  adapt  the  chelation  therapy  according  to  different  parameters (compliance, efficacy, toxicity, …) in case of treatment failure, unsuitability of current treatment and urgent need for rapid chelation. Adaptation of the doses and switch to a different chelator remain the first options. However, combination therapy may be proposed in order to give the possibility to take advantage of the different pharmacological properties of the different chelators for specific cases. The combination therapy includes the possibility to give concomitantly or alternatively iron chelators. The way to manage combination therapy remains to be more precisely described (OC).

## Main studies of deferiprone and deferoxamine combination chelation therapy

## 1. Efficacy on iron overload

A randomized controlled trial 16 compared combination therapy (n=32) to DFO alone (n=33) for 1 year. The patients were pretreated by DFO monotherapy. All patients were administered DFO 5 days a week at  a  dosage  of  35  mg/kg/day,  and  those  in  the  combination  treatment  group  additionally  received daily  Ferriprox  (75  mg/kg  per  day).  Significantly  greater  improvement  in  serum  ferritin  in  the combined group (-976 versus -233 µg/L; P=0.001) was observed.

Another controlled trial 17 randomized 60 patients undergoing chelation with DFO to either remain on DFO monotherapy (5 to 7 days per week) or switch to an alternating regimen (5 days of deferiprone (75 mg/kg per day) alternating with 2 days of DFO. Both arms resulted in equivalent decreases of serum ferritin (-248 ± 791 µg/l for the alternating therapy group vs - 349 ± 573 µg/l for the DFO group; p = 0.5802).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Alternating therapy has also been evaluated in a long-term trial that included a 5-year follow-up 18 . 213 patients (pretreated by DFO or DFP) were randomized to DFP at 75 mg/kg, divided into three oral daily doses, for 4 d/week and DFO by subcutaneous infusion (8-12 h) at 50 mg/kg per day for the remaining 3 d/week (n=105) was compared with DFP alone at 75 mg/kg (n=108), administered 7 d/week  during  a  5-year  follow-up.  The  group  receiving  alternating  therapy  showed  a  significant reduction in serum ferritin.

In conclusion, in the randomized  trial with 65 patients, DFP-DFO  combination  administered concomitantly  is  associated  with  greater  efficacy  than  DFO  alone  as  regards  serum  ferritin  level  in patients previously treated.

In a randomized trial with 60 patients, alternating therapy (5 days of deferiprone (75 mg/kg per day) alternating with 2 days of DFO) compared to DFO alone did not show greater efficacy in decrease in serum  ferritin  level  than  DFO  alone.  However,  a  randomized  trial  with  213  patients  showed  that alternating  therapy  (4  days  of  deferiprone  (75  mg/kg  per  day  alternating  with  3  days  of  DFO) compared to DFP alone was correlated with a greater efficacy in decrease of serum ferritin level. The fact  that  alternating  therapy  demonstrated its superiority over DFP and not over DFO may indicate that this solution may rather rescue inefficient DFP monotherapy.

## 2. Efficacy on cardiac iron overload

A  consensus  statement  from  the  American  Heart  Association  has  been  established  in  2013.  Use  of deferiprone-DFO  combination  therapy  is  recommended  in  patients  suffering  moderate  to  severe cardiac iron overload or when cardiac dysfunction is detected: 'The first principle of management of acute  heart  failure  is  control  of  cardiac  toxicity  related  to  free  iron  by  urgent  commencement  of  a continuous,  uninterrupted  infusion  of  high-dose  intravenous  deferoxamine,  augmented  by  oral deferiprone'.

A  randomized  placebo-controlled  clinical  trial 19 compared  the  use  of  deferoxamine  alone  or  in combination  with  deferiprone  (75  mg/kg  per  day)  in  the  treatment  of  65  patients  with  mild  to moderate cardiac iron loading (cardiac T2* 8-20 ms). The beneficial effect of combined therapy on cardiac  iron  removal  and  improvement  in  cardiac  function  was  confirmed.  After  one  year,  those receiving combination therapy had significantly greater improvement in cardiac T2* (from 11.7 to 17.7 ms compared with 12.4 to 15.7 ms) and in LVEF (2.6% compared with 0.6%) than those receiving deferoxamine alone.

Efficacy  of  deferoxamine  and  deferiprone  combination  was  confirmed  in  a  single  arm  trial 20 of  15 patients  with  severe  myocardial  siderosis  (T2*  &lt;8  ms)  and  myocardial  dysfunction.    At  baseline, deferoxamine was prescribed at 38 +/- 10.2 mg/kg for 5.3 days/week, and deferiprone at 73.9 +/4.0  mg/kg/day.  Treatment  with  deferoxamine  combined  with  deferiprone  resulted  in  significant improvement in cardiac T2* (5.7 to 7.9 ms) and LVEF (51.2% to 65.6%).

In  contrast  to  what  was  observed  for  alternating  therapy,  simultaneous  combination  therapy  of DFO/DFP may improve a marker of cardiac overload when compared to DFO, making the simultaneous combination superior to DFO when heart iron overload must receive control.

## 3. Effect on liver iron concentration

One observational study described a more rapid decline of liver iron concentration with combination compared  to  monotherapy 21 . In a study of 52 patients 22 who  switched from deferoxamine monotherapy to deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy at baseline, 98% of patients had hepatic iron overload and 64% had severe hepatic overload: after 3 years of combination therapy, these proportions declined to 60% and 10%, respectively, and by 5 years, none of the 50 patients remaining on the study had iron overload.

Thus, combination therapy could be an alternative therapeutic option in case of mild or severe hepatic iron overload uncontrolled by iron chelator monotherapy.

## 4. Effect on endocrine complications

Regarding endocrine complications, a small study in 11 patients showed that combined therapy (DFO at 35-50 mg/kg, 3-4 times a week associated with DFP at 75 mg/kg, per os, daily) improved glucose metabolism 23 .  In  a  study  from  Greece,  reversal  of  endocrine  complications  with  very  intensive combined chelation (DFP 75-100 mg/kg/day and DFO 20-60 mg/kg/day) has been reported. Abnormal glucose  metabolism  was  normalized  in  11  of  39  (44%) 23 ,  several  cases  of  hypothyroidism,  and hypogonadism  reversal  were  reported 25 .  However,  zinc  deficiency  has  also  been  implicated  in  the development of hypogonadism and has been more commonly associated with DFP chelation therapy than DFO or DFX 24 . DFP cannot be associated with a better decrease endocrine complication. Further studies are awaited.

## 5. Effect on survival

Randomized  trial  evaluating  the  survival  of  the  deferiprone-DFO  combination  treatment  were provided 25 . The multivariate analysis in Cyprus showed that combined chelation was associated with improved  survival.  The  proposed  explanation  by  the  authors  of  the  significant  trend  of  increasing between  1980  and  2000  (p&lt;0.001)  and  a  decline  (but  not  significant)  after  2000  cardiac  deaths (p=0.06) was the introduction of the combination therapy. In the small long-term comparative study (16  patients  on  DFO  monotherapy  and  19  patients  on  deferiprone  and  DFO  combination  therapy), there was no increased mortality with the combination 26 .

A major factor affecting mortality in any disease (especially severe and life threatening) over a recent period of 20 years is the global improvement in healthcare systems efficiency. To take the example of heart failure, improved prevention/detection, availability of new drugs (beta blockers, RAS inhibitors).

Roger V et al reported in the JAMA 2004 that ' survival after heart failure diagnosis improved over time (5-year age-adjusted survival, 43% in 1979-1984 vs 52% in 1996-2000, P&lt;.001). However, men and younger  persons  experienced  larger  survival  gains,  contrasting  with  less  or  no  improvement  for women and elderly persons .'

Applied to a younger population and most often before diagnosis of heart failure in a population goes for very intensive follow-up, this improvement may be even larger.

As a consequence, the demonstration that combination therapy explained mortality improvements in Cyprus is considered very weak by the assessor. No statement related to this improvement should take place in the AR and in the PI.

## Main studies of deferiprone and deferasirox combination chelation therapy

Among the  5  publications  presented  in  the  Appendix  B:  2  of  them  were  case  studies 27,28 with  one patient; two others were prospective, single center studies carried by Farmaki et al. 29 in 15 patients and Totadri et al. 30 in 36 patients showed serum ferritin significant decreases. In addition, liver iron concentration and cardiac iron load decreased in Farmaki et al. study.

Data  from  the  randomized  prospective  study 31 showed  that  both  combination  regimes  DFP/DFX  and DFP/DFO were similarly effective in reducing liver iron concentration and serum ferritin in heavily iron loaded TM patients with normal cardiac function. However, this study was carried only in two centers, 48 patients in each group. No data was provided in comparison with monotherapy.

In conclusion, further studies were needed to complete the evaluation of the effect of this combination on larger number of patients and with different grades of iron overload severity.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

As noted by the MAH, most studies are observational, only few are prospective and/or randomized. The high number of publications shows the interest of combination therapy by the scientific community in  the  treatment of severe bTM. Comparative studies and some randomized clinical trials show that DFP-DFO combination is associated with relatively more rapid or pronounced serum ferritin decreases when compared with monotherapy. In addition, a decrease in serum ferritin could be associated with a

decrease in iron liver. However, effects on endocrine complications and survival remain unclear. Use of the  combination  on  moderate  and  severe  cardiac  complications  is  the  only  clear  indication.  For  the DFP-DFX combination, data are also too preliminary and further studies on larger number of patients and with different grades of iron overload severity are needed.

Randomized trial with alternating therapy (Maggio et al., 2009) or combination therapy (Gomber et al., 2004; Aydinok et al., 2007) compared to DFP alone concluded to a greater efficacy of combination to decrease  serum  ferritin  level.  As  supported  by  the  Guidelines  for  the  Management  of  Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia (TDT) 3 rd  Edition (Cappellini et al. 2014), these studies show that SF can be controlled with a relatively low frequency of DFO given twice a week when combined with DFP standard doses (75 mg/kg/day). The fact that DFO-DFP combination therapy demonstrated its superiority over DFP and not over DFO (Galanello et al., 2006; Aydinok et al., 2007) may indicate that this solution may rather rescue inefficient DFP monotherapy or provide a more acceptable option to patients not accepting  frequent  infusions  anymore  (which  may  correspond  to  an  inefficient  monotherapy  due  to tolerability issues and is covered by the Rapporteurs' indication wording).

A similar SF decrease was observed between DFP-DFO combination compared to DFO (Aydinok et al., 2007) but a greater efficacy of the combination was found in patients which received more days of DFO (5 days vs. 2 days) (Tanner et al., 2007). Tanner et al. (2007) compared the use of DFO alone or in combination  with  DFP  (75  mg/kg  per  day)  in  the  treatment  of  65  patients  with  mild  to  moderate cardiac iron loading (cardiac T2* 8-20 ms). The beneficial effect of combined therapy on cardiac iron removal and improvement in cardiac function  was  confirmed.  Efficacy  of  DFO-DFP  combination  was confirmed  in  a  single  arm  trial  of  15  patients  with  severe  myocardial  siderosis  (T2*  &lt;8  ms)  and myocardial dysfunction (Tanner et al., 2008). In contrast to what was observed for alternating therapy, simultaneous  combination  therapy  of  DFO/DFP  may  improve  a  marker  of  cardiac  overload  when compared to DFO, making the simultaneous combination superior to DFO when heart iron overload must receive control.

In summary, data from the published literature on iron balance studies in patients with thalassaemia major show that the use of Ferriprox concurrently with deferoxamine (coadministration of both chelators during the same day, either simultaneously or sequentially, e.g., Ferriprox during the day and deferoxamine during the night), promotes greater iron excretion than either drug alone. Doses of Ferriprox in those studies ranged from 50 to 100 mg/kg/day and doses of deferoxamine from 40 to 60 mg/kg/day. However, chelation therapy may not necessarily protect against iron-induced organ damage.

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluated the effect of concurrent therapy with Ferriprox and deferoxamine in patients with thalassaemia major, who previously received the standard chelation monotherapy with subcutaneous deferoxamine and had mild to moderate cardiac iron loading (myocardial T2* from 8 to 20 ms). Following randomization, 32 patients received deferoxamine (43.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week) and Ferriprox (75 mg/kg/day) and 33 patients received deferoxamine monotherapy (34.9 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week). After one year of study therapy, patients on concurrent chelation therapy had experienced a significantly greater reduction in serum ferritin (1574 µg/l to 598 µg/l with concurrent therapy vs. 1379 µg/l to 1146 µg/l with deferoxamine monotherapy, p&lt;0.001), significantly greater reduction in myocardial iron overload, as assessed by an increase in MRI T2* (11.7 ms to 17.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 12.4 ms to 15.7 ms with deferoxamine monotherapy, p=0.02) and significantly greater reduction in liver iron concentration, also assessed by an increase in MRI T2* (4.9 ms to 10.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 4.2 ms to 5.0 ms with deferoxamine monotherapy, p&lt; 0.001).

The above information has been included in section 5.1. of the SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The wording of the indication has been agreed as:

Ferriprox monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major when current chelation deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate.

Ferriprox in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive correction (see section 4.2).

Dose adjustments when used with other iron chelators have been included in  the SmPC section 4.2. as follows:

In patients for whom monotherapy is inadequate, Ferriprox may be used with deferoxamine at the standard dose (75 mg/kg/day) but should not exceed 100 mg/kg/day.

In the case of iron-induced heart failure, Ferriprox at 75-100 mg/kg/day should be added to deferoxamine therapy. The product information of deferoxamine should be consulted.

Concurrent use of iron chelators is not recommended in patients whose serum ferritin falls below 500 µg/l due to the risk of excessive iron removal.

## 2.3.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The CHMP acknowledge the conditions in which the combination chelation therapy is needed: a failure to control the iron burden at maximum dosage of current chelators and when current chelators cannot be adequately used, e.g. associated with dose-limiting toxicities.

Moreover, in the absence of evidence that a particular combination is a problem, its use should not be restrained, and the possibility to use Ferriprox in combination should be given to the clinician based on its own assessment of the potential benefit for the patient. Therefore the combination of Ferriprox with another chelator in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive - is supported by the above data.

Efficacy data of the DFP-DFX combination is very limited due to the small number of patients exposed and the lack of information about the safety of this combination (only 5 patients exposed in the MAH clinical trials). Thus, the use of deferiprone with deferoxamine or deferasirox has been differentiated in the  SmPC.  Additional  precautions  for  use  have  been  added  on  the  combination  of  deferiprone  and deferasirox as limited data are available.

## 2.4. Clinical safety

## 2.4.1. Main Studies

Safety data collected by ApoPharma during later-stage clinical trials and safety results published in the literature were provided in this application instead of new relevant data from dedicated trial.

In  the  pooled  safety  database  of  all  patients  enrolled  in  ApoPharma  clinical  trials  (N=712  as  of  31 August  2014),  115  patients  received  combination  Ferriprox-DFO  therapy,  with  a  mean  exposure  of slightly over 2 years.  Five other patients received combination Ferriprox-DFX therapy (not included in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  table  below).  A  list  of  ADRs  from  Apopharma  database  that  compares  the  proportion  of  ADRs between  Ferriprox  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  was  provided  in  Appendix  C.  The  total exposure for Ferriprox in combination with DFO is lower than for Ferriprox monotherapy (244 vs 1343 PY  (patient-years).  The  incidence  rate  of  events  (for  100  PY)  is  higher  in  the  arm  of  Ferriprox  in combination with DFO in 2 system organ class: cardiac disorders (1.64 vs 0.15), infections (1.64 vs 0.74), investigations (14.75 vs 14.60) and Ear disorders (0.82 vs 0.37). The main cardiac disorders reported are rhythm troubles (but we cannot totally exclude the fact that it could be related to iron overload  in  heart).  The  safety  database  was  also  reviewed  for  reports  of  serious  ADRs  from  postmarketing surveillance.  While this review did not allow for comparison of incidence, the nature of the reported reactions did not raise any safety concerns.  A list of post-marketing serious ADRs that were associated with deferiprone-DFO combination therapy is provided in Appendix D, and for deferiproneDFX combination therapy in Appendix E.

A search for studies that reported safety data on combination therapies between 1998 and June 2015 identified 57 publications that presented safety data on combination therapy:

49 publications on deferiprone-DFO (Appendix F) and 8 publications on deferiprone-DFX (Appendix G).

Based  on  the  indications  of  deferiprone,  the  combination  of  deferiprone  with  other  iron  chelator therapies (deferoxamine or deferasirox) is considered as an off-label use. Deferiprone-DFO combination therapy was not associated with new safety concerns in the provided studies. Thus, data are reassuring but should be taken with considerable caution as dose regimen were very heterogenous according  the  studies.  Only  dedicated  studies  could  provide  an  answer  on  the  relevance  of  this combination as long as on the efficacy and safety aspect.

In  addition,  no  clear  conclusion  could  be  drawn  from  association  deferiprone-  deferasirox  as  only isolated patients received such combination in published literature. In the SPC of Exjade, combination with  other  chelators  are  contra-indicated  as  the  safety  of  such  combination  were  not  clearly established.  Combination  with  other  iron  chelator  therapy  is  an  exclusion  criteria  in  clinical  trial development program of Exjade.

Whatever the iron chelators associated, we cannot totally exclude that this potential risk remains.

Furthermore, in post-marketing setting, in Eudravigilance database, there are 7 fatal (3 fatal agranulocytosis and 4 fatal cardiac complications)

a) one Swedish published case32 in a 10-years old patient with DBA (off-label use) : in this case, the girl developed agranulocytosis 9 weeks after chelation with deferiprone was initiated (45 mg/kg daily, 60% of recommended dose) in addition to her ordinary deferoxamine therapy. The blood count checked weekly dropped  markedly  between  week  8  and  9.  She  rapidly  developed  a  septicemia.  Despite  G-CSF  and corticoid therapy, she remained neutropenic and died 6 weeks after admission. According to the authors, DBA  patients  may  be  more  prone  than  thalassemia  patients  to  developing  deferiprone  associated agranulocytosis as DBA patients may develop bone marrow hypoplasia. However, it should kept in mind that  in  this  case  the  agranulocytosis    developed  rapidly  after  addition  of  deferiprone  to  her  ordinary deferoxamine therapy and agranulocytosis is not predictable and as well possibly not dose dependent.

b) One Swedish case (in Swedish in EV) was reported in a 12 years-old girl with beta-thalassemia : the patient  has  received  transfusions  since  early  age  and  had  a  failed  bone  marrow  transplantation.  She received deferiprone (1.5g) in addition of deferoxamine (unknown dose). After six months of treatment, during ferriprox dose escalation, neutrophils count drop &lt;0.1 G/l and platelets dropped to 70 (N : 140400)  within  one  week  despite  weekly  controls.    The  day  after  the  onset  of  fever,  CRP  was  250mg/L. Ferriprox was stopped and treatment with G-CSF was started. The patient developed a sepsis (E coli) and a sore throat with streptococcus B. She experienced several cardiac arrests. An increased sensitivity due

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to cardiac iron overload was also suspected and died.

c)  One  case  from  Iran  was  reported  in  a  22  years-old  beta-thalassemic  patient.  The  patient  began treatment with deferiprone (75mg/kg/day) due to iron overload in combination with deferoxamine (3g). Two months later, the patient had neutrophils count decreased and agranulocytosis was diagnosed with septic shock. The patient developed ARDS and died 10 days after event onset.

And 4 fatal cardiac complications (including one with DFP+DFX and 3 with DFP+DFO), probably due to disease progression (cardiac iron overload).

In  addition,  23  other  life-threatening  cases  were  retrieved  with  combined  DFP+DFO  in  eudravigilance database  (mainly  agranulocytosis  occurring  in  young  beta-thalassemic  patients  and  occurring  most frequently  within  the  1 st months  of  combined  therapy.  In  most  cases,  the  patient  recovered  without sequelae after drug interruption).

Recently,  a  French  serious  case  of  arthropathy/arthralgia  occurred  within  3  months  with  combination DFO+DFP  (doses  unknown)  in  a  6  years-old  thalassemic  patient.  Symptoms  improved  after  DFP discontinuation  but  remains  under  DFO  monotherapy.  This  case  (coded  as  leading  to  disability  or incapacity)  suggests  a  possible  addition  of  adverse  effects  of  each  iron  chelator  associated  which  is worrying.

However, as concludes the COCHRANE report (2013) 33  on the use of oral DFP for iron chelation in people with thalassaemia, a meta-analysis of a further two trials showed a significant increased risk of adverse events associated with combined DFP-DFO compared with DFO alone, RR 3.04 (95% CI 1.18 to 7.83) and there is no adequately-powered, high-quality trials comparing the overall clinical efficacy and long-term outcome of deferiprone with desferrioxamine, allowing to have a precise idea on how to manage in clinical practice the association of chelators in terms of posology and regimen to insure the safety for patients.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH provided in a first part of this procedure a review of the safety data collected by itself during later-stage clinical trials and in a second part safety results published in the literature.

DFP-DFO combination therapy was not associated with new safety concerns in the provided studies. Thus, data are reassuring but should be taken with considerable caution as dose regimen were very heterogenous according the studies. Only dedicated studies could provide an answer on the relevance of this combination as long as on the efficacy and safety aspect.

In  addition,  no  clear  conclusion  could  be  drawn  from  association  DFP-DFX  as  only  isolated  patients received such combination in published literature.

Whatever the iron chelators associated, we cannot totally exclude that this potential risk remains. 7 fatal cases caused by agranulocytosis or cardiac complications have been observed in Eudravigilance database.  Thus,  the  warning  'Fatalities  and  life-threatening  situations  (caused  by  agranulocytosis) have  been  reported  with  deferiprone  in  combination  with  deferoxamine'  has  been  included  in  the section 4.4 of the SmPC.

A list of ADRs from Apopharma database that compares the proportion of ADRs between deferiprone monotherapy and combination therapy was provided. Data from pooled safety database from clinical trials  (244  patients-year  exposed  for  Ferriprox  monotherapy  and  1343  patients-year  exposed  to Ferriprox  and  deferoxamine)  showed statistically  significant  (p&lt;0.05)  differences  in  the  incidence  of adverse  reactions  based  on  SOC  for  'Cardiac  disorders\",  \"Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue

44 Fisher SA, Brunskill SJ, Doree C, Gooding S, Chowdhury O, Roberts DJ. Desferrioxamine mesylate for managing transfusional iron overload in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013;8:CD004450.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

disorders' and \"Renal and urinary disorders\". The incidences of 'Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders' and \"Renal and urinary disorders\" were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy,  whereas  the  incidence  of  'Cardiac  disorders\"  was  higher  during  combination  therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of 'Cardiac disorders\" reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy.

In  consequence,  the  CHMP  proposes  to  modify  the  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  include precaution for use related to cardiac disorders (see section 2.9 of this procedure: Update of Product Information).

In  the  safety  profile  of  DFP-DFO  combination  provided  by  the  MAH,  only  18  children  have  been exposed to the combination. Thus, it is very difficult to draw any sound conclusion on these findings. However, the number of children treated with the combination and the incidence of adverse events have been documented in the section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Information on Combined use with other iron chelators has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC; The use of combination therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The response to therapy should be assessed periodically, and the occurrence of adverse events closely monitored. Fatalities and life-threatening situations (caused by agranulocytosis) have been reported with deferiprone in combination with deferoxamine. Combination therapy with deferoxamine is not recommended when monotherapy with either chelator is adequate or when serum ferritin falls below 500 µg/l. Limited data are available on the combined use of Ferriprox and deferasirox, and caution should be applied when considering the use of such combination.

The safety profile of combination therapy (deferiprone and deferoxamine) observed in clinical trials, post-marketing experience or published literature was consistent with that characterized for monotherapy.

Data from the pooled safety database from clinical trials (1343 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox monotherapy and 244 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox and deferoxamine) showed statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on System Organ Class for 'Cardiac disorders\", \"Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders' and \"Renal and urinary disorders\". The incidences of 'Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders' and \"Renal and urinary disorders\" were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy, whereas the incidence of 'Cardiac disorders\" was higher during combination therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of 'Cardiac disorders\" reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy. Careful monitoring of cardiac events in patients on combination therapy is warranted (see section 4.4).

The incidences of adverse reactions experienced by 18 children and 97 adults treated with combination therapy were not significantly different between the two age groups except in the incidence of arthropathy (11.1% in children vs. none in adults, p=0.02). Evaluation of rate of reactions per 100 patient-years of exposure showed that only the rate of diarrhoea was significantly higher in children (11.05) than in adults (2.01, p=0.01).

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on clinical safety

As safety data of the combination deferiprone and deferasirox are too preliminary, this combination is not recommended. Thus, the use of deferiprone with deferoxamine or deferasirox has been differentiated in the SmPC. Additional precautions for use have been added on the combination of deferiprone and deferasirox as limited data are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy was not associated with new safety concerns in the provided studies. Thus, data are reassuring but should be taken with considerable caution as dose regimen were very heterogenous according the studies.  In consequence, relevant warnings and precautions concerning cardiac disorders and agranulocytosis are included in the section 4.4 of the SmPC. All available information on the safety profile of the combination is included in section 4.8. of the SmPC.

- 1) Reported MedDRA Version 17.0 Preferred Terms include: all terms where the serious flag was \"Y\" at the event level. Terms coded to \"Pregnancy\" or \"Pregnancy of Partner\" are not considered ADRs.

2) Cases were tabulated based on whether DFO was listed as a medication (concomitant or suspect) for that case, note this might include cases with both DFO and DFX reported.

3) Investigator led studies for patients with non systemic iron overload have been excluded.

4) Registry cases received &lt; 26NOV2013 are treated as spontaneous in terms of assessment of causality. Data cut off: 31AUG2014

## 2.5. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The RMP remains unchanged.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

Following the review and assessment of the available data (see Clinical efficacy and Clinical Safety discussions above), the CHMP agrees to extend the Ferriprox indication as follows:

Ferriprox monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major when current chelation deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate.

Ferriprox in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive correction (see section 4.2).

Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC  were also updated to reflect the relevant information.

The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this procedure to update the Product Information in compliance with the QRD template version 9.1 and combine the SmPC for the 500mg and 1000mg tablets. The contact details of France and Portugal have been updated in the PL.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Iron overload is one of the major causes of morbidity in patients with thalassemia major. Main causes of mortality are sudden cardiac death, arrhythmia, and heart failure from cardiac iron overload. The majority of morbidity stems from liver cirrhosis from hepatic iron overload and endocrine dysfunction. The goal of iron chelation therapy is to reduce iron overload in the susceptible organs and to prevent end-organ damage (heart failure, liver cirrhosis, endocrinopathy), morbidities known to reduce survival in this population. Three chelators are available in the EU and their respective indications, while not specifying monotherapy, do not recommend combination use and do not describe when a combined treatment should be used, nor the practical modalities of such treatments. Efficacy and safety data of combinations are not mentioned in the available information for these products.

The conditions in which the combination chelation therapy is needed are acknowledged: a failure to control the iron burden at maximum dosage of current chelators and when current chelators cannot be adequately used, e.g. associated with dose-limiting toxicities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Comparative studies and some randomized clinical trials show that DFP-DFO combination is associated with relatively more rapid or pronounced serum ferritin decreases when compared with monotherapy. In  addition,  a  decrease  in  serum  ferritin  could  be  associated  with  a  decrease  in  iron  liver.  No pharmacological problems prevent this use and even a theoretical synergy may suggest that DFO/DFP is a right choice.

Randomized trials with alternating therapy or combination therapy compared to DFP alone concluded to  a  greater  efficacy  of  combination  to  decrease  serum  ferritin  level  (e.g.  Maggio  et  al.,  2009).  As supported by the Guidelines for the Management of Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia (TDT) 3rd Edition  (Cappellini  et  al.  2014),  these  studies  show  that  SF  can  be  controlled  with  a  relatively  low frequency of DFO given twice a week when combined with DFP standard doses (75 mg/kg/day). The fact that DFO-DFP combination therapy demonstrated its superiority over DFP and not over DFO may indicate  that  this  solution  may  rather  rescue  inefficient  DFP  monotherapy  or  provide  a  more acceptable option to patients not accepting frequent infusions anymore.

Randomized trial (Tanner et al., 2007) showed greater efficacy of the combination DFP-DFO compared to DFO alone in patients which received 5 days of DFO. Simultaneous combination therapy of DFO/DFP may  improve  a  marker  of  cardiac  overload  when  compared  to  DFO,  making  the  simultaneous combination superior to DFO when heart iron overload must receive control.

As a request of the CHMP on the last round, the MAH proposed a new wording with a starting and a limited dose of deferiprone in association with deferoxamine in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

Efficacy data of the DFP-DFX combination is very limited due to the small number of patients exposed and the lack of information about the safety of this combination (only 5 patients exposed in the MAH clinical trials). Thus, the use of deferiprone with deferoxamine or deferasirox has been differentiated in the  SmPC.  Additional  precautions  for  use  have  been  added  on  the  combination  of  deferiprone  and deferasirox as limited data are available.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The expected superior effect of combination over mono-components is established on iron overload markers  only,  but  not  on  hard  clinical  endpoints  such  as  frequency/severity  of  complications  or prolonged survival.  One report based on a 20-year survey in Cyprus concludes that the introduction of the combination resulted in an improvement of survival in patients with beta-thalassemia major, was discussed.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Deferiprone-DFO combination therapy was not associated with new safety concerns in  the  provided studies. Thus, data are reassuring but should be taken with considerable caution as dose regimen were very heterogeneous according the studies.

In  Eudravigilance  database,  7  fatal  cases  have  been  observed  when  deferiprone  was  used  in association.  3  caused  by  agranulocytosis  with  DFP+DFO  and  4  caused  by  cardiac  complications including one with DFP+DFX and 3 with DFP+DFO. Thus, whatever the iron chelators associated, we cannot totally exclude that this potential risk remains. There is a need for much attention to this risk when deferiprone is used in combination which must appear in The SmPC.

Combination is necessarily associated with the addition of side effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A list of ADRs from Apopharma database that compares the proportion of ADRs between deferiprone monotherapy and combination therapy was provided. Data from pooled safety database from clinical trials  (244  patients-year  exposed  for  Ferriprox  monotherapy  and  1343  patients-year  exposed  to Ferriprox  and  deferoxamine)  showed statistically  significant  (p&lt;0.05)  differences  in  the  incidence  of adverse  reactions  based  on  SOC  for  'Cardiac  disorders\",  \"Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue disorders' and \"Renal and urinary disorders\". The incidences of 'Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders' and \"Renal and urinary disorders\" were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy,  whereas  the  incidence  of  'Cardiac  disorders\"  was  higher  during  combination  therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of 'Cardiac disorders\" reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy.

In consequence, the Rapporteurs propose to modify the SmPC in order to include precaution for use related to cardiac disorders (see section 4.4).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

In  the  safety  profile  of  DFP-DFO  combination  provided  by  the  MAH,  only  18  children  have  been exposed to the combination. Thus, it is very difficult to draw any sound conclusion on these findings. However, the number of children treated with the combination and the incidence of adverse events have been documented in the SmPc (section 4.8).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

The Benefit /Risk Balance of the deferiprone-deferoxamine combination in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of lifethreatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive correction  - is considered positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Ferriprox in combination with another chelator.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this procedure to update the Product Information in compliance with the QRD template version 9.1 and combine the SmPC for the 500mg and 1000mg tablets. The contact details of France and Portugal have been updated in the PL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet.
