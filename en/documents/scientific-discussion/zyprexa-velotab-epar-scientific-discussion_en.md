## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Zyprexa Velotab. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 March 2004. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Schizophrenia  is  defined  as  a  major  psychotic  disorder  characterised  by  disturbances  in  form  and content of thought, mood, behaviour, sense of self and relationship to the external world. It affects a relatively  high  proportion  of  the  population  (approx.  1%)  and  causes  severe  impairment  of  social functioning in the individuals for a long period of time, in light of the fact that the disease starts in the early years of adult life.

The first attempt to specifically treat schizophrenic disorders was in 1952 with chlorpromazine and, later, with other medications, like haloperidol (a butyrophenone) which became the standard drug for this  disease.  This  treatment  is  moderately  effective  against  positive  symptoms  (e.g.  delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, hostility and suspiciousness), but its use is limited by the lack of efficacy against negative symptoms (e.g. flattened affect, emotional and social withdrawal and poverty of  speech),  the  adverse  reactions  (in  particular  extrapyramidal  effects),  and  the  high  frequency  of refractory  patients  (up  to  40  %).  In  the  1980's  'atypical  antipsychotics',  like  risperidone  and clozapine, showed some efficacy on negative symptoms and in refractory patients.

Olanzapine is an antipsychotic closely related to clozapine both in chemical structure (thienobenzodiazepine vs dibenzodiazepine) and pharmacological effects. Olanzapine 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10  mg  coated  tablets  have  been  registered  in  the  EU  since  27  September  1996  as  Zyprexa (EU/1/96/022/001-101) and Olansek (EU/1/96/021/001-010).

Zyprexa Velotab orodispersible tablet is a freeze-dried, rapid-dispersing preparation of olanzapine to be  placed  in  the  mouth  or  alternatively  to  be  dispersed  in  water  or  other  suitable  beverage  for administration. The drug substance used for the manufacture of the orodispersible tablet is the same as that  used  for  the  manufacture  of  coated  tablets  with  the  exception  of  difference  in  the  particle  size specification. Orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets. The product is presented in strengths of 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg. The 15 and 20 mg formulations also represent new  strengths.  According  to  the  applicant  the  rationale  for  the  development  of  Zyprexa  Velotab orodispersible tablet is as follows: 1) To enhance compliance in psychiatric patients who may have a tendency to 'hide' the tablet in the buccal cavity and then remove it when not under supervision and 2)  To  allow  easy  administration  in  patients  who  have  difficulties  in  swallowing.  The  currently approved indications for olanzapine-coated tablets are: 1) Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia  and  2)  Olanzapine  is  effective  in  maintaining  the  clinical  improvement  during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response.

The  proposed  dosage,  frequency  of  administration  and  therapeutic  indications  are  the  same  as  for olanzapine coated tablets. The usual starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg/day administered as a single daily dose. Daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the  range  of  5-20  mg  daily.  An  increase  to  a  dose  greater  than  the  routine  therapeutic  dose  of  10 mg/day is recommended only after appropriate clinical reassessment. A lower starting dose (5 mg/day) should  be  considered  for  elderly  patients  and  for  patients  with  renal  impairment.  In  patients  with moderate hepatic insufficiency, the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution.. As the orodispersible tablet cannot be divided, olanzapine coated tablets should be used in cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Zyprexa Velotab orodispersible tablet is a freeze-dried, rapid-dispersing preparation to be placed in the mouth or alternatively to be dispersed in water or other suitable beverage for administration. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

active substance used for the manufacture of the orodispersible tablet is the same, with the exception of  a  different  particle  size  specification,  as  that  used  for  the  manufacture  of  the  coated  tablet formulation  authorised  on  27  September  1996.  Bioequivalence  studies  have  been  performed  to compare the orodispersible tablet with the coated tablets (see under 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects). This formulation may thus be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets. Each orodispersible tablet contains 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg of olanzapine. Other ingredients include gelatin, aspartame, mannitol, and sodium methyland propyl parahydroxybenzoates.  The primary packaging is a cold-formed aluminium foil blister of seven tablets per blister strip. The pack size is 28 orodispersible tablets per carton.

The Zydis R technology produces a lyophilised, solid, oral dosage form, and was developed by Scherer DDS. The orodispersible tablet starts to disintegrate within a matter of seconds when placed on the tongue or in liquid vehicles and hence is readily swallowed.

## Active substance

Olanzapine  is  produced  by  organic  synthesis  in  four  phases:  formation  of  thieno  group,  arylation, reduction and ring closure and nucleophilic displacement. The chemical structure of olanzapine has been proven by means of X-ray crystallography, 1H , 13 C-NMR, MS, IR, UV, elemental analysis and potentiometric titrations. The specifications and analytical methods are the same as authorised earlier for Zyprexa.

Olanzapine used in the manufacture of the orodispersible tablet is further processed, to produce the particle size of the desired specification. The specification for olanzapine includes tests for identity, potency, related substances, water and particle size. The methods used to test olanzapine in both the orodispersable tablet and the coated tablet formulations are identical with the exception of the particle size and identity methods and have been adequately validated. Batch data provided for twelve lots of olanzapine confirms the consistency and uniformity of the batches produced.

Olanzapine is sensitive to moisture, but isotherwise chemically and physically stable in the solid state. The  proposed  packagingprovides  adequate  protection  from  both  moisture  and  light  exposure.  The available  stability  data  support  the  appropriateness  of  the  proposed  packages.  Stability  data  on olanzapine used in both the orodispersible tablet and coated tablet formulations support a 24-month retest period for the active substance used in orodispersible tablets.

## Other ingredients

The  orodispersible  tablets  contain  gelatin  and  mannitol  to  provide  strength  and  fast  dispersion properties,  aspartame  as  sweetener,  and  sodium  methyl  parahydroxybenzoate  and  sodium  propyl parahydroxybenzoate as preservatives. Each of the excipients employed in the formulation complies with European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) specifications.

One component, gelatin, is derived from bovine material. The applicant confirms that the gelatin used complies with the CPMP Guideline for sourcing and processing to reduce potential risk posed by BSE in products for human use.

## Product development and finished product

The orodispersible tablet formulation was developed as some patients have difficulty swallowing the coated tablet formulation and a subset of patients try to avoid taking medication by hiding it in the mouth  and  discarding  it  later.  During  the  formulation  development  process  several  issues  were identified including the particle size of olanzapine and the use of preservatives during processing. The particle size of the olanzapine is controlled to produce orodispersible tablets of acceptable uniformity and appearance. Development studies indicated the need for preservatives in the in process suspension and support the levels used.

The  manufacturing  process  used  is  typical  of  lyophilized  products.  The  manufacturing  process involves dispersion of the active substance into an aqueous solution of the excipients. This multi-step process involves numerous operations to ensure complete solution of the excipients, thorough wetting and  dispersion  of  the  active  substance,  and  deaeration  of  the  mix.  The  resulting  suspension  is dispensed  into  blister  cavities  formed  from  an  aluminium  foil  web  material.  After  dosing  the suspension is immediately frozen and lyophilized.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  finished  product  specifications  include  controls  for  appearance,  identity,  potency,  content uniformity, related substances, water content, disintegration and microbial testing. Batch analysis data on 18 commercial scale lots of olanzapine orodispersible tablets confirm the satisfactory uniformity of the product at release.

The finished product is packed in cold-formed aluminium foil blisters sealed with an aluminium foil lid. Acceptable data on packaging components, routine tests and scientific data have been provided.

On the basis of the stability results presented a shelf life of 24 months is accepted. As the stability results show that olanzapine orodispersible tablet is stable in the storage conditions studied, it can be considered that no temperature recommendation is needed on the labelling. The product is sensitive to moisture and the text \"Store in the original package\" is therefore necessary in the labelling.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The studies submitted as part of the application for Zyprexa were considered as a part of the Zyprexa Velotab orodispersible tablet application. Given this full toxicology data on olanzapine and the use of recognized excipients, no additional studies were carried out with the orodispersible tablet formulation. The data is summarised and discussed below.

## Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic properties of olanzapine were extensively studied and compared with those of two  antipsychotics;  haloperidol,  a  butyrophenone,  which  is  usually  defined  as  the  'reference' antipsychotic  drug,  and  clozapine,  a  dibenzodiazepine,  which  is  defined  in  the  expert  report  as  the closest antipsychotic to olanzapine.

## Effects relating to the proposed indications

The in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic effects of olanzapine as regards binding, effects on central neurotransmitters,  and  activity  on  behavioural  models  were  studied.  The  mean  binding  affinity constants (Ki nM) of olanzapine for rat neuronal receptors were 31 and 11, for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and 4 and 11 for serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, respectively. Binding affinities for adrenergic alpha1- and muscarinic M1-receptors were 19 and 1.9, respectively. The binding profile in human  brain  homogenates  was  roughly  similar  to  that  found  in  the  rat  brain.  The  increase  of  the concentrations  of  dopamine  metabolites  in  the  corpus  striatum  and  nucleus  accumbens  of  the  rat, suggests that olanzapine blocks the post-synaptic dopamine receptors, as has been observed with other antipsychotic agents.

Olanzapine  has  been  extensively  studied  in  behavioural  models  for  neuroleptics:  apomorphineinduced climbing behaviour, apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour in rats with unilateral brain lesion, conditioned avoidance response, amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, dopamine-induced locomotor activity and stereotyped behaviour. Most experiments were performed in rats with orally administered olanzapine at doses of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg.

## General pharmacodynamics

After high oral doses of &gt;10 mg/kg, olanzapine produced a global CNS depressant effect in rats: i.e. a decrease  in  activity,  sedation,  catalepsy,  ptosis,  muscle  incoordination,  hypothermia  and  mydriasis. After lower doses of 0.3 mg/kg, only minimal amount of symptoms were observed.

Olanzapine  produced  no  changes  in  the  threshold  of  pentylene-tetrazol-induced  convulsions,  but lowered the convulsive threshold of electroshock-induced convulsions.

After doses of 5 mg/kg, olanzapine increased slow wave sleep and temporarily abolished REM sleep in cats and resulted in a REM sleep rebound.

Olanzapine had no effect on memory acquisition and little effect on memory retention in mice after doses of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg.

Hypotension was described in anaesthetised rats and cats after iv doses of 0.1 mg/kg. No effects on blood pressure or heart rate were seen in conscious rats after oral administration of olanzapine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Olanzapine showed spasmolytic activity in guinea pig ileum in vitro and reduced gut motility in mice after doses of 10 mg/kg. Slight reduction in feeding and drinking behaviour was described in rats after the highest i.p. dose of 2.5 mg/kg.

Doses of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg of olanzapine increased levels of prolactin in rats. Although no comparative studies are available, this is a well-known effect of antipsychotic drugs.

In behavioural studies, olanzapine exhibited preferential 5HT2  receptor antagonist properties compared to dopamine receptor antagonism, distinguishing it from standard antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol. Olanzapine was also observed to have properties similar to those of the atypical agent clozapine,  e.g.  increases  in  punished  responding  and  substitution  in  a  drug  discrimination  assay.  In general, pharmacodynamic studies showed acceptable safety pharmacology.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in rats, mice, dogs, and monkeys. The results are consistent with satisfactory absorption (bioavailability approximately 80 %), distribution (protein binding rate 81 to 91 %) and extensive metabolism after oral dosing.

Great inter species variation was observed in eg. half-lives, Cmax, metabolites and elimination route. Therefore any direct extrapolation to human kinetics cannot be performed.

Degradation  products  have  been  specifically  tested  but  they  did  not  exhibit  any  pharmacological effects.  The  measured  synthetic  impurities  were  well  below  the  recommended  levels  and  failed  to show any pharmacological effect in dogs or rats.

Toxicokinetic studies in rats (1 to 16 mg/kg) and dogs (2 to 10 mg/kg) were conducted as part of the chronic  toxicity  studies.  The  level  for  exposure  could  be  estimated  from  pharmacokinetic  data  and results of the comparison between AUC and administered dose.

Olanzapine interactions have been studied mostly in human beings (see section 4).

## Toxicology

The therapeutic dose of olanzapine used in humans is approximately 0.33 mg/kg.

## Single dose toxicity studies.

Acute toxicity tests were conducted in mice, rats, Beagle dogs and Rhesus monkeys. Signs of CNS toxicity,  hypoactivity,  coma,  leg  weakness,  tremor,  convulsions  and  ptosis  were  described  in  both mice and rats. In dogs and monkeys there were no deaths after single oral doses of 25 to 100mg/kg. CNS  depression  (3-5  days),  ataxia,  hypoactivity,  tremor,  sedation,  lethargy,  increased  heart  rate, laboured  respiration  and  miosis  were  seen  in  dogs.  In  Rhesus  monkeys,  at  all  doses,  sedation  and prostration accompanied by anorexia were described. At 50 mg/kg loss of response to noise or touch was seen. At the highest dose, signs of toxicity persisted up to the fourth day following dosing.

## Repeated dose toxicity studies

Studies  up  to  one  year  in  duration  were  conducted  in  rats  and  dogs  (daily  oral  administration). Peripheral  blood  was  a  target  organ  of  olanzapine.  Leukocytes  (lymphocytes  and  neutrophils)  were decreased  in  rats  given  doses  of ≥ 16  mg/kg  and  mice  given  doses  of ≥ 3  mg/kg.  Neutrophils, thrombocytes,  or  erythrocytes  were  decreased  in  individual  dogs  given  doses  of ≥ 8  mg/kg.  These changes  were  reversible.  The  positive  Coomb's  test  in  a  dog  with  anaemia  and  the  lack  of  bone marrow involvement suggest that the cytopenias could be of immune origin, but a specific mechanism has not been defined.

## Mutagenic potential.

There was no evidence of mutagenic activity in the standard battery of mutagenicity tests performed.

## Carcinogenic potential.

Mammary tumours  including  adenomas,  fibroadenomas  as  well  as  adenocarcinomas,  were  seen  in females of both Fischer rats after doses of ≥ 2.5 mg/kg and in CD1 mice after doses of 8 to 30 mg/kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mammary tumours are not an unexpected finding in rodents treated with prolactin secretion inducing compounds.

## Reproduction studies

Olanzapine exhibited no relevant toxicity in the reproduction studies conducted.

## Special studies

Immunotoxicity  studies  were  carried  out  in  mice  at  doses  of  3  to  45  mg/kg.  Lymphopenia  and neutropenia were seen at high doses. Overall immune function was relatively unaltered although an increase in B lymphocyte count and decrease in NK activity in the spleen was shown.

No dependency potential, as shown by evaluation of self-administration and physical dependence on olanzapine  was  found  in  rats  and  monkeys  at  doses  of  0.05  to  32  mg/kg  and  0.06  to  8  mg/kg respectively.

Repeated  dose  toxicity  with  degradation  impurities  were  conducted  with  the  3  main  degradation products  (amide,  ketolactam,  ketothiolactam)  with  doses  of  about  100  times  the  expected  human exposure.  No  toxicity  was  shown.  Similarly,  no  mutagenic  properties  of  olanzapine  metabolites  or impurities were detected in the Ames test.

The  primary  toxicology  marker  was  the  effect  on  peripheral  blood  cells.  This  therefore  required careful evaluation in the clinical studies to determine its relevance to the human safety profile.

## 4. Clinical aspects

Olanzapine  coated  tablets  were  authorised  in  the  EU  in  September  1996  as  Zyprexa  and  Olansek. These approvals were based on extensive clinical safety and efficacy studies with both capsule and coated  tablet  formulations,  which  have  been  shown  to  be  bioequivalent.  Olanzapine  orodispersible tablet  is  a  new  pharmaceutical  form  of  the  active  substance  designed  to  disperse  immediately  on contact with saliva in the buccal cavity. The clinical studies submitted as part of the application for Zyprexa  were  considered  as  a  part  of  the  Zyprexa  Velotab  application.  In  addition  three  new bioequivalence  studies  and  one  new  open  label  use  study  were  submitted.  These  studies  are summarised and discussed below.

## Clinical pharmacology

Data on 200 subjects enrolled in 24 clinical pharmacology studies were submitted. These data defined the  important  attributes  of  olanzapine  pharmacokinetics,  although  some  individual  studies  had methodological  drawbacks  (i.e.  poor  sensitivity,  limit  of  quantification,  pharmacokinetic  terms  not corrected  for  fraction  of  drug  absorbed)  and  only  a  small  number  of  subjects.  Several  metabolic pathways,  including  glucuronidation  and  CYP450  oxidative  metabolism  were  defined.  Excretion  in urine as unchanged olanzapine is a very minor elimination pathway. Oral bioavailability is high and consistent  across  individuals.  The  pharmacokinetics  are  linear  and  dose  proportional,  approaching steady state within one week of daily oral administration.

No relationship  between  olanzapine  plasma  concentrations  and  clinical  efficacy  variables  has  been observed.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Dopamine receptor occupancy

After single oral administration in healthy volunteers the 5-HT2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine in the  neocortex  was  74-92%.  The  D2  receptor  occupancy  in  the  putamen  ranged  from  59%  to  63%. There were no changes in pulse rate or blood pressure; the subjects were very sedated during six hours following the administration.

## Cognition and psychomotor performance

A comparative study vs. Haloperidol was carried out in 16 elderly healthy subjects, who were given either  olanzapine  3  mg/day  or  Haloperidol  3  mg/day.  Effects  on  both  cognitive  and  psychomotor performance were observed with both drugs. These effects tended to be more pronounced in females

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  correlated  positively  with  age.  Somnolence,  dizziness  and  anticholinergic  effects  such  as  dry mouth and miosis were observed.

## Pharmacokinetics

Traditional  pharmacokinetics  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  were  carried  out  as  well  as  extensive population pharmacokinetic studies in the treated patients. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed using the  standard  non-compartmental  method  of  analysis.  The  results  of  both  types  of  studies  are  in accordance and demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine is not altered in a time dependent fashion.

Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects showed that a single dose was consistent and predictive of the  pharmacokinetics  after  multiple  dose  administration  for  up  to  two  weeks  duration.  The  median half-life of olanzapine was 31 hours, suggesting that steady state would be achieved within 7 to 12 days. There were no substantial differences in plasma concentrations after the 7th or 14th daily dose. The linear dose proportionality was demonstrated adequately over the proposed dose range.

## Absorption

Two studies were performed using 14C olanzapine in healthy volunteers. Dry mouth, dizziness, taste perversion, asthenia,  nausea,  arrhythmia, elevated heart rate, orthostatic  hypotension, transient ALT elevation  (in  all  subjects),  were  recorded  as  possibly  or  probably  related  events  occurring  after  the administration of olanzapine. The average Cmax for a single 12 to 12.5 mg dose was 10.5  +/-1.0  ng/ml  (HPLC).  At  Tmax  (4.9  hours)  olanzapine  accounted  for  28%  of  radioactivity, indicating substantial first pass metabolism. Radioactivity in plasma exceeded that in blood indicating no  extensive  distribution  into  red  blood  cells.  The  mean  plasma  half  time  for  olanzapine  was 25.5 ± 1.6 hours and 58.7 ± 7.1 hours for total radioactivity (olanzapine + metabolites).

Following repeated once daily 10mg dose, steady state levels were reached within 7 days with up to a 3-fold accumulation (Cmax and AUC).

## Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution was 21.9 ± 3.2 l/kg. The plasmaprotein binding was about 93% over the therapeutic concentration range. Olanzapine is bound to albumin and alfa-1-glycoprotein.

## Metabolism

Metabolism of olanzapine has been investigated in vitro, in human liver slices, and extensive studies have  been  carried  out  to  investigate  the  interaction  of  olanzapine  with  human  cytochromes. Olanzapine is extensively metabolised and probably undergoes first pass metabolism in humans.

The  most  important  metabolic  pathways  for  olanzapine  are  via  glucuronidation  and  P450  CYP1A2 (N-desmethyl  and  7-hydroxy  metabolites).  The  CYP2D6  (2-hydroxymethyl  metabolite)  and  flavincontaining  monooxygenase  (FMO3)  (N-oxide)  pathways  are  minor  with  regard  to  circulating metabolites  in  humans.  Theophylline,  caffeine,  imipramine,  fluoroquinolones  and  fluvoxamine  are also  metabolised  by  these  isoenzymes.  No  metabolites  derived  via  CYP3A  have  been  identified  in humans.

## Elimination

In healthy subjects the median T1/2 was 31 hours, ranging from 14.5 to 79.5 hours. The variability is large  (4-5  fold)  and  within  subject  variability  is  smaller  than  between  subject  variability.  Urinary clearance is the major route of excretion for the metabolites of olanzapine, as most of the parent drug undergoes metabolism in the liver. Urinary excretion of unchanged olanzapine is a minor elimination pathway. However unchanged olanzapine and N-10 glucuronide conjugate have been found in human faeces, representing 2% and 8% of an oral dose respectively.

## Population pharmacokinetics

An  extensive  population  pharmacokinetic  study  was  submitted.  This  analysis  was  carried  out  in subjects enrolled in two classic pharmacokinetic studies (34 subjects given single doses from 2.5 to 15 mg) and in four major clinical studies (1711 patients analysed according to the Non-linear Mixed Effect Modelling Method - NONMEM).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the analysis of the healthy volunteer studies, smoking significantly affected olanzapine pharmacokinetics: non-smokers had 50%  lower  olanzapine clearance and about 50%  longer elimination half-life (smoking induced CYP1A2 activity). Clearance in women was 30% lower than in men. Clearance decreased by 35% with increase in age from 20 to 79 years.

According  to  the  analysis  of  the  combined  data  from  the  four  main  clinical  studies,  clearance  in women was 21% lower than in men and clearance decreased by approximately 25% with increase in age from 18 to 86 years.

Interactions: pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic interactions

Imipramine: No  interaction  leading  to  adverse  events  was  observed:  somnolence  and  postural hypotension  were  observed with  both  medicines.  Following  co-administration  with  imipramine,  the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine demonstrated a statistically significant increase in Cmax (14%) and a noticeable, but not significant increase in AUC (19%). No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of imipramine.

Ethanol: An open-label, three arm, cross-over single and multiple dose olanzapine ethanol interaction trial was conducted in 15 non-alcoholic male subjects. Somnolence was reported most often with the combination of the two substances (81.8%) as compared with olanzapine alone (23.1%) and ethanol alone  (14.3%).  Dizziness,  amblyopia,  hypotension,  nausea,  pallor,  paresthesia,  speech  disorder  and asthenia  were  associated  with  the  combination.  Increased  ALT  activities,  possibly  associated  with olanzapine  were  observed  in  two  subjects.  A  slight  prolongation  of  QTc  interval  (mean  increase: 10.7  msec:  p=0.059)  was  seen  during  olanzapine  treatment.  Five  symptomatic  postural  hypotensive episodes occurred with the combination.

Carbamazepine: Cmax,  AUC  and  elimination  half  life  of  olanzapine  were  clearly  reduced  during carbamazepine administration demonstrating a metabolic interaction probably related to an interaction at  CYP1A2,  as  in  humans  no  CYP3A  metabolites  have  been  seen  with  olanzapine.  One  patient developed  grand  mal  seizures  (no  previous  history  of  epilepsy).  The  most  commonly  observed undesirable effects were drowsiness and increase in hepatic enzymes (gamma-GT, ALT, AST).

Lithium: Interaction with lithium has been studied after single and repeated administration. AUC of lithium was slightly but statistically significantly elevated (about 7%) during olanzapine dosing. Renal clearance of lithium was reduced (10%) and the elimination half life increased. Such small changes are  likely  to  have  no  clinical  relevance.  Post  treatment  ALT  and  AST  values  were  elevated  and attributed to olanzapine dosing.

Warfarin: Average  olanzapine  Cmax  values  were  reduced  (-11%)  when  given  with  warfarin. Olanzapine had no evident effects on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. In asingle blind, three-arm, randomised  cross-over  study  in  19  healthy  male  subjects,  postural  hypotension  and  ALT  elevation were observed.

Cimetidine, antacids, charcoal: Activated  charcoal  decreased  the  bioavailability,  Cmax  and  AUC  of olanzapine.  No  changes  were  observed  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  olanzapine  after administration of cimetidine or antacid.

Fluoxetine (60  mg  single  dose  or  60  mg  daily  for  8  days)  causes  a  mean  16%  increase  in  the maximum  concentration  of  olanzapine  and  a  mean  16%  decrease  in  olanzapine  clearance.  The magnitude  of  the  impact  of  this  factor  is  small  in  comparison  to  the  overall  variability  between individuals and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended.

Valproate: in  a  study  to  determine  pharmacokinetic and dynamic drug interaction, using single and multiple  doses  of  olanzapine  and  assessing  their  effect  on  steady-state  valproic  acid  concentrations studied  the  PK  interaction  with  valproate.  Upon  multiple  dose  administration,  concentrations  of olanzapine had accumulated approximately two or three-fold higher than the single dose concentrations. These data, based upon single dose steady-state concentrations obtained from patients on stable therapeutic doses of valproate, are typical of the results from other olanzapine pharmacokinetic studies suggesting that valproate has no substantive impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The adverse events on olanzapine were generally those observed in prior studies and included asthenia, somnolence, dry mouth, and headache.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

Elderly: Olanzapine half-life, MRT and Tmax were increased in elderly compared to young subjects. Moreover, additional analyses revealed an interaction between gender and age: dose-normalised AUC values  were  63%  higher  and  plasma  clearance  lower  (38%)  in  elderly  females  compared  to  young females,  but  no  differences  were  observed  between  males  of  different  ages.  Somnolence  and orthostatic hypotension were the most frequent adverse events.

Patients with renal impairment: At the time of submission of olanzapine coated tablets, only limited studies  were  conducted  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (16  patients)  and  cirrhosis  (6  patients). Preliminary  reports  may  have  suggested  the  possibility  for  an  increase  in  blood  concentration  of olanzapine  in  these  situations.  Definitive  conclusions  regarding  the  effect  of  renal  or  hepatic impairment on olanzapine pharmacokinetics could not be drawn. Thus, no specific dosage recommendations could be given at the time, but it was stated that a lower starting dose should be considered. Additional information was provided in the agreed timeframe post-authorisation.

## Post-authorisation clinical data in cirrhotic patients

The  MAH  submitted  a  report  of  a  pharmacokinetic  study  in  normal  and  cirrhotic  subjects  (study HGAU). This study enrolled 4 normal and 8 cirrhotic subjects (Child-Pugh Class A or B). Single oral doses of 2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg of olanzapine were given. Olanzapine Cmax and AUC increased linearly with  dose  in  both  normal  and  cirrhotic  subjects  with  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  mean pharmacokinetic variables. However T1/2 tended to be longer for cirrhotic subjects (range 23.4-86.1 h for hepatically impaired, 38.1-62.6 h for normal  subjects). It was  considered  that the dose recommendations for subjects with hepatic impairment should be more conservative in spite of the limited pharmacokinetic data that does not show any meaningful differences in single dose kinetics. It was also considered that the dosage recommendation should more clearly define the degree of hepatic impairment  as  the  data  was  limited  to  cirrhotic  patients  with  Child-Pugh  Class  A  or  B.  This information is reflected in  the  SPC  for  orodispersible  tablets.  In  addition  a  reference  to  the  lack  of substantial removal of olanzapine by hemodialysis is included in the section on Overdose in the SPC.

## Bioequivalence studies

Olanzapine  capsules  were  used  in  the  clinical  studies,  whereas  coated  tablet  formulations  are  now marketed. The following formulations were found to be bioequivalent in the marketing authorisation application for Zyprexa coated tablets: 2.5 mg and 5 mg coated tablets, 1 mg and 5 mg coated tablets and capsules, 5 mg tablets and 10 mg coated tablets and capsules, and 15 mg capsules and 5 and 7.5 mg coated tablets.

Three  additional  bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  with  the  orodispersible  tablet  formulation. The studies have been carried out according to GCP.

In the first study (F1D-EW-LOAJ), the bioequivalence of olanzapine orodispersible tablets 5 mg and olanzapine coated tablets (5 mg) was assessed in an open-label crossover study following single doses of each formulation separated by 13 days. Healthy male (n=11) and female (n=9) subjects of whom 11 were smokers were enrolled. Coated tablets were swallowed with water. No water was given to the subjects when they received the orodispersible tablets, which were allowed to dissolve on the tongue. Olanzapine  was  determined  in  heparinised  plasma  and  the  concentration  data  were  analysed  by standard noncompartmental pharmacokinetic methods.

Disappearance times of the orodispersible tablet from the tongue were less than 2 min apart from 2 subjects  (max.  4.5  min).  There  were  no  apparent  differences  in  the  incidence  of  adverse  events reported  following  the  use  of  coated  tablets  or  the  orodispersible  tablets.  The  coated  tablet  and orodispersible  tablet  formulations  were  shown  to  be  bioequivalent  with  regard  to  C max ,  AUC0-t  and AUC0-inf.. However, a difference was observed in the onset of absorption, which occurred earlier in the orodispersible  tablet  group.  Nevertheless,  mean  plasma  concentration  vs.  time  profiles  for  the  two formulations  were  similar  during  the  first  hour.  The  initial  difference  is  probably  of  no  clinical consequence.  Tmax  was  similar  (4.99  hr  for  coated  tablet  and  5.14  hr  for  orodispersible  tablet formulations). A statistically significant difference in Clp and T½ was observed between smokers and non-smokers. This finding is consistent with results from previous studies and may be explained by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CYP1A2 enzyme induction in smokers. This pharmacokinetic difference is appropriately addressed in the SPC.

The  second  bioequivalence  study  (F1D-EW-LOAL)  was  an  open-label  crossover  study,  which followed a protocol similar to that described in the previous section. Single doses of 20 mg (four 5 mg tablets) of olanzapine-coated tablets were compared to 20 mg (one tablet) of olanzapine orodispersible tablets. Twenty-two healthy male subjects of whom 13 were smokers were enrolled.

On the first occasion, the disappearance time of the orodispersible tablet from the tongue exceeded 2 min in 3 subjects (max 12 min) and on the second occasion in 7 subjects (max. 9 min 10 sec). There were  no  apparent  differences  in  the  adverse  events  reported  between  the  two  formulations.  No clinically significant changes were seen in the ECG recordings. At 4 hours post dose, on each of the two  dosing  occasions,  several  of  the  subjects  had  lowered  supine  blood  pressure.  BP  returned  to normal at 36 hr post dose. The coated tablet and orodispersible tablet formulations were shown to be bioequivalent according to Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf.. A slight difference in the onset of absorption was observed, as described in the previous section. Although highly variable for both formulations, the absorption rate constants were similar which may be taken to indicate a lag time in absorption rather than a different rate or site of absorption of the two formulations.

In the third open-label crossover study  (F1D-EW-LOAU),  the  bioequivalence  of  olanzapine orodispersible tablets containing olanzapine manufactured in different ways (5 mg and 10 mg tablets) was investigated. The aim of the study was to determine whether the processing of olanzapine affects the  bioavailability.  Twenty-three  healthy  male  subjects  of  whom  12  were  smokers  were  enrolled. Single doses of 10 mg were administered on three occasions 13 days apart. Otherwise the protocol followed the same principles outlined in the two previous bioequivalence studies.

Due to the small number of subjects, no definitive conclusions can be drawn on possible differences in the frequency of adverse effects between the formulations. According to the study report, no clinically significant changes were seen in the ECG readings. Vital sign measurements were not significantly altered from baseline values. However, at 4 hours post dose on each of the three dosing occasions, lowered supine blood pressure was observed. There were 30 reports of sleepiness or drowsiness and 23 reports of feeling dizzy or faint. The two olanzapine orodispersible tablet formulations were found to be bioequivalent compared to the coated tablet according to Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf..

## Clinical efficacy

Clinical experience with olanzapine in the target population i.e. patients suffering from schizophrenia or  other  psychoses  is  based  on  5  studies.  Of  these  4  may  be  considered  major  (well  controlled, multicentre,  adequate  number  of  patients  and  well  diagnosed)  enrolling  more  than  3000  patients worldwide. The main studies have incorporated a short placebo run-in period (4-9 days). The acute double blind phases were of 6 weeks duration, which is standard for the acute phase of antipsychotic studies. The acute phases have been followed by an open (study HGAP) or a double blind extension (studies  E003,  HGAD,  HGAJ)  phase  of  up  to  one  year  or  more,  without  re-randomisation. Discontinuation  rates  during  the  acute  phase  were  very  high,  up  to  77%  at  the  lowest  investigated olanzapine dose (1 mg) and placebo.

Efficacy has been assessed using various rating scales:

- BPRS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (primary efficacy measure except for study HGAO). The BPRS positive score includes conceptual disorganisation, hallucinatory behaviour, suspiciousness and unusual thought content. The BPRS negative score includes blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, motor retardation.
- PANSS, Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale
- CGI, Clinical Global Impression. CGI-S, Severity of Illness. CGI-I, Improvement of Illness.
- SANS, Scale for Assessment on Negative Symptoms (used only in study HGAD)
- MADRS, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (used only in study HGAJ)
- ACES, Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale
- QLS, Quality of Life Scale.
- OAS, Overt Aggression Scale.

For  the  studies  with  double-blind  extensions  relapse  during  the  one-year  period  was  the  end-point considered.  The  rating  scales  selection  is  clinically  relevant  because  it  takes  into  account  overall

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

psychiatric  state,  positive  and  negative  symptoms,  clinical  global  impression,  depression  status  and quality of life.

All  the  patients  enrolled  in  the  four  main  studies  were  diagnosed  according  to  the  criteria  of DSM-III-R  (Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Revised  APA  1987)  for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. It is important to consider that no general consensus is at present achieved on the definition of 'responders' in clinical studies of schizophrenic patients. In the published literature a reduction of 25% to 30% of BPRS score is required. All analyses were done on an intent-to-treat  basis.  In  the  analysis  of  LOCF  (last-observation-carried-forward),  change  from baseline to endpoint, patients were included in the evaluation only if they had both a baseline and a post baseline assessment. Treatment groups were compared with regard to mean change from baseline to endpoint in the efficacy rating scale scores using analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Kaplan-Meier  estimated  survival  curves  described  the  time  to  relapse  from  the  beginning  of  the double-blind extension phase: the curves were compared (log-rank test) between treatment groups for maintenance of response (lack of hospitalisation because of exacerbation of psychotic psychopathology).

The aims of the four main studies were to assess the safety and efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of  patients  with  schizophrenia,  both  in  acute  and  chronic  phases  of  treatment  and  to  evaluate  the incidence and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition the studies HGAP, HGAD and E003 were  carried  out  to  determine  any  possible  relationship  between  dose,  plasma  concentration  of olanzapine and therapeutic effect. In all three studies the lowest effective dosage range of olanzapine was explored.

## Study FID-MC-HGAP study

Study  FID-MC-HGAP  was  designed  as  a  three  arm,  randomised,  parallel,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled multicentre study. 152 schizophrenic patients were administered doses of olanzapine 1 and 10  mg  and  placebo.  An  indefinite  open  label  extension  of  this  study,  including  124  patients  and 5-10-15-20  mg/day  doses  was  conducted  but  data  were  not  available  for  review  at  the  time  of submission of the marketing authorisation application for the coated tablets.

98% of the patients had a chronic course and 65% were experiencing an acute exacerbation. 38% of the patients treated with the 10-mg dose completed the six-week treatment as compared with 20% of placebo patients and 23% receiving 1 mg of olanzapine. Patients with a decrease of at least 40% in BPRS total scores or an endpoint score of 18 or less were classified as responders. Response rates were 9.5% in placebo group, 11.9% in olanzapine 1-mg group and 27.9% in olanzapine 10-mg group. Mean change from baseline to endpoint in BPRS total scores within group was significant only for the dose of 10 mg (approx. -20.7%) and was significantly greater than placebo.

With the PANSS positive score olanzapine 10  mg versus placebo showed significant  mean change (-16%) and also with PANSS negative score (-11%). The PANSS general psychopathology score was significantly improved only in the 10-mg olanzapine arm. Improvement was seen in the responders on average after two weeks. Olanzapine at the dose of 10 mg/day appears to be effective in the treatment of positive, negative and overall psychopathology when compared to placebo.

Patients  treated  with  10  mg  olanzapine  showed  a  slight  mean  increase  of  alkaline  phosphatase  and gamma-glutamyl-transferase activities compared with placebo. Mean increases in AST and ALT were transient.  The  patients  in  the  10  mg  olanzapine  group  gained  significantly  more  weight  than  the placebo group and also the proportion of patients in the 10 mg olanzapine group with elevated serum concentrations of prolactin was significantly higher than placebo.

## Study FID-EW-E003

Study  FID-EW-E003  was  a  fixed  dose  range,  multicentre,  randomised,  double  blind  study  of olanzapine  vs  haloperidol  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia.  57%  of  patients  were  of  the  paranoid subtype  and  74%  had  a  chronic  course.  The  initial  number  of  patients  was  431  diagnosed  with schizophrenia with acute exacerbation and the range of doses varied between 1-17.5 mg for olanzapine and 10-15-20 mg for Haloperidol. It was carried out over six weeks with an indefinite extension:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  all  groups  in  both  primary  and  secondary  analyses.  Significant differences were only seen between the 1 and 15 mg olanzapine groups, thus no lowest effective dose range was established. With regard to efficacy results in the relapse rate at 1 year, the only statistically significant  pairwise  differences  were  between  olanzapine  low  dose  (2.5-7.5  mg)  versus  1  mg olanzapine.

## Study FID-MC-HGAD

Study  FID-MC-HGAD  was  a  fixed  dose  range,  multicentre,  randomised,  double  -blind  study  for comparison of haloperidol, olanzapine and placebo and initially included 335 patients with diagnosis of  schizophrenia  with  acute  exacerbation.  The  duration  of  the  initial  double  blind  period  was  six weeks  and  doses  varied  from  between  2  to  17.5  mg  for  olanzapine  and  from  10  to  20  mg  for haloperidol.

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  (BPRS  score)  showed  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the 10 and 15 mg olanzapine groups and also the secondary analysis (CGI score) compared with placebo. The  acute  phase  results  indicated  that  after  doses  of  2.5-17.5  mg/day,  olanzapine  is  an  effective antipsychotic  agent  with  respect  to  overall  and  positive  score  psychopathology.  In  the  dose  range between 12.5-17.5 mg/day, olanzapine was more effective than either placebo or haloperidol (10-20 mg/day) against negative psychotic symptoms. The analysis of the relapse rates indicated that patients, who showed an acceptable reduction in the initial symptoms during acute therapy and continued on long-term  olanzapine  therapy  15.0 -2.5  mg/day  (less  than  1/3  of  the  initial  population)  showed statistically significantly fewer relapses than those who continued on placebo after the six week acute treatment.

An  increase  of  AST/ALT  levels  was  seen  in  the  olanzapine  treated  groups.  A  lower  tendency  to extrapyramidal effects and weight gain were also shown

## Study FID-MC-HGAJ

Study FID-MC-HGAJ was a double blind, randomised two-arm study which included 1996 patients comparing haloperidol (5-10-15-20 mg) and olanzapine (5-20 mg), in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders and schizoaffective disorders.

Significantly more olanzapine patients than haloperidol patients completed the six-week phase (66% vs 47%). Fewer patients with olanzapine discontinued the study for lack of efficacy (21% vs 32%) or for  adverse  events  occurrence  (4.5%  vs  7.3%)  in  the  acute  phase.  There  were  significantly  more responders with olanzapine 51.6% than with haloperidol 34.2%. In the acute phase, six week treatment after  wash-out,  olanzapine  showed  a  significantly  greater  mean  improvement  in  BPRS  total  score compared with the haloperidol treatment (p=0.015). Evaluation of PANSS  negative score demonstrated superior improvement in the olanzapine treatment group than in the haloperidol group (p=0.032).  The  same  holds  true  for  the  BPRS  negative  scores  (p=0.002).  Olanzapine  showed numerically superior improvement in PANSS  positive score and significantly greater mean improvement  in  CGI  severity  (p=0.029)  compared  with  haloperidol.  Olanzapine  also  showed significantly  greater  improvement  compared  with  haloperidol  (p=0.001)  indicating  an  effect  on associated  depressive  symptoms.  Further,  olanzapine  treated  patients  showed  significantly  greater improvement in the Quality of Life Scale compared with haloperidol (p&lt;0.05). The use of alcohol was higher in the olanzapine group as well as that of anticholinergics in the haloperidol group.

However, as the haloperidol doses were possibly too high (mean modal maintenance dose 11.8 mg) and could potentially induce depression mimicking negative symptoms it is difficult to conclude that olanzapine is undoubtedly more efficacious on negative scores than haloperidol. Moreover the patient population enrolled was of the mixed type, and therefore it is difficult to affirm that olanzapine has a specific effect on negative symptoms and thus independent from its effect on positive symptoms. The relapse analysis indicates that olanzapine provides greater long-term efficacy than haloperidol therapy.

## FID-MC-HGAO

The objective of study FID-MC-HGAO was to study the short-term safety profile of olanzapine in a geriatric population and to evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of psychotic symptoms of  patients  with  primary  degenerative  dementia  of  the  Alzheimer  type  (diagnosed  according  to  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DSM-III-R  criteria).  The  study  randomised  238  patients  (&gt;  65  years  old)  during  8  weeks  and  was double blind and placebo controlled. The doses used varied between 1 and 8 mg /day. There were no statistically  significant  changes  for  the  olanzapine  treated  group  for  the  specific  indexes  used (BEHAVE-AD, BPRS, CGI-S/I and MMSE).

## Supportive studies

An  open-label  use  study  of  olanzapine  orodispersible  tablets  was  carried  out  in  patients  with schizophrenia  and  related  psychotic  disorders.  The  study  was  carried  out  according  to  GCP.  The primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  practical  use  of  the  new  formulation  in  patients  stabilised  on coated olanzapine tablets (5, 10, 15 or 20 mg/day) over a seven-day period. The secondary objective was to assess patient comfort based on a patient spontaneous adverse event self-report and acceptance questionnaire.  Eleven  outpatients  (5  female,  6  male,  age  19-50  yr.)  were  enrolled.  They  were transferred to the same dose of olanzapine orodispersible tablets for another 7 days (1-4 tablets per day). Efficacy was not measured.

The  mean  time  to  disintegration  of  the  tablet  (all  visits)  was  15.78  seconds  and  the  mean  time  to complete disappearance of the tablet was 0.97 minutes. All patients found the formulation acceptable. No serious adverse events were reported during the study and none of the AEs led to withdrawal from the study. Blood pressure and heart rate were taken at the two first visits and are reported to have been within normal limits.

For  the  extension  of  the  indication  for  oral  olanzapine  to  include  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe manic episode, the studies described below were performed.

## Study HGEH: Olanzapine vs. placebo

In this study, the patients (n=139) were predominantly bipolar manic, only 17% were bipolar mixed, 32% were rapid cyclers and 53% were psychotic. According to change from baseline in Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the control of acute manic symptoms. This effect was statistically significant in ITT LOCF analysis from baseline to endpoint (3 weeks), but not in the visit wise analyses before the 3-week endpoint. However, the proportion of patients who responded by 50% decrease from baseline in Y-MRS score was statistically and clinically significantly superior to placebo (48.6% vs. 24.2%). The results of the secondary efficacy variable analyses (CGIBP  severity  of  mania,  severity  of  depression,  overall  severity  of  bipolar  illness,  PANSS  negative, PANSS positive scores) do not give convincing support; the only noticeable difference in favour of olanzapine was observed for PANSS  total score. The studied patient population was very heterogeneous; the efficacy of olanzapine compared to placebo was not consistent across subgroups (e.g. in non-rapid cyclers, patients with mixed type mania, patients who used benzodiazepines).

## Study HGGW: Olanzapine vs. placebo

In this double-blind placebo-controlled study, patients with bipolar I disorder and an acute manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features were enrolled. The study was stopped early due to slow recruitment and only 115 instead of planned 240 patients were randomised. The dropout rate was high,  leaving  only  34  patients  in  the  olanzapine  group  and  25  patients  in  the  placebo  group  who completed the 4-week acute phase. The proportion of patients with bipolar mixed episode was higher in  this  study  compared  to  HGEH  (42.6%)  and  55.7%  experienced  psychotic  features.  As  in  study HGEH,  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  Y-MRS  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint,  LOCF,  and olanzapine  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo.  The  magnitude  of  difference  in  the response to olanzapine (-6.65 points on the Y-MRS, 95% CI for the treatment difference -13.09, -3.66) was  similar  to  that  observed  in  study  HGEH.  In  a  visitwise  completers  analysis,  a  statistically significant improvement in the olanzapine group vs. placebo was observed at week 1, 2 and 3, but no longer at week 4. Visitwise observed cases analyses generally supported the primary analysis.

Changes in the secondary efficacy variables generally supported the efficacy of olanzapine compared to placebo. However, with regard to depressive symptoms (HAMD-21) and PANSS negative score no statistically  significant  difference  compared  to  placebo  was  shown. The responder  analysis  (at  least 50%  decrease  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS)  also  supported  the  efficacy  of  olanzapine  (64.8%).  The placebo response rate in this study was high (42.9%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of patients who achieved remission of mania as defined in the protocol was statistically significantly higher in the olanzapine group (35.7% vs. 61.1%). The remission criteria of depression were not met in a statistically significantly higher proportion of olanzapine-treated patients compared to  placebo  (53.7%  vs.  42.9%,  respectively).  Worsening  of  depression  was  observed  in  24.1%  of patients  in  the  olanzapine  group  and  33.9%  in  the  placebo  group,  which  was  not  statistically significant.

## Study HGHQ: Olanzapine vs. valproate

The primary objective of the study was to assess the non-inferiority in efficacy of 5-20  mg/day of olanzapine compared with 500-2500 mg/day of valproate in improving overall manic symptomatology, as measured by the reduction from baseline of the Y-MRS total score, after acute treatment  (up  to  3  weeks).  Long-term  therapy  was  also  examined  in  the  double-blind  (11  month) extension.  As  regards  efficacy,  the  acute  3-week  phase  demonstrated  statistical  superiority  of olanzapine  compared  to  valproate  in  the  change  from  baseline  of  Y-MRS.  The  mean  change  from baseline  to  3  weeks  was  -13.36  (SD  8.78)  in  the  olanzapine  group  and  -10.45  (SD  10.45)  in  the valproate group. The DB extension phase data suggest comparable efficacy as measured by primary and secondary efficacy variables. The response rates were not statistically significantly different after acute or long-term treatment, and were numerically in favour of olanzapine. However, the results of the  analysis  of  recurrence  of  symptoms  early  (weeks  5-11)  in  treatment,  may  suggest  that  a  higher initial  response  rate  during  olanzapine  treatment  could  be  offset  by  a  higher  rate  of  symptom recurrence  during  the  index  episode.  Compared  to  valproate,  olanzapine  showed  numerically  fewer recurrences (up to 44 weeks).

A problem in this trial (and other trials as well) was the heterogeneity of the patient population (manic, mixed, psychotic, non-psychotic, rapid cyclers). Furthermore, enrolment in this study was prematurely terminated after 251 patients had been randomised instead of the planned 650. The Data Monitoring Board who was unblinded to efficacy data made the decision. However, the interim analysis was not planned  in  the  protocol.  The  possibility  of  unblinding  of  investigators  to  treatment  assignment  and introduction  of  bias  cannot  be  totally  excluded,  although  the  results  with  regards  to  the  primary efficacy variable were similar before and after the interim analysis.

Due to many forms of severity of symptoms in the manic population, the issue on psychotic features as a marker of severity was discussed during the ad-hoc expert meeting. Notably, these subtypes do not represent co-morbid conditions, but rather differences in the pattern of symptoms, which may vary within patients from one episode to another, e.g. the presence of psychotic symptoms is a marker of severity  of  the  index  episode.  Olanzapine  was  also  significantly  more  effective  in  patients  without psychotic symptoms, and it is therefore assumed that the treatment response to olanzapine in patients with acute bipolar mania is not based solely on its antipsychotic features.

## Study HGHD: Olanzapine vs. haloperidol

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  superiority  in  efficacy  of  flexible  dosing  of olanzapine  (5,  10,  15  or  20  mg/d)  compared  with  haloperidol  (3,  5,  10,  or  15  mg/d)  in  improving overall manic symptomatology, as measured by the proportion of patients who completed 6 weeks of double-blind acute therapy and met the criteria for symptomatic remission at Week 6. The remission criteria for mania were met in 52.1% of olanzapine-treated patients and 46.1% of haloperidol-treated patients (p=0.152). Y-MRS change from baseline to endpoint was a secondary efficacy measure in this study. The study continued for another 6 weeks in patients who, having completed the 6-week initial period had shown an improvement from baseline CGI-BP overall severity score. The second 6-week period  aimed  to  demonstrate  maintenance  of  effect.  The  patients  were  almost  exclusively  bipolar manic and the majority (57%) exhibited current psychotic features. The starting doses of both drugs were high (olanzapine 15 mg, haloperidol 10 mg).

The CPMP considered that as there are no placebo-controlled studies of haloperidol and there was no placebo-arm in this study, confirmation of effect size of the comparator is lacking and maintenance of effect  during  a  single  acute  episode  is  poorly  supported.  In  addition,  in  this  study  vs.  haloperidol, olanzapine failed to show superiority for the primary endpoint as was outlined in the study protocol. Nevertheless, an ad-hoc independent expert panel agreed upon a post-hoc non-inferiority margin of 12.5%, and non-inferiority was thus suggested for olanzapine compared to haloperidol. The results of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the study were questioned due to the lack of a placebo-control and failed primary objective of showing superiority of olanzapine, but the response rates were high for both olanzapine and haloperidol and are consistent with response rates of other studies. Therefore, the study was considered supportive, albeit not pivotal.

## Study HGFU: Olanzapine added to mood stabilisers

This  study  was  designed  as  2  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  studies  of  approximately  168 inpatients or outpatients per study (yielding a total of 336 patients overall) meeting diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed, with or without psychotic features. The primary objective was to  evaluate the  efficacy  of  olanzapine  (5,  10,  15  or  20  mg)  compared  with  placebo when  each was added  to  the  patients'  current  mood  stabiliser  therapy  to  assess  acute  olanzapine  therapy.  Of importance, the starting dose was 10 mg in this study. This study is ongoing, and only 6-week acute phase data are available. Efficacy of acute therapy was to be evaluated using improvement in clinical symptomatology after up to 6 weeks of double-blind therapy as measured by reductions from baseline in the Y-MRS total score. At randomisation, 117 patients (34.1%) were being treated with lithium as a mood stabiliser, and 226 patients (65.9%) with valproate. Forty-eight% of the patients were bipolar manic and 52.0% were bipolar mixed. Overall, 45.1% of the patients had a rapid cycling course, and 33.1% were exhibiting psychotic features in their current episode of mania.

The olanzapine/mood stabiliser group experienced a statistically significantly greater mean improvement  in  Y-MRS  total  score  than  did  the  placebo/mood  stabiliser  group.  Several  of  the secondary  efficacy  variables  (PANS  total,  CGI-BP  severity  of  overall  bipolar  disease,  CGI-BP depression and HAMD-21) showed statistically significant differences in favour of the olanzapine/mood stabiliser group The analysis of responders (at least 50% decrease in Y-MRS total score  olanzapine/mood  67.7%,  placebo/mood  stabiliser  44.7%)  gives  further  reassurance  of  a clinically relevant difference between the groups. The time to response was significantly shorter in the olanzapine/mood stabiliser group.

For  the  Y-MRS  score  change  from  baseline,  no  treatment-by-subgroup  interaction  was  observed depending on the mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate). Considering time to statistically significant effect  and  maintenance  of  effect,  the  visit  wise  analyses  offer  some  further  information.  The olanzapine and mood stabiliser group demonstrated statistically significantly greater mean improvement in Y-MRS total scores at most of the visits up to and including week 6 and the time to response was 18 days for olanzapine and mood stabiliser and 28 days for placebo and mood stabiliser. The study could not answer the question whether the combination of olanzapine and mood stabiliser offers advantage over olanzapine monotherapy.

For the extension of the indication for oral olanzapine to include prevention of recurrence in patients with  bipolar  disorder  in  patients  whose  manic  episode  has  responded  to  olanzapine  treatment,  the studies described below were performed.

## Study HGHL: Olanzapine vs. placebo in relapse prevention

Study HGHL was a randomised, double blind parallel study of olanzapine vs. placebo for up to 12 months in patients who experienced a symptomatic remission of an index episode of mania or mixed episode in bipolar disorder after 6-12 weeks of open-label acute treatment with olanzapine. Altogether 731 patients entered the open-label phase, 225 were rerandomised to receive olanzapine and 136 to receive placebo during the double-blind study period. Over 50% were rapid cyclers, over 40% had a mixed episode and over 20% had psychotic features in the beginning of open-label treatment. These proportions remained similar for the patient population entering the double-blind phase.

The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  time  to  symptomatic  relapse.  Olanzapine  was  statistically significantly  superior  to  placebo  in  time-to-event  for  symptomatic  relapse  of  bipolar  disorder  (174 days in the olanzapine group, 22 days in the placebo group), manic relapse and depressive relapse. The differences  in  the  proportions  of  patients  experiencing  bipolar  (either  manic  or  depressive)  relapse (olanzapine  46.7%,  placebo  80.1%),  depressive  relapse  (34.7%  vs.  47.8%,  respectively)  or  manic relapse (16.4% vs. 41.2%, respectively) were all statistically significant, and consistently lower in the olanzapine group. This effect was robust according to subgroup analyses and was seen in patients with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a mixed index episode, in rapid cyclers and non-rapid cyclers and in patients with or without psychotic features. Mixed relapses were not analysed separately. Nevertheless, according to post hoc analyses using several definitions of depressive and manic relapses, the results are robust and support efficacy in the prevention of both types of episodes.

The  study  showed  that  olanzapine  was  effective  in  preventing  recurrence  of  manic  and  depressive symptoms during 12 months, following olanzapine-induced remission of a manic episode.

## Study HGHT: Olanzapine vs. lithium in relapse prevention

Study  HGHT  was  a  randomised,  double-blind  parallel  study  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  olanzapine compared with lithium for up to 12 months in patients who experienced a symptomatic remission of an index manic or mixed episode after 6-12 weeks of acute open-label treatment with olanzapine and lithium combination therapy. Altogether 543 patients entered the open-label treatment and 431 were rerandomised to double-blind treatment with either olanzapine or lithium. The other drug was tapered off over a period 4 weeks after entering the double-blind phase. A great majority of patients in this study had a manic index episode and approximately 27% had psychotic features. Few patients were rapid  cyclers  or  had  a  mixed  episode.  Prior  lithium  use  was  reported  by  74%  of  patients  and, importantly,  the  data  do  not  suggest  that  a  lithium-resistant  population  was  enrolled..  The  primary efficacy  measure  was  symptomatic  relapse  of  bipolar  disorder.  The  primary  objective  was  to  show non-inferiority  of  olanzapine  to  lithium.  This  objective  was  met,  since  the  percentage  of  bipolar relapses was 30.0% in the olanzapine group and 38.8% in the lithium group, and the upper limit of 95% CI for the difference was less than the protocol-defined non-inferiority limit of 7.3%. This result was clearly driven by a lower percentage of patients relapsing to mania. There was no difference in the relapses to depression. These results were similar in the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses.

Symptomatic relapse at one year was similar in the two groups and non-inferiority was concluded at 52 weeks as regards bipolar, depressive and  manic relapse. For relapse into mania, olanzapine was shown to be superior to lithium with an opposite trend earlier in treatment (up to 4.5 months) during which there were more symptomatic bipolar relapses in the olanzapine group. The first four weeks of the double-blind treatment entailed tapering off either olanzapine or lithium over the first four weeks, which is expected to result in a higher initial relapse rate in both groups, but as confirmed in further analyses (taper period alone and monotherapy period alone), tapering of lithium was associated with a higher initial relapse rate than tapering of olanzapine. Examination of the Kaplan-Meier curves clearly suggested that this initial difference up to 4.5 months was due to more frequent relapses to depression in  the  olanzapine  group  during  initial  months  of  monotherapy  compared  to  lithium  monotherapy. Looking  at  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  of  relapse  to  depression,  the  difference  between  the  curves actually disappeared at approximately 6 months. Separate analysis of the taper period and subsequent treatment period showed that a major part of the difference was attributable to taper, but not limited to it.

The results of Study HGHT suggested that in this population of patients with only mild depressive symptoms during the index episode of mania, tapering off lithium may result, at least initially, in a higher risk of switch to depression than tapering off olanzapine. The risk of relapse to mania is lower during long-term monotherapy with olanzapine than with lithium.

## Study HGFU - Olanzapine added to mood stabilisers

The results of the acute double-blind phase of this study were reviewed for the indication for treatment of manic episode. Patients who responded to acute treatment with either mood stabiliser + placebo or mood stabiliser + olanzapine were rerandomised to olanzapine + mood stabiliser or placebo + mood stabiliser  for  a  18  month  double-blind  treatment  extension  phase.  Mood  stabiliser  treatment  was carefully optimised and frequently monitored in both treatment groups.

In  the  99  patients  who  were  randomised  to  olanzapine  +  mood  stabiliser  in  the  acute  phase  and rerandomised  to  the  extension  phase,  the  majority  (64%)  continued  to  have  valproate  as  mood stabiliser  and  the  illness  characteristics  of  the  population  (manic/mixed,  psychotic  features,  rapid cyclers) were similar to the acute phase.

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  in  the  extension  phase  was  time  to  syndromic  relapse  to  mania  or depression.  The  primary  analysis  population  was  patients  who  received  and  responded  to  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination therapy in the acute phase. The rates of syndromic relapse to mania or depression during 18 months were relatively low (approximately 30%). There were no statistically significant differences or even trends of differences between the two groups in the primary analysis.

The results of the extension phase did not provide conclusive evidence of any added benefit in terms of  efficacy  to  continue  combination  of  olanzapine  and  mood  stabiliser  for  long-term  relapse prevention after remission has been achieved with such a combination and did not answer the question which drug would best be tapered off and discontinued.

The Kaplan-Meier curves for time to syndromic and symptomatic relapse showed trends in favour or olanzapine  +  mood  stabiliser  over  placebo  and  mood  stabiliser,  but  no  statistical  significance  was shown. There is no compelling evidence that discontinuation of olanzapine treatment in patients who have experienced remission during combination treatment of olanzapine and mood stabiliser would put patients at an unacceptable risk of symptom recurrence.

## General discussion on clinical efficacy

During the initial review, the CPMP convened an expert working group, to consider the clinical data requirements necessary to evaluate medicinal products for the treatment of schizophrenia. A number of recommendations were made to the CPMP regarding criteria to be considered in evaluating such products.

During  the  CPMP  meeting  on  18-20  June  1996  the  main  issues  discussed  by  the  CPMP  members related to the following:

Long term efficacy: The majority of the controlled studies have a six week duration and those with a one  year  double  blind  extension  phase  had  a  high  discontinuation  rate.  However  a  statistically significant  higher  proportion  of  patients  on  olanzapine  maintained  a  response  for  one  year  than  on placebo or Haloperidol.

Indication on negative symptoms: The main studies showing statistically significant improved efficacy for these symptoms (HGAJ, HGAD) were not done prospectively with relief of negative symptoms as the primary end-point in a specific population of patients showing persistent negative symptomatology.

Indication on depressive symptoms in schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychosis: The  efficacy  on depressive symptoms associated with schizophrenia was observed in one comparative study in which it  was  not  the  primary  endpoint.  Moreover,  it  was  also  considered  that  it  is  possible  that  the comparator  chosen,  Haloperidol,  can  induce  depression  affecting  the  MADRS  score.  However  a subgroup analysis suggested a possible effect on depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity (MADRS score ≥ 16).

Concluding this discussion the CPMP considered that olanzapine was effective in the treatment of schizophrenia and in maintaining improvement in patients showing an initial treatment response. In addition the CPMP considered that effects on depressive symptoms, as well as negative psychotic symptoms, should be included in the SPC.

For the extension of indication in 2002 the CPMP considered that favourable benefit/risk profile had been established for the indication 'Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of a moderate to severe manic episode; olanzapine has not been demonstrated to prevent recurrence of manic or depressive episodes' . Olanzapine compared to placebo showed convincing evidence for efficacy in the primary efficacy  parameters  in  two  short-term  studies.  Non-inferiority  of  olanzapine  was  shown  for  the primary efficacy parameters according to the study protocol in the comparator study with valproate and  a  secondary  assessment  of  superiority  showed  that  olanzapine  could  be  considered  statistical superior  to  valproate  with  regard  to  reduction  of  manic  symptoms.  Olanzapine  failed  to  show superiority  to  haloperidol  for  the  primary  endpoint  as  was  outlined  in  the  study  HGHD  protocol; however, non-inferiority was suggested for olanzapine following a post-hoc interpretation. Olanzapine showed numerically fewer recurrences (up to 44 weeks) compared to valproate; no difference in the recurrence rate was seen in comparison to haloperidol (up to 6 weeks) and no statistical significant differences between olanzapine and haloperidol and valproate were shown using time to recurrence to depression as an endpoint.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the extension of indication in 2003 the CPMP considered that a favourable benefit/risk profile had been established for the  indication: 'in  patients  whose  manic episode  has  responded  to  olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder'. This applies to patients whose manic index episode has responded to either olanzapine monotherapy or  combination  therapy  with  olanzapine  and  mood  stabiliser.  Olanzapine  monotherapy  up  to  12 months was shown to be superior to placebo in bipolar relapse prevention after response of a manic episode to olanzapine treatment and to be non-inferior to lithium monotherapy in terms of recurrence of  bipolar  symptoms  in  patients  whose  index  episode  of  mania  had  responded  to  a  combination  of lithium and olanzapine. However, tapering off lithium from the combination over a relatively short period of time (4 weeks) resulted in a higher risk of relapse to depression for several months compared to tapering off olanzapine. There was no difference at 12 months in the rate of relapse to depression. However,  olanzapine  monotherapy  in  this  situation  was  shown  to  be  superior  to  lithium  in  the prevention of recurrence of mania based on secondary analysis.

The  benefit/risk  of  long-term  combination  of  olanzapine  with  mood  stabilisers  for  prevention  of recurrence  in  bipolar  I  disorder  was  considered  unfavourable,  as  the  study  did  not  meet  statistical significance for the primary endpoint of time to syndromic relapse and secondary efficacy evaluations were thus not considered. Moreover, the undesirable effects are more frequent than with monotherapy.

Olanzapine  can  be  considered  to  an  acceptable  alternative  to  available  mood  stabilisers  for  the prevention of bipolar recurrence, but careful monitoring of the clinical condition, glycaemic control in patients  with  risk  factors  for  diabetes  or  pre-existing  diabetes,  and  extrapyramidal  symptoms  are required.

## Clinical safety

The initial overall safety assessment database for the coated tablet marketing authorisation application includes 2500 patients who were exposed to olanzapine. Patients with significant somatic baseline illnesses were generally excluded from the studies. Sixty four percent of the patients were male, 80% Caucasian and 56% less than 40 years old. The percentage of patients over 65 years of agewas 11%.

The  incidence  of  somnolence,  dizziness,  constipation,  appeared  to  be  dose-related  and  remained within reasonable limits. Significant weight gain was observed consistently across all major studies. Significant parkinsonism and akathisia as assessed by symptom rating scales was observed to occur less  frequently  during  olanzapine  treatment  than  Haloperidol  treatment.  Extrapyramidal  symptoms were reported clinically and statistically significantly less often during olanzapine treatment in double blind  studies  and  the  need  for  anticholinergic  treatment  was  less  frequent  during  treatment  with olanzapine  than  Haloperidol.  Comparisons  with  other  anticholinergic  neuroleptics  have  not  been performed. Olanzapine elevates serum prolactin levels, but the highest levels observed are less than those with therapeutically equivalent doses of Haloperidol. There was one report of gynecomastia and no reports of galactorrhoea in olanzapine-treated patients. Convulsions without known predisposing conditions have been described with low incidence in olanzapine-treated patients.

An  elevation  of  creatine  phosphokinase  (CPK)  was  found  not  to  be  statistically  different  to  that observed with Haloperidol.

The  safety  profile  in  the  elderly  (&gt;65  years)  patients  was  found  to  be  more  or  less  comparable  to younger patients.

Cardiovascular changes: In the Overall Integrated Database olanzapine was shown to increase both supine and standing diastolic and systolic blood pressure as well as standing and supine heart rate, as well as prolonged corrected QT-interval (an incidence of 8%, mean change 2.82 msecs). Although the mean  change  from  baseline  was  observed  to  be  small  and  the  incidence  of  clinically  significant treatment  emergent  arrhythmias  was  not  different  from  that  of  haloperidol,  caution  should  be exercised in patients who have prolonged baseline QT, in patients treated with other drugs known to affect  QT interval and in patients with disturbed electrolyte balance. Olanzapine was also shown to prolong QT interval in rats.

Hepatic  changes: Moderate  asymptomatic  elevations  in  ALT  and/or  AST  levels  were  observed  in some patients usually during the first 6 weeks of treatment. In most cases, the elevated aminotransferase activities returned to normal during continued treatment. Cases of clinical hepatitis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  not  reported.  There  are  no  data  on  possible  morphological  changes  in  the  liver,  since  needle biopsies  were  not  obtained.  However,  in  view  of  these  elevated  liver  enzyme  levels  caution  is warranted  in  patients  at  risk  i.e.  patients  with  elevated  baseline  ALT  and/or  AST,  in  patients  who develop  elevated  ALT/AST  during  treatment,  in  patients  with  signs  or  symptoms  of  hepatic impairment, in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve and in patients who are being treated with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. In the event of elevated ALT and/or AST in an asymptomatic patient, follow-up should be organised and dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.

Haematological  changes: Mild-to-moderate  transient  eosinophilia  (extreme  values  were  up  to approximately  27%  of  WBC)  was  reported  more  often  with  olanzapine  than  with  haloperidol. Eosinophilia is a well-characterised clozapine treatment-emergent effect. This effect appeared to be dose-related  in  E003.  In  most  cases,  the  eosinophil  counts  returned  to  'normal'  despite  continued exposure to olanzapine, but adequate follow-up data are  missing. One patient was reported to have severe  dyspnoea  and  a  treatment-emergent  X-ray  abnormality  described  as  scleroemphysema  and concomitant  eosinophilia.  There  were  statistically  significant,  but  clinically  insignificant  treatmentemergent decreases in hematocrit and haemoglobin values during olanzapine treatment. Eight cases of thrombocytopenia were reported. Leukopenia and/or neutropenia have been infrequently reported in both  olanzapine  and  haloperidol  treated  patients.  Six  patients  were  discontinued  due  to  leukopenia. There  were  no  clear  differences  in  the  incidence  of,  or  discontinuation  due  to  low  leukocyte  or neutrophil counts between Haloperidol and olanzapine groups. Dose-dependent decreases in leukocyte counts were observed in chronic toxicity studies and these changes were generally accompanied by myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow. However the risk of leukopenia and neutropenia was not found to be dose related and appears to be relatively low. Thirty-two patients with clozapine-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis histories received olanzapine without decreases in baseline neutrophil counts.

Drug  interactions: Using  rank  transformed  data  an  increased  consumption  of  alcohol  has  been observed in 1 out of the 4 double blind studies. There does not appear to be an increased risk of drug abuse or drug dependency in olanzapine treated patients compared to Haloperidol treated patients.

For the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode , the placebo- and active comparator-controlled studies provided a fairly extensive safety database. Limited long-term safety data was available from the  uncontrolled extension phase of study HGHE. Compared to the safety database in patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of somnolence, weight gain, increased appetite, dry mouth and dizziness appear to be clearly more frequent in patients with bipolar disorder. Dizziness, asthenia, somnolence, dry  mouth  and  weight  gain  were  the  outstanding  adverse  events  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies; somnolence was reported in up to 38% of patients, dizziness in up to 13% of patients, weight gain in up to  11% of patients.  These  adverse  events  could  adversely  affect  compliance  in  clinical  practice. Transient  increases  in  ALT  were  reported  very  frequently  (up  to  22%  of  patients)  without  signs  of hepatic dysfunction; this phenomenon is well known from previous clinical studies and is mainly seen during the initial weeks of treatment, and a potentially clinically significant effect is increase in uric acid (2% of patients).

Compared  to placebo ,  no  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  in  mean  change  from baseline in either the Simpson-Angus  or  Barnes  Akathisia scales, measuring extrapyramidal symptoms.

Compared  to valproate in  acute  (3  weeks)  treatment,  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  occurred statistically significantly more often during olanzapine treatment; somnolence (38.4% vs. 21.4%), dry mouth  (33.6%  vs.  6.3%),  increased  appetite  (12.0%  vs.  2.4%),  tremor  (9.6%  vs.  3.2%),  speech disorder  (8.0%  vs.  0.8%)  and  tongue  oedema;  tongue  oedema  could  be  related  to  extrapyramidal symptoms. Only nausea occurred significantly more often during valproate treatment. Euphoria was reported  more  often  in  the  olanzapine  group,  although  the  difference  was  not  significant.  Severe adverse events were catatonic reaction, euphoria and extrapyramidal syndrome. Olanzapine treatment was  associated  with  an  increase  in  corrected  QT-interval.  The  mean  increase  was  small  especially when the appropriate Fredericia's formula was used to calculate QTc. Although the difference was not statistically significant, the percentage of patients with QTc prolongation exceeding 30 ms was higher in  the  olanzapine  group  (8.8%)  compared  to  valproate  (4.1%).  The  frequency  of  clearly  significant increase in QTc (&gt;60 ms) was low. Although the difference was not statistically significant (5.3% vs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1.8%), treatment emergent Parkinsonism appeared to be more frequent during olanzapine treatment. Altogether,  the  safety  profile  of  olanzapine  cannot  be  considered  superior  to  valproate.  A  possible higher risk of neutropenia during combined olanzapine/valproate treatment is mentioned in the SPC. The limited data on co-administration with lithium and valproate, as well as the non-existing clinical data  on  the  combination  of  olanzapine  and  carbamazepine  (used  in  Europe  as  mood  stabiliser)  is addressed in section 4.4 of the SPC, with a cross-reference already present information in section 4.5 on pharmacokinetic data.

Compared to haloperidol , a number of adverse events, primarily extrapyramidal symptoms, occurred statistically significantly more frequently in the haloperidol group during the six-week acute phase of study  HGHD than in  the  olanzapine  group  -  akathisia  (26.0%  vs.  5.6%),  extrapyramidal  syndrome (22.4% vs. 2.1%), hypertonia (17.4% vs. 3.8%), tremor (14.2% vs. 4.7%), dystonia (6.4% vs. 1.3%), hypokinesia (3.7% vs. 0.4%) and dyskinesia (2.7% vs. 0.0%). Haloperidol-treated patients also had statistically  significantly  higher  rates  of  increased  salivation  (6.8%  vs.  0.4%,  p&lt;.001).  The  only adverse  events  that  occurred  at  statistically  significantly  higher  rates  among  olanzapine-treated patients were weight gain (9.8% vs. 2.7%), infection (4.3% vs. 0.5%) and fever (3.4% vs. 0.0%). The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events in olanzapine-treated patients (incidence &gt;10%)  were  insomnia  (10.7%)  and  somnolence  (10.3%).  Among  haloperidol-treated  patients, common adverse events (incidence &gt;10%) were akathisia (26.0%), extrapyramidal syndrome (22.4%), hypertonia (17.4%), tremor (14.2%), and insomnia (13.7%). A number of adverse events, primarily extrapyramidal symptoms, occurred significantly more frequently in the haloperidol group than in the olanzapine group during the continuation phase. The incidence of tardive dyskinesia was statistically significantly  higher  in  the  haloperidol  group  (3.6%  vs.  0.0%,  p=.020).  The  only  adverse  event  that occurred at a significantly higher rate among olanzapine-treated patients was weight gain (14.4% vs. 5.1%,  p=.011).  No  increase  in  corrected  QTc  was  observed,  but  potentially  significant  QTc prolongation  of  at  least  30  ms  (olanzapine  8.1%,  haloperidol  6.7%)  and  at  least  60  ms  (olanzapine 0.6%, haloperidol 0.7%) were reported with similar frequency in both groups. No patient had QTc exceeding  500  ms.  Altogether;  the  safety  profile  of  olanzapine  in  this  patient  population  is  clearly superior  to  haloperidol.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  low  incidence  of  extrapyramidal  symptoms  and tardive dyskinesia.

Combined with mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate ) in study HGFU, anticholinergic/antihistaminic and extrapyramidal symptoms (somnolence, dry mouth, weight gain, increased appetite, tremor and speech disorder) were substantially more frequent with olanzapine and mood stabiliser than with mood stabiliser  alone.  The  profile  of  adverse  effects  was  similar  compared  to  monotherapy  trials  and  no unexpected adverse events were observed. However, a statistically significantly higher incidence of neutropenia was reported with the combination of olanzapine plus mood stabiliser compared to mood stabiliser  alone  (3.2%  vs.  1.1%).  This  increased  incidence  appears  to  be  associated  with  the combination of olanzapine and valproate, and high plasma valproate level can be a contributing factor in these cases. However, it is to be noted that no pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed.

The safety profile of long-term olanzapine treatment in patients with bipolar I disorder is similar to that in patients with schizophrenia. Compared to lithium and valproate, the most frequently used mood stabilisers,  the  safety  concerns  with  olanzapine  monotherapy  focus  on  weight  gain.  The  results  of safety  analyses  did  not  suggest  any  specific  safety  hazards  related  to  the  concomitant  use  of  mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate) with olanzapine. The profile of adverse events associated with lithium or valproate plus olanzapine co-therapy was consistent with expected undesirable effects of olanzapine and  mood  stabilisers.  However,  the  interpretation  must  be  cautious,  since  the  sensitivity  of  the database to detect interactions was low. The data from the controlled clinical trials did not suggest a difference  in  the  risk  of  suicide  in  patients  who  had  received  long-term  olanzapine  treatment  vs. comparators.  In the  overall  database,  suicidal  ideation  or  suicide  attempt  were  reported  as  SAEs  in 1.6%  and  0.8%  of  patients  during  olanzapine  treatment,  respectively.  Suicidal  ideation  or  suicide attempt  were  the  reason  for  discontinuation  in  0.4%  of  patients,  including  patients  who  received combination treatment with olanzapine and mood stabiliser. Clinically significant weight gain was the outstanding safety concern with long-term olanzapine treatment. This risk is well known and appears to be of similar magnitude and frequency compared to patients with schizophrenia. Weight gain may have adverse long-term metabolic consequences (hyperlipidaemia, risk of diabetes mellitus) with an eventual impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The current database clearly showed that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

abnormalities of glycaemic control were more frequent during olanzapine than lithium or valproate treatment.

The other, less common risks of olanzapine compared to available mood stabilisers were treatmentemergent Parkinsonism, akathisia and (tardive) dyskinesia.

## Other post-authorisation safety data updates

The SPC and PL initially authorized for Zyprexa Velotab also reflected the amendments for Zyprexa coated tablet following the first six Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) for olanzapine, which started with the Community Marketing Authorisation for Zyprexa in 1996.

Following the CPMP review of the 7 th PSUR, the sections 4.4, 4.6 and 4.8 of the SPC were amended with  respect  to  allergic  reactions,  urinary  hesitation,  discontinuation  symptoms  (such  as  sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting), and neutropenia. Spontaneous reports have been very rarely  received  on  tremor,  hypertonia,  lethargy  and  sleepiness,  in  infants  born  to  mothers  who  had used  olanzapine  during  the  3 rd trimester.  In  addition,  following  results  in  studies  in  Parkinson's disease,  it  was  added  that  the  use  of  olanzapine  in  the  treatment  of  dopamine-agonist-associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease is not recommended since worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology  and  hallucinations  were  very  commonly  and  more  frequently  reported  than  with placebo.

Following  the  CPMP  review  of  the  9th  PSUR,  the  sections  4.6  and  4.8  were  amended  to  include information on the infant exposure to olanzapine at breast-feeding, as well as the section 4.8 to include information  on  the  very  rare  occurrence  of  extrapyramidal  symptoms  (Parkinsonism,  dystonia  and tardive dyskinesia).

In  March  2004,  the  EMEA  issued  a  Public  Statement  on  Cerebrovascular  adverse  events  and increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia, based on data from clinical trials that sshow an increased  risk  of  cerebrovascular  adverse  events  and  mortality  in  elderly  patients  with  dementia receiving olanzapine. This Public Statement can be found on the EMEA Website (http://www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/drugalert/drugalert.htm).

It  is  to  be  noted  that  olanzapine  is  not  approved  for  the  treatment  of  dementia-related  psychosis and/or  behavioural  disturbances  and  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  this  particular  group  of patients.

The MAH has simultaneously informed physicians throughout the European Union of these findings via a Dear Dr Letter.

The provisional changes introduced to the information for prescribers and patients can be found in the Module 3 and 4 of this EPAR.

## 5. Conclusions

Taken together the studies submitted as part of the application for Zyprexa and the additional studies performed with the orodispersible tablet formulation, the CPMP considered that there were no major objections to granting marketing authorisations for Zyprexa Velotab 5 mg, 10 g, 15 mg and 20 mg orodispersible tablets. Even though the 15 mg and 20 mg orodispersible tablets are also new strengths, they fit with the approved posology recommendations.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit /risk profile of Zyprexa Velotab orodispersible tablet in the treatment of schizophrenia was favourable.
