## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

ViraferonPeg/PegIntron  (peginterferon  alfa-2b)  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with chronic  hepatitis  C  who  have  elevated  transaminases  without  liver  decompensation  and  who  are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV. The best way to use ViraferonPeg in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. The spontaneous remission rate in chronic hepatitis C is very low and there are currently no licensed alternative treatment options to alfa interferon and ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. This variation concerns a revision of section 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the summary of product characteristics to include the retreatment of patients who have failed prior therapy with alfa-interferon (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin. A new maximum ribavirin dose of 1,400 mg for patients over 105 kg of weight is also proposed. Data from the EPIC (Evaluation of PegIntron in Control of Hepatitis) studies program is submitted in support of this variation.  The EPIC studies program consists of three clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C with at least moderate fibrosis who have failed prior therapy with alpha interferon (including peginterferon alfa) and ribavirin. Protocol P02370 assesses sustained viral response (SVR), P02570  assesses  whether  low  dose  peginterferon  alfa-2b  (0.5  mcg/kg/w.)  can  slow  progression  of fibrosis and P02569 whether this therapy delays progression to end-stage liver disease in patients with cirrhosis. In this submission data from study P02370 is presented. The  EPIC  program  was  subject  to  advice  from  the  CHMP  in  September  2002  and  the  studies programme was accepted, including the single arm design of study P02370, with some caveats related to the assessment of safety. No formal interim analysis was planned, but data were available for review on an ongoing basis. Data from the analysis of October 2003 were made public at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) annual meeting in April 2005. In November 2005, data were also presented to FDA and the EU Rapporteur (Sweden). It was accepted that an interim analysis based on all subjects enrolled by 1  April  2004,  the  first  cohort,  could  be  submitted  as  a  basis  for  a  label  change.  This  manner  of proceeding;  repeat analyses, making study data public, followed by a formal interim analysis and a regulatory submission,  is ill suited to control for the overall type-1 error. Nevertheless, as data were already made public and appeared convincingly far from the predetermined cut-off for a meaningful clinical effect, the submission strategy was accepted by the CHMP. Further  to  the  submission  of  this  variation  in  September  2006  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder (MAH) informed the CHMP in February 2007 that in some instances the hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid  (HCV-RNA)  assays  conducted  in  the  company's  laboratories  (in-house  Polymerase  Chain Reaction (PCR) assay) to quantitatively assess HCV-RNA from subjects samples in this clinical trial had underreported the levels of HCV-RNA as evidence by the under recovery of the positive control. A  corrective  action  plan  was  developed  by  the  MAH  that  included  the  development  of  new  and revised  procedures  with  additional  assay  and  laboratory  controls  to  ensure  confidence  in  the robustness  of  the  assay  and  retesting  of  the  impacted  samples.  The  retested  sample  results  were submitted to the CHMP for assessment and had no meaningful impact on the study results. edicinal product no longer authorise

The data presented in this report constitutes the retested sample data.

## 1.2 Clinical Efficacy

The  main  study  submitted  in  support  of  this  variation  is  study  P02370  which  is  presented  and evaluated hereafter.  Study P02370 assessed SVR in patients treated for hepatitis C with peginterferon alfa 2b plus Rebetol who failed to respond to previous combination therapy (any interferon treatment in  combination with repairing). Data from two further studies has been submitted in support of the safety profile associated with retreatment of previous nonresponders and is discussed in Section 3.3 'Clinical Safety' of this report.  These two trials are the registration trial C/I98-580 in treatment naive patients and study P02314, an investigator-initiated study performed to support Rebetol weight-based dosing in the United States.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study P0230 Objectives Primary: to estimate SVR after treatment with peginterferon alfa 2b 1.5 mcg/kg/w and ribavirin 800 1400 mg/d for 48 weeks. SVR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV RNA at the end of 24 weeks of follow-up. Secondary: the identification of non-responders to study therapy for inclusion in studies P02570 and P02569. The hypothesis to be tested was that the SVR in non-responders and relapse patients is higher than 10%. Design Single arm, multicenter (132, 107 non-US sites) study in patients with chronic hepatitis C who failed to respond or relapsed after treatment with combination therapy (any interferon and ribavirin). Patients with   undetectable viral load at week 12 continued on therapy for a total of 48 weeks then entered a 24-week follow up period (no treatment); subjects who were HCV RNA positive at Treatment Week 12 (TW12) were to be discontinued from this trial and enrolled in a maintenance therapy trial. There were deviations from the protocol for subjects with detectable HCV RNA at treatment week 12. Some of these subjects were allowed to continue treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in study P02370: Prior to November 2003 subjects with HCV RNA level decreased ≥ 2 log10 were given deviations to continue. November 2003 to October 2004 subjects with HCV RNA level of ≤ 750 IU/ml were given deviations to continue. Study population Adults (18-65 years of age) with chronic hepatitis C, regardless of HCV genotype, with moderate to advanced hepatic fibrosis (METAVIR F2, F3, or F4) who failed previous therapy with alfa- interferon plus ribavirin therapy were eligible. Cirrhotic subjects must have been modified Child-Pugh Class A. The estimated number of patients to be recruited was 2200. This submission is based on the 'first cohort' in study P02370 (n=1354). Statistical methods The primary efficacy endpoint, SVR rate, was summarised using descriptive statistics (N, %) along with the 99% confidence intervals (based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution). The SVR rates in the key subgroups were summarised using descriptive statistics (N, %) with 95% confidence intervals. Baseline Characteristics edicinal product no longer authorise

The vast majority of patients had genotype 1 disease. About 3 out of 4 patients had received prior therapy with non-pegylated interferon and about 2 out of 3 patients were classified as non-responders to  prior  therapy.  There  was  a  large  number  of  patients  with  cirrhosis  (METAVIR  F4).  Degree  of fibrosis  correlates  with  age,  otherwise  there  were  no  major  differences  in  baseline  characteristics comparing different METAVIR fibrosis groups

## Results

Table 1 shows the virologic response rates. In the full study population, the lower 99% CI margin for SVR is close to 20%, i.e. reassuringly far from the hypothesis set out to be tested (SVR &gt;10%).

CI=confidence interval; EOT=end of treatment; SVR=sustained virologic response. a: Primary endpoint. b: TW24 was not considered a key time point; therefore, no impacted samples were reassayed.  The results depicted represent the original assay values for this time point. The stability of study data over time are illustrated as follows in table 2: Table 2 Sustained Virologic Response by Order of Enrolment SVR=sustained virologic response; CI=confidence interval.  Taking protocol-specified dose modifications and early discontinuations into account, 1075/1336 subjects were adherent to the peginterferon alfa-2b dosage, 1089/1336 to the ribavirin dosage, and 1029/1336 to both drugs. As shown in Table 3 in patients with a viral log reduction of ≥ 2, altogether 153 out of 293 patients continued combination therapy and the sustained response rate in this group was 11.8% (95% CI 7; 17%). In patients with less pronounced reduction in viral load only 55/457 continued combination therapy. No patients with SVR were seen in this group. A similar pattern was seen in relation to absolute viral load as shown in table 4. Table 3: Predictability of SVR by week 12 response Protocol No. P02370 edicinal product no longer authorise

In  patients  infected  with  HCV  genotype  1  and  cirrhosis,  the  SVR  rate  is  low  (44/451),  but  these patients have a poor prognosis and a cure rate of close to 10% is of clinical relevance. The sustained response rates for patients in study P02370 summarised by prior therapy (non-pegylated interferon/ribavirin vs pegylated interferon/ribavirin) versus prior response (non-responder vs relapser), genotype, fibrosis and baseline viral load are shown in Table 5.  The pattern of SVR in this population of non responders/relapsers is similar compared with treatment naïve patients as regards the influence of genotype, viral load and METAVIR score.  The SVR rate is lower in previous nonresponders  compared  with  patients  with  relapse.  Similarly  the  SVR  appears  higher  in  patients previously treated with non-pegylated interferon. edicinal product no longer authorise

Table 6 summarises SVR with HCV RNA below the Limit of Detection (LLD) of 125 IU/ml at TW 12.  The subjects are categorised as follows: 1) below the limits of detection: includes all subjects (i.e. also patients with signal detected) with viral load below the limits of detection 2) below the limits of detection, signal detected: includes all subjects with viral load below the limits of detection for whom a signal was detected The overall  sustained  response  rate  in  patients  previously  treated  with  interferon/ribavirin  and  viral load below LLD but signal detected is thus 18% versus 61% in those with viral load below LLD no signal detected (for peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin, corresponding figures were 21% versus 51%). edicinal product no longer authorise

The SVR rates in the SPC refer to 'below LLD, no signal detected'. The CHMP considered whether SVR in patients close to detectability, i.e 'LLD, signal detected', should be mentioned in the SPC. The  overall  SVR  in  patients  previously  treated  with  interferon/ribavirin  and  peginterferon/ribavirin viral  load  below  LLD  but  signal  detected  is  18%  and  21%  respectively.    However  'LLD,  signal detected' is assay dependent and thus not interpretable by assays other than the in house assay of the Marketing Authorisation Holder. As such this information has not been included in the SPC.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy This study demonstrated an overall SVR rate of around 20%. The pattern of SVR in the population of non responders/relapsers is similar compared with treatment naïve patients as regards the influence of genotype,  viral  load  and  METAVIR  score.    The  SVR  rate  is  as  expected  lower  in  previous  nonresponders  compared  with  patients  with  relapse.  Similarly  the  SVR  appears  higher  in  patients previously treated with non-pegylated interferon. This was confirmed in a multivariate analysis and is reflected in the SPC. For patients with undetectable HCV viral load at week 12, only two predictors of SVR were identified in  the  multivariate  analysis;  genotype  and  METAVIR  score.  The  SVR  in  week  12  responders, according to genotype are outlined below: Overall  approximately  37 %  of  patients  had  undetectable  plasma  HCV-RNA  levels  at  Week  12  of therapy.  In this subgroup, there was a 57 % (282/499) sustained virological response rate. In patients with detectable HCV-RNA week 12, other factors in addition to quantitative viral response are  likely  to  have  influenced  the  decision  to  continue  or  not  on  combination  therapy.  Therefore outcome  in  patients  who  continued  combination  therapy  probably  overestimates  the  benefit  of continued therapy. This, however, is not self evident as, for example,  a high fibrosis score could be viewed as an incitement to continue combination therapy, e.g. in patient with a low viral load or viral log reduction of ≥ 2, even if a positive outcome was considered less likely. Overall  it  is  agreed  that  week  12  data  are  pivotal  for  the  decision  whether  to  continue  or  not  on combination therapy and information has been provided in the SPC. edicinal product no longer authorise

## 1.2 Clinical Safety

In order to assess the safety profile associated with retreatment of previous nonresponders, in addition to data from study P02370, data from treatment-naïve subjects enrolled in the registration trial C/I98580 and data from Study P02314, an investigator-initiated study performed to support Rebetol weightbased dosing in the United States were  taken into consideration.

Patient Exposure There were 1341 subjects in the Safety Population of study P02370 all of whom received treatment. Because of the study design the percentage of subjects receiving treatment decreased from 93% (1243 subjects)  at  TW  18  to  50%  (669  subjects)  at  TW  24.  Forty-five  percent  of  the  subjects  (598/1341) received 48 weeks of treatment. Adverse events To assess the safety profile associated with retreatment of previous nonresponders, the Adverse Events (AE) profile for subjects enrolled in Study P02370 (prior nonresponders) was compared with the AE profile of treatment-naïve subjects enrolled in the registration trial C/I98-580. Common AE occurring during the first 18 weeks of treatment in each trial were compared. Patients in study P02370 generally experienced individual AEs with a lower frequency. This is likely due to a variety of factors including the exclusion of subjects with a history of moderate or severe depression  and  subjects  with  intolerance  to  ribavirin/interferon  based  on  their  prior  treatment experience.   Additionally, subjects who experienced significant AEs with prior treatment may have chosen to not be retreated.  Likewise investigators may have chosen not to retreat such subjects even if the subjects were willing to be retreated. Overall the pattern of AEs was qualitatively as expected and there were no new safety issues. Serious adverse events and deaths There was one death on therapy. This was a 66 year old man who entered coma due to a cerebral haemorrhage on day 30 of therapy. This was reported as unlikely to be related.  Cerebral haemorrhage is a listed event and was much discussed in relation to the Japanese experience with alpha interferons. The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  was  similar  to  the  incidence  reported  in  treatment  naïve patients.  In  F2  patients  7%,  F3  9%  and  F4  10%.  One  patient  underwent  liver  transplantation,  one developed oesophageal varices and there were three reports of liver malignancies. The most frequently reported SAEs were pneumonia (8), neutropenia (5), 'chest pain' (5) and suicidal ideations (5). The 8 cases of 'pneumonia' included two cases of lobar pneumonia and 6 not further specified. Severe AEs were reported in 22% of subjects. Thrombocytopenia (2%) and neutropenia (7%) were overall more commonly seen in this population compared with treatment naïve. Drug Discontinuations and modifications Dose  modifications were  undertaken in a total of 30%  of  subjects; in  most cases due to haematotoxicity, but asthenia was the cause in 2% of patients. The pattern was similar with respect to discontinuations;  altogether  7%  (n=89)  discontinued,  among  them  there  were  cases  of  depression (n=6), influenza like illness (n=5) and fatigue (n=5). edicinal product no longer authorise

Taking into account data from P02314 and P02370  there are no clinically relevant safety differences related to the use of ribavirin 1400 mg in patients weighing more than 105 kg.

The most obvious F-score related difference in event rates was thrombocytopenia and this is expected (Table 7). Overall,  affective  disorders  were  less  commonly  reported  in  this  treatment-experienced  patient population. Safety data for new maximum dose 1400mg In  study  P02370,  82  subjects  in  cohort  1  received  the  1400  mg  dose  of  ribavirin.    There  was  no meaningful  difference  in  the  rate  of  treatment  discontinuation,  overall  adverse  events,  or  serious adverse events in subjects receiving the 1400 mg dose in comparison to those receiving the 800 mg, 1000 mg, or 1200 mg doses (see Table 8). The only adverse event that appeared to occur at a higher rate  in  the  1400  mg  group  was  vomiting  (18%  vs.  6%,  10%  ,  and  8%  for  the  3  other  groups, respectively), however none were serious adverse events and there was no meaningful difference in the incidence of vomiting in the F4 subjects compared to the F2/3 subjects. Table 8 Discontinuation, Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events by Rebetol Dose *Includes subjects who discontinued due do treatment failure as per protocol design In addition to the data from study P02370, data on an additional 292 subjects who received the 1400 mg dose of ribavirin in study P02314 were considered.  Study P02314 is an investigator-initiated study performed to support Rebetol weight-based dosing in the United States. edicinal product no longer authorise

## Discussion Clinical Safety

Overall the pattern of AEs was qualitatively as expected and there were no new safety issues. There was one death on therapy. This was reported as unlikely to be related.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  was  similar  to  the  incidence  reported  in  treatment  naïve patients. Severe AEs were reported in 22% of subjects. Thrombocytopenia (2%) and neutropenia (7%) were overall more commonly seen in this population compared with treatment naïve.

Regarding the new maximum dose of 1400mg, 82 subjects in study P02370, in cohort 1 received the 1400  mg  dose  of  ribavirin. There  was  no  meaningful  difference  in the rate of treatment discontinuation, overall adverse events, or serious adverse events in subjects receiving the 1400 mg dose  in  comparison  to  those  receiving  the  800  mg,  1000  mg,  or  1200  mg  doses.  The  only  adverse event that appeared to occur at a higher rate in the 1400 mg group was vomiting however none were serious adverse events and there was no meaningful difference in the incidence of vomiting in the F4 subjects compared to the F2/3 subjects. In addition to the data from study P02370, data on an additional 292 subjects who received the 1400 mg  dose  of  ribavirin  in  study  P02314  were  considered.    Overall,  no  clinically  relevant  safety differences  related  to  the  use  of  ribavirin  1400  mg  in  patients  weighing  more  than  105  kg  were identified. 1.4   Risk management The  CHMP  agreed  that  a  EU-Risk  management  plan  would  not  be  required  for  Rebetol  for    the extension of indication of the treatment of patients who failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy. 1.5 Overall conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment This  submission  is  based  on  an  interim  analysis  of  an  ongoing  single-arm  trial.  Study  outcome  in altogether 1354 patients with prior non-response or relapse after treatment with (any) alpha interferon plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C were detailed in this interim report. The spontaneous remission rate in chronic hepatitis C is very low. All patients included in the study had  fibrosis  and  about  40%  cirrhosis,  i.e.  a  poor  long-term  prognosis.  Therefore  a  sustained  viral response  rate  about  20%  as  demonstrated  in  this  submission  convincingly  demonstrates  efficacy. There are currently no licensed alternative treatment options to (peg)interferon plus  ribavirin in the treatment of chronic  hepatitis C. Efficacy  results  however  differ  significantly  with  regard  to  the  mode  of  prior  treatment  failure ('relapse'  versus  'nonresponder')  and  with  regard  to  the  previous  therapy  regimen.  Nonresponder patients  whose  previous  combination  therapy  included  nonpegylated  interferon/ribavirin  were  more likely to respond to treatment than patients who had previously received pegylated interferon/ribavirin (17%  vs.  4%).  The  low  response  rate  in  prior  non-responders  to  the  same  therapy  is  expected. Nevertheless, 'near response' to prior therapy and, e.g. a short duration of prior therapy would be a reason to try to induce sustained response in a patient with poor prognosis due to fibrosis/cirrhosis, not least as there are no alternative curative therapies currently available and that viral response at week 12 can be used to identify patients with an increased likelihood to become sustained responders. edicinal product no longer authorise

Probably  due  to  selection  based  on  prior  tolerance  to  interferon  plus  ribavirin  therapy,  the  overall incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions was lower than in treatment naïve patients. In patients with  cirrhosis  a  higher  incidence  of  haematotoxicity  was  reported  as  expected.  There  were  no unexpected findings. Overall there are no clinically relevant safety differences related to the use of ribavirin 1400 mg in patients weighing more than 105 kg, and the 1400 mg dose is accepted in these patients.

Despite  the  well-known  tolerability  and  safety  concerns  related  to  treatment  with  interferon  plus ribavirin for one year, the benefit-risk balance of ViraferonPeg in the treatment of hepatitis C patients who have failed  previous  treatment  with  interferon  alfa  (pegylated  or  non-pegylated)  and  ribavarin combination is considered favourable, especially as viral response at week 12 can be used to identify patients with an increased likelihood to become sustained responders.
