| II/0096 | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update information with the 4-year clinical data in patients with ulcerative colitis based on the final report from study CNTO1275UCO3001 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a phase 3, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab induction and maintenance therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The RMP version 24.1 has also been updated. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce a correction to the PI. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 26/04/2023 | 15/11/2023 | SmPC        | In UNIFI, patients who completed the study through week 44 were eligible to continue treatment in a study extension. Among the 400 patients who entered on and were treated with ustekinumab every 12 or 8 weeks in the study extension, symptomatic remission was generally maintained through week 200 for patients who failed conventional therapy (but not a biologic therapy) and those who failed biologic therapy, including those who failed both anti-TNF and vedolizumab. Among patients who received 4 years of ustekinumab treatment and were assessed using the full Mayo score at maintenance week 200, 74.2% (69/93) and 68.3% (41/60) maintained mucosal healing and clinical remission, respectively.

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 27/10/2022 | 15/11/2023 | SmPC and PL | SmPC new text Ustekinumab crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients treated with ustekinumab during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, the risk of infection in infants exposed in utero to ustekinumab may be increased after birth. Administration of live vaccines (such as the BCG vaccine) to infants exposed in utero to ustekinumab is not recommended for 6 months following birth or until ustekinumab infant serum levels are undetectable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). If there is a clear clinical benefit for the individual infant, administration of a live vaccine might be considered at an earlier timepoint, if infant ustekinumab serum levels are undetectable.

A total of 61 cases of pustular psoriasis/rash pustular were identified in the SCEPTRE database. Forty (40) cases were assessed as de novo pustular psoriasis, 10 cases concerned patients with a known history of pustular psoriasis, 8 cases reported the indication of ustekinumab as some type of pustular psoriasis and the remaining 3 cases reported patients who had pustular disease when ustekinumab was initiated but did not clearly state pustular psoriasis as the indication. Therefore, 'pustular psoriasis' is added as an adverse drug reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC with category uncommon and in section 4 of the package leaflet.   |

| II/0028 | Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC regarding the need to monitor the appearance of non- melanoma skin cancer in all patients. Update of section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC regarding the lack of suppression of humoral immune response to pneumococcal polysaccharide or tetanus vaccines after long term treatment with Stelara. Exposure numbers in section 4.8 have also been updated in accordance with the 5-year safety update for studies C0743T08 and C0743T09. Section 4.9 of the SmPC has also been amended with the updated single IV dose of Stelara at which no direct toxic effect is observed. Section 2 of the package leaflet has been updated with a wording regarding the need to tell the doctor before taking Stelara in case the patient has ever had an allergic reaction to Stelara (or if the patient is not sure about it) or if the patient has any new or changing lesions within psoriasis areas or on normal skin. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. | 17/01/2013 | 19/09/2013 | SmPC and PL | Results with up to 5 years of treatment with ustekinumab in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis and updated information on potential overdosing of ustekinumab have provided additional information on safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and immunogenicity. The overall safety database has increased and no major changes in the known safety profile for Stelara have emerged. No cumulative safety signals have been seen over 5 years follow-up and the rates of AEs and SAEs are consistent with year 3 and year 4 data. With the larger safety data base, six (6) cases of melanoma (one with invasive melanoma) were identified. There is no evidence of a dose-response with ustekinumab for the development of melanoma. However, the event of melanoma has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC and will continue to be monitored. Information from the literature identified 2 patients older than 60 years of age, who developed multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) after each receiving 2 doses of ustekinumab. Therefore, a warning regarding the need to monitor all patients for the appearance of non- melanoma skin cancer has been added in the SmPC. New data has been provided on vaccination responses to tetanus and pneumococcal vaccination. The results show no |

|         | C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |            |      | impairment of antibody responses to these vaccinations in subjects who have received Stelara for at least 3.5 years. The above information has been included in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC and is considered by the CHMP to be in line with the 5-year clinical trial update and the results from the vaccine substudy. In addition the maximum dose given without safety signals is now 6mg/kg since intravenous dosing up to 6 mg/kg was evaluated in the C0743T26 Phase 2b trial of ustekinumab in Crohn's disease. Section 4.9 of the SmPC has been updated accordingly. Moreover, the exposure numbers in the SmPC have been updated in line with the 5-year clinical update for studies C0743T08 and C0743T09. Information regarding the presence of neutralizing antibodies has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC as approximately 75% of ADA positive subjects had Nab. The benefit/risk balance for Stelara in the treatment of psoriasis is positive and a further key benefit has been provided in the data for this variation; namely the demonstration that after at least 3.5 years treatment with Stelara vaccination responses to tetanus and to pneumococcus are not impaired compared with subjects   |

Additionally, it was observed that the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab from study C0743T25 (a phase 3 study in Korean and Taiwanese subjects) were generally comparable between Asian and non-Asian subjects with psoriasis, with some numerical differences in serum ustekinumab concentrations which might be attributed to cross-study comparisons, inter-subject variability, and most likely, the difference in body weight between the 2 populations. Section 5.2 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect this information.   |

| II/0007/G | This was an application for a group of variations. This application was submitted for a group of variations consisting of two Type II variations. One type II variation is to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC with information on hypersensitivity reactions further to the assessment of PSUR 1, and to update the relevant section of the PL and the educational materials accordingly. The other type II variation is to update section 4.4 of the SPC to state the lack of data on secondary transmission of live vaccines and the lack of evidence that Stelara affects allergy immunotherapy. Additionally, the MAH took this opportunity to include administrative changes in Annex IIB. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - | 22/07/2010 | 26/08/2010 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The MAH conducted a cumulative review of hypersensitivity reactions reported in clinical trials and in the post- marketing setting in which 18 cases were identified (6 from clinical trials and 12 post-marketing). The majority of non- serious cases reported rash or urticaria; three serious post- marketing cases were reported (hypersensitivity, angioedema). The CHMP concluded that a warning about the possibility of delayed hypersensitivity should be added to section 4.4 of the SPC, and that the respective adverse drug reactions should be added to section 4.8. It is in general possible that secondary transmission of live vaccine viruses from individuals vaccinated with such vaccines to contacts of the vaccine recipients occurs. There are no data available on such secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Stelara. Nevertheless the CHMP accepted the inclusion of such precautionary statement in section 4.4 of the SPC. Finally, there is a theoretical risk that that treatment of patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy could alter the protection conferred by the allergy immunotherapy based on the mechanism of action of Stelara. Although there is no evidence that Stelara may affect allergy immunotherapy, the CHMP accepted to |
