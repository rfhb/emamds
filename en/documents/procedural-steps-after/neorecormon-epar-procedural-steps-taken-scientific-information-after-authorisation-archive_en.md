| II/0083 | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC, upon request by PRAC following the assessment of PSU 047, MEA 052 and MEA 052.1, with further information regarding the potential risk of retinopathy of prematurity (RoP) with early epoetin use in prematurity. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. Further, the annexes have been aligned with the latest QRD template (version 9). C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH | 23/07/2015 | 15/07/2016 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | In preterm infants a potential risk of erythropoietin to cause retinopathy cannot be excluded, therefore caution should be exercised and the decision to treat a preterm infant should be balanced against the potential benefit and risk of this treatment and available alternative options. Prevention of anaemia of prematurity: The solution is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 x 250 IU/kg b.w. per week. Premature infants who have already been transfused by the start of treatment with NeoRecormon are not likely to benefit as much as untransfused infants. The treatment should last for 6 weeks. |

Information with respect to the results of the Cochrane meta-analysis on the effects of epoetins in cancer patients and to the occurrence of PRCA in patients with Hepatitis C treated with Interferon, Ribavirin and Epoetin should be included into the SPC.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   |            |            | epoetins compared to patients who did not receive them. Following this review, the CHMP concluded, at its June 2008 meeting, that the benefits of epoetins continue to outweigh their risks in the approved indications. However, in cancer patients with a reasonably long life-expectancy, the benefit of using epoetins does not outweigh the risk of tumour progression and shorter overall survival and therefore the Committee concluded that in these patients anaemia should be corrected with blood transfusions. The decision to administer epoetin-containing medicines should be based on an informed assessment of the benefits against the risks on individual basis, taking into account the type and stage of tumour, the degree of anaemia, the patient's life- expectancy, the environment in which the patient is being treated and patient preference. As a result, Section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the Package Leaflet are being updated to reflect these conclusions by incorporating wording requested by CHMP for inclusion for all epoetins for which a cancer indication is   |

The safety review was initiated because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in section 4.1, to highlight that epoetins should be used only if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in Section 4.4 to mention the observed negative benefit risk balance in patients treated with high target haemoglobin concentrations, and iv) in section 5.1 to include the relevant results of the trials triggering the safety review. Additional section 4.8 has also been amended to update frequency of one adverse reaction. The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further changes to the package leaflet have been made to   |
