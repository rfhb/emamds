Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted  according to Article 46 of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 11 May 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric clinical study report for Exviera/Viekirax, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Information on the development program The MAH stated that study M14-748, An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Ombitasvir (OBV), Paritaprevir (PTV), Ritonavir (RTV) With or Without Dasabuvir (DSV) and With or Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Pediatric Subjects With Genotype 1 or 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (ZIRCON), is a stand-alone study. CHMP comment The efficacy and on-treatment safety data from this study has already been assessed within procedures EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. Therefore, this assessment report is limited to the new follow-up data submitted. 2.2. Clinical aspects 2.2.1. Introduction The MAH submitted a final report for: · Study M14-748, An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Ombitasvir (OBV), Paritaprevir (PTV), Ritonavir (RTV) With or Without Dasabuvir (DSV) and With or Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Pediatric Subjects With Genotype 1 or 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (ZIRCON) 2.2.2. Clinical study Study M14-748 Description Study M14-748 is a completed Phase 2/3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of ombitasvir (OBV)/ paritaprevir (PTV)/ ritonavir (RTV) with or without dasabuvir (DSV) and with or without ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT)1 or GT4-infected pediatric subjects of ≥ 3 to 17 years of age.

## Results

## Recruitment, numbers analysed and baseline data

See EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. Efficacy results SVR24 results were consistent with the primary efficacy results with 98.4% agreement between SVR12 and SVR24; the overall SVR24 rate in the ITT population was 96.9% with a 2-sided 95% CI of 89.3% to 99.1%. No subject failed to achieve SVR24 due to virologic reasons. CHMP comment The high correlation between SVR12 and SVR24 is in line with established knowledge within the field of HCV treatment with DAAs. Safety results For on-treatment safety, see EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. Growth and Development Outcomes Height z-scores were calculated at PT visits using WHO published height-for-age z-score tables. No subject had a height z-score below -2, which would indicate evidence of stunted growth, at any visit. Mean change from baseline in height z-score across visits, sexes, and age groups ranged from -0.22 in the male, 12 to 17 year age group at PT Week 144 to 0.63 in the male, 9 to 11 year age group at PT Week 144.

Growth rate was calculated at PT visits as the change in height divided by the change in age from the previous visit. For females, mean growth rate at the Final PT Visit was 27.32 mm/year in the 12 to 17 year age group, 35.14 mm/year in the 9 to 11 year age group, and 73.73 mm/year in the 3 to 8 year age group. For males, mean growth rate at the Final PT Visit was 7.17 mm/year in the 12 to 17 year age group, 89.20 mm/year in the 9 to 11 year age group, and 58.70 mm/year in the 3 to 8 year age group. Mean change in waist circumference at the Final PT Visit was -0.491 cm in the 12 to 17 year age group. Tanner pubertal stage subject listings have been provided but not summarized by the Applicant. 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects The new data assessed within this procedure does not alter the previous conclusion in procedures EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839. 3. Rapporteur's CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation As concluded in procedures EMEA/H/C/003837 and EMEA/H/C/003839, pharmacokinetic results from this study demonstrated that weight-based pediatric doses, administered orally as tablets, for the DAAs and RTV provided generally comparable exposures across the weight groups of 15 to 29 kg, 30 to 44 kg, and ≥45 kg. Also, the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir with or without dasabuvir and with or without ribavirin in hepatitis C virus GT1 or GT4-infected pediatric subjects of ≥ 3 to 17 years of age appear comparable to that in adults. The new data assessed within this procedure does not alter the previous conclusion. Given that the Applicant does not intend to pursue a paediatric indication, no further data or clarifications are needed. The proposal to leave the SmPC unchanged is endorsed.
