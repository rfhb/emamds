## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Zegalogue 0.6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each pre-filled syringe contains 0.6 mg dasiglucagon (as hydrochloride) in 0.6 mL.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection (injection)

Clear, colorless solution, pH 6.5 and osmolality of 330-490 mOsm/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Zegalogue is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and over with diabetes mellitus.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and over

The recommended dose is 0.6 mg administered by a subcutaneous injection.

If there has been no response after 15 minutes, an additional dose of Zegalogue from a new pre-filled syringe may be administered.

## Special populations

## Elderly

Zegalogue can be used in elderly patients. No dose adjustment is required. Efficacy and safety data are very limited in patients aged 65 years and absent in patients aged 75 and above.

## Renal impairment

Zegalogue can be used in patients with renal impairment. No dose adjustment is required.

## Hepatic impairment

Zegalogue can be used in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population (&lt; 6 years)

The safety and efficacy of Zegalogue in children aged less than 6 years have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Subcutaneous use.

Zegalogue is to be injected in the lower abdomen, buttocks, thigh, or outer upper arm.

Patients and their caregivers should be instructed on the signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycaemia. As severe hypoglycaemia requires the help of others to recover, the patient should be instructed to inform those around them about Zegalogue and its package leaflet. Zegalogue should be administered as soon as possible when severe hypoglycaemia is recognised.

Patients and caregivers should be instructed on how to correctly use Zegalogue and to read the package leaflet. The following instructions should be emphasised:

Instructions for use, pre-filled syringe:

1. When administering Zegalogue pre-filled syringe, insert the needle into the skin and press the plunger fully down until the syringe is empty.
2. After the injection is given, if the person is unconscious, turn the person on their side to prevent choking.
3. After giving the dose, the caregiver should call for medical help right away.
4. If there has been no response after 15 minutes, an additional dose of Zegalogue from a new pre-filled syringe may be administered while waiting for emergency assistance.
5. When the patient has responded to treatment, give oral carbohydrate to restore liver glycogen and prevent relapse of hypoglycaemia.

Each pre-filled syringe contains a single dose of dasiglucagon and cannot be reused.

For further information before administration see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Phaeocromocytoma (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Glycogen stores and hypoglycaemia

Dasiglucagon is effective in treating hypoglycaemia only if sufficient liver glycogen is present. To prevent relapse of the hypoglycaemia, oral carbohydrates should be given to restore liver glycogen, when the patient has responded to treatment. Patients in states of starvation, with adrenal insufficiency, chronic alcohol abuse or chronic hypoglycaemia may not have adequate levels of hepatic glycogen for dasiglucagon administration to be effective. Patients with these conditions should be treated with glucose.

## Phaeocromocytoma

Glucagon stimulates the release of catecholamines. In the presence of phaeocromocytoma, glucagon products can cause the tumour to release large amounts of catecholamines, which will cause an acute hypertensive reaction. Zegalogue is contraindicated in patients with phaeochromocytoma (see section 4.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Insulinoma

In patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon medicinal products may produce an initial increase in blood glucose. However, dasiglucagon administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood glucose) stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycaemia. A patient developing symptoms of hypoglycaemia after a dose of dasiglucagon should be given glucose orally or intravenously.

## Excipients

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose (0.6 mL), that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Latex

In latex-sensitive individuals the medicinal product may cause severe allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Dasiglucagon does not inhibit CYP enzymes and drug transporters in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Insulin

Reacts antagonistically towards dasiglucagon.

## Indometacin

When used with indometacin, dasiglucagon may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may even produce hypoglycaemia.

## Warfarin

Dasiglucagon may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

## Beta-blockers

Patients taking beta-blockers might be expected to have a greater increase in both pulse and blood pressure when taking dasiglucagon, an increase of which will be transient because of the short half-life of dasiglucagon. The increase in blood pressure and pulse rate may require therapy in patients with coronary artery disease.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of dasiglucagon, a glucagon analogue, in pregnant women. The use of glucagon has been reported in pregnant women with diabetes and no harmful effects are known with respect to the course of pregnancy and the health of the unborn and the neonate.

Studies in animals with dasiglucagon have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Untreated hypoglycaemia in pregnancy can cause complications and may be fatal.

The use of Zegalogue during pregnancy should be considered only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

Dasiglucagon is cleared from the bloodstream very quickly and thus the amount excreted in the milk of nursing mothers following treatment of severe hypoglycaemic reactions is expected to be extremely small. As dasiglucagon is degraded in the digestive tract and cannot be absorbed in its intact form, it will not exert any metabolic effect in the child. Zegalogue can be used during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

Based on animal data, dasiglucagon had no effect on male or female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Zegalogue has no or neglible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia which may persist for a brief period after receiving treatment. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea (62.2%), vomiting (31.6%) and headache (9.6%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions associated with dasiglucagon obtained from clinical studies are tabulated below. Adverse reactions associated with dasiglucagon are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with injectable glucagon and reported as 'very rare' (less than 1 case per 10 000 patients) and are known medicinal class effects of glucagon.

## Paediatric population

Safety results in a limited paediatric population of 20 patients aged 7-17 years old, in a placebocontrolled trial were consistent with the safety profile in adults, except for nausea (65%) and vomiting (50%), which were less frequent in adults.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

If overdose occurs, the patient may experience nausea, vomiting, inhibition of gastro-intestinal tract motility, increase in blood pressure and pulse rate. In case of suspected overdosing, serum potassium may decrease and should be monitored and corrected if needed. If the patient develops a dramatic increase in blood pressure, use of nonselective α -adrenergic blockade has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure for the short time that control would be needed.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Pancreatic hormones, glycogenolytic hormones, ATC code: H04AA02.

## Mechanism of action

Dasiglucagon is a glucagon receptor agonist analogue, which increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby stimulating glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are necessary for dasiglucagon to produce an antihypoglycaemic effect (see section 4.4).

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Gender and injection site had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacodynamics of dasiglucagon.

After administration of dasiglucagon in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (Trial 16137), the time course of glucose is shown, with a mean glucose increase from baseline to 90 minutes of 9.3 mmol/L (168 mg/dL) (Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 Mean plasma glucose over time in adults with type 1 diabetes administered 0.6 mg dasiglucagon in Trial 16137

<!-- image -->

In paediatric patients (7 to 17 years) with type 1 diabetes (Trial 17086), the time course of glucose is shown for children and adolescents, with a mean glucose increase at 60 minutes after administration of dasiglucagon of 9.0 mmol/L (162 mg/dL) (Figure 2).

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were uncommonly detected. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed, however, data are still limited.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials were conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes. Two trials (Trial 16137 and Trial 17145) were conducted in adult patients, and one trial (Trial 17086) was conducted in paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years. In all 3 trials, patients were randomised to dasiglucagon 0.6 mg, placebo, or (in Trials 16137 and 17086) glucagon for injection 1.0 mg. Dasiglucagon and the comparators were administered as single subcutaneous injections following a controlled induction of hypoglycaemia using intravenous administration of insulin. During this procedure, a plasma glucose concentration of &lt; 60 mg/dL was targeted in Trials 16137 and 17145, whereas the target was &lt; 80 mg/dL in Trial 17086. The primary efficacy endpoint for all 3 trials was time to plasma glucose recovery (treatment success), defined as an increase in blood glucose of ≥ 20 mg/dL from time of administration, without additional intervention within 45 minutes. The primary hypothesis test was superiority of dasiglucagon versus placebo. There was no formal hypothesis test of dasiglucagon versus glucagon for injection.

Trial 16137 randomised a total of 170 patients 2:1:1 to dasiglucagon, placebo, and glucagon for injection. The mean age of the patients was 39.1 years (96% were &lt; 65 years), and the mean duration of diabetes was 20.0 years; 63% were male; 92% were White. The mean baseline plasma glucose was 58.8 mg/dL. The median time to plasma glucose recovery was statistically significantly shorter for dasiglucagon (10 minutes) versus placebo (40 minutes) (Table 2). The median time to plasma glucose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recovery was numerically similar between dasiglucagon (10 minutes) and glucagon for injection (12 minutes).

Trial 17145 randomised a total of 45 patients 3:1 to dasiglucagon and placebo. The mean age of the patients was 41.0 years (95% were &lt; 65 years), and the mean duration of diabetes was 22.5 years; 57% were male; 93% were White. The mean baseline plasma glucose was 55.0 mg/dL. The median time to plasma glucose recovery was statistically significantly shorter for dasiglucagon (10 minutes) versus placebo (35 minutes) (Table 2).

## Paediatric population

Trial 17086 randomised a total of 42 patients 2:1:1 to dasiglucagon, placebo, and glucagon for injection. Patients were stratified by age (6-11 years and 12-17 years). The mean age of the patients was 12.5 years (range 7 to 17 years), and the mean duration of diabetes was 5.9 years; 56% were male; 95% were White. The mean baseline plasma glucose was 72.0 mg/dL. The median time to plasma glucose recovery was statistically significantly shorter for dasiglucagon (10 minutes) versus placebo (30 minutes) (Table 3). The median time to plasma glucose recovery was numerically similar between dasiglucagon (10 minutes) and glucagon for injection (10 minutes).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Zegalogue in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Dasiglucagon absorption following subcutaneous injection of 0.6 mg in adults resulted in a mean peak plasma concentration of 1 510 pmol/L at around 35 minutes.

## Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution was 47 L to 57 L following subcutaneous administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

Metabolism data indicated that dasiglucagon is cleared like native glucagon through proteolytic degradation pathways in blood, liver, and kidney.

## Elimination

The half-life of dasiglucagon was approximately 30 minutes.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal studies have been performed to evaluate hepatic impairment.

## Paediatric population

Data from one trial (Trial 17086) conducted in paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years with type 1 diabetes showed that after administration of dasiglucagon, the mean peak plasma concentration of 1 160 pmol/L occurred at around 21 minutes.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

In rats administered subcutaneously daily with dasiglucagon for 12 days, maternal toxicity, in terms of decreased body weight gain, lower fetal body weight, and delayed bone ossification, was observed at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day (≥ 475 times the human dose based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC)).

In rabbits administered subcutaneously daily with dasiglucagon for 14 days, lower fetal body weight and delayed bone ossification were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (100 times the human dose based on AUC), a dose that also induced maternal toxicity in terms of decreased body weight gain. At ≥ 0.3 mg/kg/day (≥ 20 times the human dose based on AUC), dasiglucagon caused fetal skeletal and visceral malformations with no maternal toxicity observed.

## 1. What Zegalogue is and what it is used for

## What Zegalogue is

Zegalogue contains the active substance dasiglucagon. This belongs to a group of medicines called 'glycogenolytic hormones'.

Zegalogue is used in adults and children aged 6 years or older with diabetes mellitus to treat very low blood sugar (severe hypoglycaemia).

The body uses glucagon, a natural hormone produced by the pancreas, to help release sugar into the blood stream so the body can use it. In people with diabetes, the body sometimes does not release enough glucagon when blood sugar levels decrease and this may lead to hypoglycaemia. The active substance in Zegalogue, dasiglucagon, works in a similar way to glucagon. It helps to convert a form of sugar stored in the liver (called glycogen) into the simple sugar molecules (called glucose) the body can use for energy. Glucose is then released into the blood stream, which makes the blood sugar level rise and reduces the effects of low blood sugar.

## Information on hypoglycaemia

Early symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) include:

- sweating
- drowsiness
- dizziness
- sleep disturbances
- palpitation
- anxiety
- tremor
- blurred vision
- hunger

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- headache
- slurred speech
- depressed mood
- tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue
- irritability
- light-headedness
- abnormal behaviour
- inability to concentrate
- unsteady movement
- personality changes.

And if not treated, the patient may progress to very low blood sugar (severe hypoglycaemia) which can include:

- confusion
- seizures
- unconsciousness
- death.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Zegalogue

## Important information

Always have Zegalogue with or near you. A delay in treatment may be harmful to you.

Show your family members, friends or people you work with where you keep this medicine. Also explain to them when and how to use it. It is important they know how to use Zegalogue before you need it.

## Do not use Zegalogue if

- you are allergic to dasiglucagon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- you have phaeochromocytoma (a tumour in your adrenal gland which causes it to make too much adrenaline).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Zegalogue.

Zegalogue may not work properly if:

- you have been fasting or have had low blood sugar levels for a long time.
- you have adrenal insufficiency (a rare disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough of certain hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone).
- you have low blood sugar caused by drinking too much alcohol.
- you have insulinoma (a tumour in the pancreas that releases glucagon or insulin into your blood).

If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse, before using Zegalogue.

After using Zegalogue, eat as soon as possible. This is to prevent low blood sugar happening again. Take a fast-acting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugary drink.

## Children

Zegalogue is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. This is because it has not been studied in this age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Zegalogue

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

The following medicines may decrease the effectiveness of Zegalogue:

- Insulin - used to treat diabetes. Insulin has the opposite effect of glucagon on blood sugar.
- Indometacin - used to treat joint pain and stiffness.

Zegalogue may increase the risk of side effects of the following medicines:

- Warfarin - used to prevent blood clots. Zegalogue may increase the blood-thinning effect of warfarin.
- Beta-blockers - used to treat high blood pressure and uneven heartbeat. Zegalogue may increase your blood pressure and pulse. This will only last a short time.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zegalogue.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, your doctor will consider the benefit and risk of using Zegalogue for you and your baby.

Zegalogue can be used during breast-feeding.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

## Driving and using tools and machines

Do not drive or use any tools or machines when your blood sugar levels are very low. After taking Zegalogue, wait until your blood sugar levels are back to normal and you no longer experience the effects of very low blood sugar.

## Zegalogue contains sodium

Zegalogue contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Latex

The container of this medicine contains latex rubber which may cause severe allergic reactions.

## 3. How to give Zegalogue

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with them if you are not sure.

Explain how to use Zegalogue and show where you keep it to your family, friends, co-workers or caregiver. They will need to know how to give you this medicine without delay when you need it.

## How Zegalogue is given

Zegalogue is given as an injection under the skin (sub-cutaneous injection) which contains a dose of 0.6 mg. If there has been no response after 15 minutes of giving the first injection, another injection of Zegalogue may be given.

After using Zegalogue, eat as soon as possible. This is to prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too low again. Take a fast-acting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugary drink.

Detailed instructions on how to use Zegalogue are provided at the end of this leaflet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>
