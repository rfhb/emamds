## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) (JCOVDEN), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on facial paralysis (including Bell's palsy) from clinical trial(s) and spontaneous reports including cases with a close temporal relationship and no other alternative explanation, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between 'COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) (JCOVDEN) and facial paralysis (including Bell's palsy) is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 'COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) (JCOVDEN) should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) (JCOVDEN) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) (JCOVDEN) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
