## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 7 October 2016 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Gazyvaro in combination with chemotherapy, followed by Gazyvaro maintenance therapy in patients achieving a response, for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and the RMP are updated in accordance. In addition, the due date for provision of the final clinical study report of study BO21223/GALLIUM listed in the Gazyvaro RMP as Category 3 has been updated. Furthermore, the Annex II is brought in line with the latest QRD template (version 10). In addition, clarification or editorial changes to the SmPC are proposed for accuracy and clarity.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Gazyvaro, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/1054 on 10 October 2012 and EU/3/15/1504 on 19 June 2015. Gazyvaro was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and Treatment of follicular lymphoma.

The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan designation.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) EMEA-33-2010 on the granting of a class waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH request for additional market protection

The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication.

## Protocol assistance

The applicant did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP.

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

The benefit of adding rituximab to combination chemotherapy during the initial treatment of advanced NHL has been documented in multiple clinical trials over the past decade.

Efficacy and safety results of the pivotal, randomized, open-label, Phase III study BO21223 (GALLIUM) in  patients  with  previously  untreated  advanced  indolent  non  -Hodgkin  lymphoma  NHL  compare obinutuzumab to established treatment with rituximab.

## 2.1.2. Disease or condition

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) includes all types of malignant lymphomas except from Hodgkin's disease. These include a heterogeneous group of malignancies, ranging from slow-growing iNHL, which comprise about a third of all NHLs, to more aggressive forms of NHL. The main subtypes of iNHL are follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphomas, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Follicular lymphomas are indolent (slow-growing) NHL and the second-most-common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas overall.

## 2.1.3. Epidemiology , Aetiology and pathogenesis

Follicular lymphomas (FLs) are the second most frequent subtype of nodal lymphoid malignancies in Western Europe. The annual incidence of this disease in the EU has rapidly increased during recent decades and has risen from 2-3/100 000 during the 1950s to 5/100 000 recently [1], representing approximately  22%  of  all  NHLs  and  70%  of  indolent  NHL.  Marginal  zone  lymphomas  account  for approximately 5-10% of NHL cases.

## 2.1.4. Biologic features and risk factors, screening tools/prevention

NHL is distinguished from Hodgkin's disease only by the absence of binucleate giant cells. Follicular lymphomas are indolent (slow-growing) NHL and the second-most-common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas overall, defined as a lymphoma of follicle center B-cells (centrocytes and centroblasts), which has at least a partially follicular pattern. It is positive for the B-cell markers CD10, CD19, CD22, and usually CD20, but almost always negative for CD5.

Follicular  lymphoma is  defined  as  a  mature  B-cell  neoplasm  in  the  2008  World  Health  Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Follicular lymphoma cells are malignant counterparts of normal germinal center B cells. Approximately 85% of patients with FL have a  genomic  translocation  t(14;18)(q32;q21),  [2]  which  results  in  the  overexpression  of  the  BCL-2 protein, a member of a family of proteins that blocks programmed cell death or apoptosis.

## 2.1.5. Clinical presentation and diagnosis and stage/prognosis

Diagnosis should be based on a surgical specimen/excisional lymph node biopsy and in the cases without easily accessible lymph nodes core biopsies can be carried. Fine needle aspirations are inappropriate for a reliable diagnosis. The histological report should give the diagnosis according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Grading of lymph node biopsies is carried out

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

according to the number of blasts/high-power field (Table 1). FL grade 3B (with sheets of blasts) is considered an aggressive lymphoma and treated as such, whereas grade 1, 2 and 3A should be treated as indolent disease [3]. Review, especially of grade 3A or 3B, by an expert haematopathologist is performed if the infiltration pattern is atypical (diffuse areas, even with small cells).

Since treatment largely depends on the stage of the disease, initial staging should be thorough, particularly in the small proportion of patients with early stages I and II (10%-15%) including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis, and a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy; Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT is particularly important to confirm localised stage I/II before involved-field radiotherapy.

A complete blood count, routine blood chemistry including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), β2 microglobulin and uric acid as well as screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C are required. The staging is carried out according to the Ann Arbor classification system with mention of bulky disease (&gt;7 cm) when appropriate.

For prognostic purposes, a 'Follicular Lymphoma-specific International Prognostic Index' (FLIPI, see Table 1) has been established [4]. A revised FLIPI 2 (incorporating β2 microglobulin, diameter of largest lymph node, bone marrow involvement and haemoglobin level) has been suggested for patients requiring treatment which may be more informative on progression-free survival (PFS) [5].

## 2.1.6. Management

Current  treatment  options  for  patients  with  previously  untreated  advanced  follicular  lymphoma according  to  recommendations  for  initial  treatment  of  follicular  lymphoma  in  ESMO  and  NCCN guidelines,  treatment  options  for  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  FL  include  'watch  and  wait', radiotherapy, and systemic treatments.

Systematic treatments include chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP, R-CVP, R-benda) and in selected cases (elderly/infirm patients) rituximab monotherapy (or R-chlorambucil for elderly patients). For patients who achieve response (CR/PR) rituximab maintenance is indicated.

## About the product

Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA ® , GAZYVARO ® ; also known as GA101 and RO5072759) is a glycoengineered, humanized Type II CD20 monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype. It consists of two heavy chains and two light chains with inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds, as is typical of IgG1 antibodies. Obinutuzumab was derived by humanization of the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and is produced in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) K1 cell line. It has been glycoengineered to improve a number of characteristics compared with the anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab. The calculated molecular mass of intact obinutuzumab is 146,321 Da (peptide chains only, with heavy chain C-terminal lysine residue and heavy chain N-terminal glutamines).

Obinutuzumab recognizes a type II epitope of the CD20 molecule found on B cells. It has high-affinity binding to the CD20 antigen, low complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity, high direct cell death  induction  and  high  antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  and  antibody-dependent cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP).  Based  on  these  features  and  nonclinical  studies,  obinutuzumab  was expected to have improved efficacy with similar toxicity to rituximab, which is an established treatment for  patients  with  B-cell  malignancies,  including  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL),  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and other B-cell disorders.

Obinutuzumab was first approved for use in combination with chlorambucil in the first-line treatment of patients with CLL in the United States (US) (November 2013), the European Union (EU) (July 2014) and many other countries based on the results of the pivotal Phase III trial, study BO21004 (CLL-11). Obinutuzumab was later approved for use in combination with bendamustine in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who did not respond to a rituximab-containing regimen, in the US (February 2016) and in the EU (June 2016), based on the results of the pivotal Phase III trial, GAO4753g (GADOLIN).

This  application  is  seeking  approval  of  an  additional  indication  for  obinutuzumab  in  patients  with previously untreated FL based on the results of the pivotal Phase III trial, BO21223 (GALLIUM). The proposed indication is as follows:

'Gazyvaro in combination with chemotherapy, followed by Gazyvaro maintenance therapy in patients achieving a response, is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma.'

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The  primary  and  secondary  pharmacology  of  obinutuzumab  and  chemotherapy  drugs  has  been previously investigated.

## Population Pharmacokinetics

Population PK model (Report 1072889):

Analysis objectives:

- -To  update  a  previously  developed  population  model  [Report  No.  1065581]  that  describes pharmacokinetics  of  obinutuzumab  following  intravenous  administration  in  patients  with CD20+ B-cells malignancies.
- -To re-estimate population PK parameters of the model
- -To  determine  post-hoc  estimates  for  derived  PK  parameters  (steady-state  AUCτ,  Cmax, Ctrough, terminal half-life and effective half-life)
- -To re-estimate the inter-individual variability of model parameters in the patient population
- -To re-estimate the residual variability of the dependent variable (obinutuzumab concentration) in the patient population
- -To confirm and re-estimate the effects of previously identified covariate factors that influence disposition of obinutuzumab, and to estimate the effects of new covariates
- -To determine whether the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) affects pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab following intravenous administration in patients with CD20+ B-cells malignancies
- -To perform model-based simulations of clinically relevant dosing regimens.

The analyzed dataset:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The population PK model was previously built using data from studies BO20999, BO21000, BO21003, BO21004,  GAO4753g,  and  GAO4915g.  These  data  included  16301  serum  concentration  values  of obinutuzumab from a total of 961 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), FL (406 patients), MZL  (35  patients),  other  indolent  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (iNHL)  subtypes,  diffuse  large  B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The current population PK analysis added the data from study BO21223 (7550 concentration values from a total of 493 patients with FL [408], MZL [84], and CLL [1]) to the previous data set, thus including a total of 23,851.

## Model characteristics:

The  PK  model  comprises  two  clearance  pathways:  a  linear  clearance  and  a  nonlinear  time  varying clearance pathway (target mediated drug disposition: TMDD). This model was applied to the data and the  model  parameters  were  re-estimated  consecutively  to  the  inclusion  of  the  data  from  study BO21223. The estimated parameters are reported below (Table 4) as well as the parameters of the prior model (table 14) for analysis and comparison purpose.

## Systemic exposure to obinutuzumab predictions:

The model was used for the predictions of systemic exposure to obinutuzumab in the target population but also in MZL patients when co-treated with chemotherapy (CHOP or CVP) and obinutuzumab 21-day cycles (during the induction phase) or with bendamustine and obinutuzumab 28 day cycles.

Table 7: Summary of conditional predictions for Cmax, Ctrough and AUC following G-CHOP/CVP dosing regimen, by iNHL subtype

The covariate factors and patients' individual random effects were used to compute PK parameters in each group following G-CHOP/CVP dosing regimen (10o0 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, and on Day 1 of cycles 2-8, cycle duration 21 days; then every 8 weeks). Residual variability was not included in the simulations. CV was computed as standard deviation of the log-transformed data. MZL: marginal zone lymphoma; FL: follicular lymphoma

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

The mechanism of action as well as the primary and secondary pharmacology of obinutuzumab and chemotherapy drugs has been previously investigated.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

As part of the study BO21223, B-cells counts and tumor size were measured in patients with FL and MZL. A PK-PD modelling has been attempted by the applicant in order to assess the relationship these PD endpoints and the systemic exposure. The PPK model described above was used in order to estimate the systemic exposure to obinutuzumab.

Relationship between obinutuzumab exposure and time course of B-cell counts:

The graphical analysis performed to assess the relationship between the observed values of B-cell counts and obinutuzumab exposure (Cmean) indicated that in all exposure groups B-cell counts declined from their baseline values to nearly zero after start of drug administration. B-cells remained

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

at very low levels for most patients (for majority of patients at BLQ levels) for most of the observation period (Figure 3).

A graphical analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the change in tumor size and obinutuzumab  exposure  (Figure  198).  Tumor  size  decreased  during  Induction  from  a  median  of approximately 5000 mm 2  to 500 mm 2  with a slow additional decrease during Maintenance. Change in tumor size was similar in all exposure categories.

Reduction  in  tumor  size  is  observed  in  all  Cmean  groups.  However,  no  optimal  target  mean concentration could be defined.

In  the  submitted  PopPK  report  (September  2016),  ADAs  were  detected  in  29  patients  from  study BO21223 (5.8%). By comparison, ADAs were detected in 17 patients (5.5%) from study BO21004, 2 patients (2%) from study GAO4915g, 1 patient (0.5%) from study GAO4753g. All ADAs detected in Study BO21223 were detected prior to initiation of obinutuzumab treatment only. In an update, 1/565 patient (0.2% of patients with a post-baseline assessment) developed HAHA at induction completion. While the clinical significance of HAHA is not known, a potential correlation between HAHA and clinical course cannot be ruled out. Patients with detected ADAs had higher initial time-dependent clearance and a higher rate of decline of this clearance, but the same time-independent clearance as patients without ADAs, indicating a transient effect of ADAs on obinutuzumab concentrations only.

The rate of ADAs observed in study BO21223 is comparable to that observed in previous studies. ADAs do  not  exhibit  a  neutralizing  activity  as  obinutuzumab  PKs  appears  to  have  no  clinically  impact  on systemic exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Obinutuzumab is currently approved in patients with CLL in combination with chlorambucil non eligible to full-dose fludarabine and in patients with FL in combination with bendamustine who did not respond to rituximab or rituximab-containing regimen. In the current variation the applicant seeks the use of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP or bendamustine) in previously untreated patients with FL.

The claimed induction dosing scheme for the pursued new indication is slightly different from that currently approved. Indeed, when administered with CHOP or CVP shorter administration cycles are to be followed (eight 21-day cycles instead of six 28-day cycles). Consequently, the total dose of obinutuzumab in the induction phase is higher (8000 mg versus 6000) for patients treated with CHOP or CVP in the new indication.

The pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab has been characterized using non compartmental analysis (NCA) in early studies but also and mainly through a population-PK approach (PPK) using all available, consisting mostly in sparse data collected during clinical studies.

Study BO21223 is pivotal for the claimed indication. The study included PK sampling (approximately 23 samples per obinutuzumab-treated patient) from a planned sample of 460 patients with FL or MZL who received obinutuzumab. The obinutuzumab PK data from Study BO21223 were added to the population PK dataset and the population PK model was updated. The presence of ADAs was also analyzed in all patients receiving obinutuzumab. Therefore, the previously developed PPK model was updated by the inclusion of data collected in study BO21223. The PPK model was refined and the model parameters were re-estimated. This update is provided by the applicant in report 1072889 and analyzed below.

The current population PK model of obinutuzumab (with the inclusion of data from BO21223) was consistent with a previously developed model in patients with CLL, FL, other iNHL subtypes, DLBCL, and MCL. The model confirmed the influence of previously identified covariates (body weight, sex, tumor size and serum albumin at baseline, disease types [CLL, FL/DLBCL, MCL], iNHL subtypes [SLL], and concomitant chemotherapies [CHOP, CVP, bendamustine, FC]). The PK model also better quantified the influence of a MZL diagnosis compared to FL, with a slightly higher time-dependent clearance and a similar linear clearance. Doxorubicin (administered as part of CHOP regimen) had no influence on obinutuzumab PK.

As typical for mAbs, obinutuzumab exposure is lower in patients with high body weight (following Q3W regimen, mean AUCτ and Ctrough at Cycle 8 of induction and Cycle 4 of maintenance is 31-39% higher for WT &lt; 60 kg and 28% - 37% lower for WT &gt;90 kg compared to patients weighting 60 - 90 kg), and is also lower in male patients (31%-43% lower in male FL patients compared to females). As most of the targeted agents, obinutuzumab exposure depends on tumor burden and therefore decreases in patients with high tumor size at baseline (following Q3W regimen in FL patients, mean AUCτ and Ctrough at Cycle 8 of induction and Cycle 4 of maintenance is 5% -7% higher for BSIZ &lt; 2777 mm 2 and 1% - 2% lower for BSIZ &gt;8998 mm 2 , compared to BSIZ of 2777 - 8998 mm 2 ).

The approach used by the applicant to characterize the PKs of obinutuzumab in the new target population (untreated patients with FL) and according to claimed dosing scheme could be considered acceptable. As expected, higher systemic exposure to obinutuzumab is observed in patients treated with bendamustine and obinutuzumab every 21 days comparatively to those receiving other chemotherapy (CHOP or CVP) and obinutuzumab every 28 days. The systemic exposure appears to be approximately proportional to the dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Body weight appears to be the most determinant factor for systemic exposure. For instance, systemic exposure in FL patients is estimated to be approximately doubled in patients weighing less than 60 Kg comparatively to those weighing more than 90 kg. In order to explore the the adequacy of the proposed dosing scheme PFS was compared in normal weighted (BMI  30 mg/m 2  ) and in obese patients (BMI  30 mg/m 2  and body weight  90 kg or  90 kg), and no significant difference was observed (see discussion on clinical efficacy) thus  confirming the fixed dose/regimen of obinutuzumab.

Even though tumor size was identified as a significant covariate in the final model, the influence of tumor size on the systemic exposure to obinutuzumab remains limited.

The influence of obinutuzumab on the PKs of the co-administered chemotherapies has not been formally investigated, however it is generally accepted -due to the nature of obinutuzumab- that any significant impact of on the PKs of concomitant chemotherapies is unlikely (See discussion on clinical safety).

The PKs of obinutuzumab is adequately elucidated in the new group of patients (untreated patients with FL) treated with the claimed dosing scheme. The concentration time-course of obinutuzumab is accurately described by a two-compartment PK model with both time-dependant and time-independent clearance components (TMDD). The prior model was refined by the inclusion of the data collected in the pivotal study BO21223.

Since obinutuzumab is given more frequently when combined with CHOP/CVP (every 21 days), higher obinutuzumab systemic exposure is observed compared to when obinutuzumab is given in combination with bendamustine (every 28 days). The systemic exposure appears to be approximately proportional to the dose.

The influence of obinutuzumab on the PKs of the co-administered chemotherapies has not been formally investigated. But it could be agreed that significant impact of obinutuzumab on the PKs of the drugs used in chemotherapies is unlikely.

No relationship between obinutuzumab exposure and time course of B-cell counts was established. The relationship between the observed values of B-cell counts and obinutuzumab exposure (Cmean) indicated that in all exposure groups B-cell counts declined from their baseline values to nearly zero after start of drug administration. B-cells remained at very low levels for most patients.

The rate of ADAs observed in study BO21223 is comparable to that observed in previous studies. ADAs do not exhibit a neutralizing activity as obinutuzumab PKs appears to have no clinically impact on systemic exposure (See discussion on clinical safety).

## Methods

## Study participants

Adult patients with previously untreated indolent NHL were eligible for the study.

## Inclusion Criteria:

Patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for the study entry:

-  Histologically  documented,  CD20-positive,  indolent  B-cell  NHL  consisting  of  one  of  the following: FL (Grades 1-3a), splenic MZL, nodal MZL, or extranodal MZL

Tissue  diagnostic  procedures  had  to  be performed within  12  months  prior  to  randomization. Biopsy material from an excisional or core biopsy had to be submitted for retrospective central confirmation. Tissue samples dated &gt;12 months prior to randomization were accepted only if tissue material was available for retrospective confirmation, if there was no clinical indication for transformation of disease, and if the request for additional biopsy was unethical treatment of the patient. Bone marrow alone was not suitable to make the diagnosis of FL.

Approximately 200 patients with MZL (splenic, nodal, or extranodal) were to be randomized. After reaching the cap of 200, recruitment of patients with MZL was stopped.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with splenic MZL without splenic tissue available for histologic review, the diagnosis could be confirmed by the presence of splenomegaly and typical morphologic and immunophenotypic findings in the blood and bone marrow.

Bone marrow had to be submitted for retrospective central confirmation.

-  Stage III or IV disease or Stage II bulky disease
- o Bulky disease is defined as a tumor diameter of ≥ 7 cm.
-  For  patients  with  FL:  requirement  for  treatment,  defined  as  meeting  at  least  one  of  the following criteria:
- o Bulky disease, defined as a nodal or extranodal (except spleen) mass ≥ 7 cm in the greatest diameter
- o Local  symptoms  or  compromise  of  normal  organ  function  due  to  progressive  nodal disease or extranodal tumor mass
- o Presence of B symptoms (fever, drenching night sweats, or unintentional weight loss of &gt; 10% of normal body weight over a period of 6 months or less)
- o Presence of symptomatic extranodal disease (e.g., pleural effusions, peritoneal ascites)
- o Cytopenias due to underlying lymphoma (i.e., absolute neutrophil count 1.0 x 10 9 /L, haemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL, and/or platelet count &gt; 100 x 10 9 /L)
- o Involvement of ≥ 3 nodal sites, each with a diameter of ≥ 3 cm
- o Symptomatic splenic enlargement
-  For patients with symptomatic splenic, nodal, or non-gastric extranodal MZL:
- o disease  that  was  de  novo  or  had  relapsed  following  local  therapy  (i.e.,  surgery  or radiotherapy) and required therapy, as assessed by the investigator
-  For  patients  with  symptomatic  gastric  extranodal  MZL:  Helicobacter  pylori-negative  disease that was de novo or had relapsed following local therapy (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy) and required therapy, as assessed by the investigator, or H. pylori-positive disease that remained stable, progressed, or relapsed following antibiotic therapy and required therapy, as assessed by  the  investigator  (see  Appendix  G  of  the  protocol  for  additional  details  regarding  gastric extranodal MZL)
-  At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (&gt; 2 cm in its largest dimension by CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI])

In patients with splenic MZL, an enlarged spleen on CT scan or extending at least 2 cm below the  costal  margin  by  physical  examination  constituted measurable  disease providing that  no explanation  other  than  lymphomatous  involvement  was  likely.  For  an  enlarged  liver  to constitute the only measurable disease parameter, a liver biopsy showing proof of NHL in the liver was required.

-  Able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply with the study protocol
-  Age ≥ 18 years
-  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 (see Appendix H of the protocol)
-  Adequate hematologic function (unless abnormalities are related to NHL), defined as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL
- o Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10 9 /L
- o Platelet count ≥ 75 x 10 9 /L
-  For men who were not surgically sterile: agreement to use a barrier method of contraception during the treatment phase and for at least 3 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab and rituximab or bendamustine or according to institutional guidelines for CHOP  or  CVP chemotherapy, whichever is longer.  In  addition,  male  patients  had  to  agree  to  request  that their  partners  use  an  additional  method  of  contraception,  such  as  oral  contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method of contraception, or spermicidal gel.
-  For  women of  reproductive  potential  who  were  not  surgically  sterile:  agreement  to  use  two adequate methods of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, or barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly during the treatment period and for at least 12 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab or rituximab, for at least 3 months after  the  last  dose of  bendamustine or according to institutional guidelines for CHOP or CVP chemotherapy, whichever is longer.

It was recommended to stop MTX 2-3  weeks  prior  to  starting  immunochemotherapy  since  the  combination  of  MTX  and immunochemotherapy increases the risk of immunosuppression and of infection

-  For patients with non-follicular lymphoma: prior treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy
-  Regular treatment with corticosteroids during the 4 weeks prior to the start of Cycle 1, unless administered for indications other than NHL at a dose equivalent to ≤ 30 mg/day prednisone

Patients receiving corticosteroid treatment with ≤ 30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent had to be documented to be on a stable dose of at least 4 weeks' duration prior to randomization.

If  glucocorticoid  treatment  was  urgently  required  for  medical  reasons  (e.g.,  complications imminent if not treated at least with glucocorticoids; strong discomfort/pain of the patient due

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to lymphoma), prednisone 100 mg or equivalent could be given for a maximum of 5 sequential days,  but  all  tumor  assessments  had  to  be  completed  prior  to  the  start  of  glucocorticoid treatment.

Glucocorticoid treatment had to be stopped prior to randomization.

In cases when  a  glucocorticoid  pre-treatment/pre-phase was  done  externally prior to considering the patient for study inclusion, glucocorticoids had to be stopped for at least 7 days before screening assessments can begin.

Bendamustine was administered on Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 1-6, with prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone also administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Patients randomized  to  receive  R-chemo  who  achieved  a  CR  or  PR  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy continued to receive R-maintenance at 375 mg/m 2  every 2 months until disease progression, or for 2 years.

## Obinutuzumab

In the G-chemo arm, eight to ten doses of obinutuzumab at 1000 mg were administered by IV infusion with the accompanying chemotherapy regimen during induction. More details are provided in Section 4.3.2 of the protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  G-CHOP: Obinutuzumab was administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6(21-day cycles). CHOP was administered on Day 1, with prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone also administered on Days1-5 of Cycles 1-6.
-  G-CVP: Obinutuzumab was administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2-8 (21-day cycles). CVP was administered on Day 1, with prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone also administered on Days1-5 of Cycles 1-8.

CVP  was  administered  according  to  the  standard  preparation  and  infusion procedures of each investigational site.

## Bendamustine

A total of six 28-day cycles of bendamustine was administered. If bendamustine was discontinued for any reason other than toxicity, patients were to be discontinued from study treatment and entered follow-up directly without maintenance.

## Premedication

All rituximab or obinutuzumab infusions were administered after premedication with oral acetaminophen/paracetamol and an antihistamine. Patients who were considered to have a high tumor burden and who were considered at risk for tumor lysis by the investigator also received tumor lysis prophylaxis prior to the initiation of treatment.

Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and bendamustine  have  a moderate  risk of emesis. It  was recommended that infusions be administered following premedication with a serotonin antagonist or per institutional practice.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study was:

-  To evaluate the efficacy of  obinutuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  (G-chemo)  followed  by obinutuzumab maintenance (G-maintenance) therapy compared with rituximab plus chemotherapy  (R-chemo)  followed  by  rituximab  maintenance  (R-maintenance)  therapy  in patients with previously untreated advanced FL, as measured by investigator-assessed PFS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following secondary objective applied to patients with previously untreated advanced indolent NHL (i.e., overall population):

-  To evaluate and compare investigator-assessed PFS between the two arms

The  following  secondary  objectives  applied  to  patients  with  previously  untreated  advanced  indolent NHL (i.e., overall population) and to the subset of patients with previously untreated advanced FL (i.e., follicular population):

-  To  evaluate  and  compare  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC)-assessed  PFS  between  the two arms. In the US, IRC-assessed PFS will be the basis of regulatory decisions.
-  To evaluate and compare overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) after the end of induction treatment, as assessed by the investigator, between the two arms, with and without 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
-  To evaluate and compare OR and CR after the end of induction treatment, as assessed by the IRC, between the two arms, with and without FDG-PET
-  To evaluate and compare overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS),  duration  of  response  (DOR),  and  time  to  next  anti-lymphoma  treatment  (TTNLT) between the two arms

EFS, DFS, and DOR are based on investigator assessment.

-  To  evaluate  and  compare  the  safety  profiles  between  the  two  arms  during  induction  and maintenance
-  To  assess  patient-reported  outcomes  (PROs)  in  both  arms.  HRQoL  was  assessed  using  two self-administered validated questionnaires, FACT-Lym and EuroQol EQ-5D-3L.

The exploratory objectives for this study were as follows:

-  To evaluate and compare the proportion of patients who transformed to aggressive histology at first relapse between the two arms
-  To evaluate the proportion of patients with a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the  end  of  induction  treatment  who  converted  to  CR  or  to  PR/CR,  respectively,  during maintenance treatment or post-induction observation, as assessed by the investigator
-  To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy
-  To compare the efficacy of obinutuzumab versus rituximab within each chemotherapy subset
-  To assess the prognostic and predictive ability of baseline clinical factors, which may include activities  of  daily  living  (ADLs),  instrumental  activities  of  daily  living  (IADLs),  Follicular Lymphoma  International  Prognostic  Index  2  (FLIPI2)  score,  International  Prognostic  Index (IPI) score, and FDG-PET imaging
-  To assess the prognostic and predictive ability of biomarkers (such as Fc  receptor polymorphisms) pertaining to the biology of FL and factors relating to the host immune system (such as immunohistochemistry [IHC] and gene expression assessment of specific targets or gene profiles) To assess the prognostic and predictive value of BCL2/IgH rearrangement and other  markers  of  minimum  residual  disease  (MRD)  in  patients  with  FL  at  baseline,  during induction, at the completion of induction therapy, during maintenance therapy or observation,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and during follow-up (IgH clonality could be used as a marker of MRD in patients without an identifiable BCL2/IgH translocation at baseline)

-  To correlate FDG-PET results with efficacy parameters
-  A dedicated analysis to adequately assess PFS in the MZL subcohort was performed
-  To identify and characterize changes in tumor gene expression and cell surface markers that occur  in  patients  who  have  relapsed  and/or  transformed  after  initial  treatment  with  a rituximab- or obinutuzumab-containing regimen.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

Progression free survival (PFS) is the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. PFS is defined as time from  the  day  of  randomization  until  the  first  documented  day  of  disease  progression,  symptomatic deterioration, disease transformation, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients who did not experience documented disease progression or death were censored at the last valid (SD, PR, CR) tumor assessment prior to the clinical cut-off date.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

Secondary efficacy endpoints were EFS, TTNLT, DFS, and DOR and additionally  - on account of the primary  endpoint  crossing  the  pre-specified  boundary-  key  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  in hierarchical order by the fixed sequence testing procedure.

-  CR  rate  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy  in  the  FL  population  based  on  tumor  assessment without PET
-  CR rate at the end of induction therapy in the overall population based on tumor assessment without PET
-  Overall survival in the FL population; Overall survival in the overall population

OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. OS for patients who were not reported to have died at the time of the analysis were censored at the date when they were last known to be alive as documented by the investigator.

-  ORR at the end of induction therapy in the FL population based on tumor assessment without PET
-  ORR at  the  end  of  induction  therapy  in  the  overall  population  based  on  tumor  assessment without PET. The ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with CR or PR as the end-ofinduction response. All other cases are designated non-responders.

All analyses are based on the investigator's assessment. Analyses of PFS, CR rate, and ORR are based on IRC assessments in the application for the FDA registration.

EFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date to disease progression/relapse, death  from  any  cause,  or  initiation  of  a  NALT.  If  the  specified  event  (disease  progression/relapse, death, or initiation of a NALT) did not occur, EFS was censored at the date of last tumor assessment. For patients without an event who have not had post-baseline tumor assessments, EFS was censored on the date of randomization.

Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNLT) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the start date of the next anti-lymphoma treatment or death from any cause. Patients without a TTNLT event were censored at the date at which the patient was last known to be alive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR to the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause (PFS event). DFS is evaluated for the subgroup of patients with a response of CR at any time prior to NALT. DFS for patients who have had no documented disease progression, relapse, or have not died after CR, were censored at the last disease assessment date.

Duration of response, defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or PR to the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause (PFS event) for the subgroup of patients with a response of CR or PR any time prior to NALT. For patients achieving a response who have  not  experienced  disease  progression,  relapse,  or  died  prior  to  the  time  of  the  analysis,  the duration of response was censored on the date of last disease assessment.

## Sample size

The primary analysis of the study tested the equality of PFS distributions in the R-chemo and G-chemo arms the following null hypothesis with use of a two-sided stratified log rank test at an overall 5% significance level:

-  Equality  of  PFS  distributions  in  the  G-chemo  and  R-chemo  arms  in  the  FL  population  by investigator assessment: H0: PFSG-chemo = PFSR-chemo versus H1: SG-chemo ≠ SR-chemo In  the  FL  subset,  estimates  on  the  number  of  events  required  to  demonstrate  efficacy  with respect to PFS were based on the following assumptions:
-  Two-sided log rank test at the 0.05 level of significance
-  Powered for the FL population
-  Eighty  percent  power  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio  (HR)  for  G-chemo  versus  R-chemo  of  0.74, corresponding to an improvement in 3-year PFS from 70.7% to 77.4% or in median PFS from 6 years to 8.1 years (35%). Note that estimates of median PFS were not likely to be reached in either study arm at either interim or final PFS analysis
-  Exponential distribution of PFS
-  An annual dropout rate of 2.5%

Performance  of  interim  analysis  on  PFS:  one  futility  analysis  when  approximately  30%  of  the  total (investigator-assessed) PFS events had occurred and one efficacy analysis when approximately 67% of the total (investigator-assessed) PFS events had occurred. Efficacy and (nonbinding) futility boundaries were  calculated  using  the  Lan-DeMets  approximation  to  the  O-Brien-Fleming  boundary  shape. Resulting significance levels at the interim and final analyses are documented in the SAP.

In addition, a futility analysis based on CR rates at the end of induction as determined by CT (or MRI, but not PET), was performed on the first 170 randomized patients with FL.

With the above assumptions, 370 PFS events were required to achieve 80% power for the primary analysis. Recruitment was staggered in order to recruit the first 170 patients at a smaller number of sites, followed by the activation of all sites after the IDMC meeting for futility based on CR rates. It was expected that during the first stage, after a 6-month ramp up, 18 patients per month would be recruited, and after the IDMC meeting and another 4-month ramp up, an accrual rate of 37 patients per month was expected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The 1200 patients with FL enrolled over 49 months and followed for an additional 29 months after randomization of the last patients were required to provide 370 PFS events, with a total duration for PFS follow-up of approximately 78 months (6.5 years).

Although  the primary  efficacy endpoint  is the investigator-assessed  PFS,  PFS  based  on  IRC assessments was also analyzed to support the primary analysis. In the United States, IRC-assessed PFS will be the basis for regulatory decisions. Approximately 200 additional patients with non-follicular lymphoma (i.e., with MZL) were enrolled. This number was selected on the basis of estimation from the enrolment feasibility assessment prior to the start of the study. This estimation indicated that at least  200  patients  with  MZL  would  likely  be  enrolled  in  49  months,  in  addition  to  the  planned enrollment of 1200 patients with FL. As such, data from the patients with MZL can be interpreted in context  of  subgroup  analyses.  However,  this  subgroup  was  not  powered  to  detect  statistically significant differences.

## Randomisation

1202 eligible patients with FL who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1  ratio  to  either  G-chemo  followed  by  G-maintenance  in  responders  or  R-chemo  followed  by  Rmaintenance in responders. In addition, 195 patients with MZL were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment arms. There were an additional 4 patients with non-FL.

Randomization was stratified for the following factors:

1. Chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine)
2. FLIPI (for FL: low, intermediate, or high)/IPI (for MZL: low/low-intermediate or highintermediate/high) group (see the protocol for further details)

3.  Geographic region (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, South and Central America, North America, other)

## Blinding (masking)

This  was  an  open-label  study;  however  the  IRC  was  blinded  to  treatment  assignment  throughout. Clinical Scientists from the MAH's study team reviewed eCRF data for ambiguous, contradictory and/or potentially erroneous data entry as part of routine data cleaning. For these activities, they were not blinded  to  treatment  allocation  on  an  individual  patient  basis.  However,  no  aggregated  efficacy  or safety  analyses  by  treatment  arm  were  conducted  by  the  Sponsor  using  unblinded  data  before  the IDMC released the data following the interim analysis.

At  the  pre-specified  interim  analysis  for  efficacy,  the  IDMC  recommended  that  the  study  be  fully analyzed because the pre-specified boundary for the primary endpoint, investigator-assessed PFS, had been  crossed  and  the  results  were  considered  clinically  meaningful.  The  Sponsor  endorsed  this recommendation  and  the  interim  analysis  is  now  considered  the  primary  analysis  of  efficacy.  The Sponsor was only exposed to aggregate efficacy or safety analyses by treatment arm after the IDMC recommendation and Sponsor decision.

## Statistical methods

A  two-sided  stratified  log-rank  test  (0.05  significance  level)  stratified  by  chemotherapy  regimen (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine) and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) risk group (low, intermediate, or high) in patients with FL, or international prognostic index (IPI) risk group (low  or  low-intermediate  vs.  high-intermediate  or  high)  was  used  for  the  primary  analysis.  KaplanMeier  methodology  was  used  to  estimate  PFS  distribution  for  each  treatment  arm.  Estimates  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  effect  were  expressed  as  hazard  ratios  through  the  use  of  a  stratified  Cox  proportional hazards analysis, including 95% confidence intervals.

PFS was compared using a two-sided log-rank test stratified by chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine),  FL  international  prognostic  index  (FLIPI)  risk  group  (low,  intermediate,  or  high)  in patients with FL or international prognostic index (IPI) risk group (low or low-intermediate vs. highintermediate or high) in patients with non-follicular lymphoma.

Estimates of the treatment effect are expressed as hazard ratios, estimated with the use of a stratified Cox  model,  including  95%  confidence  limits.  An  unstratified  log-rank  test  was  also  performed  as  a sensitivity analysis. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate median (if reached), 2-year and 3-year PFS and 95% CIs for each treatment arm, and the Kaplan-Meier curve is provided for a visual description of the difference across treatment arms.

Three interim analyses were planned: two for futility (one on CR and one on PFS) and one for efficacy (on PFS).

The first interim analysis was based on differences in end-of-induction CR rates in the first 170 enrolled patients with FL. The IDMC reviewed the data on 24 October 2012 and recommended that the study continue.

The second interim analysis (futility on PFS) was conducted when 30% of the required investigatorassessed  PFS  events  (i.e.,  approximately  111  events)  had  occurred.  The  clinical  data  cutoff  for  the second  interim  analysis  was  20  February  2014.  The  IDMC  reviewed  the  data  on  31  July  2014  and recommended that the study continue.

The  third  interim  analysis  (efficacy)  was  planned  after  67%  of  the  events  had  occurred  (i.e. approximately 248 events), and all patients had been enrolled and followed for an estimated minimum of 11 months. The clinical cutoff date for the third interim analysis was 31 January 2016. This analysis is  now  referred  to  as  the  primary  analysis.  The  IDMC  reviewed  the  data  on  20  May  2016  and recommended that the study be fully analyzed at this time, as the primary endpoint had been met. The IDMC recommendations are provided.

PFS was analyzed for the follicular lymphoma population based on assessments by the investigators as well  as  by  the  IRC;  both  investigator-  and  IRC-assessed  PFS  endpoints  were  analyzed  in  the  same manner. In the US, IRC-assessed PFS will be the basis of regulatory decisions. It was anticipated that in the worst case, the number of corresponding IRC events at clinical cutoff would be, at most, 10% lower than the number of investigator-assessed events. Such a worst case loss in number of events would  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  power  of  approximately  5%  to  detect  the  assumed  treatment difference. All analyses of PFS and secondary efficacy endpoints were performed for the FL population and  the  overall  population,  with  the  exception  of  PFS,  which  was  analysed  only  in  the  overall population as a secondary efficacy endpoint (PFS for the follicular population is the primary efficacy endpoint). Patients were analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized.

To adjust for multiple statistical testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, thereby controlling the overall Type I error rate at a two-sided 0.05 level of significance, the fixed sequence testing procedure (Westfall and Krishen 2001) was used. These endpoints were tested in the following order:

-  PFS in the overall population
-  CR  rate  at  the  end  of  induction  therapy  in  the  FL  population  based  on  tumor  assessment without PET

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  CR rate at the end of induction therapy in the overall population based on tumor assessment without PET
-  Overall survival in the FL population
-  Overall survival in the overall population
-  ORR at the end of induction therapy in the FL population based on tumor assessment without PET
-  ORR at  the  end  of  induction  therapy  in  the  overall  population  based  on  tumor  assessment without PET

The primary efficacy analysis population is the intent-to-treat follicular lymphoma population (FL ITT), defined as all randomized patients with follicular histology. Efficacy analyses were conducted according to  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  principle,  where  patients  were  grouped  according  to  their  randomized treatment arm regardless of what treatments were actually received.

The  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  also  determined  in  the  intent-to-treat population, defined as all randomized patients (overall population, ITT).

Pharmacokinetic analyses and the evaluable population are defined in a separate analysis plan. Patient data was included in the pharmacokinetic analysis if they contained sufficient dosing information and at least one adequately documented and quantifiable concentration per patient.

The  safety  analysis  population  included  all  patients  who  received  any  amount  of  study  drug (obinutuzumab,  rituximab,  or  chemotherapy  [CHOP,  CVP,  or  bendamustine]),  and  patients  were analyzed according to the treatment received (i.e., a patient who received obinutuzumab at least once for  any  reason  was  analyzed  under  the  G-chemo  treatment  arm;  if  only  chemotherapy  and/or rituximab was received, the patient was analysed under the R-chemo treatment arm).

| Version A1 (26 July 2011)                   | On the basis of a decision by the Sponsor, Study B021223 was amended to allow for an early futility analysis of the first 170 randomized patients with follicular lymphoma based on the end-of-induction treatment complete response rates. The statistical methods sections were updated accordingly. PET was also made mandatory at screening and at end of induction therapy for the first 170 patients with follicular lymphoma at all sites where PET scanners were available. The determination of minimal residual disease (MRD) based on polymerase chain reaction detection of BCL2/lgH-rearrangements within the malignant clone for all patients with follicular lymphoma was also implemented. Additional minor changes as detailed in the protocol amendment summary of changes for protocol amendment A1. |
| Version A2 (16 July 2012)                   | The protocol was amended to implement a DNA substudy in those and to DNA collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Version A3 (France only) (18 November 2012) | Study B021223 was amended to address questions received from France's Agence Nationale de Securite Medicament (ANSM) on 17 October 2012. This protocol version was a country-specific amendment implemented in France. Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) was added as an exclusion criterion, and additional information regarding PML diagnosis, evaluation, and guidance on how to manage a potential PML case was included. These changes were implemented into version A4.

## Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Overall Population)

In the overall population, the median age was 60.0 years (range: 23 to 88 years). The G-chemo arm had more patients &gt; 60 years old than the R-chemo arm (53.0% vs 47.8%, respectively). The majority of patients were White (82.4% [1154/1401] of patients). Overall, more female than male patients were randomized (739/1401 patients [52.7%] vs. 662/1401 patients [47.3%]).

The majority of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (96.8%). Overall, 60.2% of patients were classified as stage IV according to Ann Arbor criteria. Baseline B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) were present in 34.5% of patients. FCγ receptor polymorphism results were available for 1332/1401 patients (95.1%) for the FCγreceptor IIa and IIIa, and 1245/1401 patients (88.9%) for the FCγ receptor IIb analyses. For FCγ receptor IIa, overall the 131HR genotype was most frequent (47.5% of patients) and the frequency was comparable in both treatment arms. For FC  receptor IIIa, the 158FF genotype was  most frequent (44.9% of patients) in the R-chemo arm, but the 158VF genotype was most frequent (48.5% of patients) in the G-chemo arm. For FC  receptor IIb/IIc, overall the 232II genotype was most frequent (78.1% of patients) and the frequency was comparable in both treatment arms.

## Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (MZL Population)

Regarding geographic region, the R-chemo arm had more patients from Eastern Europe than the Gchemo arm (16.7% versus 10.1%; respectively). There were 32/195 patients (16.4%) who received CHOP chemotherapy (18/96 patients [18.8%] in the R-chemo arm and 14/99 patients [14.1%] in the G-chemo arm). There were 24/195 patients (12.3%) who received CVP chemotherapy (12/96 patients [12.5%] in the R-chemo arm and 12/99 patients [12.1%] in the G-chemo arm). There were 139/195

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients (71.3%) who received bendamustine chemotherapy (66/96 patients [68.8%] in the R-chemo arm and 73/99 patients [73.7%] in the G-chemo arm).

## Central Pathology Assessments (Overall Population)

As randomization was stratified according to FLIPI group for FL (low, intermediate, or high) or IPI group for MZL (low/low-intermediate or high-intermediate/high), among other criteria, patients were randomized separately depending on their diagnosis (FL or MZL). The investigator provided the diagnosis as two categories, FL or non-FL, to IxRS. The investigator reported the diagnosis in the eCRF in three categories: FL, non-FL (with subtypes), or other. Three patients had an eCRF diagnosis of other: (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [transformed FL]; R-chemo), (DBCL; G-chemo), and CLL; Gchemo).

## Outcomes and estimation

The HR for the primary endpoint of PFS by INV in the FL population was 0.66, p-value 0.0012. The median PFS by INV was not reached in any arm at the time of analysis. The results of the primary endpoint analysis are further supported by PFS by IRC

| Impact of treatment discontinuation                 | Patients who discontinued the study treatment for other reasons than disease progression or death were counted as having progressed at the time of discontinuation (event was date of last dose for early treatment discontinuations).         | 0.78 (0.64, 0.95) (p=0.0135) 181 vs.221                               | 0.83 (0.67, 1.01) (p=0.06) 175 vs.206                                 |
| Impact of late death                                | Patients who died more than 6 months after their last response assessment and showed no sign of progression were censored at the last available response assessment.                                                                           | 0.64 (0.49, 0.83) (p=0.0007) 95 vs. 140                               | 0.72 (0.55, 0.95) (p=0.0200) 88 vs. 118                               |
| Impact of non-evaluable* last tumor assessment      | Accepting non-evaluable* tumor assessment as last response assessment for censoring purposes.                                                                                                                                                  | 0.66 (0.51, 0.86) (p=0.0016) 101 vs. 144                              | 0.70 (0.53, 0.91) (p=0.0073) 95 vs.132                                |

## Concordance rate between PFS by INV and IRC

Agreement  between  the  IRC  and  the  Investigator  on  the  type  of  PFS  event  (i.e.,  agreement  on assignment of  PD,  death or  no  event  per  patient)  was  high  (92.1%  overall)  and  balanced  between arms (91.0% in the R-chemo arm vs. 93.2% in the G-chemo arm). In particular, for the R-chemo arm, the Investigator and IRC agreed that progression had not occurred in 444 of 601 patients (73.9%) and that  progression  had  occurred  in  91  of  601  patients  (15.1%).  Similarly,  for  the  G-chemo  arm,  the Investigator and the IRC agreed that progression had not occurred in 486 of 601 patients (80.9%) and had occurred in 54 of 601 patients (9.0%). The majority of discordance between IRC-and Investigator PFS events was related to cases where the Investigator registered a progression event, but the IRC did not (54 patients; Table 29). Note that once the Investigator had diagnosed progression, no more CT scans  were  expected  to  be  available  to  the  IRC,  preventing  subsequent  registration  of  disease progression. A small subset of these cases (7/54) were related to disease transformation.

## Disease Transformation

Of  the  1202  patients  with  Follicular  Lymphoma  enrolled  in  the  study,  210  patients  (17.5%)  had documented progression (130/601 patients in the R-chemo arm [21.6%], and 80/601 patients in the G-chemo arm [13.3%]). Disease transformation (to a high grade malignancy or DLBCL) was reported for  29/601  patients  (4.8%)  in  the  R-chemo  arm,  and  18/601  patients  (3.0%)  in  the  G-chemo  arm (Table 33), with a difference in transformation rates of - 1.8% (95% CI:  - 4.1, 0.4). When considered as a percentage of patients with disease progression, 22.3% of patients in the R-chemo arm (29/130) and 22.5% of patients in the G-chemo arm (18/80) progressed with disease transformation.

## Response conversion during maintenance treatment

At the end of the induction therapy, 794/1201 patients (66.1%) achieved a PR (379 patients (63.1%) in the R-chemo arm vs. 415 patients (69,1%) in the G-chemo arm). A total of 493 patients with an end of induction response of PR also had an available end of maintenance response assessment. Of these  patients,  an  improvement  in  response  to  CR  during  maintenance  was  observed  in  97/222 patients (43.7%) in the R-chemo arm, compared with 134/271 patients (49.4%) on the G-chemo arm.

## End of Maintenance Response (FL ITT Population)

A non-pre-specified end of maintenance response (EOMR) analysis was conducted. EOMR was defined as  the  first  response  assessment  that  occurred  after  the  last  dose  of  maintenance  treatment.  The population included all patients randomized other than those who had not yet reached the end of the maintenance  assessment.  Patients  with  disease  progression  or  death  at  any  time  or  with  missing response  assessments  at  the  end  of  maintenance  were  considered  non-responders.  This  analysis  is similar to that exploring conversion, but includes all randomized patients in the study long enough, i.e., also early withdrawals and non-responders, within the denominator.

Based on the Investigator assessment, 712/1058 patients with FL (67.3%) achieved a CR or PR at the end of maintenance phase: 341 patients (64.0% [95% CI: 59.7, 68.1]) in the R-chemo arm and 371 patients (70.7% [95% CI: 66.6, 74.5]) in the G-chemo arm, an absolute difference of 6.7% (95% CI: 1.0, 12.4; p-value = 0.0197, CMH test) in favor of G-chemo at this time point. Similarly, an absolute difference in CR rate of 2.5% (95% CI: - 3.5, 8.4; p-value = 0.39, CMH test) was found in favor of Gchemo at this time point (Table 22)

When response was assessed by IRC, the IRC assessed EOMR was similar to the Investigator assessed EOMR with 65.1% (95% CI: 60.9, 69.2) for the R-chemo arm and 70.9% (95%

CI:  66.8,  74.8)  for  the  G-chemo  arm;  and  CR  rates  were  42.6%  (95%  CI:  38.4,  46.9)  and 45.2% (95% CI: 40.9, 49.6), respectively.

## Supportive study

The data to support the current application to extend the use of obinutuzumab to previously untreated patients with FL comes from one pivotal Phase III study, with supporting data from a Phase Ib study:

BO21000 (GAUDI): An open-label, multi-center, randomized, Phase Ib study to investigate the safety and  efficacy  of  RO5072759  given  in  combination  with  CHOP,  FC  or  bendamustine  chemotherapy  in patients with CD20+ B-cell follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Study BO21000, the number of scheduled obinutuzumab doses was lower than in Study BO21223 since only two doses of obinutuzumab were scheduled in Cycle 1 (on Day 1 and 8 in BO21000 vs. Day 1, 8, and 15 in BO21223), fewer treatment cycles were scheduled during induction (4 or 6 for G-benda and 6 or 8 for G-CHOP in BO21000 vs. 6 for G-benda and 8 for G-CHOP or G-CVP in BO21223), and because of less frequent maintenance dosing (every 3 months for a total of 8 maintenance doses in BO21000 vs. every 2 months for a total of 12 maintenance doses in BO21223). The number of planned chemotherapy cycles was also lower in BO21000 than in BO21223.

Note: This study used the 2007 revised response criteria for NHL, and unconfirmed response (CRu) is not part of these revised criteria. Patients whose response would have been labeled CRu according to the original 1999 criteria were therefore classified under PR s after receiving the last dose of obinutuzumab or until progression or NALT, whichever occurred first. Monitoring for recurrent disease continued in patients who were in continuous response (il.e., CR/PR), and all patients were followed for survival every 6 months until the end of the study.The end of the study was defined as the time point when the last patient had completed 2 years of follow-up after receiving the last dose of maintenance therapy

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The Applicant has provided one pivotal, randomised (1:1), open-label, phase III study (BO21223) to support  the  proposed  extension  of  the  indication.  The  study  included  patients  with  previously untreated stage III/IV or stage II Bulky disease (&gt;7cm) Follicular Lymphoma (FL). Patients with Grade 3b FL are excluded from the study as reflected in the SmPC, since they usually are more aggressive and treated as DLBCL. The recent GOYA study comparing R-CHOP with G-CHOP in patients with DLBCL showed that the latter was not superior to the first. Patients with Grade 3b FL are in clinical practise perceived to behave as DLBCL.

The choice of backbones (CHOP, CVP or bendamustine) and regimens are fully acceptable, since RCHOP,  R-CVP  and  R-B  followed  by  rituximab  maintenance  are  considered  standard  of  care  in  this patient population.

Randomisation  and  the  three  stratification  factors  are  acceptable.  The  stratification  factors  are: Chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine), FLIPI (for FL: low, intermediate, or high)/IPI (for  MZL:  low/low-intermediate  or  high-intermediate/high)  group  and  geographic  region  (Western Europe,  Eastern  Europe,  South  and  Central  America,  North  America,  other).  It  is  noted  that randomization occurred separately for the patients with FL and MZL. The Western Europe region only included countries within the European Union.

The trial was adequately powered for the FL population (in line with the claimed indication), with 3 planned  interim  analyses  (2  for  futility,  one  for  efficacy)  using  the  O'Brien-Fleming  sequential procedure for controlling the overall 0.05 type-1 error, with a nominal type-1 error of 0.012 for the efficacy interim analysis. Calculations were based upon a hazard ratio of 0.741  representing a 26% reduction risk of disease progression. Assuming a 6-year PFS in the R-Chemo arm and exponentially distributed PFS times, this corresponds to a 2.1-years increase of median PFS with Gazyvaro compared to  SOC.  Analysis  in  the  MZL  cohort  was  exploratory  only;  therefore  no  power  calculation  was performed for this subgroup of subjects.

The primary objective of this study is to compare efficacy between R-chemo and G-chemo in terms of Progression-free survival as assessed by Investigator. PFS is fully acceptable in patients with FL, since the course of the disease typically stretches over years to decades. The Applicant has included PFS by IRC  as  a  secondary  objective.  This  is  acknowledged  since  the  study  is  open-label.  To  adjust  for multiple  statistical  testing  of  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints,  the  Applicant  has applied  a  fixed  sequence  testing  procedure.  Other  secondary  objectives/endpoints  include  OS,  EFS, TTNALT, DFS and DOR. The testing of EFS, TTNALT, DFS and DOR were not adjusted for multiplicity, and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant applied 3 planned IA's. However, the first two IAs were concerned with futility, while the last IA was related to PFS (efficacy) and was planned after 67% of the events had occurred.

The protocol was amended 4 times. None of the amendments are considered critical for conduct of the study or the interpretation of data. With regard to protocol deviations, the overall number of deviations is similar between the two arms. In the updated analysis 427 patients in the G-chemo arm and 418 patients in the R-chemo arm had at least one deviation. The subcategory 'other tumour or response related assessments' comprised 194 patients in the G-chemo arm and 187 patients in the R-chemo arm. The pattern of deviations is more or less similar, the majority of deviations in the subcategory included 'missing' or 'out of window' MRD assessments, missing laboratory assessments or related to patients with MZL who were not the target population. The deviations were considered having no direct impact on the primary endpoint.

In general, the baseline demographic characteristics are well balanced between the two treatment arms. The majority of patients are white, below 65 years of age. Mean age is approximately 58 years. There are slightly more patients in the age group 60-69 years in the G-chemo arm. If any, this is in favour of the R-chemo arm. The baseline disease characteristics are well balanced. The majority of patients had ECOG score of 0 or 1, Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4, FLIPI score intermediate or high. Slightly more patients had Bulky disease at baseline in the R-chemo arm, however, the difference is not considered major. Baseline B-symptoms are well balanced without any major differences. Overall, at baseline, patients in the two treatment arms had similar levels of HRQoL (as measured by the FACTLym questionnaire) and health status (as measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire).  Patients in both treatment arms had some impairment of physical function, functional wellbeing, emotional and social function at baseline as a result of their disease, similar to that reported in the literature in a sample of newly diagnosed patients with FL (Pettengell et al, 2009), and in other cancer and non-cancer populations (Janda et al 2009; Brucker at al 2005).

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The dosing rationale was based on a comprehensive review of safety, efficacy and PK data in Phase I studies. A unit dose of 1000 mg for all infusions was chosen as the dose to be used in future Phase II and Phase III studies since it was the dose most likely to be well tolerated and efficacious in a majority of  NHL  patients  regardless  of  their  initial  tumor  burden.  Furthermore,  PK  modelling  suggested  that additional  doses of  obinutuzumab on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 would saturate the target-mediated clearance,  achieve  a  steady  state  of  drug  early,  and  maintain  it  for  the  duration  of  treatment.  In addition, when used as monotherapy in the iNHL Phase II extension portion of the BO20999 study, obinutuzumab showed greater efficacy with doses around 1000 mg compared with lower doses of 400 mg, with a doubling of  response  rate in  rituximab-refractory  patients.  The  maintenance  regimen  of 2-monthly dosing for  up  to  two  years  was  also  familiar  to  clinicians  as  this  regimen  is  used  for  Rmaintenance in patients with previously untreated FL and had been shown to be safe in the Phase I/II obinutuzumab Studies BO21003 and BO21000.

The median PFS by INV was not reached in any arm at the time of analysis. The HR for PFS in the FL population was 0.66, p-value 0.0012. The results of the primary endpoint are further supported by the key secondary endpoint, PFS by IRC. The concordance rate between the two analyses is considered acceptable and in line with what has previously been accepted. The IRC-assessment hazard ratio is 0.71 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.93] and is in the range of the expected reduction risk in FL population. The study  was  stopped  for  efficacy  based  on  IDMC  recommendations  as  planned  and  described  in  the protocol.

In order to confirm the proposed dosing scheme -since body weight was the most determinant factor for systemic exposure (See Clinical Pharmacology)-  PFS was compared in normal weighted and in obese patients and similar PFS observed in patients with BMI  30 mg/m 2  or  30 mg/m 2  and body weight  90 kg or  90 kg. The lack of relationship between exposure and PFS previously reported in Study BO21223, confirm the recommended fixed dose/regimen of 1000 mg of obinutuzumab for previously untreated patients with FL across the whole range of body weight.  These findings are also consistent with saturation of CD20+ tumor cells during the course of treatment.  Therefore, a body weight-adjusted dosing is unlikely to improve PFS in patients with extreme body weight, such as obese patients.

OS data in the updated analysis were also consistent with the primary analysis, showing no significant effect of G-chemo as compared to R-chemo. The Applicant will provide updated OS data at the time of the final analysis post authorisation. This is as expected, due to the natural history of the disease, the OS data are not mature, but there is no indication of any detrimental effect.

In terms of OS across subgroups, findings of higher number of AEs of fatal outcome in the G-benda and R-benda arms as compared to the other chemotherapy backbones are discussed under Clinical Safety.  A  comparison  between  chemotherapy  backbones  is  difficult  in  view  that  this  is  not  a randomised comparison and that there are likely confounding factors due to patient selection. Indeed, although  small  numbers,  patients  in  the  R-benda  and  G-benda  subgroup  were  of    older  age  &gt;  80 years, had more baseline comorbidity and/or new anti-lymphoma treatment than patients in the CHOP subgroups.  More mature OS data are needed to further investigate the impact of these findings.

With  regard  to  secondary  endpoints,  EFS,  DOR  and  TTNALT  data  are  consistent  with  the  primary endpoint and show a benefit in favour of G-chemo. It needs to be highlighted that EFS, DOR andDFS were not adjusted for multiplicity. With regard to DFS, data are not mature, but there is no indication of any detrimental effect.

When comparing progression disease events between investigators and IRC at the end of treatment induction,  agreement  is  relatively  high,  reaching  0.75  kappa  values  in  both  arms.  However,  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

agreement between both assessment bodies is lower when it involves the whole range of events (CR, PR,  SD,  PD  and  unevaluable).  The  observed  discrepancies  between  investigators  and  IRC  PFS assessments were all addressed, especially in case of conflicting assessments (not evaluable response or disease progression vs positive response). Conflicting situations were equally observed in both arms (8.3%  and  8.9%  respectively  in  G-  and  R-Chemo).  A  focus  on  all  possible  impacts  on  the  patient management from these specific conflicting  situations  showed  no  detrimental  effect  on  the  affected patients.

Several  pre-specified  sensitivity  analysis  of  PFS  were  conducted.  All  analyses,  except  for  one,  were consistent with the primary analyses. The 'impact of loss to follow-up' (worst case analysis) showed no difference between the two treatment arms. Thus, even when patients in G-chemo arm withdrew prior to disease progression and were consequently counted as 'events' in the sensitivity analysis, the result indicate that G-chemo is at least non-inferior to R-chemo. Overall, the sensitivity analyses show that the primary estimate is robust and reliable.

Subgroups analyses in both the IRC and INV assessed PFS are consistent with the primary estimate. With regard to subgroup analysis of PFS by INV by stratification factors, no relevant difference in terms of chemotherapy backbone or region was shown. There seems to be no difference between G-chemo and  R-chemo  in  patients  with  FLIPI  score  low.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  these  patients  in general  have  low  disease  activity,  leading  to  difficulties  in  showing  a  difference  between  the  two treatment  arms  or  the  fact  that  patients  with  FLIPI  score  low  only  comprised  21%  of  the  ITT population. No explanation could be found as to why obinutuzumab had no effect in the FLIPI low score subgroup, however these results were reported in the SmPC.

No significant difference according to transformation of the disease is seen in the G-chemo population versus the R-chemo population, which is reassuring.

Over the course of treatment, HRQoL was similar in the two treatment arms.  Patients in both arms experienced clinically meaningful improvements in lymphoma-specific symptoms and the summary scales that included this subscale (i.e., TOI, Lym-Total).  No clear differences were detected in HRQoL between the two treatment arms and at no timepoint during the study, however, the value of these subjective data are limited in an open-label study.

The Applicant has also provided a supportive study, BO21000, a small phase 1b study that investigates obinutuzumab in combination with CHOP and bendamustine. The study is divided in two parts, where the second part of the study included previously untreated patients. Since study BO21000 main objective is safety, the interpretation of efficacy should be cautious, however, the secondary endpoints included efficacy measures, such as PFS, TTNALT, DOR, ORR and EFS, and seems to provide supportive evidence for the findings in the pivotal study.

It is noted that patients with Grade 3b FL were excluded from the pivotal study. These patients are in the clinical setting often treated with R-CHOP. The GOYA study comparing R-CHOP with O-CHOP in patients with DLCBL showed that the latter was not superior to the first. Patients with Grade 3b FL are in clinical practise perceived to behave as DLBCL, and are as such treated the same way.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The  Applicant  has  provided  the  BO21223  study,  that  demonstrate  a  statistically  significant  and clinically relevant improvement  of  PFS  in  patients with  FL  being  treated  with  obinutuzumab +chemotherapy  (bendamustine,  CHOP  or  CVP)  compared  with  Rituximab+chemotherapy,  thus  the study met its primary endpoint. The primary results are confirmed by PFS by IRC and all sensitivity analyses support these findings. Furthermore, the findings are consistent across all relevant subgroups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and stratification factors.

Updated analysis of PFS and OS were performed with 6.6 months additional median follow-up (data cut-off as of 10 September 2016). The investigator-assessed PFS demonstrated a HR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.87), p=0.0016, being consistent with the primary analysis. The updated OS data were also consistent with the primary analysis, showing no significant effect of G-chemo as compared to Rchemo.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The primary safety data for patients receiving first-line treatment for FL are derived from the pivotal Phase III study BO21223 (GALLIUM) with 595 patients treated with G-chemo, but safety of the overall population (FL + MZL and other NHL) are provided with 698 patients treated with G-chemo.

The safety of obinutuzumab from the GALLIUM study is supported by data from 81 patients from the Phase Ib  study  BO21000  (GAUDI)  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (induction therapy), followed by obinutuzumab maintenance monotherapy in patients with FL.

Safety data are presented separately for the induction, maintenance and follow-up phases. Data have been  collected  up  to  31 January  2016,  which  corresponds  to  the  clinical  cut-off  date  for  the  third interim  analysis  for  efficacy.  Safety  data  from  Studies  BO21223  and  BO21000  are  presented separately  as  of  the  different  drug  exposures  during  induction  (difference  in  number  of  cycles  and doses), the different maintenance dosage schedules (every 2 months in BO21223 and every 3 months in BO21000), different eligibility requirements for maintenance, and the large difference in population sizes between the studies (595 vs 81 patients).

## Safety data collection

Safety monitoring comprised the collection of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), protocol-specified  hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  urinalysis  variables,  vital  signs,  pharmacodynamic parameters, and immunological tests. SAE was defined as any experience that suggested a significant hazard,  contraindication,  side  effect,  or  precaution  (see  ICH  Guideline  for  Clinical  Safety  Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2). The severity of all adverse events was graded on a five-point scale (Grade 1 to 5) and reported in detail on the eCRF according to the  National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  (NCI  CTCAE)  version  4.0  for  Study BO21223  and  version  3.0  for  Study  BO21000.  All  deaths  are  summarized  by  analysis  population, including AEs that resulted in death. Deaths were outcomes, not events. Progression of lymphoma was not recorded as an AE or SAE if it was clearly consistent with the suspected progression of the patient's underlying  cancer.    Hospitalization  due  solely  to  the  progression  of  underlying  lymphoma  was  not reported as an SAE.

All AEs (related and unrelated) were recorded up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug, Grade ≥ 3 AEs (related and unrelated) were recorded up to 6 months after the last dose of study drug, Grade 3 or  4  infections  (related  and  unrelated)  were  recorded  up  to  24  months  after  the  last  dose  of  study drug.

All  grade  events  of  infusion  related  reactions  (IRRs),  neutropenia,  infections  (including  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), thrombocytopenia (including acute thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events), gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, cardiac events, second malignancies  and  hepatitis  B  reactivation  were  identified  as  AEPIs  (adverse  events  of  particular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interest).

## Safety Population

The safety population included all patients who received any amount of study drug (obinutuzumab, rituximab, or chemotherapy [CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine]).  The FL safety population consisted of 1192 patients: 597patients in the R-chemo arm and 595 in the G-chemo arm.  Of 1202 randomized patients with FL, 10 patients (four patients in the R-chemo arm and six patients in the G-chemo arm) did not receive any amount of study drug (obinutuzumab, rituximab, or chemotherapy [CHOP, CVP, or bendamustine])  and  therefore,  per  protocol,  were  excluded  from  the  FL  safety  population.  Three patients in the G-chemo arm received one or more doses of rituximab in error - these patients are also included in the G-chemo arm for safety analyses.

## Patient exposure

In Study BO21223, the median observation time (randomization to last available assessment) among FL patients at the cutoff date was 34.4 months (range: 0.1  54.5 months) in the R-chemo arm and 34.8 months (range: 0.0  53.8 months) in the G-chemo arm. The median duration of post-treatment follow-up  at  the  cutoff  date  of  31  January  2016  was  9.2  months  (range:  0.0  42.3 months)  in  the R-chemo arm and 9.4 months (range: 0.0  46.9 months) in the G-chemo arm.

Of 676 patients with previously untreated FL treated with an obinutuzumab-based chemoimmunotherapy  induction  regimen  in  the  two  studies,  620 patients  went  on  to  receive obinutuzumab maintenance for up to 2 years as monotherapy.

Time unit is in weeks, dose unit is mg. Treatment duration is the date of the last dose of study medication minus the date of the first maintenance dose plus 28 days. Or if new antileukemia therapy was started within these 28 days exposure duration is the time interval between first maintenance dose and start of new anti-lymphoma therapy minus 1 day.

Dose intensity is the total dose actually received divided by the total planned dose. a   The G-chemo heading shows the patients who received obinutuzumab as planned (in column 'GA101'), and in the column entitled 'Rituximab' it shows the three patients with a medication error who received at least one dose of both obinutuzumab and rituximab.

AE = adverse event; FL = follicular lymphoma; GI = gastrointestinal, IRR = infusion-related reaction; TLS = tumor lysis syndrome a  Fatal AEs for BO21223 include outcomes that were available in the database as of the snapshot date (29 April 2016) where the AE onset date was on or before the cutoff date (31 January 2016)

b    Two additional deaths, due to neutropenic sepsis and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively, were reported in follow-up.

c   AEs reported under the secondary malignancies SMQ (not the SOC) are shown.

d   Data are based on DNA lab tests, and Hepatitis B Reactivation is based on the protocol definition.  Denominators are the number of patients who had positive core antibody results at baseline (patients at risk).

e   Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen or total hepatitis B core antibody at baseline screening were excluded from Study BO21000.   Two patients had a protocol deviation of hepatitis testing not done at screening.

## Adverse Events by Severity

The majority  of  AEs  reported  in  the  study  were  NCI  CTC  AE  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  in  each  arm (8022/9341 events [85.9%] in the R-chemo arm and 8767/10311 [85.0%] in the G chemo arm (see Table 16).

The numbers of AEs that were Grade 3-5 (1,319 in the R-chemo arm and 1,544 in the R-chemo arm) were much lower than the numbers of Grade 1-2 AEs (see paragraph above). In the R-chemo arm vs. the G-chemo arm of the study, 67.8% of patients and 74.6% of patients, respectively, experienced Grade 3-5 AEs.  The percentages of patients with FL with at least one Grade 3-5 AE in the R-chemo arm  vs.  G-chemo  arm,  respectively,  were  36.2%  vs.  35.3%  Grade  3;  28.3%  vs.  35.3%  Grade  4 (driven by a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia in the G-chemo arm (29.5% in the R-chemo arm vs. 36.6% in the G-chemo arm); and 3.4% vs. 4.0% Grade 5.

AE:  adverse event; NCI CTC = National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria

Multiple occurrences of the same AE in the same individual are counted in the total number of AEs.

## Adverse events of special interest

A higher incidence of AEs (all grades and Grade 3-5) in the G-chemo arm compared to the R-chemo arm was observed for the following AEPIs:  IRRs, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infections (no PML case was reported), and second malignancies. The incidence of hemorrhagic events and gastrointestinal perforations were comparable between the study arms.

## Prolonged neutropenia and late onset neutropenia

Prolonged  neutropenia  was  defined  as  low  neutrophil  counts  at  the  last  visit  before  last  antibody administration (LAA) followed by an assessment of low neutrophil count between Day 24 and Day 41 after LAA.  Prolonged neutropenia occurred in 3/537 patients (0.6%) in the R chemo arm and 5/533 patients (0.9%) in the G chemo arm.

Late onset neutropenia (i.e., low neutrophil count at LAA with absolute neutrophil count within normal range at last previous visit prior to LAA) occurred in 22/537 patients (4.1%) in the R chemo arm and 21/533 patients (3.9%) in the G chemo arm.

## Gastrointestinal perforation

Gastrointestinal  perforation  was  reported  in  three  patients  (0.5%)  in  the  R-chemo  arm  and  in  four patients (0.7%) in the G-chemo arm. The events included fistulas in two patients in the R-chemo arm (one  of  whom  had  a  history  of  diverticulitis  and  intermittent  constipation  at  study  entry)  and  one patient in the G-chemo arm (with a history of sigmoiditis at study entry); each of these three patients had extranodal involvement at study entry.

## Cardiac events

The incidence of cardiac AEs (SOC of 'Cardiac Disorders') was 9.7% in the R-chemo arm and 13.1% in the G-chemo arm.  The most frequently occurring cardiac events, for patients in the R-chemo and Gchemo  arms,  respectively,  were  palpitations  (2.7%  vs.  2.5%),  tachycardia  (1.2%  vs.  2.7%),  atrial fibrillation (1.3% vs. 1.7%), sinus tachycardia (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and angina pectoris (0.8% vs. 0.7%).

The percentage of patients with Grade 3 to 5 cardiac AEs was similar in the two arms: 2.8% for R-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chemo and 3.7% for G-chemo), with four patients in each arm experiencing Grade 4 events and two in each arm experiencing Grade 5 events. The fatal events were cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction in the R-chemo arm, and two cases of cardiogenic shock in the G-chemo arm.  Each fatal cardiac AE occurred in elderly patients (  65 years old) with pre-existing conditions.

Serious cardiac AEs were reported in 2.0 % of patients in the R-chemo arm and 4.4% in the G-chemo arm.  The  incidence  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  and  serious  AEs  in  patients  without  pre-existing  cardiac conditions was low and balanced between arms.

Of the patients who experienced cardiac events, one patient in the R chemo arm (due to cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock) and two patients in the G chemo arm (one due to tachycardia and the other due to ventricular dysfunction) had a study treatment withdrawn due to the event.  Ten patients in the R-chemo arm and 20 patients in the G-chemo arm had a dose interruption of any drug due to cardiac events.  Twenty-six patients in the R-chemo arm and 41 patients in the G-chemo arm had treatment for cardiac events, and the cardiac events had resolved in most patients by the data cutoff date (for 41/58 patients in the R-chemo arm and 66/78 patients in the G-chemo arm).

Some of  the  patients  had  cardiac  events  that  occurred  during  or within  24  hours of  the  end  of  an infusion and were therefore considered infusion-related events (10 patients [1.7%] who experienced cardiac events in the R-chemo arm and 26 patients [4.4%] who experienced cardiac events in the Gchemo arm).  When excluding cardiac AEs reported as IRRs (such as palpitations, tachycardia, and bradycardia  occurring  within  24  hours  of  infusion),  the  incidence  of  cardiac  AEs  was  comparable between arms: 8.2% of patients in the R-chemo arm vs. 9.6% in the G-chemo arm.

Twenty-six patients in the R-chemo arm and 41 patients in the G-chemo arm had treatment for cardiac events,  and  the  cardiac  events  had  resolved  in  most  patients  by  the  data  cutoff  date  (for  41/58 patients in the R-chemo arm and 66/78 patients in the G-chemo arm).

There were four fatal cardiac AEs in total, two in each arm (cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction in the R-chemo arm, and two cases of cardiogenic shock in the G-chemo arm). The fatal cardiac AEs in the G-chemo arm occurred in elderly patients (&gt; 65 years old) with preexisting cardiac conditions.

## Investigator text for AEs encoded using MedDRA v18.1.

Percentages are based on N in the column headings.

AEs with onset date before the first drug intake are not taken into account.

For frequency counts by preferred term, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an

individual are counted only once.

For frequency counts of \"Total number of events\" rows, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted separately.

arm had an event as compared to a 7.9% of the patients in the G-chemo arm.

## Hepatitis B Reactivation

Overall, 53 patients in the R-chemo arm and 29 patients in the G-chemo arm were hepatitis B core antibody positive at baseline, and therefore at risk of developing hepatitis B reactivation. Five patients experienced AEs of HBV reactivation: two in the R-chemo arm and three in the G-chemo arm; all the events reported in the G-chemo arm were Grades 1 or 2.

Patients could receive prophylactic anti-viral medication to prevent HBV reactivation in countries where they are administered as part of the standard of care or national guidelines.  Of the patients with hepatitis B core antibody positive at baseline, 15 in the R-chemo arm and 7 in the G-chemo arm received prophylaxis for hepatitis B on-study.  Of the 5 patients who experienced the AE PT of Hepatitis B reactivation, both patients in the R-chemo arm and one of the 3 patients in the G-chemo arm, received prophylaxis for hepatitis B.

## Laboratory findings

## B-cell depletion and recovery

Almost  all  patients  who  had  a  B-cell  result  reported  showed  B-cell  depletion  at  the  last  antibody administration. Of the 452 patients in the R-chemo arm with a B-cell result, 445 patients showed B-cell depletion at the LAA.  Of the 457 patients in the G chemo arm with a B-cell result, 454 patients had Bcell depletion at the LAA.

Immunoglobulin depletion was defined as levels below 0.5 g/L, 5.0 g/L and 0.3 g/L for IgA, IgG and IgM, respectively, at any time during the study. The proportion of patients experiencing immunoglobulin depletion at the last dose of antibody was:

- IgA: 9.5% in the R-chemo arm and 6.4% in the G-chemo arm.
- IgG: 11.6% in the R-chemo arm and 9.4% in the G-chemo arm
- IgM: 29.0% in the R-chemo arm and 29.7% in the G-chemo arm

Immunoglobulin depletion was comparable between the treatment arms. At the time of data cutoff, only a few patients (3.4 - 10.7%) with immunoglobulin depletion had recovered, hence the time to recovery could not be calculated in a meaningful way.

## Chemistry

The highest NCI-CTCAE Grade for chemistry parameters throughout the study is shown in Table 41 (also see Section 8.12.12.2 in primary BO21223 CSR).  Grade 3 and/or Grade 4 abnormalities were reported for the following chemistry parameters on both treatment arms during the study:  albumin (low), ALT (high), AST (high), calcium (low and high), CrCL (low), BSA corrected CrCL (low), creatinine (high and low), potassium (low and high), sodium (low), bilirubin (high), and uric acid (high).  High uric acid (any grade and Grade 3, in particular) was more frequently (≥ 5% difference) reported in the G-chemo arm. Abnormalities of the following parameters were also more frequently reported (≥ 5% difference) in the G-chemo arm: low albumin, high ALT, high AST, low calcium, high potassium and low sodium.

## Anti-therapeutic antibodies

The detection of human anti-human (HAHA) anti-drug antibodies against obinutuzumab was performed using a validated ELISA.  The sensitivity of the method was 18.4 ng -equiv./mL antibody titer in human serum. For the positive control, a purified rabbit  polyclonal  antibody  directed  against  obinutuzumab was used.  The mean drug tolerance factor was 95.6 (the tolerated ratio of drug to positive control), allowing  the  detection  of  anti-obinutuzumab  antibodies  with  a  sensitivity  level  of  0.500  µg/mL  at obinutuzumab serum concentrations of up to 47.8 ≥g/mL.

Immunogenicity  testing  of  study  samples  in  the  G  chemo  arm  was  performed  using  a  3  tiered approach (screening, confirmation, and titration).  The confirmatory assay was statistically evaluated during validation to allow for the presence of approximately 1% false positive results.  For samples confirmed positive, titration was performed and an antibody titer value was reported.  The titer was defined as the highest sample dilution that resulted in a response at or above the assay cut point.

At baseline, 25 patients (5.1%) in the G chemo arm had positive HAHA results.  As these patients had not been exposed to obinutuzumab before, these results can be regarded as false positive. One patient in the G chemo arm had a detectable positive HAHA result for anti obinutuzumab antibodies after Cycle 1, Day 1.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

No  dose  reductions  were  permitted  for  obinutuzumab  in  either  study  (nor  for  rituximab  in  Study BO21223).  Certain  AEs  warranted  slowing  of  antibody  infusion  rate,  interruptions,  or  dose  delays. Chemotherapy  regimen  modifications  included  dose  delays  and  reduction  of  certain  chemotherapy components under certain circumstances.

A  patient  was  considered  to  have  withdrawn  from  study  treatment  if  they  discontinued  all  of  the components of their allocated treatment.

## Post marketing experience

There is currently no Post Marketing Experience with obinutuzumab in this indication. No new safety concerns have been identified since the last RMP was submitted.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The size of the safety database with approximately 600 patients exposed to obinutuzumab in both the induction phase and the maintenance phase is acceptable. Demographic and patient characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms.

Dose intensity and duration of treatment was overall comparable between treatment arms in both induction and maintenance phase. During induction, most patients received all planned doses of obinutuzumab or rituximab. Overall, 99.5% of patients in the R-chemo arm and 99.7% of patients in the G-chemo arm received at least 90% of the planned cumulative dose of therapeutic antibody.

In the FL population of Study BO21223, the treatment arms were generally well-balanced with respect to demographic factors.  The median age of patients was 59.0 years (range: 23 to 88 years) and very similar in each study arm.  The majority of patients were less than 65 years of age (68.7%).  Overall, more  female  than  male  patients  were  randomized  in  the  study  (53.2%  female).    The  majority  of patients were White (80.5%).  The median BSA was 1.84 m 2  and the median BMI was 25.69 kg/ m 2 , and these characteristics were also very similar in both treatment arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Baseline disease characteristics including B-symptom data, bone marrow involvement, FLIPI scores and other parameters, were also balanced overall between the two arms of the study. The treatment arms were well balanced with regard to the baseline stratification factors: FLIPI (low, intermediate and high), chemotherapy regimen (CHOP, CVP, bendamustine) and geographic region (Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, Asia, Other).  AEs and SAEs were defined according to acceptable standards. The causal relationship of AEs to the investigational products was assessed by investigators. Deaths were outcomes, not events, and progression of lymphoma was not recorded as AEs or SAEs.

In the G-chemo arm, only four patients missed either the Cycle1 Day 8, or Cycle 1 Day 15 dose (note, the other 11 patients in this listing were withdrawn from treatment after Cycle 1 Day 1 so only received one dose of study medication in total).

During maintenance, most patients received all planned doses of obinutuzumab or rituximab. Overall, 99.2% of patients in the R-chemo arm and 99.8% of patients in the G-chemo arm received at least 90% of the planned cumulative dose of therapeutic antibody. The median duration of treatment with rituximab and obinutuzumab during maintenance was the same in the two arms (92 weeks).

Overall, AEs are more frequently observed in the G-chemo arm. This is not unexpected and is in line with  the  previous  findings  in  studies  with  obinutuzumab.  However,  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to withdrawal of study treatment is considered similar. Thus, even though AEs occur more frequently in the G-chemo, patients seem to adhere to treatment. Looking at AEs with an incidence rate of at least 10%,  the  most  relevant  differences  are  seen  with  regard  to  neutropenia,  diarrhoea,  pyrexia  and infusion related reactions (IRR). These are all well-known AEs related to anti-CD20 antibodies and are adequately reflected in the SmPC. Looking at the AEs reported with a difference of at least 2%, it is observed  that  the  difference  in  neutropenia  does  not  translate  into  a  relevant  difference  in  terms febrile  neutropenia.  Differences  are  observed  with  regard  to  other  AEs,  but  none  are  considered clinically significant and the majority of these AEs are adequately handled in the clinical setting.

More  AEs  occurred  during  induction  phase,  where  the  majority  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  were  observed. During both induction, maintenance and follow-up, more AEs occurred in the G-chemo arm. This is as expected and do not pose any major clinical concerns or challenges.

There are no relevant difference between the two treatment arms in terms of Grade 1-3 and 5 AEs was reported, however, a significant difference is observed in Grade 4 AEs. The updated data as of clinical cutoff of 10 September 2016 showed consistency between these data and the primary analysis data concerning  the  AEs,  SAEs,  fatal  AEs,  and  resolved  AEs.  A  difference  less  than  2%  was  reported  in either sex compared with the overall FL patient population.

No significant difference in safety between the two treatment arms was observed related to gender. With regard to age, there seems to be more SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and death in patients &gt;=65 years, which was expected.

With regard to adverse events of particular/special interest IRR, a well-known AE related to anti-CD20 antibodies, is more frequently observed in patients treated with obinutuzumab, especially during the first  couple  of  cycles  of  treatment.  Most  of  the  IRR  resolved  with  either  treatment  modifications  or spontaneously.  IRR  is  well  described  in  the  SmPC,  were  precautionary  measures  in  terms  of premedication are given.

Neutropenia was another adverse event of particular/special interest; slightly more Grade 3 and 4 AEs are observed in the G-chemo arm. This is not unexpected. No Grade 5 AEs are observed. Neutropenia in itself is not a major concerns, however, prolonged neutropenia give rise to more infections. Overall,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

more infections and Grade 3-5 infections were reported in the G-chemo arm compared to the R-chemo arm.  The incidence of Grade 3-5 infections was lower among G-chemo patients who received G-CSF prophylaxis compared with those who did not. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) could be considered in  patients  who  experience  neutropenia.The  incidence  and  rate  of  infection  is  higher  for obinutuzumab  compared  to  rituximab,  also  in  the  maintenance  phase.  This  could  be  related  to prolonged B-cell depletion and longer recovery. Patients that received bendamustine seems to be at higher risk. Updated B-cell assessments as of data cutoff of 10-september-2016 are still immature and no conclusion can be drawn. B-cell depletion and recovery data will be submitted in the final clinical study report.

Serious cardiac AEs were reported in 2.0 % of patients in the R-chemo arm and 4.4% in the G-chemo arm;  the  imbalance  between  the  arms  was  largely  due  to  more  reports  of  atrial  fibrillation, bradycardia, and acute myocardial infarction (mostly in elderly patients with previous or concurrent coronary disease) in the G-chemo arm.

When IRRs were excluded the difference in the incidence of cardiac events was reduced. The number of  cardiac  Grade  3-5  and  serious  AEs  in  patients  without  cardiac  conditions  was  low  and  balanced between arms. Overall, the risk of cardiac events in patients with pre-existing conditions is notable, and  these  patients  should  be  monitored  closely  if  treated  with  obinutuzumab.  This  is  adequately reflected in the SmPC. The updated cardiac AEs were similar to the first analysis. The numbers are small and overall a similar proportion of patients had cardiac grade 3-5 events in both treatment arms when cardiac IRRs were excluded. Most patients in the R-chemo and G-chemo arms with grade 3-5 cardiac  events  had  predisposing  factors,  hypertension  being  the  most  frequent,  other  factors  were diabetes  and  pre-existing  cardiac  conditions.  The  4  fatal  events  were  in  patients  who  received bendamustine during induction. Patients who receive bendamustine are often more frail compared to those who receive CHOP. The cardiac events are adequately reflected in the SmPC.

With regard to secondary malignancies, there are slightly more events in the G-chemo arm, 6.0% in the R-chemo arm and 7.9% in the G-chemo arm comparable to the proportion observed in the primary analysis.    Although,  no  apparent  pattern  can  be  observed,  hematological  malignancies  were  only observed  in  the  G-chemo  arm.  The  number  for  each  different  cancer  is  small,    it  could  be  chance findings  and  was  driven  mainly  by  a  difference  in  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  and  hematological malignancies.  Cytogenetic  tests  performed  in  patients  with  secondary  AML/MDS,  however  were inconclusive as to whether the cases were treatment related or de novo.

With  regard  to  other  adverse  events  of  particular/special  interest  (thrombocytopenia,  TLS,  GI perforation) no clinically relevant differences were observed.

There  was  a  higher  rate  of  thrombocytopenia  in  the  G-chemo  arm  compared  to  the  R-chemo  arm, especially in cycle 1, but the incidence of hemorrhage was low. Patients should be carefully monitored as addressed in the SmPC.  Concomitant treatment with agents like platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants  could  increase  the  risk.    Thrombocytopenia  was  only  seen  in  few  patients  in  the maintenance phase.  This AE is known with Gazyvaro.

The  risk  of  TLS  is  already  flagged  in  the  FL  population.  Patients  considered  at  risk  should  receive prophylaxis. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

Hepatitis B reactivation is a known risk of anti-CD20 antibodies. The numbers are small, but seems comparable  between  the  treatment  groups.  Screening  should  be  performed  and  local  guidelines followed. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC. No case of PML was observed.

The above findings are also reflected in the pattern of SAEs and Grade 3-5 AEs, where more are seen in the G-chemo arm, mainly driven by infections, neutropenia, IRR and thrombocytopenia. Overall, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher toxicity of obinutuzumab compared to rituximab is as expected from the mechanism of action and seems manageable.

Updated data with regard to secondary malignancies, showed slightly  more  events  in  the  G-chemo arm:  6.0%  in  the  R-chemo  arm  and  7.9%  in  the  G-chemo  arm.  Hematological  malignancies malignancies (Hodgkin disease, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) were only observed in the G-chemo arm.  Although no clear pattern in the type  of  tumor  and  the  onset,  latency,  or  chemotherapy  regimen,  in  either  treatment  arm  was observed,  the  difference  was  mainly  driven  by  a  difference  in  non-melanoma  skin  cancers  and hematological  malignancies.  Cytogenetic  tests  performed  in  patients  with  secondary  AML/MDS, however were inconclusive as to whether the cases were treatment related or de novo.

The frequency of death was similar in the R-chemo and G-chemo arm, (3.4% vs. 4.0%, respectively). The causes of death due to adverse events are overall as expected and with no apparent differences between treatment arms. However, the number of deaths and number of AEs with fatal outcome in the R-Benda and G-Benda arm are high compared to the other chemo backbones. This is in contrast to common clinical understanding of the safety profile of bendamustine, which is considered to be more tolerable  than  CHOP  and  CVP.  The  updated  analysis  as  of  clinical  cutoff  date  10  september  2016 revealed  1  more  patient  in  the  R-benda  subgroup  with  a  fatal  outcome.    Although  small  numbers, more  patients  in  the  R-benda  and  G-benda  subgroup  were  confounded  by  older  age  &gt;  80  years, baseline  comorbidity  and/or  new  anti-lymphoma  treatment  than  patients  in  the  CHOP  subgroups. Thus no specific cause could be identified which could explain the higher incidence of fatal AEs  in the G-benda (5.9%)and R-benda (4.4%) subgroup, when compared to patients who received CVP- and CHOP-containing regimens (range of 1.6% to 2.0%).

No concerns regarding anti-drug antibodies were identified.

No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with obinutuzumab. This is acceptable as such interactions are not expected with this monoclonal antibody. A comparison of serum pharmacokinetic  parameters  from  studies  of  obinutuzumab  monotherapy  with  pharmacokinetic parameters from studies of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (BO21000) suggests that concomitant chemotherapy has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab.

Delayed reporting of AEs was reported, however this was widely spread and not confined to specific sites with no trends detected. Updated safety data as of the 5 th  May 2017 showed an increase of adverse events between the snapshot dates 29 April 2016 and 5 May 2017 by 8.3 % and 7.9 % in the R-chemo arm and G-chemo arm respectively. The number of patients with any AE (all grades), Grade 3-5 AEs, Fatal AEs, SAEs or AE leading to withdrawal from any treatment was only slightly affected and did not differ between the treatments.  The updated safety data did not cause a difference between treatment arms of ≥ 2 %. An increase in number of patients experiencing a Grade 3-5 AE of 2.2 % in the R-chemo arm and 2.0 % in the G-chemo arm was mainly driven by neutropenia. The incidence of neutropenia is highest in the G-chemo arm.  No differences between treatment arms was identified by AE grade, nature or severity. The incidence by treatment phase and by chemotherapy was also unaffected by the safety update. The small numerical differences in incidences caused by the safety update did not change the overall safety profile of either treatment and no concerning changes in incidences between treatments has been identified.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics and section 4.8 has been updated accordingly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The final report from study BO21223 as foreseen in the RMP- focus on safety updates; events of thrombocytopenia, late onset and prolonged neutropenia, prolonged B-cell depletion, immunogenicity, will be specifically investigated.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, the safety of the combination of obinutuzumab with chemotherapy is acceptable and as expected. There are more AEs and SAEs, but the withdrawal rates are comparable between the two treatment arms, thus, indicating that patients adhered to treatment. The observed toxicities are manageable in clinical practice.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

-  Within this procedure, the MAH has submitted an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP version 3.0) and based on the latest approved RMP (version 2.2), including data from the pivotal study BO21223/GALLIUM in previously untreated patients with advanced follicular lymphoma as well as data from the supportive study BO21000/GAUDI.

In addition, the MAH proposed to update the due date for the final clinical study report of study BO21223/GALLIUM listed in the Gazyvaro Risk Management Plan \"Category 3: Required additional pharmacovigilance activities'.

The PRAC considered the risk management plan version 3.1 to be acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment reports are attached.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

-  No  significant  changes  impacting  the  readability  of  the  package  leaflet  are  made.  The  new additions follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the approved package leaflet.
-  The  target  group  of  users  has  not  fundamentally  changed:  the  age  range  of  patients  with previously untreated follicular lymphoma is similar to the age range of participants interviewed during  the  Gazyvaro  user  test.  Gazyvaro  is  already  approved  in  the  follicular  lymphoma setting.
-  Moreover,  posology  proposed  in  this  application  does  not  essentially  differ  to  the  currently approved follicular lymphoma indication.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

This is a type II variation to extend the indication of GAZYVARO in combination with chemotherapy, followed  by  Gazyvaro  maintenance  therapy  in  patients  achieving  a  response,  for  the  treatment  of patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma.

The  MAH  has  provided  the  interim  results  of  one  pivotal,  randomized,  open-label,  Phase  III  study BO21223 (GALLIUM) in patients with previously untreated advanced indolent non -Hodgkin lymphoma NHL.  Obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  significantly  decreases  the  risk  of  relapse compared to R-chemo with HR for PFS at 0.66, p-value 0.0012. In a disease characterized by several relapses,  where  the patient  finally  becomes  refractory  to the  different  chemotherapy  agents, this  is clinically highly relevant, as time-to relapse is further postponed. Secondary endpoints, such as EFS, DOR and TTNALT are consistent with the primary endpoint and show a benefit in favour of G-chemo. With  regard  to  DFS,  as  expected  in  a  disease  entity  with  a  relatively  long  survival,  data  are  not mature, but there is no indication of any detrimental effect.

The median PFS by INV was not reached in any arm at the time of analysis. Due to the course of FL, median PFS may take considerable long time to reach. An updated analysis after 6.6 months additional median follow-up with a data cut-off of 10 September 2016 was performed. The investigator-assessed PFS increased to 281/370 = 76% of total planned events with a HR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.87), p=0.0016, being consistent with the primary analysis. The HR estimate for secondary time-to-event endpoints are consistent with data from the primary analysis. OS data were also consistent with the primary analysis, showing no significant effect of G-chemo as compared to R-chemo. A PFS blinded assessment was performed by an Independent review committee (IRC) in order to support primary outcomes  resulting  in  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.71  -  in  the  range  of  the  expected  reduction  risk  in  FL population,  but  not  statistically  significant  in  regard  to  the  type-1  error  set  in  the  trial  for  the  3 rd interim  analysis  (0.012).    The  concordance  rate between  the  two  analyses  is  considered  acceptable and in line with what has previously been accepted. The study was stopped for efficacy based on IDMC recommendations as planned and described in the protocol.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

There seems to be no difference between G-chemo and R-chemo in patients with FLIPI score low, but patients with FLIPI score low only comprised 21% of the ITT population and no explanation could be found as to why obinutuzumab had no added effect in the FLIPI low score subgroup. This information was reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

There are no data on the activity of Gazyvaro in Follicular Lymphoma grade 3b patients. These patients were excluded from the clinical studies GALLIUM and GOYA, (see SmPC section 5.1) as in clinical practice they are more aggressively treated, similar to DLBCL. Data from DLBCL patients from the GOYA trial indicated similar activity for Gazyvaro and Rituximab in patients with DLBCL.

Update on the overall survival data (still immature at the time of the updated analysis) will be provided with the final report from Study BO21223 (see RMP).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Overall, AEs are more frequently observed in the G-chemo arm. This is not unexpected and is in line

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  the  previous  findings  in  studies  with  obinutuzumab.  However,  the  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to withdrawal of study treatment is considered similar. Thus, even though AEs occur more frequently in the G-chemo, patients seem to adhere to treatment. Looking at AEs with an incidence rate of at least 10%,  the  most  relevant  differences  are  seen  with  regard  to  neutropenia,  diarrhoea,  pyrexia  and infusion related reactions (IRR). These are all well-known AEs related to anti-CD20 antibodies and are adequately reflected in the SmPC.

More  AEs  occurred  during  induction  phase,  where  the  majority  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  were  observed. During both induction, maintenance and follow-up, more AEs occurred in the G-chemo arm. This is as expected and do not pose any major clinical concerns or challenges.

Slightly  more  Grade  3  and  4  AEs  are  observed  in  the  G-chemo  arm.  This  is  not  unexpected. Neutropenia  in  itself  is  not  a  major  concerns,  however,  prolonged  neutropenia  give  rise  to  more infections.  Overall,  more  infections  and  Grade  3-5  infections  were  reported  in  the  G-chemo  arm compared to  the  R-chemo  arm.    The  incidence  of  Grade  3-5  infections  was  lower  among  G-chemo patients who received G-CSF prophylaxis compared with those who did not. Thus Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) could be considered in patients who experience neutropenia.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Considering that the results from the subgroup analysis in FLIPI low patients are currently inconclusive, section 4.4 of the SmPC was amended to include a recommendation that the therapy choice in these patients should take into account the overall safety profile of obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy and the patient situation. Final report from Study BO21223 will provide more information on adverse events such as thrombocytopenia, late onset and prolonged neutropenia, prolonged B-cell depletion and immunogenicity (see RMP).

Subgroup  analyses  of  outcome  by  chemotherapy  backbone  showed  that  the  number  of  deaths  and number of AEs with fatal outcome in the R-Benda and G-Benda arm are higher compared to the other chemo backbones. Although small numbers, patients in the R-benda and G-benda subgroup were of older age &gt; 80 years and had more baseline comorbidity and/or new anti-lymphoma treatment than patients in the CHOP subgroups.  No specific cause could be identified which could explain the higher incidence  of  fatal  AEs   in  the  G-benda  (5.9%)and  R-benda  (4.4%)  subgroup,  when  compared  to patients  who  received  CVP-  and  CHOP-containing  regimens  (range  of  1.6%  to  2.0%).  Final  study report is expected to provide mature data (see RMP).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The PFS gain is considered clinically meaningful for patients with FL with HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.87), p=0.0016 from the updated analysis - consistent with the primary analysis (HR = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.85]).  Overall survival data are as expected immature at this stage, but will be updated at the final CSR.

There  are  no  new  safety  findings  and  the  observed  toxicities  are  overall  manageable  in  the  clinical setting.  However,  the  adverse  event  profile  of  obinutuzumab  including  uncertainties  (i.e.  risk  of secondary malignancies) is in line with well-known so far safety in CLL.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Data  to  support  the  efficacy  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  patients  with previously untreated FL are provided from one pivotal Phase III study (study BO21223/GALLIUM), with additional data from the supporting study BO21000 (GAUDI). Study BO21223, showed that treatment with obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in  the risk  of progression or death  as  assessed by  the  investigator,  compared

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  rituximab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  The  results  of  the  primary  endpoint  are  further supported by the key secondary endpoint, PFS by IRC. Due to the course of FL, median PFS may take considerable long time to reach, however the difference in PFS between the two treatment arms in patients with FL, favoring obinutuzumab +chemo  followed by obinutuzumab maintenance is statistically significant and clinically important and seems robust.  Results from secondary endpoints are consistent with the primary endpoint. OS data in the updated analysis were also consistent with the primary analysis, showing no difference in the effect of G-chemo as compared to R-chemo. The Applicant  will  provide  updated  efficacy  data  including  OS  data  at  the  time  of  the  final  analysis  post authorisation.

Obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy induction followed by obinutuzumab maintenance in patients with previously-untreated  FL  was  associated  with  a  tolerable  and  manageable  safety  profile.  Overall,  no unexpected safety signals were detected in study BO21223 or study BO21000.

The final study report from the pivotal study will be provided.
