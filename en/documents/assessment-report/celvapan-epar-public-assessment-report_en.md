## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain to which most or all humans are immunologically naïve emerges to cause clinically apparent illness and then spreads easily from person to person worldwide. Pandemics are different from seasonal outbreaks of influenza, as the latter are caused by subtypes of influenza viruses that are already circulating in the world whereas pandemics are caused by new subtypes or by subtypes that have not circulated among people for a long time. Specific  guidance  has  been  developed  for  the  fast  track  assessment  procedure  for  pandemic  influenza vaccines 1 , which can only be used once WHO/EU have officially declared the pandemic (WHO Phase 6 onwards). The procedure involves the submission and evaluation of a core pandemic dossier during the inter-pandemic period, followed by a fast track assessment of the data for replacing the mock-up vaccine strain with the recommended pandemic strain as a variation to the MAA. Baxter AG has submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (core pandemic dossier) for Celvapan in line with the above mentioned guidelines. Celvapan is a whole virion inactivated influenza vaccine, which is produced in Vero cells and employing a wild type virus H5N1strain. The final vaccine comprises 7.5µg of HA antigen of strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (or A/Indonesia/05/2005) per 0.5 ml dose and is presented in a 10-dose vial with no preservative added. Celvapan is indicated for prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance. Unlike  for  the  seasonal  vaccine,  a  single  immunization  is  expected  not  to  be  sufficient  to  achieve protection,  since  in  a  pandemic  situation  vaccinees  will  be  most  likely  immunologically  naïve  for  the pandemic  influenza  strain.  Thus,  the  proposed  vaccination  schedule  is  intended  to  be  two  0.5  ml intramuscular injections with an interval of 3 weeks for individuals from 18 years of age and older. From  an  epidemiological  point  of  view  it  is  very  unlikely  that  influenza  strain  A/Vietnam  /1203/2004 would be the next pandemic strain, since the H5N1 virus continues to undergo antigenic drift. It is also possible that the next pandemic will not be caused by a H5N1 virus but will be due to another subtype of influenza virus (e.g. with haemagglutinin of type H2, H7 or H9). In line with the core dossier concept, a variation would therefore have to be submitted to introduce the WHO/EU recommended strain, prepared from the influenza virus causing the pandemic, prior to use of Celvapan in a pandemic. Celvapan is not indicated for prophylactic use during the pre-pandemic period. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Celvapan is a Vero cell-derived, monovalent, whole virion, inactivated vaccine containing 7.5 µg/dose of Haemagglutinin (HA).

For details on the composition of Celvapan please refer to Table 1. Table 1. Composition of Celvapan Active Substance The  Active  Substance  is  an  aqueous  solution  containing  Vero  cell-derived,  formaldehyde-  and  UVinactivated, and sucrose gradient purified whole virions of influenza virus. Additional components of the Active Substance are Tween 80, Sodium Chloride and Tris-buffer (TBS, containing Trometamol). · Manufacturer All  manufacturing  steps  of  Celvapan  are  performed  in  Baxter  facilities  under  Good  Manufacturing Practice  (GMP)  conditions.  The  involved  facilities  Baxter  AG  in  Orth/Donau;  Austria  and  Baxter BioScience  s.r.o.  in  Jevany  Bohumil,  Czech  republic  hold  current  GMP  licenses  (Manufacturing Authorisations). The specific development work was performed with H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005. The production process using the Vero cell technology can be divided into four main stages: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -Vero Cell Propagation
- -Virus Propagation and Harvesting
- -Inactivation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## -Purification and sterile Filtration

In the upstream processing, cells are produced and then infected with the respective influenza virus (i.e. H5N1). Then the virus is harvested and inactivated by sequential formaldehyde and Ultraviolet Irradiation (UV)  inactivation  steps.  Two  separate  inactivation  steps  were  designed  for  two  separate  targets  i.e. primarily protein for formaldehyde and nucleic acid as a target for UV irradiation. In Purification I, the product is concentrated and purified using ultra-centrifugation with a sucrose gradient. During Purification II, the product is homogenized and sucrose and further impurities are removed by ultrafiltration. The final stage of Active Substance manufacture is the sterile filtration of the Monovalent Bulk.

· Control of Materials The following starting materials used in the production of monovalent bulk are of biological origin: Vero cell line used in the production of viral antigens and Influenza virus seed. The H5N1 working seed is derived from the Strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and Strain A/Indonesia/05/2005. The  different  Vero  cell  populations  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB),  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  and  Post Production  Cell  Bank  (PPCB)  were  tested  for  characterisation  and  safety  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  5.2.3. including  DNA  fingerprinting  on  MCB,  WCB,  and  PPCB.  Mycoplasma  testing  by  indicator  DNA fluorochrome test or by cultivation assay. Morphology examination, extraneous agents testing  and tests for bacterial and fungal contamination and retroviruses. In conclusion the testing panel on the cell bank system provide assurance that the cell banks can be considered free of extraneous agents according to Ph. Eur. 5.2.3. Extraneous Agents were evaluated in vitro and in vivo . In vitro testing of the neutralized Vietnam strain Production Virus Banks, both from the Orth and Bohumil facility, confirmed the absence of extraneous agents in the Production Virus Banks. Additionally  the  Applicant  studied  the  evaluation  of  feasibility  to  completely  neutralize  H5N1  for  the purpose  of  extraneous  agents in  vivo testing  on  the  Production  Virus  Banks  of  the  Vietnam  strain,  as sufficient neutralisation of the virus banks is a prerequisite for the performance of the in vivo testing. The neutralized  samples  were  inoculated  into  appropriate  numbers  of  adult  mice,  suckling  mice  and  guinea pigs as per Ph. Eur. Animals were observed for the requested time period for signs of disease or death. The suckling mice study was considered to have been completed successfully in compliance with Ph.Eur. 2.6.16. The currently ongoing studies in guinea pigs and adult mice will be finalized by March 2009 and results will be provided as follow-up measures. In addition the extraneous agents test program for virus banks  of  a  future  pandemic  strain  will  be  revised  to  be  fully  in  line  with  Ph.  Eur  2308.  In  conclusion sufficient data on extraneous agents testing in vitro and in vivo as well as by PCR have been generated to demonstrate absence of extraneous agents. The excipients of animal origin, Trypsin and Cytodex, are used in the production of the Active Substance. The  two  animal  components  and  the  manufacturing  process  itself  (including  media  used  in  equipment with direct contact with the product) have been evaluated according to the relevant guidelines and found to present no risk of TSE transmission. Biological reagents involved in routine manufacture of the active substance do not contain components of bovine origin. · Process validation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Production of the Active Substance starts with the Vero Cell Inoculum and the Production Virus Bank. Quality control testing is performed on intermediate products at the following steps:

- -Vero cell culture in Fermenter step 3 prior to infection

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Fermentation Broth
- -Formaldehyde Treated Virus Harvest
- -Purified Monovalent Virus Harvest (PMVH) as the result of Purification I

Critical steps in the production of the Active Substance are those associated with viral safety and sterility. These  include  tests  for  inactivation  with  formaldehyde,  inactivation  by  UV  light,  control  of  total inactivation  process  and  sterile  filtration,  which  has  been  tested  through  filtration  contact  time,  filter integrity and sterility according to Ph.Eur.

The biological characterisation of the inactivated whole virus vaccine Active Substance was carried out by determining the haemagglutination (HA) titre and the infectious titre. For this purpose the egg infectious dose  50  (EID50/mL)  as  well  as  the  plaque  forming  units  (pfu/mL)  were  determined.  Additionally  the Applicant  also  detected  the  neuraminidase  (NA)  activity.  The  Applicant  tested  whether  egg-derived influenza virus vaccine strains would differ from the vero cell derived ones with respect to their biological characterisation, however, no significant differences could be detected.

Validation  studies  for  Celvapan  were  based  on  the  H5N1  Influenza  strains  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  and A/Indonesia/05/2005.  The  validation  of  Active  Substance  manufacture  has  been  carried  out  with  the Vietnam/1203/2004 strain. The occurrence of human infections with Clade 2 H5N1 influenza strains in Indonesia, and the high mortality rate (56 %) associated with these infections, has prompted Baxter to also produce a whole virus H5N1 influenza candidate vaccine based on the Clade 2 A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain for a clinical Phase 1 study, which was used to validate the formulation and filling process steps. The validation of WCB production was performed retrospectively on all relevant WCBs produced in the last  years  at  the  Orth/Austria  facility.  The  WCB  lots  listed  in  the  dossier  were  used  for  production  of material for clinical trials of several investigational products, e.g. pandemic and interpandemic influenza, SARS  and  Ross  River  vaccine.  In  conclusion,  sufficient  information  has  been  provided  regarding  the specific WCB(s) used for production of Celvapan clinical trial material and conformance lots. All tests according  to  Ph.  Eur.  2308  and  5.2.3  have  been  conducted  and  were  included  in  the  specification  for production of future Working Cell Banks. Process  validation  of  the  Vero  Cell  Inoculum  in  Bohumil  included  twelve  consecutive  lots.  The conformity of the cell propagation from 120 L up to 6000 L bioreactors was tested on three consecutive lots for the purpose of the Process Validation of the Cell Propagation at different stages of Fermentation. These  results  demonstrated  that  different  lots  used  for  both  the  vero  cell  inoculation  and  fermentation process were found to be comparable. The  strain used  for  process validation covering  virus propagation,  harvest and  inactivation  was A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Clade 1). Three conformance lots were produced in the Bohumil facility and the results  confirmed  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process.  During  the  process  validation  for Celvapan production, it was verified that the manufacturing process of the virus propagation, harvest and inactivation, purification and transport conforms to the process validation protocols. In conclusion the data generated during process validation at both facilities Orth/Austria and Bohumil/Czech Republic demonstrated a consistent manufacturing process. · Characterisation and Specification The  biological,  immunological,  genetic  and  physicochemical  characterisation  included  a  comparison between egg-derived and vero-cell derived influenza virus seeds. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The genetic stability of the influenza virus grown in Vero cells versus egg derived virus was evaluated by comparing the genetic sequence of the Haemagglutinin gene sequence of an egg-derived Seed Virus Bank

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  that  of  a  Post  Production  Virus  developed  in  Vero  cells.  The  egg-derived  Seed  Virus  Bank  and  the Vero-derived post production virus preparations were identical on the DNA and on the amino acid level, demonstrating that once a recommended vaccine strain has been adapted to sufficient growth in eggs, no re-adaptation during the passages in serum free Vero cells occurs.

Immunological characterization was carried out on the egg derived and vero derived by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, neuraminidase inhibition (NAI)  assay and Western  blot analysis. Further immunological characterization was done by infection and immunization studies in mice with egg-derived and Vero-derived viruses and vaccines. Additionally, a challenge experiment was carried out in ferrets. There were generally no significant differences in HI titres between any of the samples from any season, egg-derived or Vero cell-derived. These results demonstrate that passages of egg-derived influenza virus on Vero cells do not change their antigenicity. The  physicochemical  characterization  was  carried  out  by  Coomassie  staining  of  the  viral  proteins, separated  by  polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  (PAGE).  The  protein  compositions  of  the  Vero  cellderived  influenza  virus  MVBs  were  comparable  to  those  of  the  egg-derived  NIBSC  standard  antigen reagents. The following product- and process-related impurities have been identified during the Active Substance manufacturing  process  and  are  routinely tested for  during  the  process:  Vero  Cell  DNA  during Manufacturing of Monovalent Bulk (MVB); Residual Vero Cell DNA in the Monovalent Bulk; Vero Host Cell Protein; residuals of formaldeyde, sucrose, trypsin and benzonase. The  agreed  specifications  for  the  monovalent  bulk  include  a  test  for  vero  cell  protein  via  ELISA,  the Haemagglutinin  assay  and  SRD  test  for  HA  protein,  the  Bradford  Method  for  total  protein,  the Haemagglutination  Inhibition  test,  H5N1  identity  test  using  RT  PCR,  a  safety  test  for  preparative influenza virus on Vero cells, a test for Tween 80 concentration via photometric detection, the LAL test for bacterial endotoxine and a sterility test. The specifications of the monovalent bulk have been sufficiently justified and are considered adequate. · Stability Stability  test  results  of  up  to  12  month  on  4  lots  of  Purified  Monovalent  Virus  Harvest  and  5  lots  of monovalent  bulk  have  been  provided.  An  apparent  decrease  in  protein  concentration  measured  by  the Bradford method was observed after 9 month with all MVBs produced to date. Therefore the shelf life of the monovalent bulk has been set at 6 month. The Applicant committed to provide the outcome of the his investigations regarding the decrease of total protein in the MVB and further results of stability studies on Monovalent Bulk as a follow up measure as soon as they become available.

Celvapan  finished  product  contains  the  formalin-  and  UV-inactivated,  purified  whole  virion  in  a formulation of 7.5 μ g HA/0.5 mL dose without adjuvant. The product is presented in a 10 mL glass vial of hydrolytic  type  I.  The  filling  volume  corresponds  to  a  content  of  10  doses  with  0.5  mL.  The  stopper consists of latex-free halogen-butyl rubber and is qualified by the supplier to be penetrated up to ten times. Overfilling of the vials by 0.85 mL minimum ensures that the nominal amount of product doses (10 doses per vial) can be drawn from the vial. Therefore, the 10 dose vial contains at least 5.85 mL of Medicinal product solution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  Applicant's  pharmaceutical  development  was  based  on  experience  with  various  influenza  strains, which have shown that individual strains exhibit different aggregation behaviour which results in losses during  sterile  filtration.  Therefore,  prior  to  sterile  filtration  a  homogenization  step  is  performed  in  the course of the Purification process. No additives or preservatives are added, except for Tween 80, which prevents re-aggregation of the virions. The  excipients Tris-buffered saline  (TBS  containing  Tris (Trometamol) and Sodium Chloride, Tris (Trometamol, 20 mM) as buffer, NaCl (137 mM) as electrolyte and Tween 80 detergent are used for the finished product (see Table 1).

Sterile Monovalent Bulks (MVB) are transported at +2 to +8 °C from the Bohumil facility in the Czech Republic  to  Vienna/Austria  for  formulation.  Tris-buffer  and  Tween  80  solution  are  delivered  from  the Orth/Austria facility to Lange Allee 51. The Bulk Medicinal product is prepared in a closed production system, which has been validated by media runs. The calculated amount of Tween 80 solution and TrisBuffer are sterile filtered into the formulation tank. No preservatives are added. The mobile tank is stored in a cold storage at 2-8 °C until filling. The Bulk Medicinal product is filled under clean room Class A conditions (EU cGMP Guide) in multi dose vials and the vials are stoppered and crimped under class A conditions  to  give  the  Final  Container  Product.  All  components  of  the  final  container  that  come  into contact  with  the  product  comply  with  the  respective  requirements  in  Ph.  Eur.,  USP,  and  ISO  standard

The most critical aspect of formulation and filling is to maintain sterility of the Medicinal product as the sterile  filtration  is  performed  at  the  final  stages  of  Active  Substance  preparation.  All  added  buffer solutions are sterile filtered directly prior to introduction into the formulation system. Primary container components  are  sterilized  and  the  vials  depyrogenized  before  filling.  The  second  critical  aspect  is  the homogeneity of the product throughout the filling process. This is guaranteed by continuous stirring of the formulation vessel. Formulation and filling steps are performed according to established and validated procedures. The Bulk Medicinal product is prepared in a closed production system that assures aseptic working conditions. The Bulk Medicinal product is filled clean room Class A conditions according to EU cGMP Guide, in multi dose vials and the vials are stoppered and crimped under class A conditions to give the Final Container Product. All components of the final container that come into contact with the product comply with the respective  requirements  in  USP,  Ph.  Eur.  and  ISO  standard  specifications  concerning  containers  for injectables. The  components  of  the  Medicinal  product  have  been  adequately  described  and  justified.  No  novel  or unusual excipients are used and the formulation development is supported by clinical development. The manufacturing  process  complies  with  standard  formulation  and  filling  procedures  used  for  inactivated viral vaccines. · Adventitious Agents No  materials  of  animal  origin  are  added  to  the  Active  Substance  in  the  manufacture  of  the  finished product.  Only  the  excipients  Tris-buffered  saline  and  Sodium  Chloride  and  Tween  80  are  used  for  the finished  product.  The  excipients  used  are  tested  for  sterility  using  membrane  filtration,  bacterial endotoxins  using  the  LAL  test,  pH,  conductivity  and  Tween  80  content.  The  analytical  methods  are performed according to Ph. Eur. where applicable and are validated according to ICH guidelines. The two excipients of animal origin, Trypsin and Cytodex, used in the production of the Active Substance have been evaluated and found to present no risk of TSE transmission. No biological reagents involved in routine manufacture of the active substance contain any components of bovine origin. Overall, sufficient data is provided to exclude a risk of TSE transmission through Celvapan. The risk of transmitting TSE by Celvapan is thus considered very remote. · Manufacture of the Product Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Product Specification

Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  Active  Substance  and  Medicinal  product have  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  the  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

The  quality  control  program  performed  on  the  Bulk  Medicinal  product  for  Celvapan  include  the  SRH Assay for quantification of haemagglutinin (HA), the Bradford assay to determine total protein,  a PCR test  for  detection  of  residual  Vero  cell  DNA,  an  ELISA test  for  residual  benzonase as well as  tests  for Tween 80 concentration,  sucrose,  formaldehyde,  ph  and  sterility.  Quality  control  testing  performed  on Final  Container  Product  consists  of  SRH  Assay  for  quantification  of  haemagglutinin  (HA),  extractable volume, ph, bacterial  endotoxin  using  the  LAL  test  and  sterility.  All  analytical  methods  are  performed according to Ph. Eur. where applicable and are validated according to ICH guidelines. To  overcome  a  possible  limitations  of  availability  of  SRD  reagents  during  a  pandemic  situation,  the Applicant developed  an alternative  haemagglutinin  (HA)  quantification  method  based  on  HPLC determination of the HA-1 subunit of the HA protein. The value determined with this HPLC testing is compared  to  results  of  Influenza  strains  where  SRD  reagents  are  available.      The  acceptability  of  the alternative  HPLC  method  was  subject  of  a  Scientific  Advice  and  was  assessed  to  be  acceptable.  The Applicant  has  committed  to  complete  the  validation  and  implementation  of  this  method  in  follow-up measures. Compliance  with  the  product  specifications  has  been  shown  on  three  conformance  lots  each,  the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain. The provided data is considered acceptable. · Stability of the Product The stability indicating parameters cover identity, potency and purity as well as general quality and safety parameters.  The  specifications  used  in  the  stability  studies  and  the  end  of  shelf  life  specifications,  are identical  with  the  acceptance  criteria  defined  in  the  release  specification  for  the  respective  production stage. Stability studies are performed using the actual final container (10 dose vials), except for the studies performed  on  clinical  Phase  1/2  material,  which  was  filled  in  single-dose  syringes  of  the  same  glass material. Based on the data currently available on the Pandemic Influenza Vaccine for Clinical Phase 1/2, Phase 3 and  Conformance  Batches  and  taking  the  experience  with  several  inter-pandemic  Vero  cell  derived Influenza Vaccine lots into consideration a shelf life of 12 months for the Medicinal product was accepted. To  investigate  the  source  of  an  apparent  upward  trend  of  the  HA  content  detected  in  the  SRD  assay stability of the H5N1 vaccine will be further addressed in a follow up measure. The open shelf life following the first withdrawal of a dose is the following: 'vial to be used within one vaccination session or within 3 hours, whichever is less' Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Active Substance Medicinal product no longer authorised

Introduction Pharmacology studies evaluated both the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the vaccines in small animals. Mice s.c. immunized with the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 candidate vaccines developed anti-H5 HAspecific antibodies as well as functional antibodies (HI and/or MN titers), and survived the challenge with homologous or heterologous (clade 2.1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 or clade 3 A/HongKong/156/1997) strains. The  vaccines  werealso  demonstrated  to  be  immunogenic  in  rats  and  guinea  pigs  in  terms  of  all  three serological  tests  (H5  specific  binding  ELISA,  HI  and  MN  assay).  Immune  antisera  raised  against  nonGMP research material in guinea pigs cross-neutralized an array of heterologous H5N1 strains (3x Clade 1,  1x  Clade  2.1,  2x  Clade  2.2,  1x  Clade  3,  and  H5N3)  in  vitro.  Further  supportive  data  on  the immunogenicity and (cross-)protective efficacy were generated in small animals (mice, guinea pigs: s.c., preclinical materials) with the A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 candidate vaccines. Pharmacology · Primary Pharmacodynamics Two ferret challenge studies demonstrated protective efficacy against a homologous challenge with  2.1 x 10 6 TCID50 in the ferrets previously immunised using a clinical lot of H5N1 vaccine prepared from strain A/Vietnam (Lot VNV1G001A, 7.5µg HA) and using the intended route and time interval. Whereas all animals in the control group receiving buffer died 4 to 7 days after administration of the challenge dose, 100% of ferrets in the vaccine group survived challenge. Data on virus recovery from post-mortem tissues confirmed that every animal in the control and vaccine group demonstrated some level of virus replication either  in  nasal  wash  or  in  one  or  more  tissues.  At  moribund  sacrifice,  all  animals  of  the  control  cohort except one had high titres of virus in the lungs (between 3.8 to 6.4 logs TCID50 per gram of tissue), liver (4.3 to 5.9 logs TCID50 per gram), brain (2.9 to 4.9 logs TCID50 per gram) and olfactory bulb (5.4 to 7.1 logs TCID50 per gram). One animal only had virus recovered from the nasal wash and the liver (4.3 logs TCID50 per gram) and was found to have an atypical course of infection. The animals of the vaccinated cohort,  having all  survived  to  day  14,  had  for  the  most  part  cleared  virus  from    every  tissue  examined except the liver. There was an absence of detectable virus in the lungs of all but one animal and in the brain of all but two animals. All olfactory bulbs taken from the vaccinated ferrets were negative for virus. The viral titres in the livers of the vaccinated ferrets were lower (between 3.5 to 4.4 logs TCID50 per gram) than for the control cohort (4.3 to 5.9 logs TCID50 per gram). In general disease symptoms were mitigated in the vaccinated ferrets compared with the control group, i.e. reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of necrosis in the brain and olfactory bulb.

Protection against homologous or heterologous challenge was investigated using ferrets immunised with a Clade 2 strain A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine. Sixty-six animals were divided into 6 cohorts and received either a dose of 7.5µg HA, 3.75µg HA or buffer on days 0 and 21. Animals were challenged intranasally with  either  A/Indonesia/05/2005  (1.0x10 5 TCID50,  1  log  lower  as  targeted)  or  A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (1.5x10 6 TCID50) on day 35. Both the high and low doses of A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine were shown to be efficacious with 100% survival, reduced incidence of fever, reduced weight loss, reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological changes in the vaccinated cohorts following homologous challenge. However, due to the low challenge dose, 2 out of 8 animals in the control group survived the homologous challenge. Cross-protection  against  a  heterologous  challenge  indicated  a  vaccine  dose-dependent  survival  as compared to the control cohort. All control animals infected with A/Vietnam/1203/04 died between days 3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 7 following heterologous challenge, while 38% of animals vaccinated with 2 doses of 7.5µg HA and 63% of  animals  vaccinated  with  2  doses  of  3.75µg  HA  died  between  days  6  and  10.  Similarly  to  the homologous challenge, vaccination reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological changes against a heterologous challenge. Moreover, there is some evidence that survival correlates with absence of viremia since  hepatic  inflammatory  necrosis  was  not  found  in  any  of  the  ferrets  which  survived  14  days  post challenge.

The repeat-dose toxicity study performed in CD rats was a pivotal GLP study and is considered appropriate for toxicity evaluation (local and systemic). In this study, an appropriate number of animals per sex per group was included and relevant vaccine exposure (clinical lot, intramuscular route, 3x injections at a dose of either 24 µg HA with alum or 36 µg HA without adjuvant) given. The study consisted of a main study arm (32 days) and a 2-week recovery arm (46 days). The induction of relevant, functional immune response was provided by the induction of  functional immune response (HI titers, on

· Secondary pharmacodynamics Secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  not  performed.  This  approach  is  in  accordance  with  the relevant guidelines, note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. · Safety Pharmacology No studies were conducted as no specific concerns in physiological functions are raised. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No studies were conducted. Pharmacokinetics Experimental  studies  to  demonstrate  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of  the  active ingredients in Celvapan  have  not  been  performed.  This  is  in line with the relevant guidelines CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03. Toxicology The non-clinical toxicological testing program comprises a literature-based risk assessment of Tween 80 (Polysorbate  80),  a  non-GLP  rabbit  pyrogenicity  study,  a  GLP  single-dose  toxicity  study  and  a  GLP pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  which  local  tolerance  assessment  was  included.  This  program  is considered  to  meet  sufficiently  the  requirements  of  Regulatory  Guideline  on  'core  dossier  approach  to registration of pandemic influenza vaccines' (CPMP/VEG/4717/03). · Single-dose toxicity The GLP single-dose toxicity study assessed the acute toxicity and local tolerance of the candidate vaccine after single intramuscular injection in Wistar rats. In this study, the vaccine used was Pre-clinical 100L GMP material, and both adjuvanted (0.2% alum, 30 µg HA) and non-adjuvanted (45 µg HA) formulations were tested. No treatment-related systemic and local reactions (except the expected microscopical findings at the injection sites) were noted. However, the potency of these preparations in the tested rat strain is not known and the magnitude of immune responses to vaccines after single intramuscular injection was not shown.

day 32 and 46). Overall, no treatment-related effects were observed on general conditions, clinical signs (including injection sites), body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, urine analysis, haematology, clinical chemistry, bone marrow, gross macroscopical pathology, or organ weight. However, dosedependent or treatment-related abnormalities in two clinical pathology parameters were noted: one was a slight but statistically significant increase in the liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) and the other is slight but statistically significant decrease in plasma calcium, both occurring in male animals. These changes are small at group mean levels, however, some individual ALT values reached 2-fold increase relative to concurrent controls and many individual plasma calcium values were found out of the range of control values. Whether these variations are within the limits of biological variability of these clinical parameters in the tested animal strain is unknown. Histology analysis (in this study, that is liver on day 46, and parathyroid gland and bone on days 32 and 46) has not been performed.

Also  in  this  pivotal  toxicity  study  it  was  found  that  the  mean  weights  of  lungs  and  bronchi  (absolute change)  were  lower  and  of  the  thyroids  (adapted  change)  were  higher  in  females  treated  with  nonadjuvanted vaccine in comparison with concurrent control. A relationship of this change with treatment is difficult  to  determine, because  the  finding was only observed on one occasion (day 46). The Applicant considered the finding to be of doubtful toxicological importance, and justified the statement by providing new histological data for thyroids/parathyroids and lungs and bronchi in the recovery group animals (Day 46).  There  were  no  abnormal  findings  or  treatment-related  changes  in  the  concerned  organ/tissues,  and therefore  it  is  considered  that  the  slight  changes  seen  in  the  weights  of  these  organs  were  of  less toxicological importance. · Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity No studies on genotoxicity and carcinogenicity were conducted with the candidate vaccines. · Reproduction Toxicity A reproductive and developmental toxicity study is scheduled but the data are not available for the time being.  This  is  acceptable  according  to  the  relevant  guidelines.  A  rat  study  with  A/Indonesia/05/2005 candidate  vaccine  was  initiated  in  March,  2008  and  the  final  study  report  was  available  in  November, 2008. Another rat study with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 candidate vaccine was initiated in August, 2008 and the  final  study  report  will  be  available  in  April,  2009.  This  timetable  is  considered acceptable,  as  for  a mock-up pandemic vaccine having such data before authorization is not necessary. · Local tolerance See single-dose studies. · Other toxicity studies A  non-GLP  rabbit  pyrogenicity  study  investigated  the  pyrogenicity  characteristics  of  the  H5N1  whole viral candidate vaccine in comparison with a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine, Vaxigrip, as a Standard Reference. In this study, the vaccine formulation used (final container sample) and the vaccine exposure (i.v., 5 human doses) were relevant. Two separate tests (12 rabbits in total) suggested that the candidate vaccine is non-pyrogenic. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Medicinal product no longer authorised

Introduction The initial submission was based upon two clinical studies 810501 and 810601 that are summarized in Table 1. Both studies are multi-center uncontrolled studies. Whereas in study 810501 different vaccines formulations containing H5N1 whole virion inactivated antigen derived from Vero cells were investigated in adults aged 18-45 years study 810601 employed the final formulation in two age groups - healthy adults (18-59 years) and elderly (60 years and older). For the primary  vaccination series  H5N1  strain  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  was  used  to  prepare  the investigational  vaccine,  whereas  for  the  booster  immunizations  strain  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  (clade1, Month 6 booster), and strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 (clade 2; Month 6, M12, M24 booster) were used to prepare the prototype vaccine. In study 810601 vaccine derived from both strains were administered for the booster immunisations, whereas in study 810703 - the follow-up of subjects enrolled in study 810501 - 7.5µg HA of vaccine prepared from strain A/Indonesia was given as booster immunisation.

| • evaluation of cell mediated immunity (Part E) Study ongoing   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

Interim clinical reports were planned for study 810501 following the primary immunisation series and at 6 months after first vaccination in order to get information on antibody persistence. For 810501 two clinical study reports (Part A alone, and Part A and B combined) were submitted containing the analyses after completion  of  the  primary  series  and  analyses  for  antibody  persistence  up  to  6  months  after  primary vaccination.  The  6-months  safety  analysis  and  analysis  of  cellular  immune  responses  were  available during the procedure (Part C). For  study  810601  an  interim  report  after  completion  of  the  primary  immunisation  series  (Part  A)  was submitted in the initial marketing authorisation application. Results on antibody persistence derived from study  810601  and  the  6-months  booster  immunisations  of  study  810601  and  12-15  month  booster immunisation of study 810703 were available during the procedure. Parts C and D of the study 810601 are ongoing and the anticipated completion of CSRs is given as Q2 2009 and Q2 2010, respectively. Two further studies are currently ongoing. Study 810701 is an open-label Phase I/II study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two doses (3.75µg or 7.5µg HA) of a Vero cell-derived, whole viron Clade 2 H5N1 Influenza vaccine (strain A/Indonesia/05/2005) in healthy volunteers aged 21 to 45 years. The study is conducted in Hong Kong and Singapore and an interim CSR was available during the procedure. The Phase I clinical study with a H5N1 clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 candidate vaccine sponsored by the NIAID is ongoing and no CSR is available. GCP Inspection performed The  clinical  trial  810601  was  performed  in  accordance  with  the  quality  standards  of  the  International Conference  on  Harmonisation  (ICH)  guidelines  for  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  and  reflected  the requirements of the EMEA guidance. Study 810601 was performed in Europe. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to entry into the study. Pharmacokinetics As  noted in the CHMP  guideline  'Note  for  guidance  on  clinical evaluation of  new  vaccines' (CPMP/EWP/463/97)  pharmacokinetic  studies  are  generally  not  required  for  injectable  vaccines.  The kinetic  properties  of  vaccines  do  not  provide  information  useful  for  establishing  adequate  dosing recommendations'. Pharmacokinetic studies were therefore not conducted during the clinical development of Celvapan. Pharmacodynamics Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pharmacodynamic principle of vaccines generally could be regarded as the induction of an immune response  sufficient  to  protect  from  infection  with  or  disease  arising  from  the  specific  pathogen,  the vaccination is directed against. In the context of influenza, surrogate parameters are defined (CPMP/VEG/4717/03) that allow conclusion on the efficacy of the vaccine. Clinical studies performed on Celvapan  were  designed  to  obtain  information  on  these  specific  surrogate  parameters  and  further characteristics  of  the  immune  response,  i.e.  the  level  and  type  of  specific  antibodies  elicited  the persistence of antibody titres and the investigation of a dose response relationship to define the appropriate dosing  recommendation.  Thus  the  immunological  response  to  Celvapan  is  covered  as  part  of  the evaluation of efficacy.

## Clinical efficacy

## Immunogenicity assessment

The  immunogenicity  of  Celvapan  was  investigated  in  two  clinical  trials  using  haemagglutination inhibition  (HI)  assays,  microneutralisation  (MN)  assays  and  single  radial  hemolysis  (SRH)  assays.  For both studies the interpretation of the HI and SRH results for each H5N1 vaccine formulation after each injection  was  linked  to  the  immunogenicity  requirements  defined  by  the  Note  for  Guidance  on Harmonisation for Influenza vaccines (CPMP/BWP/214/96).

The high variability and low sensitivity of the HI assay was also subject of the EMEA Scientific Advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/310862/2007) and the company was encouraged to provide further immunogenicity data based on the SRH assay and challenge studies using  the  ferret  model  to  confirm proof-of-concept.

Further  as  proposed  in  guideline  EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006  the proportions  of  achieving  at  least  a  fourfold  increase  in  the  neutralising  antibody  titer  (criterion  for seroconversion) and GMTs were reported along with reverse cumulative distribution curves. To  allow  the  use  of  the  immunogenicity  criteria  it  should  be  demonstrated  that  the  Vero-cell  derived pandemic influenza vaccine is antigenically similar to the egg-cultured vaccine, as requested in the NfG on  influenza  vaccines  (CPMP/BWP/214/96).  The  Applicant  elaborated  in  detail  on  this  issue,  and provided data on the characterization of egg-derived and Vero cell-derived influenza virus vaccine strains of previous influenza seasons. No significant differences in their infectivity, antigenicity and immunogenicity  in  mice  were  demonstrated.  Moreover  the  egg-derived  seed  virus  remains  genetically stable during five passages in Vero cells. Hence it can be anticipated that the production system has no influence on the antigenicity of the vaccine. HI assay The evaluation of human sera by HI assays revealed a high variability in the test results, although varying designs of the assay were applied: HI titres were assessed using horse or turkey erythrocytes as well as utilising  antigen  from  homologous  or  heterologous  wild  type  or  RG  reassortant  strains  from  different sources (egg-derived or MDCK-derived). Surprisingly the highest immune responses across all vaccine groups were found with antigen of the RG reassortants regardless whether it was egg or MDCK derived or represent a homologous or heterologous strain. In general, a low responsiveness was observed throughout all  analyses  of  human  sera  most  probably  due  to  a  low  sensitivity  of  the  assay  in  clinical  studies  -  in contrast to pre-clinical studies. Similar findings were reported for some other H5N1 vaccines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## MN assay

The MN assay is based on ability of neutralising antibodies to inhibit the attachment of virus to cells as well  as  intracellular  penetration  and  propagation.  Such  assays  are  commonly  used  to  detect  protective antibodies  in  human  reconvalescent  sera  or  sera  from  vaccinees.  However,  at  present  it  is  not  known which neutralising antibody titer confers protection against a potential pandemic strain. Moreover there is a  high  variability  in  test  results  depending  on  the  laboratory  and  the  specific  neutralisation  assay employed. Several studies have indicated that a cut-off of 1:20 is appropriate whereas others have used a cut-off of 1:40. The interpretation of results based on different neutralisation assays is further hampered because no international reference material is available for standardisation.

In the dose-response study 810501 four vaccine formulations adjuvanted with alum (3.5µg, 7.5µg, 15µg and 30µg) and 2 non-adjuvanted vaccine formulations (7.5µg and 15µg) were evaluated in healthy adults of 18-45 years of age. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly on day 0 and day 21 (ref to Table 1). Based on the MN and SRH assay using the homologous vaccine strain (A/Vietnam) the highest immune responses  were  achieved  following  two  immunisations  with  the  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  formulations. Moreover  after  the  first  vaccination  significantly  higher  seroprotection  rates  by  SRH  assay  and seroneutralisation rates (percentage of subjects with MN titre ≥ 1:20) by MN assay were observed in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups compared to the adjuvanted vaccine groups indicating no adjuvanting but rather an inhibitory effect of alum throughout all antigen concentrations. These results are contrary to the experience with an already approved whole virion vaccine where an adjuvanting effect of alum could be demonstrated.  The  controversial  effects  might  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  different  manufacturing

The Applicant has performed passive immune transfer studies in mice to evaluate whether the chosen cutoff  titer  of  1:20  is  appropriately  defined.  A  MN  titer  of  1:5  (mouse  immune  sera)  or  1:7  (guinea  pig immune sera), respectively, was demonstrated to correlate with 50% protection against a lethal challenge. In addition two independent passive immune transfer experiments using pooled human immune sera from vaccinees  enrolled  in  study  810601  were  conducted.  One  day  after  intravenous  injection  of  different dilutions  of  the  human  antibodies  mice  were  challenged  with  a  lethal  dose  of  wild  type  virus  strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004  of  133  LD50  units.  Two  hours  before  challenge  the  animals  were  bled  and  the neutralising antibody titres were determined before and after administration. The calculated MN titre of 1:10 was found to protect 50% of animals, whereas these calculated MN titers were not measurable after administration. However, these data suggest that the cut-off titer of 1:20 is appropriately defined for the MN  assay  and  that  the  neutralising  antibody  response  as  measured  in  cell  culture  corresponds  to  a functional immune response in vivo. With regard to assay validation an initial validation report was presented. In addition upon request during the procedure and following a GCP inspection revalidation of the assay was conducted. In summary, the new validation data were found to be satisfactory. SRH assay As requested per EMEA Scientific Advice standard SRH assays were conducted to confirm the results obtained with the MN assay. A detailed description of the assay and the validation report was provided in the Applicant's response to the day120 LoQ. The performance of the assay was found to be satisfactorily validated. Cellular immunity Preliminary data on cellular immunity were provided and demonstrate a strong bias towards a humoral immune response. · Dose response studies Dose response study 810501 Medicinal product no longer authorised

processes are used for the two vaccines. Celvapan is based on a wild type virus strain propagated in Vero cells whereas the other whole virion vaccine utilises a reassortant strain grown in embryonated hen eggs.

The seroprotection and seroneutralisation rates following the 2-dose vaccination schedule and 6 months later are summarised in Table 3 (MN assay) and Table 4 (SRH assay).

Reverse cumulative analyses on MN titre distributions post dose 1 and 2 provide additional evidence on the  lack  of  an  adjuvanting  effect  of  alum  and  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  impact  of  the  antigen concentration on the immune response, i.e no dose-response is observed neither for the adjuvanted nor the non-adjuvanted vaccine formulations (Figure 1).

With  both  the  SRH  and  the  MN  assay  all  three  requirements  were  fulfilled  following  two immunisations with the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg vaccine formulation with seroprotection rate of 78.6% by SRH assay and seroneutralisation rate of 76.2% by MN assay, seroconversion rates of 69.0% and 73.8% and a GM fold increase of 5.3 and 6.3, respectively. Moreover cross-neutralisation experiments indicate a high responsiveness for the original prototype A/Hongkong strain (76.2%) and a reasonable cross-neutralising  response  for  the  further  evolved  strain  A/Indonesia  (45.2%).  The  neutralising antibody responses against all three virus strains persist over 6 months with low to moderate decline rates (A/Vietnam: 54.8%; A/Indonesia: 33.3%; A/Hongkong: 71.4%).

Thus, the choice of the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg formulation is justified for Celvapan. · Main studies Study 810601 immunogenicity of the 7.5µg vaccine in healthy adults and elderly METHODS  (The methods for study 810501 and 810601 are described together in this section) Study Participants The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  both  studies  810501  and  810601  were  in  general  identical except for the age at the time of first vaccination. In study 810501 healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years were enrolled, whereas in study 810601 persons 18-59 years of age and 60 years of age and older were included. Treatments Study 810501: Four  different  alum  adjuvanted  (3.75µg,  7.5µg,  15µg,  30µg  HA)  and  two  non-adjuvanted  (7.5µg, 15µg HA) vaccine formulations of the pandemic candidate influenza vaccine (single-dose presentation) were administered each on D0 and D21 as primary vaccinations. Each subject received two injections of 0.5ml of the same vaccine dose and formulation by intra-muscular injection into the musculus deltoideus. Blood samples were taken on day 0, day 21 and 41 as well as on day 180 (+14 days) for the immunogenicity assessment. Study 810601: One  lot  (Lot  Number  VNV1G001A)  of  the  candidate  vaccine  was  used  for  the  first  and  second vaccinations  in  all  subjects.  The  vaccine  for  the  primary  vaccination  series  was  produced  of  strain A/Vietnam/1203/2003  according  to  the  final  manufacturing  process.  It  is  provided  as  multi-dose presentation containing no preservative Objectives Study 810501: The primary objective of this study was to identify the immunogenicity and safety of different doses of an adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted mock-up pandemic influenza vaccine. Study 810601: To assess the immune response to an H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population To assess the safety and tolerability of an H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population To assess the need for and timing of a booster vaccination Medicinal product no longer authorised

For a subset of subjects further objectives of the study are:

To evaluate the T-cell  mediated  immune response  induced by an H5N1 influenza vaccine after the first, second and booster vaccination.

Outcomes/endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study 810501:

## Primary endpoints

Number of subjects with antibody response to the vaccine strain (A/Vietnam/1203/04) associated with protection 21 days after the first and second vaccination defined as either Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) titer ≥ 1:40 or titer measured by Microneutralization (MN) test ≥ 1:20.

Secondary endpoints included the antibody response 21 days after the first and second vaccinations in terms of: -Fold increase of antibody response 21 days after the first and second vaccinations as compared to baseline measured by HI and MN assays -Number of subjects with seroconversion defined as a minimum four fold increase in titer measured by HI or MN assay 21 days after the first and second vaccinations as compared to baseline -Antibody response 180 days after the first vaccination measured by HI and MN assays -Fold  increase  of  antibody  response  180  days  after  the  first  vaccination  as  compared  to  baseline measured by HI and MN assays -Number  of  subjects  with  antibody  response  associated  with  protection  180  days  after  the  first vaccination defined as either HI titer ≥ 1:40 or titer measured by MN ≥ 1:20 -Number of subjects with antibody response associated with protection 21 days after the first and second  vaccinations  as  well  as  180  days  after  the  first  vaccination  defined  as  Single  Radial Haemolysis (SRH) area ≥ 25 mm²; For a subset of subjects cellular immunity has been assessed. Study 810601: Primary endpoints Number of subjects with antibody response to the vaccine strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) associated with protection 21 days after the second vaccination defined as titer measured by microneutralization (MN) test ≥ 20 Secondary  endpoints included  the  number  of  subjects  with  antibody  response  associated  with protection 21 days after the first vaccination measured by MN assay, number of subjects with HI titer ≥ 40 and SRH area ≥ 25 mm 2 measured 21 days after the first and second vaccinations, antibody titer 21 days after the first and second vaccinations as measured by MN, SRH and HI assays, fold increase of  antibody  response  as  compared  to  baseline  21  days  after  the  first  and  second  vaccinations  as measured by MN, SRH and HI assays, number of subjects with seroconversion (defined as a minimum four fold titer increase) 21 days after the first and second vaccinations as measured by MN, SRH and HI assays and booster data measured with different assays. For a subset of subjects cellular immunity has been assessed. Sample size Study 810501 :  The  sample size was planned under the assumption that for a seroprotection rate of 80% and 40 subjects  per  group,  the  (half-)  width  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  this  rate  is  at  most 15.2%. To account for a drop-out rate of about 10% forty-five subjects had to be enrolled per group. Study 810601 : Anticipating an observed seroprotection rate of about 60%, with a sample size of 250 subjects, the (half-) width of the two-sided 95% CI for this rate is at most 6.4%. In order to account for a drop-out rate of 10% a total number of 275 subjects were to be included into each of the 2 age strata (18 to 59 years, ≥ 60 years). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Randomisation

In study 810501 patients were randomised in cohorts. In cohort 1 patients were randomised applying a  randomisation  ratio  of  1:1:1  to  receive  3.75 μ g  adjuvanted,  7.5 μ g  adjuvanted  or  7.5 μ g  nonadjuvanted  H5N1,  in  cohort  2  patients  were  randomised  in  an  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either  15 μ g

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adjuvanted or 15 μ g non-adjuvanted H5N1 while patients in cohort 3 were not randomised but received 30 μ g adjuvanted H5N1.

In study 810601 initially all patients received 7.5 μ g non-adjuvanted H5N1. Subjects were randomised at visit 4 (day 180 +/- 14 days) in a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive either 6 months, 12-months or 24-months booster vaccinations.

## Blinding (masking)

<!-- image -->

Study  810501  was  blinded  with  respect  to  the  individual  treatment  group  within  cohorts  1  and  2 respectively. The reported part of study 810601 was performed as a not controlled, open label trial. Statistical methods Seroprotection  rates  were  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  in  both  trials.  In  study  810501  for  each treatment group the seroprotection rates (defined as MN titer ≥ 1:20 and HI titer ≥ 1:40 respectively) 21 days after the first and second vaccination and their 95% CIs intervals were calculated separately for both, HI and MN assays. In study 810601 the seroprotection rates (defined as MN titer ≥ 1:20) 21 days after the second vaccination and their 95% confidence intervals calculated separately for both age strata. All secondary immunogenicity endpoints were described by means of point estimates including their 95%-CIs stratified for the pre-defined strata. In  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  adjuvant,  in  study  810501  the  antibody  response  to  the  two  vaccine doses prepared with and without adjuvant (with 7.5 µg and 15 µg of antigen) was evaluated by an analysis of covariance. Dose, presence of adjuvant and the interaction between dose and adjuvant were the  factors  included  into  the  analysis  model;  baseline  values  were  considered  as  covariates.  These analyses were done separately for the HI assay and the MN assay, as well as for the first and second vaccination. Logistic regression was used to perform similar analyses with respect to seroprotection rates and seroconversion rates. Study population Subjects  are  included  in  the  Intent  to  treat  Population  (ITT) datasets  if  they  received  the  1st/2nd vaccination and have available serology data at Day 21 after the 1 st /2 nd vaccination. Subjects are included in the Per Protocol Population (PP) analysis if they fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria,  have  no  major  protocol  violations,  received  both  vaccinations  and  have  available  serology data at Day 21 after the 1 st /2 nd vaccination. RESULTS Participant flow Study 810501: Each subject received two 0.5ml doses of the same vaccine intramuscularly in the primary vaccination series (D0 and D21) and a booster dose of the vaccine containing either the homologous A/Vietnam strain  or  the  heterologous  A/Indonesia/05/2005  strain  was  administered  to  a  subset  of  subjects  on month 6, month 12 or month 24, respectively (see flow chart below).

## Conduct of the study

In study 810501 a total of 284 subjects were enrolled of which 275 received the first vaccination and 257  subjects received the second vaccination. In total, 249  subjects were  valuable for the immunogenicity analysis. Seventeen subjects did not come back after the first vaccination and eight subjects did not come back after the second vaccination at day 42.

Study 810601 had 6 amendments to the original protocol, but only 5 were ultimately implemented. All study centres in Singapore and Hong Kong were dropped. For the German study centres, a blood draw to evaluate liver function 7 days after the first and second vaccination was introduced in response to elevated liver enzymes in a preclinical test in rats. The amended booster vaccination schedule includes a  booster  vaccination  at  6-months,  12-months  and  24-months  using  the  H5N1  influenza  vaccine containing  alternatively the vaccine  strain or the clade 2 A/Indonesia/05/2005  strain.  In the amendment 5, the principal investigator of a study site in Austria was replaced because of GCP/GDP related irregularities at this site. Amendment 6 comprised of a revision of the 12M booster to include both the 3.75 and 7.5µg dose of A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain vaccine. Baseline data In study 80501 slightly more male subjects (143 for the first and 137 for the second vaccination) than female subjects (115 for the first vaccination and 112 for the second vaccination) were included in the immunogenicity dataset. On Day 180 slightly more male subjects (136) than female subjects (111) were included in the immunogenicity dataset. The largest number of subjects in both datasets was aged 18 to 25 years (23%-35% across groups); the second largest number of subjects was aged 26 to 30 years (19%-35% across groups). Study 810601 Gender was evenly distributed in both strata. Age was well distributed in Stratum A, in Stratum B 51.1 % of subjects were between 60 and 65 and a further 32.5 % of subjects between 66 and 70 years old. Seropositive antibody titres against the H5N1 vaccine strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) at baseline were shown in 4.1% and 16.9% of subjects for  MN, and 4.5% and 5.3% for SRH in Stratum A and B, respectively. Numbers analysed In study 810501 t he immunogenicity dataset was used for the analysis of antibody response after the first  and  second  vaccinations  and  on  Day  180  and  comprised  the  subjects  who  fulfilled  the inclusion/exclusion criteria and had immunogenicity data available for the first (n=258) and second (n=249) vaccination, as well as for Day 180 (n=247). No subjects were excluded for major protocol violations. In study 810601 number of subjects planned were 550 (275 Stratum A, 275 Stratum B) and analyzed (Part A) were 561 (281 Stratum A, 280 Stratum B) in full analysis dataset for first vaccination, 542 (270 Stratum A, 272 Stratum B) in ITT dataset for first vaccination (ITT 1), 539 (269 Stratum A, 270  Stratum  B)  received  second  vaccination,  539  (269  Stratum  A,  270  Stratum  B)  in  full  analysis dataset  for  second  vaccination,  535  (265  Stratum  A,  270  Stratum  B)  in  ITT  dataset  for  second vaccination (ITT 2) and 525 (257 Stratum A, 268 Stratum B) in PP dataset for second vaccination Outcomes and estimation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Following two vaccinations and based on the MN assay all three requirements were fulfilled in the age group of adults and 2 out of 3 requirements were met in the elderly (Table 5). With regards to the group of adults a seroneutralisation rate of 72.5%, a seroconversion rate of 60.8% and a 4.7 fold GM increase  was  achieved.  In  the  elderly  a  seroneutralisation  rate  of  74.1%,  a  seroconversion  rate  of 26.7% and a 2.8 fold increase was obtained (Table 5). In summary based on the MN assay 3 out of 3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP requirements were met for the adults and 2 out of 3 requirements were fulfilled for the elderly subjects.

The results of the MN assay were generally confirmed by the SRH assay (Table 6). Following two vaccinations 2 out of 3 three CHMP requirements were fulfilled in adults and all three 3 requirements were met in the elderly. In the group of the adults a seroprotection rate of 63.3%, a seroconversion rate of 60.2% and a 4.6 fold GM increase was achieved. In the elderly a seroprotection rate of 67.7%, a seroconversion rate of 62.4% and a 4.6 fold increase was obtained.

Of  note  is  the  high  rate  of  seropositivity  in  the  MN  assay  prior  to  vaccination.  Detectable  prevaccination anti H5N1 neutralising antibodies were found in 4.1% of subjects in the group of adults (11 subjects) and 16.9% of subjects in the group of elderly (46 subjects). This finding is confirmed by the reverse distribution of MN titres where 60% of elderly subjects achieved MN titres of at least 1:10. Considering that elderly are routinely vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines, it can be assumed that  an  antibody  response  against  N1  is  at  least  partially  responsible  for  the  pre-existing  immunity towards  H5N1  viruses.  The  presence  of  cross-reactive  antibodies  especially  at  older  ages  is  well documented  and  was  also  reported  for  other  pandemic  vaccines.  It  should  be  noted  however,  that cross-neutralisation experiments conducted in guinea pigs demonstrate that the immune response to Celvapan is predominantly directed against the H5 molecule and not the N1 protein. This implies that a  pre-existing  immunity  against  the  N1  protein  is  probably  not  boostered  by  Celvapan.  In  order  to clarify, whether the baseline seropositivity is due to cross reactive anti NA antibodies cross-absorption analyses using different concentrations of NA and HA were requested and the Applicant is committed to initiate such studies.

Although a high proportion of the elderly were found to have pre-existing neutralising antibodies only a low seroconversion rate (defined as 4-fold increase) could be achieved post dose II indicating that there  is  a  reduced  ability  to  react  to  antigen  or  to  boost  the  immune  response.  Moreover  the comparison of the seroconversion rates measured by MN vs. SRH assay reveals significant differences for elderly subjects. Post dose I seroconversion rates of 14.3 % (MN assay) and 52.4 % (SRH assay) were obtained and reached 26.7 % and 62.4 % by MN assay and SRH assay, respectively following post dose II. In order to dispel the influence of baseline H5N1 antibody titres on the immunogenicity results, a detailed analysis of the serology endpoints according to baseline status was requested. The study population was divided into two groups by using a cut-off of &lt;25mm² for the SRH and &lt;1:20 for the MN assay. Therefore, one group consisted of those subjects who already had so-called 'protective' titres at baseline and the other group was made up of subjects who where either seronegative or had low titres before the first immunization. This analysis predictably showed that those subjects who had a high titre at baseline still had high titres at day 42, but fold increase and seroconversion rates were lower for both assays. The subjects with low or negative baseline titres showed adequate SRH fold increase and seroconversion rates, but the rate of subjects with a titre ≥ 25mm² was 61.8% in the group of adults and therefore well below the acceptance limit. In the group of the elderly all 3 requirements for  the  SRH  assay  were  met.  Regarding  the  MN  assay,  if  the  CHMP  guideline  requirements  are applied,  all  of  them  can  be  satisfied  in  both  age  strata.  A  further  analysis  of  subjects  negative  for baseline neutralising antibodies is deemed to be of greater relevance to identify the responsiveness of immunologically naïve subjects. Antibody persistence Data on antibody persistence up to day 180 were provided in the Applicant's response to the day120 LoQ and Table 5 (MN assay) and Table 6 (SRH assay) are updated accordingly. The data on antibody persistence  reveal  a  decline  in  seroneutralisation/seroprotection  rates  of  35%  to  40%  for  both  age groups using either the MN or the SRH assay. The decline in the neutralizing antibody responses is however less pronounced than the decline in antibody responses determined by SRH assay. Whereas a substantial number of vaccinees have neutralizing antibody titres (of at least of 1:10) up to 180 days post  vaccination  (Figure  2),  for  only  approximately  50%  of  adults  and  elderly  subjects  antibodies ≥ 4mm 2 are detectable in the SRH assay (Figure 3).

All subjects (N=141) who were vaccinated and completed the Day 42 visit at the Austrian study site in Study 810501 were invited to participate in this  follow-up study. Only 77 of the 141 subjects who completed Study 810501 through Day 42 and were eligible for this follow-up agreed to participate.

Figure 3: Reverse cumulative distributions of antibody responses as measured by SRH assay (A/Vietnam) Results following booster immunisation The effects of a homologous and heterologous booster immunisation were evaluated in study 810703 (follow-up  to  dose-finding  study  810501)  and  in  study  810601  (part  C).

Each subject received one dose of 7.5 µg A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/2005 HA antigen in a non-adjuvanted formulation as a heterologous booster vaccination 12 to 17 months (360 to 510 days) after the first vaccination with a two-dose regimen of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain influenza vaccine administered in Study 810501. Blood samples were drawn on Day 0 before vaccination, as well as on Day 7 and 21 of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following serological assays were performed to assess the antibody response to the vaccine: MN, SRH and HI. The HI results were again consistently low with and highly inconsistent with the immune response detected with MN and SRH assays.

The seroneutralisation/seroprotection rates against strain A/Vietnam and strain A/Indonesia following a  heterologous booster immunisation with 7.5µg HA strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 are summarised in Table 7 for the MN assay and in Table 8 for the SRH assay.

With the MN assay a seroneutralisation rate of 100%, a GM fold increase of 14.0 and a seroconversion rate  of  91.7%  were  achieved  against  the  booster  strain  A/Indonesia.  Based  on  the  SRH  assay  all subjects were found to be seronegative (&lt;25mm 2 ) for the heterologous strain A/Indonesia prior booster immunisation and 7 to 21 days after the heterologous booster SPR of ~70%, a GM increase of 7.4 and a SCR of ~70% were obtained. While the neutralising antibody response against the A/Vietnam strain was generally  lower  than  against  strain  A/Indonesia  after  the  heterologous  booster  immunisation  it was significantly higher against strain  A/Vietnam than against strain A/Indonesia by SRH analysis. These findings indicate that most likely different types of antibodies are measured by the two different assays. While for the SRH assay complement is used, it is not specifically added to the MN assay. Consequently antibodies not binding to and thereby activating complement will not be detected in the SRH assay but might be measured in the MN assay. It can be speculated that complement dependent antibodies are more  specific in their epitope binding activity  than  complement  independent neutralising antibodies. Another possible explanation for the different antibody responses to

homologous and heterologous antigens could be the presence of anti NP or M2 antibodies detectable in one assay but not the other.

## Study 810601

For the 6-months booster immunisation half of the subjects were randomized into 4 groups to receive one of the following dosages:

- -3.75 µg HA antigen, strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 per 0.25 mL
- -7.5 µg HA antigen, strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 per 0.5 mL

.

-3.75 µg HA antigen, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 per 0.25 mL -7.5 µg HA antigen, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 per 0.5 mL Antibody response to the vaccine was assessed using the following assays: -Microneutralization (MN) -Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) -Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) Immunogenicity endpoints determined by MN, HI and SRH assay were evaluated against the H5N1 influenza strain contained in the vaccine for the 6-months booster vaccination (either A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or A/Indonesia/05/2005). Currently no SRH analysis was provided using strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 as antigen. Immunogenicity endpoints were analyzed for the ITT dataset only and comprised all subjects who had data available on Day 180 (± 14 days) and for the subjects randomized to receive the 6-months booster vaccination with available data on Day 201 (21 ± 3 days). The ITT dataset for Day 180 (pre booster vaccination) comprises 501 subjects (243 in Stratum A adults and 258 in Stratum B - elderly). The post 6-months booster vaccination ITT dataset comprises 243 subjects (116 adults and 127 elderly). The Day 201 results of the HI assay reported (using horse erythrocytes) were consistently low with respect to all measures i.e. seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate, GMT and GM fold increase from baseline  after  the  6-months  booster  vaccination.  These  tests  were  inconclusive  due  to  the  apparent insensitivity of the HI assay. Seroneutralisation/seroprotection The rates of subjects who achieved an antibody titer ≥ 1:20 measured by MN against the vaccine strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or A/ Indonesia/05/2005 after the 6-months booster vaccination are presented in Table 13 (Adults) and Table 14 (Elderly). The rates of subjects with antibody response associated with protection as defined by area ≥ 25mm 2 is presented in Table 15. Medicinal product no longer authorised

GM of fold increase The GMs of fold increase of MN titer post booster vaccination are presented in Table 16 (Adults) and Table 17 (Elderly). The GM of fold increase as measured by SRH assay is shown in Table 18. In  adults  aged  18  to  59  years,  the  highest  GM  fold  increase  of  MN  titer  (3.3)  was  observed  in  the 7.5µg A/Indonesia/05/2005 booster vaccine group when tested against the A/Indonesia/1205/05 strain. The GM fold increase in SRH area was 2.6 in the 7.5 µg A/Vietnam/1203/2004 dose group and 3.8 in the 7.5 µg A/Indonesia/05/2005 dose group. In elderly subjects, the GM fold increase in MN titer was lower  compared  to  adults.  The  GM  of  fold  increase  in  SRH  area  was  only  slightly  lower  than  the defined CPMP criterion (&gt;2.0) in the 7 .5 µg A/Indonesia/05/2005 dose group (2.0).

Seroconversion The  number  of  subjects  with  cross-strain  seroconversion  (defined  as  a  &gt;4  fold  increase  in  MN titer/50%  increase  in  haemolysis  area  21  days  after  booster  vaccination)  was  low  across  both  dose groups strains. This is most likely due to the higher percentage of subjects with pre-existing antibodies elicited  by  the  primary  vaccination  series  with  A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine 6 months prior to the booster (Table 19, Table 20 and Table 21).

Table 21: Number of subjects with seroconversion measured by SRH assay using strain A/Vietnam 21 days after the 6-months booster vaccinations (intent to treat dataset)

Fold increase as compared to Day 0. Fold increase as compared to Day 180. Based on these data it can be concluded that a homologous or heterologous booster immunisation has no added value as regards higher seroconversion rates but might elicit stronger cross-reactive antibody responses. Generally the antibody responses following the homologous and heterologous booster are however less pronounced compared to study 810703 indicating a moderate anamnestic response. In summary the responses are comparable to what is expected for seasonal revaccination. Ancillary analyses · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) · Clinical studies in special populations · Supportive studies Study 810701 Study 810701 is an open-label Phase I/II study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of a Vero cell-derived, whole virus clade 2 H5N1 Influenza vaccine (strain A/Indonesia, 3.75µg and 7.5µg) in 110 healthy adult male and female aged 21 to 45 years. This multi-centre study is conducted in 4 centres in Hong Kong and Singapore. Subjects  were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  2  intramuscular  injections  of  the  whole  virion,  Vero  cellderived influenza vaccine containing either 3.75 μ g or 7.5 μ g H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) antigen, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005, in a non-adjuvanted formulation on Day 0 and Day 21. The study is being conducted in 2 parts: · Part A was concluded 21(± 2) days after the second vaccination (Day 42 visit). These data are provided in the response document at day 121.

- All subjects will be monitored until Day 180 (±14 days) after the first vaccination. After the last subject  has  completed  the  Day  180  visit,  a  final  clinical  study  report  including  all  safety  and immunogenicity data collected will be written.

## The primary endpoints for evalution were:

- Frequency and severity of systemic reactions after the first and second vaccinations
- Number  of  subjects with antibody response to the vaccine strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005) associated  with  protection  21  days  after  the  second  vaccination  defined  as  titer  measured  by Microneutralization (MN) test ≥ 1:20

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further  immunogenicity  endpoints  included  the  analysis  of  seroconversion,  GM  fold  increase  and GMT by MN assay and the evaluation by SRH assay.

Antibody  response  was  analyzed  for  all  subjects  vaccinated  with  data  available  after  the  first  and second vaccinations (ITT dataset). MN and SRH analyses were performed on 107 subjects for the first vaccination  (55  vaccinated  with  the  3.75 μ g  dose,  52  vaccinated  with  the  7.5 μ g  dose),  and  104 subjects after the second vaccination (52 vaccinated with the 3.75 μ g dose, 52 vaccinated with the 7.5 μ g dose).

Antibody response against the homologous strain A/Indonesia: The neutralising antibody responses following the 2 doses against the homologous strain A/Indonesia are summarised in Table 22. A  neutralising  antibody  response  defined  as  percentage  with  MN  titres  &gt;=  1:20  21  days  after  the second vaccination for the vaccine strain, was found in 82.7% and 86.5% of subjects vaccinated with the 3.75 μ g or 7.5 μ g dose, respectively. Seroconversion defined as ≥ 4-fold increase in MN titer 21 days after vaccination as compared to baseline, was achieved after the first vaccination in 40.0% and 25.0% of  subjects,  and  after  the  second  vaccination  in  82.7%  and  86.5%,  in  the  3.75 μ g  and  7.5 μ g  dose groups,  respectively.  The  GMT  was  12.8  vs.  13.6  after  the  first  and  34.5  vs.  36.0  after  the  second vaccination in the 3.75 μ g and 7.5 μ g dose groups, respectively.

The  antibody  responses  as  measured  by  the  SRH  assay  are  given  in  Table  23.  Antibody  response associated with protection 21 days after the second vaccination for the vaccine strain, as defined by SRH area ≥ 25 mm 2 was determined in 71.2% and 69.2% of subjects vaccinated with the 3.75 μ g or 7.5 μ g dose, respectively. Seroconversion for the vaccine strain was shown in 38.2% vs. 38.5% after

the first, and 71.2% vs. 67.3% of subjects after the second vaccination in the 3.75 μ g or 7.5 μ g dose groups, respectively. Antibody response determined by SRH assay, expressed as GM of haemolysis area (GMT) for the vaccine strain was also similar between the dose groups: 11.8 and 10.5 after the first and 20.9 vs. 22.8 after the second vaccination in the 3.75 μ g and 7.5g dose groups, respectively. GM fold increase in antibody response measured by SRH in subjects in the 3.75 μ g and 7.5 μ g dose groups, respectively, with 2.8 vs. 2.5 after the first, and 5.0 vs. 5.4 after the second vaccination.

Seroprotection rates (SRH area &gt;=25 mm 2 ) 21 days after 1 st /2 nd vaccination Seroconversion rates 21 days after the 1 st and 2 nd vaccination as compared to baseline Geometric Mean fold Increase measured 21 days after 1 st /2 nd vaccination as compared to baseline In summary, the results of study 810701 indicate again that no true dose-response relation exists. The responsiveness of  a  lower  dose  of  3.75µg  HA  strain  A/Indonesia  is  similar  to  a  dose  of  7.5µg  HA strain  A/Indonesia.  Moreover  the  SPRs,  SCRs  and  GMI  determined  by  MN  and  SRH  assay  are consistent with the results of main study 810601. However, it should be noted that subjects enrolled in study 810701 had no baseline neutralising antibody titres and only 1 subject was positive as measured by SRH assay. Cross-reactivity against A/Vietnam determined by MN The rate of subjects with reciprocal MN  titer ≥ 20 against a heterologous clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) 21 days after the first and second vaccination is given in Table 24.

Clinical safety · Patient exposure Safety data are available from both clinical studies (810501 and 810601). In total 796 subjects were vaccinated with two doses of different vaccine formulations 21 days apart. 602 subjects received at least one dose of the vaccine formulation (7.5µg HA non-adjuvanted) intended for pandemic use. · Adverse events Special queried systemic and local adverse events were monitored by diary cards for 7 days after each vaccination. All adverse events were recorded for 21 days following each dose and for the time period 42 -180 days after first vaccination. For study 810601 all adverse events were reported for the time period 42 days after first vaccination for both age groups. Long-term 6-months follow-up data were provided during the procedure. Therefore the total number exposed is considered to be sufficient for a core  dossier  application  as  adverse  reactions  or  events  at  a  frequency  of  approximately  1%  are detectable. Study 810501 A total of 275 subjects received the first vaccination (on Day 0) and 257 subjects received the second vaccination (on Day 21) with the whole virion, Vero cell-derived influenza vaccine containing 3.75 μ g, 7.5 μ g, 15 μ g or 30 μ g H5N1 HA antigen/dose in an adjuvanted formulation with aluminium hydroxide, or 7.5 μ g or 15 μ g H5N1 HA antigen/dose in a non-adjuvanted formulation. The occurrence of fever with onset within 7 days after the 1 st and 2 nd vaccination is provided in Table 25 and Table 26.

Swelling Induration Redness Injection Site Pain Ecchymosis Fatigue Headache Sweating Muscle pain Joint pain Fever with onset later than Day 7 after vac. The analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  safety  endpoints  did  not  show  any  dose  dependency  or adjuvant effect, however, with respect to local reactions, there was a trend towards better tolerability in the absence of adjuvant. In the study group receiving 7.5 μ g non-adjuvanted vaccine, the probability of occurrence of systemic reactions (including fever) was 24.4% and 14.3% after the first and second vaccinations, respectively. Fever was reported in this group in 0.0% of subjects after the first and in 4.8% after the second vaccination. No fever with onset later than Day 7 after vaccination was reported. Systemic reactions (excluding fever) were reported in 28.4% of subjects after the first and in 20.6% of subjects  after  the  second  vaccination.  The  severity  of  these  reactions  after  the  first  and  second vaccinations was mild in all but 4 (1.5%) and 1 (0.4%) subjects who reported moderate reactions after the  first  and  second  vaccinations,  respectively.  Malaise  occurred  in  9.5%  of  subjects  after  the  first vaccination  and  in  6.6%  of  subjects  after  the  second  vaccination.  The  majority  of  cases  were  mild (8.4% and 6.2% after the first and second vaccination, respectively), with very few moderate cases reported.  Shivering  was  reported  less  frequently:  in  4.3%  of  subjects  after  the  first  and  in  2.7%  of subjects  after  the  second  vaccination.  The  most  frequently  reported  queried  symptoms  of  systemic reactions were headache, fatigue, and muscle pain. Medicinal product no longer authorised

All local reactions which occurred after the first and second vaccinations were mild in intensity and were  reported  in  22.5%  and  15.2%  of  subjects,  respectively.  Injection  site  pain  was  the  most frequently reported queried symptom of local reactions in all study groups. Among the other queried symptoms of local reactions (swelling, induration, erythema and ecchymosis) none occurred in more than a total of 4 subjects (0.0% to 4.4% of subjects per study group) after both the first and second vaccinations.  As  expected,  between  Day  42  and  180  (Part  B  of  the  study)  there  was  a  very  low probability of occurrence of related AEs. Only one subject reported non-serious systemic symptoms

(diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection 32 and 132 days after the second vaccination), which was judged as possibly related to study product.

## Study 810601

A total of 561 subjects (281 adults and 280 elderly) received the first vaccination and 539 subjects (269 adults and 270 elderly) received the second vaccination 21 days later with the inactivated whole virion, Vero cell-derived vaccine containing 7.5 μ g H5N1 HA antigen, strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004.

Sweating Muscle pain Joint pain Fever with onset later than Day 7 after vaccination The probability  of  occurrence  of  systemic  reactions  (including  fever)  within  21  days  after  the  first vaccination was 22.8% in adults and 23.3% in elderly subjects. The majority of subjects reported no fever  within  7  days  after  the  first  and  second  vaccinations  in  both  age  strata.  After  the  first vaccination, the occurrence of fever was 2.2% in the group of adults, and 1.1% in the elderly. After the second vaccination,  the  occurrence  of  fever  within  7  days  after  vaccination  was  0.4%  and  0.7%  in adults and elderly. No fever case lasted more than 2 days. Of the few fever cases reported, most were mild. There was no severe fever in either age stratum after either vaccination. The probability of occurrence of malaise after the first vaccination was 6.4% in both age strata; after the second vaccination , 3.7% in adults, and 4.1% in elderly subjects. Malaise after the first vaccination in adults was reported mostly as mild (5.3%), 2 were moderate (0.7%), and 1 (0.4%) severe. The rates of malaise by severity were generally similar in elderly subjects (5.7% mild and 0.7% moderate), and none severe. After the second vaccination, mild or moderate malaise was reported in 6 (2.2%), and 4 adult  subjects  (1.5%),  respectively,  and  10  (3.7%)  and  1  elderly  subject  (0.4%),  respectively.  The probability  of  occurrence  of  shivering  after  the  first  vaccination  was  3.6%  in  adults  and  4.6%  in elderly; the rates were lower after the second vaccination: 1.1% and 1.9%, adult and elderly subjects, respectively. Reports of shivering were predominantly mild, with a few moderate cases reported, none were severe. Local reactions after the first vaccination occurred at a rate of 17.1% in adults aged 18-59 years, and 8.6% in subjects 60 years and older, and in 14.5% and 6.3% of subjects after the second vaccination, respectively. Most of the local reactions were mild after each vaccination (15.7% and 8.2% after the first, and 13.8% and 5.9% after the second vaccination, respectively). The follow-up data to 6 months after the first vaccination for all subjects were available during the procedure. None of the 503 subjects experienced systemic reactions and new adverse reaction in the period between day 42 and day 180. All systemic symptoms or diagnosis of AEs reported between Day 42 and 180 were considered unrelated to vaccination. Systemic  reactions  within  21  days  after  the  6-months  booster  dose  were  mostly  mild.  One  subject experienced moderate reactions (chills, nasophryngitis, arthralgia and headache) in the group of adults. There were no severe systemic reactions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Study 810501

During the 42 day and 180 day follow-up of the study, no SAEs related to the vaccination, deaths or other significant AEs were reported.

## Study 810601

A  total  of  9  SAEs  were  reported  during  the  42  day  follow-up  of  the  study.  Eight  SAEs  were considered  unrelated  to  vaccination.  One  SAE  (malaria  tertiana  reactivation)  was  judged  related  to vaccination by the investigator. The subject has a history of malaria tertiana since August 2006 and experienced an episode of reactivation of malaria tertiana previously in November 2006. Within  21  days  after  the  6-month  booster  dose  three  subjects  reported  severe  AEs  (2  adults  and  1 elderly subject), who suffered from nasopharyngitis, uveitis and spinal stenosis. · Laboratory findings Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were tested in a subpopulation (N=51) in study 810601. There were no clinically significant increases in ALT. Slightly elevated ALT values were detected in 3 subjects. All elevated ALT values were assessed as not related to vaccination by an independent DMC and the responsible investigators. · Safety in special populations A  comparison  of  injection  site  reactions  between  the  two  age  strata  in  Study  810601  showed  that injection site pain was reported more often by the younger population than by the elderly. Joint pain and sweating was reported less often by the younger population than by the elderly. · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions Not applicable · Discontinuation due to adverse events 810501 :  Two subjects stated adverse events experienced after the first vaccination as the reason for withdrawing  their  informed  consent.  These  AEs  were  non-serious  and  were  of  mild  or  moderate severity,  however,  they  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  vaccination  and included arthralgia, chills, eye discharge, fatigue, headache, hyperhidrosis, hypoesthesia, injection site pain,  malaise,  myalgia,  generalized  pruritus  and  insomnia  for  one  subject  and  arthralgia,  myalgia, papular rash for another. 810601 :  One  subject  reported  an  AE  as  the  reason  for  withdrawal.  This  subject  experienced  severe malaise  and  mild  fatigue  3  days  after  the  first  vaccination  which  were  considered  to  be  probably related to vaccination and which lasted 7 days. · Post marketing experience Not applicable Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The production process of Celvapan Active Substance and Medicinal product is well defined and is sufficiently  validated.  All  manufacturing  sites  are  in  compliance  with  current  GMP  requirements. Several non-compliance issues with the Ph. Eur regarding the Vero cell bank system and the omission of  the  classical  extraneous  agent  testing,  which  were  initially  raised  as  major  concerns,  have  been addressed by the Applicant. The Applicant has committed to further address some minor outstanding issues as follow-up measure.

In the pivotal trial 810601 the immunogenicity of the 7.5µg vaccine was investigated in healthy adults of 18-59 years of age and elderly 60 years of age and older. Following two vaccinations and based on the  MN  assay  all  three  requirements  were  fulfilled  in  the  age  group  of  adults  and  2  out  of  3 requirements were met in the elderly. With regards to the group of adults a seroneutralisation rate of 72.5%, a seroconversion  rate  of  60.8%  and  a  4.7  fold  GM  increase  was  achieved.  In  the  elderly  a seroneutralisation rate of 74.1%, a seroconversion rate of 26.7% and a 2.8 fold increase was obtained. The results of the MN assay were generally confirmed by the SRH assay. Following two vaccinations 2 out of 3 three CHMP requirements were fulfilled in adults and all three 3 requirements were met in the elderly. In the group of the adults a seroprotection rate of 63.3%, a seroconversion rate of 60.2% and  a  4.6  fold  GM  increase  was  achieved.  In  the  elderly  a  seroprotection  rate  of  67.7%,  a

Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Consistent pharmacology data has been generated to support the potency of the vaccine, independent of the manufacturing scales and animal species tested, although a large body of data are from mice. The pharmacological program is in line with the Guideline on 'core dossier approach to registration of pandemic  influenza  vaccines'  (CPMP/VEG/4717/03),  which  specifies  that  immunogenicity  data derived from small animals that well respond to the human influenza vaccine are normally expected and that challenge experiments should be conducted if possible. Non-clinical toxicological testing program comprises a literature-based risk assessment of Tween 80 (Polysorbate 80), a non-GLP rabbit pyrogenicity study, a GLP single-dose toxicity study and a GLP pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  which  local  tolerance  assessment  is  included.  This  program  is considered to sufficiently meet the requirements of Regulatory Guideline on 'core dossier approach to registration of pandemic influenza vaccines' (CPMP/VEG/4717/03). Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). Efficacy Clinical  trials  on  protective  efficacy  for  the  mock-up  vaccine  are  not  possible.  Therefore  a  detailed characterisation of the immunological response has been performed. In  the  dose-response  study  810501  four  vaccine  formulations  adjuvanted  with  alum  (3.5µg,  7.5µg, 15µg and 30µg) and 2 non-adjuvanted vaccine formulations (7.5, and 15µg) were evaluated in healthy adults of 18-45 years of age. Based on the MN and SRH assay using the homologous vaccine strain (A/Vietnam) the highest immune responses were achieved and all CHMP requirements were fulfilled following  the  first  and  second  immunisation  with  the  non-adjuvanted  7.5µg  vaccine  formulation. Moreover cross-neutralisation  experiments  indicate  a  high  responsiveness  for  the  original  prototype A/HongKong  strain  and  a  moderate  cross-neutralising  response  for  the  further  evolved  strain A/Indonesia. The neutralising antibody responses against all three virus strains persist over 6 months with low to moderate decline rates. Medicinal product no longer authorised

seroconversion rate of 62.4% and a 4.6 fold increase was obtained. Data on 6 months persistence of antibodies indicate a moderate decline in antibody responses.

Similar results were obtained in study 810701, where adults between 21 and 45 years of age received 2 doses  of  3.75µg  HA  or  7.5µg  HA  of  strain  A/Indonesia/05/2005.  With  regard  to  the  MN  assay  all three  requirements  were  met  regardless  which  antigen  dose  were  administered.  Based  on  the  SRH assay  nearly  all  CHMP  criteria  were  fulfilled.  While  in  the  3.75µg  group  a  seroprotection  rate  of 71.2% was reached, it was slightly below the CHMP criterion for SPR in the 7.5µg group (69.2%).

Based on the MN and SRH assay the immunogenicity results obtained with the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg vaccine formulation are consistent throughout the three clinical studies suggesting that the Vero cell derived, inactivated whole virion H5N1 vaccine is suitable immunogenic. Safety The safety data provided does not raise any safety concerns as regards frequency and nature of adverse events.  The  most  commonly  observed  adverse  reactions  after  administration  of  Celvapan  were injection site pain, which was reported post dose 1 and 2. More rarely, local reactions such as injection site  erythema  and  induration,  as  well  as  systemic  reactions  such  as  headache,  fatigue,  malaise, myalgia, chills, pharyngolaryngeal pain, pyrexia and arthralgia were reported after the first and second vaccination  with  the  Vero  cell-derived  whole  virion  H5N1  pandemic  vaccine.  Symptoms  normally abated without treatment after a few days. In general less systemic and local reactions were reported after  the  second  vaccination  compared  to  the  first  vaccination.  The  profile  of  adverse  events  after administration is not unusual and comparable to other licensed influenza vaccines. Considering that the  vaccine  will  be  used  in  a  pandemic  situation  the  frequency  and  nature  of  the  adverse  events  is acceptable. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. · User consultation The  user/readability  testing  is  considered  acceptable.  Information  on  several  outstanding  issues regarding the user testing was provided by the Applicant and was found to be satisfactory. Risk-benefit assessment Clinical context It  is  not  known  which  strain  (in  terms  of  H  and  N  type)  will  trigger  the  next  human  influenza pandemic. Celvapan  is  a  mock-up  influenza  vaccine,  whose  scientific  development  is  based  on  the guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation application  (CPMP/VEG/4717/03)  and  the  guideline  on  submission  of  marketing  authorisation applications for pandemic influenza vaccines through the centralised procedure (CPMP/VEG/4986/03). Benefits Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  benefit  of  Celvapan  can  only  be  assessed  during  a  pandemic  and  following  insertion  of  an appropriate  final  pandemic  strain  into  the  vaccine.  At  present  the  potential  benefit  can  only  be evaluated based on detailed characterisation of immunological responses to vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the MN and SRH assays the immunogenicity results obtained with the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg vaccine  formulation  are  consistent  throughout  the  three  clinical  studies  suggesting  that  vaccine  is suitable immunogenic

Therefore the expected benefit of Celvapan is to provide some protection against clinically-apparent infection and/or possibly against development of severe disease in case of an influenza pandemic. It is unlikely  that  Celvapan  containing  the  antigens  from  the  strain  derived  from  A/Vietnam/1203/2004 would provide adequate protection if used during a pandemic. In line with the developed core dossier concept, a variation would therefore have to be submitted to introduce the WHO/EU recommended strain, prepared from the influenza virus causing the pandemic, prior to use of Celvapan.

Risks Celvapan  is  commonly  or  very  commonly  associated  with  a  range  of  local  and  systemic  adverse reactions but these are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile would not preclude the use of the vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-60 years or &gt; 60 years. The  current  safety  database  is  considered  to  be  sufficient  to  describe  adverse  reactions  that  occur uncommonly and to give an indication of any rare events. However, there are some adverse reactions known to be very rarely associated with influenza vaccines and it is currently not possible to predict if higher  rates  might  be  observed  with  Celvapan  compared  with,  for  example,  seasonal  influenza vaccines. Balance The overall B/R of Celvapan is positive. A risk management plan was submitted in accordance with the CHMP-recommended core RMP for these types of vaccines when intended only for use during an actual pandemic. The clinical and pharmacovigilance specific obligations identified for Celvapan can only be fulfilled if and  when  a  pandemic  is  officially  declared.  The  data  which  could  form  the  basis  of  an  annual reassessment will therefore only be available after the pandemic has occurred. Since a review of these specific  conditions  would  provide  no  relevant  information  in  the  absence  of  a  declared  pandemic situation, an annual review of the exceptional circumstances status should be initiated only in case the Pandemic is declared. Recommendation Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Celvapan for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared  pandemic  situation,  in  accordance  with  official  guidance,  was  favourable  and  therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.
