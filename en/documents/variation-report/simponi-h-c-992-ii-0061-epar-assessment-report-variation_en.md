## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Golimumab is a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to both soluble and trans-membrane forms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and inhibits TNFα bioactivity. Golimumab is classified according to the ATC Classification System as a TNFα inhibitor. Other members of this therapeutic class include infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Simponi is approved for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Axial spondyloarthritis (Axial SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the axial skeleton typically manifested by chronic back pain, spinal inflammation, seropositivity for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and extra-articular manifestations. Axial SpA encompasses both AS and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-Axial SpA), the latter of which includes patients with little to no changes in the sacroiliac joints on plain radiographs and thus do not meet modified New York criteria for AS.

The Assessments in Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for classification of Axial SpA , are; Back pain of ≥3 month duration at age of onset &lt;45, and either of the three is true : 1. The subject has active (acute) inflammation on MRI highly suggestive of sacroiliitis associated with SpA and in addition at least one of the below clinical features; 2. The subject has definitive sacroiliitis (grade ≥2 bilaterally or ≥3 unilaterally) on x-ray and in addition at least one of the below clinical features; 3.  The subject is HLA B27 positive and has at least two further of the below clinical features.

The clinical features include: HLA B27 positivity;-inflammatory back pain; arthritis; enthesitis;   uveitis; dactylitis; psoriasis; Crohn's/colitis; elevated CRP; good response to NSAIDs in the past; family history for SpA.

nr-Axial SpA is thus a subgroup of Axial SpA, consisting of those who do not meet criterion # 2 above.

The modified NY criteria for AS (mNY) require x-ray findings of sacroiliitis grade ≥2 bilaterally or grade 3-4 unilaterally. In addition, at least 1 of the 3 following clinical criteria must be fulfilled:

-Low back pain and stiffness for more than 3 months that improves with exercise but is not relieved by rest.

- -Limitation of motion of the lumbar spine in the sagittal and frontal planes.
- -Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values correlated for age and sex.

Patients with nr-Axial SpA have substantial disease burden, similar to patients with AS, who have relatively longer disease duration. Progression from nr-Axial SpA to AS occurs in approximately 10% of patients within the first 2 years from onset of symptoms and in approximately 60% of patients after 10 year (Sampiano-Barros et al, Clin Rheumatol, 2001) The Assessment in Spondyloarthritis international Society (ASAS) has recommended use of TNFα antagonists in patients with active AS or nr-Axial SpA, following failure of at least 2 NSAIDs over a 4 week period or intolerance to such agents (van der Heijde et al, Ann Rheum Dis 2011). TheTNFα antagonists adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept are approved for the treatment of nr-Axial SpA.

With this variation, the MAH sought to add the following new indication to the product information:

'Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-Axial SpA)

Simponi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe, active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)'.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The proposed indication for golimumab for the treatment of nr-Axial SpA is supported by the results of an on-going single, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (P07642).

This submission focuses on:

- Efficacy data through Week 16 (the placebo-controlled period) and through Week 24 from P07642. The main focus is on 16-week data describing the efficacy of golimumab in the improvement of signs and symptoms of disease, spinal mobility, inflammation as measured by MRI, physical function, and health-related quality of life. Data from the open label period through Week 24 demonstrate the persistence of treatment effect.
- PK and immunogenicity data through Week 16 from P07642
- Safety data through the last data cut-off (06 May 2014) from P07642 is described comprehensively in 3 presentations:
1. Comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the combined AS studies (C0524T09 and C0524T29) dataset.
2. Comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the large datasets derived from the combined Phase 3 SC rheumatologic studies (AS, RA, and PsA).
3. Comparisons of data from the P07642 study and overall dataset derived from the large, long term safety database for golimumab in AS, RA, PsA, UC and asthma studies as detailed in section 2.5 (Safety).

There is no specific guideline for the development of medicinal products for the treatment of nr Axial SpA. The clinical study supporting this extension of indication is in line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of AS (CPMP/EWP/4891/03) with respect to study design, main efficacy endpoint, and secondary endpoints.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The PK of golimumab was evaluated in the Phase 3 study (Study P07642).

Samples for golimumab concentration analysis were collected at Baseline (Week 0) and Week 16 before the administration of study medication. All samples from subjects randomized to placebo showed golimumab concentrations &lt;0.039 μg/mL, the lower limit of quantification for the assay.

Serum golimumab concentrations at Week 16 were evaluated in 2 populations: all subjects treated and the objective signs of inflammation (OSI) subpopulation, which was defined as subjects with baseline evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI and/or screening CRP level &gt;ULN.

Median golimumab concentrations at Week 16 for the OSI population were the same to the all treated population (0.8 and 0.8 μg/mL, respectively).

An analysis of trough serum golimumab concentrations by weight quartiles was performed for Study P07642 and a trend in lower concentrations for subjects in the higher weight quartiles were observed.

Study C0524T09 was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (through Week 24) study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical pharmacology of golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg administered as SC injections Q4W in adult subjects with active AS.

Trough serum golimumab concentrations achieved steady state by Week 12 and were approximately proportional to dose after SC administrations of golimumab 50 mg Q4W and 100 mg Q4W. At Week 12, the median steady-state trough concentrations were 0.6 μg g/mL and 1.1 μg g/mL in the 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. Serum trough golimumab concentrations from Week 52 were generally maintained through Week 256 and were similar to the observed median serum golimumab concentrations observed at Week 24.

An analysis of trough serum golimumab concentrations by weight quartiles performed for the original submission and a trend in lower concentrations for subjects in the higher weight quartiles were observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Impact of weight

In P07642, the effect of body weight on PK was examined by weight quartile and body-weight cut at 100 kg (Table 1). When serum golimumab concentrations were evaluated by weight quartiles, subjects in the higher weight quartile tended to have lower serum concentrations than those in the lower weight quartile. This trend was also seen in similar analyses conducted for the 5 Phase 3 AS, RA, and PsA studies. Subjects with body weights &gt;100 kg tended to have lower serum golimumab concentrations than subjects with body weights ≤100 kg. Due to the small number of golimumab-treated subjects weighing &gt;100 kg (n=6) in P07642, weight-based PK/efficacy analyses were not performed. However, in previous efficacy-by-body weight analyses done for the rheumatological indications, a trend toward a decreased response rate with increasing weight was observed when comparing subjects who weighed ≤100 kg with those weighing &gt;100 kg.

## Impact of immunogenicity

In Study P07642, antibodies to golimumab were evaluated at Week 0 and Week 16. The overall incidence of antibodies to golimumab in subjects with nr-Axial SpA in P07642 through Week 16 was 4.3% (4/93). A similar result was observed in subjects with AS in C0524729 study, where antibodies to golimumab were evaluated at Week 0 and Week 24. The incidence of antibodies to golimumab was 5.7% (5/87). For subjects who were positive for antibodies to golimumab, 100% were positive for neutralizing antibodies through Week 16 and Week 24 in P07642 and C0524T09, respectively. Serum golimumab concentrations were generally low in those subjects who were classified as positive for antibodies to golimumab. All subjects in P07642 who were positive for antibodies to golimumab (and neutralizing antibodies), sufficient efficacy was observed despite their exposures being at the lower limit of quantification when measured at Week 16. This suggested that development of immunogenic response had little impact on efficacy.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The pharmacokinetics of golimumab has been described previously in healthy subjects and in patients with RA as described in the product information. In summary, the median time to reach maximum serum concentrations ranged from 2 to 6 days following subcutaneous administration. Following a single subcutaneous injection of 100 mg, the absorption of golimumab was similar in the upper arm, abdomen, and thigh, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 51%. Golimumab exhibits approximately dose proportional PK. The average volume of distribution (V) has been shown to be 115 mL/kg and systemic clearance (CL) of golimumab was estimated to be 6.9 mL/day/kg. Terminal half-life was estimated to be approximately 12 days in healthy subjects and similar values were observed in patients with RA, PsA, AS, or UC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a limited number of RA patients treated with subcutaneous golimumab over a 6-month period, concomitant use of MTX reduced the apparent clearance of golimumab by approximately 36%. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that concomitant use of NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids or sulfasalazine did not influence the apparent clearance of golimumab.

The PK of golimumab was evaluated in the Phase 3 study (Study P07642) in patients with nr-Axial SpA. PK samples for serum golimumab concentration were collected from all subjects at Day1, Week 16 and Week 52. The same serum samples were used for the measurement of golimumab concentrations and detection of antibodies to golimumab. Serum samples were analyzed for golimumab concentrations using a validated electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) on a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) Platform. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) with the MSD platform was 0.039 μg/mL at a 1:5 dilution. Serum samples for the detection of antibodies to golimumab were analyzed using a validated enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The bioanalytical methods have been used in previous SC studies and therefore been described in detail in previous submissions.

The steady-state median golimumab concentration for all subjects treated with golimumab 50 mg was 0.8 μg/mL. These concentration values were consistent with those observed in AS Study C0524T09 and were within the range of steady-state golimumab concentrations observed in the other rheumatological indications. The results suggested that golimumab exposure is similar between the nr-Axial SpA population and populations in other rheumatologic indications, thus supporting consistency in posology across the rheumatologic indications.

Due to similarity in the median steady-state concentrations at Week 16 between nr-Axial SpA and AS, and dose linearity previously established for SC golimumab from 50 mg to 400 mg, it is expected that this trend in efficacy seen in the rheumatological indications may also occur in nr-Axial SpA. Therefore, the MAH proposed posology consistent with the approved posology for the other rheumatologic indications. This was agreed by the CHMP.

Antibodies to golimumab were evaluated at Week 0 and Week 16 for Study P07642. The overall incidence of antibodies to golimumab in subjects with nr-Axial SpA in P07642 through Week 16 was 4.3% (4/93). This incidence was stated to be similar to the incidence in subjects with AS in Study C0524T09 through Week 24 (5.7%, 5/87) and in subjects with other rheumatologic diseases.

In P07642, the 4 subjects positive for antibodies to golimumab were also positive for neutralizing antibodies through Week 16. Serum golimumab concentrations were below the limit of detection at Week 16 for all 4 subjects.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The pharmacokinetics of golimumab has been adequately studied to support the use in patients with nr-Axial SpA. The correlation between exposure and weight appears to be similar to that in previously studied patient populations and the proposal regarding dosing in patients weighing &gt;100 kg is adequately supported.

## Treatments

This study randomized 198 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either the golimumab treatment arm (Arm A, 50mg SC Q4W) or the placebo treatment arm (Arm B). The 50 mg SC Q4W dose regimen was selected for evaluation in the nr-Axial SpA (P07642)study to be consistent with the approved regimen for the treatment of other rheumatologic diseases (RA, PsA, and AS) globally. Precedence for this approach exists with the anti-TNF inhibitors etanercept, adalimumab and certolizumab, which all dose nr-Axial SpA patients with the same dose as AS patients.

Subjects were allowed to remain on a stable daily dose of NSAIDS during this study as long as this dosage was initiated at least 30 days prior to Screening. A new NSAID could not be initiated until Week 16; however NSAIDs could be initiated after Week 16 at the investigator's discretion. In addition, the following medications could be initiated after Week 16 at the investigator's discretion: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or hydroxycholoroquine. Intra-articular, tendon sheath, or bursal corticosteroid injections

## Objectives

Primary Efficacy Trial Objective: To evaluate the effect of golimumab 50 mg compared to placebo in the treatment of active axial SpA, as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16.

Primary Safety Trial Objective: To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of GLM 50 mg through Week 16 in the active axial SpA population.

Key Secondary Trial Objectives: (1)To evaluate the treatment effect of golimumab 50 mg compared to placebo as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving ASAS 40 response at Week 16. (2)To evaluate the treatment effect of golimumab 50 mg compared to placebo as measured by the proportion of subjects who achieve Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 response at Week 16. (3)To evaluate the treatment effect of golimumab 50 mg compared to placebo as measured by the proportion of subjects who achieve ASAS partial remission at Week 16. (4)To evaluate the treatment effect of golimumab 50 mg compared to placebo by the change in the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) MRI SI joints score from Baseline to Week 16.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was proportion of subjects achieving ASAS 20 response at Week 16.

ASAS-20 is defined as meeting both criteria:

1. An improvement of ≥20% from Baseline and an absolute improvement from Baseline of ≥10 mm in at least 3 of the following 4 domains:
- a) Patient global assessment
- b) Pain (total back pain)
- c) Function (BASFI)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- d) Inflammation (average of the last 2 questions of the BASDAI concerning morningstiffness)
2. Absence of deterioration from Baseline (≥20% and an absolute change of ≥10 mm) in the potential remaining domain.

Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved

- ASAS 40 response at Week 16,
- BASDAI 50 response at Week 16
- ASAS Partial Remission at Week 16
- Change from baseline to Week 16 in the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) MRI SI joints score

The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of six 10-unit horizontal NRSs to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration, respectively) over the last week. The final BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity. BASDAI 50 response is defined as improvement by at least 50% from baseline in BASDAI

## ASAS Partial Remission is defined as a VAS score of less than 20mm in each of the 4 domains of ASAS 20

The other secondary efficacy variables of P07642 were:

- Change in BASFI from Baseline to Week 16, 24, and 52;
- Change in BASMI from Baseline to Week 16; 24, and 52
- Change in CRP from Baseline to Week 16, 24, and 52
- Proportion of subjects achieving ASAS 5/6 at Week 16, 24, and 52
- Change in ASDAS-C from Baseline to Week 16, 24, and 52
- Proportion of subjects achieving low ASDAS-C (&lt;1.3) week 16, 24, and 52
- ASAS 20 response at Week 8, 12, 24, and 52
- ASAS 40 response at Week 24, and 52
- Proportion of subjects achieving BASDAI 50 at Week 24 and 52
- Proportion of subjects in ASAS partial remission at Week 24 and 52
- Change in SF-36 from Baseline to Week 16 and 52
- Change in ASQoL from Baseline to week 16 and 52
- Change in swollen and tender joint count from Baseline to Week 16, 24, and 52
- Change in chest wall expansion from Baseline to Week 16, 24, and 52; Change in EQ-5D from Baseline to Week 16 and 52
- Change in WPAI from Baseline to Week 16 and 52
- Patient's Global Disease Assessment VAS, Total Back Pain VAS and Nocturnal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Pain VAS from Baseline to Week 16, 24 and 52
- Change in Physician's Global VAS from Baseline to Week 16, 24 and 52
- Change in MASES Index from Baseline to Week 16, 24 and 52

The BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index) is the function domain of ASAS measures. is reported as a mean (VAS, 0 to 10 cm) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the functional anatomy of the subject and 2 of which relate to the subject's ability to cope with everyday life.

The BASMI is a score comprising 5 measures of hip and spinal mobility:

1. Tragus-to-wall
2. Lumbar flexion (modified Schober test)
3. Cervical rotation
4. Lateral lumbar side flexion
5. Maximal intermalleolar distance.

The 5 continuous measurements are used in conjunction with a scoring system to obtain a score on a scale of 0 to 10. The final BASMI score is the mean of the 5 scores. The higher the score, the more severe the patient's limitation of movement.

ASAS 5/6 is defined as a 20% improvement in any 5 of the following 6 domains: pain (VAS 0 to 10 cm), patient global (VAS 0 to 10 cm), function (BASFI score), morning stiffness (BASDAI, average of questions 5 and 6), CRP, and spine mobility (lumber side flexion).

The ASDAS-C is a composite index to assess disease activity in AS. It combines the following 5 disease activity variables into a single score: back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global score, peripheral pain/swelling, and CRP. An ASDAS-C score of &lt; 1.3 has been defined as inactive disease or clinical remission.

The WPAI measured time missed from work, impairment of work, and impairment of regular activities due to overall health and symptoms. The WPAI is assessed relative to measures of general health perceptions, role (physical), role (emotional), pain, symptom severity, global measures of work, and interference with regular activity.

The MASES is an index to measure enthesitis and the evaluation consists of measures at 13 sites, which are scored as 0 or 1 (0 - non tender, 1 tender). It is the sum of all site scores (from 0 to13).

## Sample size

Study P07642 was expected to randomize approximately 200 subjects.

For the primary endpoint, with the planned sample size of 100 subjects per group, there is at least 95% power to detect a 26% treatment difference between golimumab 50 mg and placebo (2-sided, overall a=0.050), assuming the true response rate for the placebo group is 25%. The placebo response rate was estimated based on the pivotal golimumab study in AS.

## Randomisation

One-hundred and ninety-eight subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the golimumab treatment arm (Arm A) or the placebo treatment arm (Arm B). 197 subjects were treated.

Subjects were stratified based on whether they had evidence of sacroiliitis (active inflammation) on MRI of the sacroiliac joint (yes/no) and CRP level (≤ ULN/ &gt; ULN [0.9mg/dL]). Subjects without evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI were limited to 50% of the total enrolled population. Subjects with a normal CRP level at screening (according to the central lab) were limited to 60% of total enrolled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Central confirmation of subject x-ray eligibility and MRI stratification was based on a single reading of Screening Visit x-rays and MRI scans of the SI joints, respectively. Readers were blinded to treatment assignment, clinical information, and results of investigator readings. Stratification for presence of MRI sacroiliitis at screening based on ASAS MRI criteria18 was undertaken for subjects not meeting modified New York criteria. Central evaluation of changes in SI joint inflammation (for the key secondary endpoint) was performed by duplicate independent readings of MRI scans for each subject. The readers were additionally blinded to the chronological order of the scans and the scores of other readers. Scoring of the SI joints utilized the SPARCC scoring system. Discrepancies between the two readers were adjudicated by a third reader.

## Blinding (masking)

Part 1 was a double-blind period, with in-house blinding. The investigator, study nurse, study participant, and sponsor personnel remained blinded to the treatment group assignments. An Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/ Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) was used to maintain the blind.

Data that could potentially unblind the treatment assignment (i.e., CRP values and MRI scores) were masked prior to unblinding.

Part 2 was open-label.

Central confirmation of subject x-ray eligibility and MRI stratification was based on a single reading of Screening Visit x-rays and MRI scans of the SI joints, respectively. Readers were blinded to treatment assignment, clinical information, and results of investigator readings. Stratification for presence of MRI sacroiliitis at screening based on ASAS MRI criteria18 was undertaken for subjects not meeting modified New York criteria. Central evaluation of changes in SI joint inflammation (for the key secondary endpoint) was performed by duplicate independent readings of MRI scans for each subject. The readers were additionally blinded to the chronological order of the scans and the scores of other readers. Scoring of the SI joints utilized the SPARCC scoring system. Discrepancies between the two readers were adjudicated by a third reader.

## Statistical methods

Efficacy Analysis of the Primary Endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint,  the proportion of ASAS 20 responders at Week 16, using the FAS population was evaluated using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with baseline evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI (yes or no) and screening CRP level (≤ULN/ &gt;ULN [0.9 mg/dL]) as the stratification factors.

Two supportive analyses were performed on the primary endpoint. One used the Per-Protocol Population and the other considered subjects who discontinued due to an AE as non-responders.

Efficacy Analysis of Secondary Endpoints

## Part 1

The binary response type secondary variables were evaluated in the same way as the primary variable.

The change from Baseline in the SPARCC MRI SI joint score was compared between golimumab 50 mg and placebo using the Mann-Whitney test.

Other continuous secondary variables were evaluated using a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model proposed by Liang and Zeger. The analysis model included terms for treatment, week, baseline evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI (yes or no), screening CRP level (≤ULN/ &gt; ULN) and treatment by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

week interaction. The treatment difference in terms of mean change from baseline at Week 16 was estimated and tested from this model. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements.

If the continuous variables were not considered to be normally distributed, then a nonparametric test, such as Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed.

## Part 2

Subjects who successfully completed Part 1 (Weeks 0-16), were eligible to participate in Part 2 (Weeks 16-60) of the trial.  All subjects in Part 2 received golimumab 50 mg SC at Week 16 (after completion of all visit assessments), and every 4 weeks thereafter, with the final dose administered at Week 48.  A final efficacy assessment will be performed after Week 52 as well as a final safety assessment at Week 60, 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment is targeted to be administered.

To assess the long-term treatment effect, descriptive statistics of the efficacy endpoints for the FAS population (counts and percentages for binary response type variables; mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables) were tabulated by treatment group (golimumab 50 mg/ golimumab 50 mg, placebo/ golimumab 50 mg) at each visit.

Multiplicity adjustment for Type I error control was implemented in the Part 1 analyses using a closed testing procedure to control the overall α level at 0.05 for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint was tested first and if significant, was followed by tests of the key secondary endpoints in the order presented. Efficacy results will be considered statistically significant after consideration of the strategy for controlling the Type I error. All statistical tests were conducted at the alpha=0.05 (2-sided) level.

Both the multiplicity method and the primary and key secondary endpoint analyses were prespecified in the protocol.

## Efficacy Analysis Populations

The primary (overall) population for efficacy analyses is called the efficacy Full Analysis Set (FAS) population (also referred to as the All Treated [AT] population; n=197 in Part 1); the safety population consists of all subjects as treated (n=197 in Part 1). A per protocol population is also defined (n=174 in Part 1).  The subgroup population consisting of subjects with evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI and/or screening CRP level &gt;upper limit of normal is referred to as the OSI population (n=158) and is the same subgroup for both efficacy and safety analyses. Efficacy analysis populations in P07642 are outlined in Table 3.

## Missing Data Imputation Strategy

For the ASAS related endpoints at Week 16 (ASAS 20, ASAS 40, ASAS 5/6, and ASAS partial remission), if subjects were missing all of the ASAS components at Week 16, they were considered to not have achieved the primary endpoint. Zero-divisor and component-wise missing data rules also applied.

For BASDAI 50, if the subject had no observation at Week 16, then the last non-missing observation prior to Week 16, including the Baseline value, was carried forward to Week 16. The missing data at other timepoints, such as Week 24 and Week 52, were imputed similarly.

In case of missing BASFI responses at a specific timepoint, the mean score was based on the available data from a minimum of 5 questions. In case of missing BASMI responses at a specific timepoint, the mean score was based on the available data from a minimum of 3 components. Otherwise, BASFI or BASMI were considered missing at that timepoint. Only observed data were used in the analyses and summaries, no missing data were imputed.

In addition, subjects who met any one of the treatment failure criteria prior to Week 16 had the change from Baseline set to 0 at Week 16. No treatment failure rule was used for BASFI or BASMI at timepoints after Week 16.

ASDAS-C was calculated if all the components were non-missing. Otherwise, ASDAS-C was considered missing. Only observed data were used in the analyses and summaries, no missing data were imputed.

## Component-wise missing data rules:

1. For any ASAS component, if the component value is missing from baseline through Week 16, then 0% will be assigned for the percent improvement from baseline of that component;
2. If the subject has a baseline value but no observation at Week 16, then the last non-missing observation prior to Week 16, including the baseline value, will be carried forward to Week 16;
3. If the baseline value is missing for a component, but a post-baseline value is observed prior to or at Week 16, then the median component value from all subjects with baseline data in the same stratum (defined based on the baseline MRI and CRP) will be used to impute the baseline value.

The missing data at other timepoints, such as Week 24 and Week 52 will be imputed similarly as described above.

For all other continuous endpoints only observed data were used in the analyses and summaries, no missing data were imputed.

## Results

## Participant flow

Of the 393 subjects screened for inclusion in the study, a total of 198 subjects were randomized, with 98 assigned to receive golimumab 50 mg and 100 assigned to placebo.  One hundred and ninety of the 198 (96.0%) randomized subjects completed the placebo-controlled period of the study (Part 1 through Week 16).

At the time of the database lock, 187 subjects (94.4%) had completed treatment through Week 24; 155 subjects (78.3%) had completed treatment through Week 52 in the open-label period of the study (Part 2), 24 (12.1%) had discontinued the study, and 21 (10.6%) subjects were ongoing in Part 2.

## Recruitment

Subjects were randomized at 52 study centers in 13 countries worldwide (Western Europe, Eastern Europe and North America). Enrollment at each study center ranged from 1 to 12 subjects.

## Conduct of the study

Protocol violators were identified prior to the first unblinding of the database and were excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis. The Per-Protocol population excluded 23 subjects based on a set of prespecified criteria; 13 from the golimumab 50 mg group and 10 from the placebo group. Excluded subjects included 8 (4%) subjects with violations on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 9 (4.5%) subjects with low medication compliance or early discontinuation from Part 1 (subjects did not receive all 4 doses of study medication), 4 (2%) subjects with use of prohibited medications or unstable NSAID use (change in dose, initiation of a new NSAID or discontinuation of NSAID)

One subject was identified as not meeting inclusion criterion 3 for nr-Axial SpA diagnosis because the subject did not have sacroiliitis on MRI and was HLA-B27 negative. This was not discovered until after the data base lock, therefore, this subject was still included in the per-protocol analysis.

Eight sites reported having visual analogue scales that were not the standard 100 mm length. A full investigation was conducted and corrected scales provided. A mathematical formula was used to convert the values recorded on the incorrect scales to the standard scale length.

## Baseline data

Of the 198 randomized subjects, 57% were men. All subjects were White, with an average age of 31 years. Demographic and subject characteristics were generally similar between the treatment groups; however, there was a numerically higher proportion of women in the placebo (48.0%) than in the golimumab group (37.8%).

Baseline disease characteristics were also similar between treatment groups and indicative of a population with nr-Axial SpA. More than 80% of subjects were HLA-B27 positive (82.7% in the golimumab 50 mg group, 82% in the placebo group). Mean BASDAI scores of 6.6 cm in the golimumab 50 mg group and 6.4 cm in the placebo group were consistent with substantial disease activity. Mean Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score CRP (ASDAS-C) scores were 3.6 and 3.5 in the golimumab and placebo groups, respectively. Two thirds of subjects had a positive MRI (evidence of sacroiliitis on the screening; 67.3% in the golimumab group, 66.0% in the placebo group), and 40.8% of subjects in the golimumab group and 41% in the placebo group had elevated CRP (mean 1.52 mg/dL, golimumab; mean 1.29 mg/dL, placebo). Elevated CRP was defined as CRP above the central laboratory upper limit of normal (0.9 mg/dL).

Demographic and subject characteristics and most baseline disease characteristics in the OSI population were similar between the treatment groups and generally similar to those of the overall population. As expected, there were differences between the overall and OSI populations in terms of baseline MRI SI Joint scores and CRP levels, given the definition of the OSI population. Mean Baseline SPARCC MRI SI Joint levels were 11.3 vs. 14.1 in the overall and OSI populations, respectively, and mean Baseline CRP scores were 1.40 mg/dL vs. 1.68 mg/dL in the overall and OSI populations, respectively.

## Numbers analysed

Part 1 efficacy data were evaluated separately from those of Part 2. At the time of Stage 1 lock, all subjects had completed Week 24. Efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS, Per Protocol, and OSI populations. Safety analyses were performed using the ASaT population. Part 1 safety data were evaluated separately from those of Part 2. In addition, cumulative exposure-adjusted AE incidence was provided from randomization to the end of the trial to evaluate the longer term (60 weeks) safety profile. Some subjects were ongoing in Part 2 and their data were analysed up to May 6, 2014 when the final subject completed their Week 24 visit.

## Outcomes and estimation Primary endpoint analysis

The primary endpoint, ASAS 20 response at Week 16, was analysed using the FAS population, consisting of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment in Part 1 (n=197).

The primary objective was achieved. A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group achieved ASAS 20 response compared with subjects in the placebo group (71.1% vs 40.0% in the golimumab 50 mg and placebo groups respectively, p&lt;0.0001; Table 5).

No subjects met the treatment failure criteria prior to Week 16; however, 7 subjects were analysed as non-responders because they discontinued prior to Week 16: 4 (2%) in the golimumab 50 mg group and 3 (1.5%) in the placebo group.

The treatment effects of golimumab 50 mg versus placebo across most of the subgroups based on demographics and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with the treatment effect observed in the FAS population. In the subgroup analysis based on stratification factors, no treatment benefit was observed for subjects with the combination of negative MRI and CRP within normal limits at baseline.

## Sensitivity Analyses

To test the robustness of the primary analysis, a sensitivity analyses in which subjects who discontinued due to an AE were considered non-responders was performed. The results are identical to those based on the primary approach since in both approaches subjects who discontinued prior to Week 16 were considered non-responders.

## Per protocol analyses

The per protocol population excluded 23 subjects based on a set of pre-specified criteria, 13 from the golimumab 50 mg group and 10 from the placebo group. The subjects who met pre-specified criteria included 8 (4%) with violations on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 9 (4.5%) with low medication compliance or early discontinuation from Part I (since these subjects did not receive all 4 doses of study medication), 4 (2%) for use of prohibited medications or unstable NSAID use (i.e. change in dose, initiation of a new NSAID or discontinuation of NSAID) during Part 1 and 3 (2%) with a large visit window between visits. One subject was counted in two criteria.

## Ancillary analyses

Four (4.3%) subjects developed antibodies to golimumab 50 mg through Week 16.  All 4 subjects achieved ASAS20 at Week 16.  This suggests that development of immunogenic response had little impact on efficacy.

Treatment comparisons for pre-specified subgroups defined by demographic, baseline characteristics and stratification factors on ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responder rates were performed.  These included: gender, age (&gt;30 yrs and &lt;=30yrs), weight (&lt;=median, 76 kg, &gt;median, 76 kg), BASDAI score (&lt;=median, 6.35 cm &gt;median, 6.35 cm), HLA-B27 status, use of NSAIDS, region (Western Europe and US, Eastern Europe), MRI (positive, negative) and CRP status (≤ULN, &gt;ULN [0.9 mg/dL]).  Differences between treatment groups, along with 95% CIs and p-values were calculated. No multiplicity control was applied to these statistical tests; results must be interpreted with caution.

<!-- image -->

ASAS 20 responses favouring golimumab 50 mg over placebo were observed in most subgroups with the exception of subjects with the combination of negative MRI and CRP within normal limits at baseline.  For this subgroup, no difference in the ASAS 20 response rate between golimumab 50 mg and placebo was seen. ASAS 40 responses favouring golimumab 50 mg over placebo were observed in all subgroups.

## OSI Population

The OSI population consisted of 158 subjects (80 % of all treated subjects).

The proportions of subjects in the OSI population who achieved ASAS 20, ASAS40, BASDAI 50 and ASAS Partial Remission at Week 16 are presented in Table 17. The proportion of responders was significantly greater in the golimumab 50 mg group than in the placebo group for all of these measures (p&lt;0.0001 for ASAS 20, ASAS 40, BASDAI 50; p=0.0204 for ASAS partial remission).

The SPARCC MRI SI joints score had significantly greater reduction from baseline in the golimumab 50 mg group than in the placebo group at Week 16 (p&lt;0.0001).

Other secondary endpoints were analyzed for the OSI population at Week 16.  For all these endpoints, a significant treatment benefit was observed for subjects in the OSI population treated with golimumab 50 mg versus placebo.

The magnitude of effect with golimumab in the OSI population was numerically similar to or greater than what was observed in the overall study population

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The proposed posology for Simponi is 50 mg given subcutaneously once a month. For patients weighing &gt;100 kg the dose should be 100 mg. This is in line with the posology of the already approved AS-indication, and is endorsed.

The MAH has submitted one pivotal study, P07642. In total, 198 subjects, whereof 125 subjects from EU representing 63% of all subjects, 63 subjects from Russia, and Turkey (32%) and 10 from US (5%) were randomized.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The included subjects were to have a diagnosis of active Axial SpA showing no evidence of radiographically (x-ray) defined sacroiliitis with chronic back pain ≥3 months, and an inadequate response or intolerance to therapy with NSAIDs.

Subjects were stratified based on whether they had active inflammation on MRI of the sacroiliac joint (yes/no) and CRP level (≤upper limit of normal/ &gt;upper limit of normal). Subjects without evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI (using a central reader) were limited to 50% of the total enrolled population. Subjects with a normal CRP level at screening (according to the central lab) were limited to 60% of total enrolled. Treated subjects with baseline evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI and/or screening C-reactive protein (CRP) level &gt;upper limit of normal (ULN; 0.9 mg/dL) made up the prespecified Objective signs of inflammation OSI population.

The primary endpoint was ASAS20 response at Week 16. Key secondary endpoints were ASAS40, BASDAI50, ASAS partial remission and change from baseline in the SPARCC RI SI joint score.

The design of the study is generally endorsed. The chosen primary endpoint is acceptable; however, ASAS40 is of greater interest, since this result is a realistic goal using the products currently on the market. Since this is a key secondary endpoint, the study design is acceptable.

During the study, 8 sites reported having visual analogue scales that were not the standard 100 mm length. Twelve patents were affected, whereof 2 were randomized. A full investigation was conducted, a mathematical conversion of the results was made and corrected scales provided. This is acceptable.

The MAH pointed out that it was possible that a subject had a good response initially to NSAIDs, however, subsequently had inadequate response for 30 days or developed intolerance to NSAID therapy. This is reasonable to CHMP, and this inclusion criterion may be compatible with meeting the NSAID good response criterion for the diagnosis.

It is noted that there seems to be a difference between males and females in achieving the primary endpoint as compared to placebo. This is seen also for ASAS40. The finding is noteworthy, since there was an imbalance between groups, with fewer females in the golimumab group. A similar outcome pattern has occurred with the age groups ≤30 and &gt;30. The MAH has provided a weighted response analysis, showing that the gender and age imbalance between treatment groups did not have a substantial impact on the overall results. The overall size of the result is thus not considered to have been driven by the imbalance and potential effect difference in sex and age.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary endpoints were met. The difference in the percentage of subjects that achieved ASAS 20 response  at Week 16 between the groups  was 31.2% (71.1% vs 40.0% in the golimumab 50 mg and placebo groups respectively, p&lt;0.0001). The primary endpoint analysis was also robust to the exclusion of subjects with pre-specified protocol deviations and to considering subjects who discontinued due to an adverse event as non-responders; the results for both the Per-protocol and sensitivity analyses were consistent with that based on the primary approach. The number of patients discontinuing prior to Week 16 are evenly distributed for the two treatments, which is reassuring for the robustness of the primary results. However there was no information available in the study report about the amount of missing data on the component-wise level for patients remaining in study. Based on the data provided by the MAH the CHMP concluded that the impact of missing data on the evaluation results is small.

All key secondary endpoints were met, the difference between groups in ASAS40 response at week 16 was 33.8% (56.7% compared with the placebo group 23.0%; p&lt;0.0001). Since this efficacy variable is considered as at least as important as the chosen primary endpoint ASAS20, a sensitivity test in form of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analysis of the PP population for ASAS40 response at Week 16 was provided by the MAH and the robustness of the results was supported.

The difference between groups in proportion of subjects achieving BASDAI50 was 28.0 (p &lt;0.0001), ASAS Partial remission 15.2% (p&lt;0.0001). The primary analysis of the change from baseline for SPARCC MRI was made on 161 subjects, since 10 subjects did not have baseline MRI, and 26 either missed Week 16 MRI or performed it too late (more than 5 days after the start of part 2). The difference between groups was still significant.

The treatment effects of golimumab 50 mg versus placebo across most of the subgroups based on demographics and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with the treatment effect observed in the FAS population. In the subgroup analysis based on stratification factors, no treatment benefit was observed for subjects with the combination of negative MRI and CRP within normal limits at baseline. Other endpoints that not were met were swollen and tender joint score respectively, or chest wall expansion. This is not unexpected, given the small number of inflamed peripheral joints in this population, (approximately 1.5 swollen and 3-4 tender). For chest wall expansion the MAH proposed that this may not be affected in this relatively early disease. This may be questioned, since the BL mean values are lower than what could be considered normal. However, the clinical significance is limited.

It was noted that there seems to be a difference between males and females in achieving the primary endpoint as compared to placebo. This was seen also for ASAS40. The finding is noteworthy, since there was an imbalance between groups, with fewer females in the golimumab group. A similar outcome pattern has occurred with the age groups ≤ 30 and &gt;30. The weighted-average responses for ASAS 20 and ASAS 40, compared with the observed FAS population responses provided by the MAH indicated that the effect of the gender and age imbalance in the treatment assignments had minimal impact on the overall size of the treatment effect.

Of the 69 golimumab 50 mg/golimumab 50 mg subjects who achieved ASAS 20 response at Week 16, 66 (95.7%) achieved ASAS 20 response at Week 24. The corresponding figure for ASAS 40 response was 92.7%, for BASDAI 50 91.1%, and for ASAS partial remission 90.6%. There was thus an acceptable persistence of the results achieved at Week 16.

Four (4.3%) subjects developed antibodies to golimumab through Week 16. All 4 achieved ASAS20 at Week 16. The MAH argued that this suggests that development of immunogenic response had little impact on efficacy and has upon request provided key secondary endpoint results for these patients further supporting this.

The magnitude of effect with golimumab in the OSI population was numerically similar to or greater than what was observed in the overall study population.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

One study has been presented, P07642, where 50mg SC Q4W was tested in comparison to placebo during a 16 week period. After week 16 all remaining subjects are treated open label, and the study is ongoing. The primary efficacy endpoint, the ASAS20 response at Week 16 was statistically significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) in the active group (golimumab [71.1%] compared with the placebo group (40.0%). The difference to placebo (31.2%) is clinically relevant. Further, also the secondary endpoint ASAS40, which is considered more relevant for an anti-TNF agent, was met, with a difference to placebo of approximately 33.8% at week 16. Other secondary analyses also support efficacy. Thus, the study results support the efficacy of golimumab in the nr Axial SpA population, regarding symptoms, spinal mobility and inflammation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH will conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (full or reduced treatment regimen) versus treatment withdrawal in subjects with nr Axial SpA who have attained inactive disease while receiving open-label golimumab and to characterise the efficacy of golimumab as retreatment upon flare in subjects with nr-Axial SpA (as described in the RMP).

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The safety profile of golimumab is well established as evidenced by available clinical study and post-authorization safety data and approvals of golimumab for AS, PsA, RA, and UC in adults. The most commonly reported ADR in clinical studies is upper respiratory tract infection. The most serious ADRs that have been reported for golimumab include serious infections (including sepsis, pneumonia, TB, invasive fungal and opportunistic infections), demyelinating disorders, lymphoma, HBV reactivation, CHF, autoimmune processes (lupus-like syndrome) and haematologic reactions.

The discussion of safety in this submission focused on data in the indication of nr Axial SpA provided by the pivotal Phase 3b study P07642 through the data cutoff of 06 May 2014, the date the last subject completed the Week 24 visit. By that date, safety data were available through the end-of-study Week 60 visit for more than 65% of subjects.

In the submission, safety data from the P07642 study were also presented together with data from the combined AS studies (C0524T09 and C0524T29). In addition, the safety data of P07642 was integrated into the overall golimumab safety database upon which the safety data in the product information is derived.

The safety data from the studies mentioned above were combined and presented in 3 different datasets as described below.

- Presentation 1: comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the combined AS studies dataset. This data presentation focused on the proportions of events for overall AEs (eg, AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs) in each study and treatment group.
- Presentation 2 focused on comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the large datasets derived from the combined Phase 3 SC rheumatologic studies (AS, RA, and PsA). This data presentation focused on the incidence of events of interest in each study and treatment group.
- A third data presentation comprised data from the P07642 study and various datasets derived from studies of golimumab in other indications. This data presentation is used to support prescribing safety information and included all indications, both approved and unapproved, with the exceptions of uveitis and Sarcoidosis.

## Combined AS Studies

As of 06 May 2014 in the completed combined AS studies (C0524T09 and C0524T29), a total of 424 subjects had received at least 1 dose of golimumab 50 mg; 130 (30.7%) subjects had been exposed to golimumab 50 mg for &gt;24 weeks to ≤52 weeks, and 251 (59.2%) subjects had been exposed to golimumab 50 mg for &gt;52 weeks. The exposure was 1644 subject-years of follow up for subjects while receiving golimumab and 68 subject years of follow-up for subjects while receiving placebo.

## Phase 3 SC Rheumatologic Studies and UC

Data from the pooled Phase 3 SC studies in rheumatologic indications and UC includes 10 Phase 3 SC studies in rheumatologic indications and UC.

Through the common placebo controlled period in these studies, 1146 subjects received placebo with 271 subject years of follow up and 2702 subjects received golimumab with 651 subject years of follow up. Through the controlled and uncontrolled period in these studies, 1146 subjects received placebo with 557 subject years of follow up and 3661 subjects received golimumab with 10,555 subject years of follow up.

## Adverse events

## P07642

Treatment with golimumab was generally well tolerated in subjects with nr-Axial SpA, with similar safety profiles observed in the placebo and golimumab 50 mg groups. Through the last data cut-off, no deaths, serious opportunistic infections, active tuberculosis, malignancies, or serious systemic hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reactions) were reported. Two serious infections were reported in the golimumab group through the last data cut-off.

Key safety results through Week 16 from P07642 are presented in Table 19.

Analyses of events of interest were performed for certain events (infections, serious infections, infections of interest, demyelination, malignancies, congestive heart failure, major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE], hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness, anaphylactic reactions, and clinically important hepatobiliary events). These incidence rates are calculated based on the duration of the safety follow up, expressed as incidence per 100 subject-years to adjust for differences in safety follow-up.

## Serious infections

Through Week 16, there were no serious infections in the placebo or golimumab 50 mg groups in the P07642 study and combined AS studies.

Through the last data cutoff, there were 2 subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group in the P07642 study reporting 1 or more serious infections. The incidence of serious infections per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the last data cutoff in the P07642 study was 0.00 (95% CI: 0.00, 9.59) in the placebo group and 1.17 (95% CI: 0.14, 4.21) in the golimumab 50 mg group.

Through the last data cut-off, there were 2 subjects with hypersensitivity reactions in the golimumab 50 mg group in the P07642 study.

The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the last data cutoff in the P07642 study was 0.00 (95% CI:  0.00, 9.59) in the placebo group and 1.17 (95% CI:  0.14, 4.21) in the golimumab 50 mg group

The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the last data cutoff in the P07642 study and combined AS studies was 0.00 (95% CI:  0.00, 3.03) in the placebo group and 1.12 (95% CI:  0.58, 1.95) in the golimumab 50 mg group with the CI for the golimumab 50 mg group contained within the CI for placebo group.

## Serum Sickness and Anaphylactic Reactions

Through the last data cut-off, there were no subjects with any anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reactions in the P07642 study

## Clinically Important Hepatobiliary Events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A clinically important hepatobiliary AE was defined as an elevation of ALT ≥3 x ULN associated with total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN, irrespective of the presence of the symptoms or associated AEs, or an ALT elevation ≥3 x ULN associated with an SAE in the hepatobiliary SOC.

Through the last data cut-off, there were no clinically important hepatobiliary events in the P07642 study.

## Injection-site Reactions

Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, there were 3 (3.0%) subjects with 1 or more injection site reactions in the placebo group and none in the golimumab 50 mg group.

Through the last data cutoff in the P07642 study, there were 3 (3.0%) subjects with 1 or more injection-site reactions in the placebo group and 4 (2.1%) subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group. There were 8 injections (0.4%) with injection site reactions in the golimumab 50 mg group with an average of 10.1 administrations.

In the combined AS studies, there were 2 subjects (1.1%) in the placebo group and 27 subjects (6.4%) in the golimumab 50 mg group with 1 or more injection-site reactions. There were 123 injections (0.8%) with injection-site reactions in the golimumab 50 mg group with an average of 26.0 administrations.

The most common injection site reaction in the P07642 study was injection-site pain, and the most common injection site reaction in the combined AS studies was injection-site erythema.

## Antibodies to Golimumab and Adverse Reactions

The relationship between the incidence of antibodies to golimumab and adverse events was assessed in the P07642 study. Following treatment with golimumab 50 mg, 4 subjects had samples at Week 16 which tested positive for anti-golimumab antibodies. One of these 4 subjects positive for anti-golimumab antibodies had an AE of vertebral artery occlusion, which was mild in intensity and resolved.

## Analyses to support prescribing safety information

Analyses of events of interest across the nr-Axial SpA P07642 study, Phase 3 SC studies in rheumatologic indications (RA, PsA, and AS), and Phase 3 UC studies were conducted to support prescribing safety information. For these analyses, 'All Indications' includes studies in nr-Axial SpA, AS, PsA, RA, and UC as described above.

To assess for changes in the frequency of existing ADRs in the product information, an analysis of AEs across indications through the placebo-controlled period was performed. If the ADR did not occur during the placebo-controlled portion of the studies, the frequencies were determined using longer-term data.

Based on these evaluations, the frequency for the following ADRs in the product information changed*:

- Opportunistic infections: 4/4215 (0.09%)
- -Changes from Uncommon to rare
- Bacterial arthritis: 4/4215 (0.09%)
- -Changes from Uncommon to rare

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, there were 2 subjects with any markedly abnormal hematology values. In the placebo group, 1 subject had an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and 1 subject had elevated absolute eosinophils. Through Week 24 one subject in the golimumab 50 mg group had &gt;1 abnormal value for decreased absolute lymphocytes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Through the last data cut-off in the P07642 study, the number of subjects with any markedly abnormal hematology value remained low.

## Clinical Chemistry

## Markedly Abnormal Chemistry Values

Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, there were 4 subjects with any markedly abnormal chemistry values, with elevated potassium and elevated total bilirubin being the only abnormal chemistry values. There were no subjects in the P07642 study with &gt;1 abnormal chemistry value.

Through the last data cut-off in the P07642 study, the number of subjects with any markedly abnormal chemistry value (elevated potassium, elevated ALT, and elevated total bilirubin) remained low. The number of subjects with &gt;1 abnormal chemistry value (elevated total bilirubin) also remained low.

## Maximum Postbaseline ALT/AST Elevations

Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, of the subjects with a baseline ALT ≤ ULN, 3.1% (3 subjects) in the placebo group and 7.7% (7 subjects) in the golimumab group had an ALT &gt;1 to &lt;2 × ULN. Of the subjects with a baseline ALT ≤ ULN, none of the subjects in the placebo group and 3.3% (3 subjects) in the golimumab group had an ALT ≥2 to &lt;3 × ULN. Through We ek 16, no subjects in the P07642 study had an elevated ALT ≥3 × ULN irrespective of baseline ALT levels.

The incidence of postbaseline ALT elevations &gt;1 to &lt;3 x ULN per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the last cutoff in the P07642 study was 25.62 (95% CI:  11.06, 50.48) in the placebo group and 39.04 (30.25, 49.57) in the golimumab 50 mg group with the CI for the golimumab 50 mg group contained within the CI for placebo group.

The incidence of postbaseline ALT elevations &gt;1 to &lt;3 x ULN per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the last cut-off in the combined AS studies was 51.60 (95% CI:  38.42, 67.85) in the placebo group and 55.95 (51.57, 60.60) in the golimumab 50 mg group with the CI for the golimumab 50 mg group contained within the CI for placebo group.

## Safety in special populations

Through the last data cut-off, in the P07642 study and combined AS studies, there was no discernable effect of demographics (gender, race, weight, age) on the proportions of subjects with AEs

As of 06 Apr 2014, a total of 169 pregnancies had been reported in patients or partners of patients treated with golimumab from clinical trials and the postmarketing setting.

In the P07642 study through the last data cutoff (06 May 2014), there was 1 pregnancy reported in the partner of a subject who received golimumab 50 mg. The female partner of Subject 201000007/114809 in the golimumab 50 mg group experienced a spontaneous abortion (reported as fetal loss) at less than 20 weeks. Conception was prior to subject starting golimumab.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No formal studies of drug-drug interactions were performed with golimumab.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Through Week 16 (the placebo-controlled period), in the P07642 study (1.0% [1 subject] in the placebo group and 2.1% [2 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) discontinued study agent because of 1 or more adverse events compared with the combined AS studies (0.5% [1 subject] in the placebo group and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2.0% [5 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) and C0524T09 (1.3% [1 subject] in the placebo group and 2.9% [4 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group).

The SOC with the highest proportions of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent was Investigations; however, most events occurred once with no discernable pattern in the types of AEs or evidence of a dose response.

In the P07642 study (2.6% [5 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) discontinued study agent because of 1 or more adverse events compared with the combined AS studies (3.3% [14 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) and C0524T09 (5.6% [12 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group).

## Post marketing experience

The MAH points out that no postmarketing data in the indication of nr-Axial SpA is available for golimumab. The postmarketing safety profile of golimumab is closely monitored and reported on an ongoing basis via the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report/Periodic Safety Update Report (PBRER/PSUR). The Applicant's routine pharmacovigilance activities include systematic collection of AEs from multiple sources and real-time and periodic medical assessments of single and aggregate cases to identify potential safety signals. As of 06 Apr 2014, an estimated 224,116 patients have been exposed to commercial golimumab worldwide since launch (Golimumab Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report-Periodic Safety Update Report [PBRER-PSUR], 07 April 2013 to 06 April 2014).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH has presented safety data for the nr-Axial SpA indication from the pivotal study P07642. As supportive analyses, safety data from this study were compared with data from the safety database for golimumab in other indications. Of these, AS is of the greatest interest, given the close similarities between the affected populations.

Safety data from the P07642 study was presented through week 16, 24 and the last data cut-off point, which was 06 May 2014. As of that date, the last subject had completed 24 weeks. A total of 193 subjects had received at least 1 dose of golimumab 50 mg; 113 (58.5%) subjects had been exposed to golimumab for &gt;24 weeks to ≤52 weeks, and 68 (35.2%) subjects had been exposed to golimumab for &gt;52 weeks.

No new adverse drug reactions were identified in the safety data from study 07642. As could be expected, the most common AEs occurred within the SOC Infections and infestations (23.0% in the placebo group and 24.7% in the golimumab group (through week 16). The most common PT was nasopharyngitis followed by upper respiratory tract infection. The corresponding results in the combined AS studies were 22.0% in the placebo group and 28.9% in the golimumab 50 mg group. The SOC with the second most frequently reported AEs was gastrointestinal disorders ,15.0% in the placebo group and 8.2% in the golimumab 50 mg group in the P07642 study and 11.5% in the placebo group and 16.3% in the golimumab 50 mg group in the combined AS studies.

During the placebo-controlled period, i.e. the first 16 weeks of the study, 1 SAE emerged in the golimumab treated group. This was a foetal death in the female partner of a male subject, who had not yet been exposed to golimumab by the time of conception. By the last data cutoff, 5 additional subjects in the golimumab group had experienced 1 or more SAEs (duodenitis, uterine polyp, staphylococcal infection, bacterial infection, and migraine). This corresponds to 3.1% of the subjects randomized to golimumab. In the combined AS studies, 9.0% (38 subjects) of the golimumab 50 mg group had 1 or more SAEs through the last data cut-off.

There were no malignancies, TB infections, cases of sepsis or opportunistic infections, events of demyelination, events of congestive heart failure, MACE, clinically important hepatobiliary events, or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reactions observed in the Phase 3 P07642 nr-Axial SpA study through the last data cut-off.

Through the last data cut-off in the P07642 study (2.1% [4 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) discontinued study agent because of 1 or more adverse events compared with the combined AS studies (1.7% [6 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) and C0524T09 (2.2% [4 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group).

Based upon the additional data provided from the P07642 study, the MAH proposed to update the product information for frequency of 2 AEs, 'opportunistic infections' and 'bacterial arthritis'. Both ADRs would be classified as rare instead of uncommon. This update is endorsed by the CHMP.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

No new significant safety signal has emerged in study P07642. The MAH also refers to the existing AS, RA and UC safety data bases, and has provided comparisons between the safety results from the current nr-Axial SpA and combined AS studies, as well as to combined rheumatologic studies and all combined golimumab studies.

Upon review of the submitted data, it is concluded that the adverse event (AE) incidence and profile of golimumab in the nr-Axial SpA-population was as expected for an anti-TNF-therapy and consistent with previous experience with golimumab.

There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is no disease activity following treatment, or the safety and efficacy of retreatment after disease flare. The MAH will conduct a clinical study to evaluate the safety of golimumab as re treatment for a disease-activity flare in subjects who have been able to withdraw treatment for nr-Axial SpA after attaining inactive disease (as described in the RMP).

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 11.1 is acceptable.

The RMP was updated to include data on nr-Axial SpA and performed studies in relevant sections of the RMP while no changes to the Summary of safety concerns (Part II, Module SVIII), the Pharmacovigilance Plan (Part III) nor the Risk Minimisation measures (Part V) were implemented.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, changes related to section 4.8, 'Description of selected adverse reactions' of the SmPC has been updated with regard to incidence numbers. Further, the table in section 4.8 has been updated regarding the frequency of 'Opportunistic infection' and 'Bacterial arthritis', both changed from Uncommon to Rare. This was endorsed by the CHMP.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

One study has been presented, P07642, where 50mg SC Q4W was tested in comparison to placebo during a 16 week period. After week 16 all remaining subjects are treated open label, and the study is ongoing.The primary efficacy endpoint, the ASAS20 response at Week 16 was statistically significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) in the active group (golimumab [71.1%] compared with the placebo group (40.0%). The difference to placebo (31.2%) is clinically relevant. Further, also the secondary endpoint ASAS40, which is considered more relevant for an anti-TNF agent, was met, with a difference to placebo of approximately 33.8% at week 16. Other secondary analyses also support efficacy. Thus, the study results support the efficacy of golimumab in the nr Axial SpA population, regarding symptoms, spinal mobility and inflammation.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is no disease activity following treatment, or the safety and efficacy of retreatment after disease flare. The MAH will conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (full or reduced treatment regimen) versus treatment withdrawal in subjects with nr Axial SpA who have attained inactive disease while receiving open-label golimumab and to characterise the efficacy of golimumab as retreatment upon flare in subjects with nr-Axial SpA (as described in the RMP).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of golimumab is well established and is characterised by several potentially serious risks, including but not limited to infections and potential risks of malignancies, congestive heart failure and demyelinating disorders. Adequate risk minimisation as well as pharmacovigilance activities are in place from previous procedures, and are adequate to also cover the current indication.

No new safety signal has emerged in study AS001. The MAH also refer to the AS safety data base, and the safety profile appears not unexpectedly to be similar between the populations.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Further long term safety data is still missing and will be gathered in the ongoing studies in other indication which include long term outcomes as described in the RMP.

There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is no disease activity following treatment, or the safety of retreatment after disease flare. The MAH will conduct a clinical study to evaluate the safety of golimumab as re treatment for a disease-activity flare in subjects who have been able to withdraw treatment for nr-Axial SpA after attaining inactive disease (as described in the RMP).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The disease nr Axial SpA is a painful condition with a considerable negative impact on function and work productivity in the afflicted patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The diagnostic criteria are based on the presence of back pain for more than 3 months, and either MRI findings indicative of sacroiliitis or positive HLA B27 in combination with specified clinical features. In the absence of MRI-findings patients without objective measure of inflammation may thus be diagnosed. The safety profile of an anti-TNF agent can be potentially serious and it is important to avoid overtreatment. It is therefore appreciated that the proposed indication includes only patients with either positive MRI findings or elevated CRP. Although the group was small, the subgroup without positive MRI and normal CRP levels did not achieve a higher response rate of ASAS20 as compared to the placebo group.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The presented results show efficacy for Simponi in patients with axial spondyloarthritis, and an acceptable safety profile for the right patient population, i.e. those with objective signs of inflammation.

There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is no disease activity following treatment, or the safety and efficacy of retreatment after disease flare. The MAH will therefore conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (full or reduced treatment regimen) versus treatment withdrawal in subjects who have attained inactive disease while receiving open-label golimumab and the efficacy and safety of golimumab as re-treatment for a disease-activity flare in subjects who have been able to withdraw treatment for nr-Axial SpA after attaining inactive disease (as described in the RMP).

The benefit-risk balance of golimumab for the treatment of adults with severe, active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is considered positive.
