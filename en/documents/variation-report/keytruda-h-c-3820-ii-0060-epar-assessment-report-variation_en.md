## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 31 July 2018 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Keytruda in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Additionally, editorial corrections to section 5.1 of the SmPC are introduced (concerning the procedure EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0052). The RMP version 20.1 has also been submitted.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/0043/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

It acts as immune check-point inhibitor by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway that downregulates the effector function of T cells, with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity (Oncologist. 2017 Jan; 22(1): 81-88).

The pharmacological inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 is a consolidated approach in the treatment of different malignancies. In the setting of lung disease, pembrolizumab is currently authorised in the EU:

- as monotherapy for first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% tumour proportion score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  as  monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 w ith a ≥1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda.

- in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in adults whose tumours have no EGFR or ALK positive mutations

In  addition,  Keytruda  is  approved  for  melanoma,  refractory  classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma,  urothelial carcinoma and HNSCC.

## Squamous Non-small cell lung cancer

In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths) (Bray F et al. CA Cancer J Clin. 2018). NSCLC accounts for more than 80% of all lung cancer cases. Of the patients with NSCLC, tumour histology is approximately 40% to 60% adenocarcinoma, 10% to 15% squamous, 5% neuroendocrine, and the rest, 'not otherwise specified'. Squamous NSCLC is a malignant epithelial tumour that shows either keratinisation and/or  intercellular  bridges.  Over  the  last  decades,  in  Europe  squamous  NSCLC  decreased  while adenocarcinoma has increased in men, while in women both squamous NSCLC and adenocarcinoma are still increasing (Forman D et al, IARC press 2013). Squamous NSCLC is most strongly associated with smoking in a dosedependent manner, with nearly 90% of cases attributed to cigarette smoking.

Compared to non-squamous histologies, squamous disease presents at an older age and more advanced disease stage at diagnosis, and is also associated with a higher incidence of comorbidities such as COPD and heart disease. Squamous NSCLC is usually centrally located, typically arising in the proximal bronchi and as a consequence more likely to invade large blood vessels (Socinski et al, J Thor Oncol 2017).

A new edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (8 th  Edition) was published in late 2016 and will be effective for all cancer cases recorded on or after 1 st  Jan 2018. With the AJCC staging, locally advanced disease is stage III, advanced disease is stage IV (NCCN NSCLC guidelines 6.2018).

Cytology may be sufficient to distinguish adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinoma. In those cases where specific subtyping is not possible by morphology alone, a limited panel of IHC is recommended to determine  the  subtype:  TTF1  positivity  is  associated  with  probable  diagnosis  of  adenocarcinoma,  p40 positivity with probable diagnosis of squamous NSCLC (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018).

## Squamous NSCLC 1st line treatment

Molecular testing (EGFR, ALK) is not recommended in patients with squamous NSCLC due to the very low incidence of mutation, except in those rare circumstances when squamous cell cancer is identified in a never-, long-time ex- or light-smoker (&lt;15 pack/years) (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018). In addition, in case of mixed histology (adenosquamous), the presence of any adenocarcinoma component in a biopsy specimen that is otherwise squamous should trigger molecular testing (NCCN NSCLC guidelines 6.2018).

Pembrolizumab monotherapy is considered a standard first-line treatment option for NSCLC patients with ≥50% PD -L1 Tumour Proportion Score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations who do not otherwise  have  contraindications  to  the  use  of  immunotherapy,  including  squamous  histology  (ESMO Metastatic  NSCLC  Guidelines  2018).  The  pivotal  KEYNOTE-024  study  leading  to  the  approval  of pembrolizumab  in  1 st line  tested  pembrolizumab  vs  platinum-based  doublet  chemotherapy  (including pemetrexed+carboplatin, pemetrexed+cisplatin, gemcitabine+cisplatin, gemcitabine+carboplatin, or paclitaxel+carboplatin;  non-squamous  patients  could  receive  pemetrexed  maintenance)  in  NSCLC  with PDL1 TPS ≥50%. The study included 18% of squamous cell lung cancer patients (i.e . 29 vs 27 subjects in pembro vs chemo arm). In the squamous subgroup, PFS HR was 0.35 (95%CI 0.17 -0.71) (Reck M et al,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

NEJM 2016). A variation to extend the first line indication of pembrolizumab in NSCLC with TPS ≥1% is currently  under  EMA  review,  based  on  the  result  of  KEYNOTE-042  study  (EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0057 procedure).

Most individual trials and meta-analyses evaluating chemotherapy options in the first-line treatment of advanced  NSCLC  did  not  report  any  differential  efficacy  in  patients  with  squamous  NCSLC.  Therefore, platinum-based  (cisplatin/carboplatin)  doublets  with  the  addition  of  a  third-generation  cytotoxic  agent (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, taxanes) are recommended in advanced squamous cell cancer patients without major comorbidities and PS 0-2 (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018). Notably, pemetrexed is not indicated in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. No particular platinum-based doublet regimen has been proved to confer a clinically significant advantage over the others, choice often being based on safety profile. The addition of a third chemotherapy agent is not recommended. No effective maintenance strategies are available  in  squamous  NSCLC  (Daaboul  N,  Curr  Oncol  2018).  Neither  a  large  individual  trial  nor  a meta-analysis  found  an  overall  survival  benefit  of  six  versus  fewer  cycles  of  first-line  platinum-based doublets, although a longer PFS coupled with higher toxicity was reported in patients receiving six cycles (Rossi A, Lancet Oncol 2014). Therefore, four up to six cycles are currently recommended (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018).

Albumine-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is considered a chemotherapeutic option in advanced NSCLC patients, particularly in patients with greater risk of neurotoxicity, pre-existing hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or contraindications for standard paclitaxel premedication (i.e. dexamethasone, H1 and H2 blockers) (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018, Ann Oncol 2016; NCCN NSCLC guidelines 6.2018). The randomized phase III study CA031 compared carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel vs carboplatin + paclitaxel, with primary efficacy endpoint ORR based on the blinded radiological review. The null hypothesis of this study was that the Abraxane/carboplatin regimen response rate was non-inferior to that of the paclitaxel/carboplatin. A non-inferior efficacy of Abraxane/carboplatin as for Taxol/carboplatin combination therapy for the treatment of NSCLC was showed. Abraxane/carboplatin combination had lower neurotoxicity but higher haematologic toxicity  compared  to  Taxol/carboplatin  (EPAR  Abraxane  II/67;  Socinsky  et  al,  JCO  2012).  Abraxane  in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of NSCLC in adult patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy (Abraxane SmPC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In EGFR expressing squamous NSCLC who have not received prior chemotherapy, necitumumab is indicated in combination  with  gemcitabine  and  cisplatin chemotherapy  (EPAR  Portrazza).  The  addition  of necitumumab  to  cisplatin/gemcitabine  has  not  been  adopted  as  a  standard  in  Europe  for  advanced squamous NSCLC and its use should be carefully evaluated (ESMO Metastatic NSCLC Guidelines 2018). The addition of necitumumab to the regimen cisplatin/gemcitabine was felt by NCCN Panel not beneficial based on toxicity,  cost  and  limited  improvement  in  efficacy  vs  chemotherapy  alone  (NCCN  NSCLC  guidelines 6.2018).

The following indication was adopted by the CHMP:

'KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults.'

The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Pembrolizumab  is  a  protein,  which  is  expected  to  be  metabolised  in  the  body  and  biodegrade  in  the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for  Human  Use'  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  pembrolizumab  is  exempt  from  the  submission  of  an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The  applicant  did  not  submit  studies  for  the  ERA.  According  to  the  guideline,  in  the  case  of  products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is acceptable.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## Objectives

Primary objectives:

- To evaluate PFS per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR in participants treated with the pembro combo compared with the control.
- To evaluate OS in participants treated with the pembro combo compared with the control.

Secondary objectives:

- To evaluate ORR and DOR per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR in participants treated with the pembro combo compared with the control.
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of the pembro combo treatment.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Dual primary endpoint:

- PFS defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

- OS defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last known contact.

## Secondary endpoints:

- ORR defined as the proportion of participants who had a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR).
- DOR defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death.
- Toxicities as defined by CTCAE v4.0

## Exploratory Objectives

1. Evaluate the pembro combo compared with the control with respect to:
- a. PFS per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by investigator review in the next line of therapy (PFS2)
- b. PFS per irRECIST, as assessed by site investigator
- c. ORR and DOR per irRECIST, as assessed by  site investigator
- d. PFS and ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central imaging vendor and OS by PD-L1 status ( ≥1% vs &lt;1%) and by taxane (investigator 's choice of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel)
2. To investigate the relationship between the pembro combo treatment and biomarkers predicting response (eg, PD-L2, genetic variation, serum sPD-L1) utilizing newly obtained or archival FFPE tumour tissue and blood, including serum and plasma.
3.  To  evaluate  changes  in  health-related  quality-of-life  assessments  from baseline in  the  overall  study population and by PD-L1 expression level using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13.
4. To characterize utilities in participants treated with the pembro combo compared with the control using the EuroQoL(EQ)-5D.
5.  To  characterize  the  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  carboplatin,  paclitaxel  or  nab-paclitaxel,  and pembrolizumab.

6. To identify molecular (genomic, metabolic and/or proteomic) biomarkers that may be indicative of clinical response/resistance, safety, pharmacodynamic activity, and/or the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab and other treatments

## Imaging assessment

Initial tumour imaging at screening had to be performed within 28 days prior to the date of randomization. The site study team had to review screening images to confirm the subject has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. The screening images had to be submitted to the central imaging vendor for retrospective confirmation of eligibility.

The imaging assessments were performed at approximately Week 6, Week 12, and Week 18 from the date of randomization. Subsequent tumour imaging was performed approximately every 9 weeks or more frequently if clinically indicated. After 45 weeks, imaging was performed every 12 weeks.

## Sample size

With ~200 subjects, the study has ~ 84% power for detecting a 25% difference in ORR (50% vs 25%) or ~ 97% power for detecting a 30% difference in ORR (50% vs. 20%) at initially assigned 0.005 (one -sided) significance level. The stud y has ~ 94% power for detecting a 25% difference in ORR (50% vs 25%) or ~ 99% power for detecting a 30% difference in ORR (50% vs 20%) at 0.025 (one -sided) significance level.

With 415 PFS events, the study has ~ 90% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at init ially assigned 0.01 (onesided) significance level, ~ 92% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.015 (one -sided) significance level, ~ 94% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.02 (one -sided) significance level, and ~ 95% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.025 (one-sided) significance level.

With 361 deaths, the study has ~ 85% power for detecting a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 at 0.01 (one -sided) significance level, ~ 90% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.02 (one -sided) significance level, and ~ 92% power for detecting a HR of 0.7 at 0.025 (one-sided) significance level.

The planned sample size is approximately 560 subjects assuming: (1) the enrollment period is 15.5 months and the ramp-up period of enrollment is 7 months; (2) median PFS is 6 months in the control group and the true hazard ratio is 0.7; (3) median OS is 12 months in the control group and the true hazard ratio is 0.7; (4) the annual dropout rate is 3% for PFS and 1% for OS; (5) the number of events and alpha levels of interim analyses and final analysis are as specified in the protocol.

## Randomisation

Treatment allocation/randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Patients were randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups Stratification factors were:

- investigator's choice of chemotherapy regimen (paclitaxel vs nab-paclitaxel)
- PD-L1 status (TPS ≥1% vs &lt;1%)
- geographic region of the enrolling site (East Asia vs non-East Asia)

The choice of paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel treatment was determined prior to randomization.

Participants were required to provide tumour tissue for PD-L1 determination. However, enrollment was open to participants regardless of PD-L1 expression status.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

The study was double-blinded.

## Statistical methods

The primary efficacy analysis was performed on intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the PFS and OS curve in each treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS and OS was assessed by the stratified log-rank test. For PFS and OS a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling was used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference between the treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate was reported. The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model.

Sensitivity analyses were performed for comparison of PFS based on investigator's assessment.

In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by a blinded independent central imaging vendor, sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules was applied.

In case the proportional hazards assumption is not valid, supportive analyses using Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) method was planned for PFS and OS to account for the possible non-proportional hazards effect.

An exploratory analysis of PFS2, defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease progression after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever first, was planned.

Since subjects in the control arm are allowed to switch to the pembrolizumab treatment after progressive disease, adjustment for the effect of crossover on OS was planned based on recognized methods, e.g., a two-stage method or the Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) model, based on an examination of the appropriateness of the data to the assumptions required by the methods.

The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method was used for the comparison of the ORR between the two treatment groups. The difference in ORR and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size with a single treatment covariate was reported. The stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis.

If sample size permits, it was planned to summarize DOR descriptively using Kaplan-Meier medians and quartiles. Only the subset of patients who show a complete response or partial response will be included in this analysis.

There are three planned interim analyses (IA) in addition to the final analysis for this study. The trial will continue until the number of death is approximately equal to the targeted number for the final analysis, irrespective of the outcome from the interim analyses. The analyses planned, endpoints evaluated, and drivers of timing are summarized in the table below:

Table 3: Summary of Interim and Final Analyses Strategy

| Analyses Key Endpoints   | Timing   | Estimated Time after First Participant   | Primary Purpose of Analysis   |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| IA1            | ORR    | ~ 200 subjects are followed for ~ 28 weeks so that each patient has at least 4 tumour   | ~ 15 months   |  Demonstrate ORR superiority                              |
|----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| IA2            | PFS OS | ~ 332 PFS events have been observed.                                                    | ~ 20 months   |  Demonstrate PFS superiority  Demonstrate OS superiority |
| IA3            | PFS OS | ~ 415 PFS events have been observed                                                     | ~ 25 months   |  Demonstrate PFS superiority  Demonstrate OS superiority |
| Final Analysis | OS     | ~ 361 deaths have occurred.                                                             | ~ 31 months   |  Demonstrate OS superiority                               |

The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than once, and when a particular null hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to other hypothesis tests (see Figure below) shows the initial one-sided alpha allocation for each hypothesis in the ellipse representing the hypothesis. The weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses.

Type I Error Reallocation Strategy Following Closed Testing Principle

<!-- image -->

The  boundary  properties  for  each  of  these  alpha-levels  for  the  interim  analyses  were  derived  using  a Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function. If the OS null hypothesis is rejected at an interim or final analysis, each PFS interim and final analysis test may be compared to its updated bounds considering the alpha reallocation from the OS hypothesis.

The OS hypothesis may be tested at alpha=0.01 (initially allocated alpha), alpha=0.02 (if the PFS but not the ORR null hypothesis is rejected), or alpha=0.025 (if both the ORR and PFS null hypotheses are rejected).

## Results

KEYNOTE-407 study is ongoing. The analyses reported in the submitted CSR were conducted using participants' data from the pre-specified Interim Analysis 2 (IA2), and includes the evaluations of all primary and secondary objectives, as well as the following exploratory objectives:

1. PFS and ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central imaging vendor by PD-L1 status ( ≥ 1% vs &lt;1%) and OS by PD-L1 status ( ≥ 1% vs &lt;1%).
2. Changes in health-related quality-of-life assessments from baseline in the overall study population and by PD-L1 expression level using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Utilities in participants treated with the pembro combo compared with the control using the EuroQoL(EQ)-5D.

The planned duration of KEYNOTE-407 is approximately 4 years. Data cutoff date was 03-APR-2018 , at which time the overall median duration of follow-up was 7.8 months (range 0.1, 19.1).

## Participant flow

## Participant Flow in KEYNOTE-407

<!-- image -->

Of the 220 participants who were assessed for eligibility, but not randomized in the study, 2 were due to physician decision and 218 were screen failures, the most frequent reasons being unconfirmed diagnosis of stage IV squamous NSCLC (14.3%), participant unable to provide qualified tumour tissue for PD -L1 assessment (13.4%) and lack of written informed consent (13.4%).

## Primary reason for Amendment 3 (13 Nov 2017)

Description of changes: Alpha allocation scheme was updated. Added an interim analysis, extended the study duration and increased the number of PFS and OS events.

Rationale: The statistical design was updated to optimize the study for the identification of long term treatment effect in OS and PFS.

## Protocol deviations

Subjects with important protocol deviations were 46 (16.5%) and 47 (16.7%) in pembro -combo and chemo arms, respectively.

Deviations were reported across the following categories:

- Discontinuation criteria (n=2 for pembro combo; n=0 for control)
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria (n=4 for pembro combo; n=5 for control)
- Informed consent form (n=3 for pembro combo; n=5 for control)
- Prohibited Medications (n=2 for pembro combo; n=7 for control)
- Safety reporting (n=16 for pembro combo; n=17 for control)
- Study intervention (n=15 for pembro combo; n=10 for control)
- Trial procedures (n=10 for pembro combo; n=6 for control)

Of these important protocol deviations, the MAH deemed 2 to be clinically significant. One participant (in the control group) was inadvertently administered blinded pembrolizumab/placebo for KEYNOTE-355 (another study open at the site) rather than the assigned placebo for KEYNOTE-407 on Day 1 of Cycle 1. The infusion was stopped after 10 minutes (approximately one third the planned dose) when the error was identified. Another participant incorrectly received placebo instead of pembrolizumab at Cycle 6 only. Both patients are included in the ITT analysis.

## Unblinding

As of the data cutoff date, there were 2 participants who were inadvertently unblinded of their treatment assignment. Both unblinding events happened at the site level only, and had no impact on data analyses per evaluation by the Sponsor's Significant Quality Issues process. Therefore, these 2 participants were not excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses in IA2.

## Outcomes and estimation

The dual primary efficacy endpoints were OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR. The secondary endpoints included ORR and DOR per RECIST 1.1.

The median follow-up time for participants was 8.3 months (range: 0.4 to 18.9 months) in the pembro combo and 7.4 months (range: 0.1 to 19.1 months) in the control at the cut-off date 3 Apr 2018.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Assessment of tumour status was performed every 6 weeks through Week 18, every 9 weeks through Week 45 and every 12 weeks thereafter.

## Overall survival

OS events occurred at 3 Apr 2018 cutoff date were 205 (37% of the overall population, 57% of the final planned 361 OS events).

Median duration of response based on investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 was 7.3 (range 1.1+ 14.5+) vs 4.9 (1.2+ - 14.6+) months in pembro combo vs control, respectively.

## Patients Reported Outcomes

Three  PRO  questionnaires  (EORTC  QLQ-C30,  EORTC  QLQ-LC13,  and  EQ-5D-3L)  were  used.  All  PRO endpoints were analysed up to Week 18.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compliance rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline until Week 18 were in a range from 79.0% through 95.0% in both treatment groups. The compliance rate for EORTC QLQ -LC13 and EQ-5D-3L were consistent with  that  for  EORTC  QLQ-C30.  Completion  rates  decreased  at  each  time  point  as  more  participants discontinued the study treatment.

## Ancillary analyses

## Subgroup analyses

<!-- image -->

For overall population and the PD-L1 subgroup, analysis is based on Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate stratified by PD-L1 status (≥1% vs. &lt;1%), taxane chemotherapy (paclitaxel vs. nab-paclitaxel) and geographic region (East Asia vs. Non-East Asia).For other subgroups, analysis is based on unstratified Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate.

Subjects with PD-L1 not evaluable are not included in the analysis for PD-L1 subgroup.

If a subgroup variable has two levels and one level of the subgroup variable has fewer than 10% of the ITT population, then this subgroup is not displayed in the plot.

For overall population and the PD-L1 subgroup, analysis is based on Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate stratified by PD-L1 status (≥1% vs. &lt;1%), taxane chemotherapy (paclitaxel vs. nab-paclitaxel) and geographic region (East Asia vs. Non-East Asia).For other subgroups, analysis is based on unstratified Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate.

Subjects with PD-L1 not evaluable are not included in the analysis for PD-L1 subgroup.

If a subgroup variable has two levels and one level of the subgroup variable has fewer than 10% of the ITT population, then this subgroup is not displayed in the plot.

## Post-study treatments

At the time of data cutoff, 208 (74.3%) subjects discontinued study treatment in the control arm. Of them, 75 eligible subjects with PD verified by BICR crossed over to pembrolizumab monotherapy within the study. An additional 14 subjects received a checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or nivolumab) as subsequent therapy outs ide of the study. Therefore, a total of 42.8% (89/208) of subjects in the control group who discontinued study treatment crossed over to a checkpoint inhibitor. In the chemotherapy group, only 110 subjects (53%, 110/208) received any subsequent anti -neoplastic therapy and the majority of these  (89/110  subjects,  81%)  received  a  subsequent  checkpoint  inhibitor.  Among  98  subjects  in  the chemotherapy group who did not receive second-line therapy, 62 died within 3 months after their last dose of study treatment.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific concomitant medication. A subject with multiple concomitant medications within a medication category is counted a single time for that category.

A medication class or specific medication appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

1 participant crossed over to pembrolizumab monotherapy within the study before receiving atezolizumab outside of the study; thus, a total of 14 participants were included in the crossover calculations.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The pivotal study supporting the sought indication is the ongoing KEYNOTE-407, a phase III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with active treatment of carboplatin-paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab in first line metastatic (stage IV M1a or M1b-AJCC 7 th edition) squamous NSCLC. No Scientific Advice to CHMP was requested on this study.

Overall, patients' selection criteria are considered reflective of the target population in the indication.

Pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  or  saline  placebo  were  administered  in  association  with  carboplatin  + paclitaxel  or  nab-paclitaxel  for  a  total  of  4  cycles,  followed  by  pembrolizumab/saline  placebo  until progression for maximum 2 years (i.e. 35 cycles) of treatment. Currently, the 200 mg Q3W dose is being evaluated  in  multiple  clinical  studies,  is  the  approved  monotherapy  dose  in  patients  with  previously untreated  NSCLC  based  on  KEYNOTE-024,  and  is  the  dose  used  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in patients with non-squamous NSCLC in KEYNOTE-189.

Participants  who  had  PD  verified  by  BICR  could  be  unblinded  and  crossover  to  or  continue  to  receive pembrolizumab monotherapy. Re-treatment with open-label pembrolizumab at progression was allowed in case the drug had been previously stopped for CR or after 35 administrations for reasons other than PD or intolerability. Carboplatin with either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel is one of the accepted standard treatment option for 1 st  line squamous cell lung cancer. Cisplatin, although indicated and used in squamous disease, was not included in this study. Therefore, no data are available for pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in squamous histology, contrary to non-squamous NSCLC (KEYNOTE-189 study) where both cisplatin and carboplatin (with pemetrexed) have been investigated and approved in association with Keytruda. On the other hand, nab-paclitaxel is approved in combination with carboplatin only.

International guidelines recommend the use of 4 to 6 cycles of treatment (Planchard et al, 2018). The number of cycles of chemotherapy used in this study was four. Investigators choice of number of cycles (up to six) could have been appropriate. Indeed, even acknowledging that no OS benefit has been demonstrated for six versus fewer cycles of first-line platinum-based doublets, a longer PFS was reported in patients receiving six cycles (Rossi A, Lancet Oncol 2014).

OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR as dual primary efficacy endpoints for this study are considered appropriate. ORR and DOR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR were evaluated as secondary endpoints. Among the exploratory endpoints included in this submission, the MAH presented OS, PFS, and ORR by PD-L1 status as well as Quality of Life evaluation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sample size calculation was driven by number of required PFS and OS events. However, the overall 1-sided 2.5% type 1 error was split between the two primary endpoints and the ORR. The pre -allocated alpha was 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 for ORR, PFS and OS, respectively. The graphical method of Maurer and Bretz was applied to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be tested  more  than  once,  and  when  a  particular  null  hypothesis  is  rejected,  the  alpha  allocated  to  that hypothesis can be reallocated to other hypothesis tests. Therefore, the power of the study depends on the allocated alpha and several scenarios were proposed. The sample size calculations result congruent with the assumptions made.

Stratification factors used at randomization (PDL1 status &lt;1% vs ≥1%, investigator's choice of paclitaxel vs nab-paclitaxel, East-Asia vs non-East Asia) are considered appropriate.

The statistical methods used for time to events and binary endpoints are considered adequate. The graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses and O'Brien-Fleming approach to allocate Type I error rate across interim analyses are appropriate as well.

Two global protocol amendments (02 and 03) are reported up to the cut-off date. The content of Amendment 03 is the same as Amendment 02; the latter was retracted due to clerical and typographical errors. From the statistical point of view, an additional IA for PFS and OS was added and the alpha allocation scheme was updated. In the original protocol version, the type I error was controlled at 0.025 (one sided) for the hypothesis testing of ORR, PFS and OS and the pre-allocated alpha was 0.005, 0.015 and 0.005 for ORR, PFS and OS, respectively. ORR was tested first and the alpha was subject to rollover to PFS (i.e., PFS will be tested at 0.020 if ORR is positive or at 0.015 otherwise). The alpha for PFS was subject to rollover to OS (i.e., the overall OS alpha was 0.005 if PFS was negative, or 0.020 or 0.025 if PFS was positive and ORR was negative or positive, respectively). However, the same Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming approximation spending function defined in the original protocol was used for the calculation of efficacy bounds for PFS (IA2 and IA3) and for OS (IA2, IA3 and final) that are more conservative due the introduction of a new IA and a new allocation scheme. Amendment 03 was approved and released prior to IA1 results being available to the independent DMC which is reassuring on the timing of the protocol amendment.

Important protoco l deviations occurred in a similar rate in both arms (16.5% vs 16.7%), and are not expected to have significantly impacted the trial results.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

A total of 559 patients were recruited worldwide across 168 sites in 17 countries. Subjects were allocated 1:1 to pembro combo arm (n=278) or control (n=281). Eligibility was assessed in 779 patients, for a total of 220 participants not randomized in the study. Of them, 2 were due to physician decision and 218 were screen failures (among which 217 failed to meet eligibility requirements based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria). The most frequent reasons for exclusion were unconfirmed diagnosis of stage IV squamous NSCLC (31 subjects, 14.3%), participant unable to provide qualifie d tumour tissue for PD-L1 assessment (29 subjects, 13.4%) and lack of written informed consent (29 subjects, 13.4%).

All randomized patients received the allocated treatment, except one subject in the control arm who was not treated. At the cut-off date, more subjects in the pembrolizumab combination arm were still receiving treatment compared to the control (43.5% vs 25.7%). Most common reason for discontinuation was progressive disease in both arms, more frequent in the control arm (30.9% vs 50%). The ra te of discontinuation due to adverse events was on the contrary higher in the group receiving combination therapy compared to chemotherapy alone, as expected (17.3% vs 8.9 %), which is approximately comparable to the discontinuation rate due to AEs seen in the combination arm of study KN189 (19.3% vs 10.4%) supporting the approval of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC patients. There was an imbalance in the number of patients who discontinued any drug due to a drug-related adverse event

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(pembro combo: 50 / 278 (18.0%), control: 20 / 280 (7.1%)). Treatment discontinuation due to withdrawal by subjects + physician decision + lost to follow-up was more common in the control arm (3.6% vs 6%).

A total of 75 (27%) patients in the control arm crossed over to pembrolizumab at progression, which appeared quite low taking into account the current authorized indication after chemotherapy. However, an additional 14 subjects received a checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or nivolumab) as subsequent therapy outside of the study. Therefore, 42.8% of subjects in the control group who discontinued study treatment crossed over to a checkpoint inhibitor (i.e. 75 within the trial and 14 outside the trial). This is similar to crossover rates in other first line NSCLC trials (e.g. 54% in KEYNOTE -24, 50% in KEYNOTE189, 42.1% in IMpower -131). Specific reasons for not receiving a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor were not coll ected. In the chemotherapy group, only 110 subjects (53% of the 208 subjects in this group who discontinued from study treatment) received any subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy and the majority of these (89/110 subjects, 81%) received a subsequent checkpo int inhibitor.

In the pembrolizumab combination arm, the most common subsequent anti-neoplastic therapies were gemcitabine (8.6%) and docetaxel (6.5%). In the chemotherapy arm, the most common subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy excluding checkpoint inhibi tors was gemcitabine (5.7%).

Baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects appeared overall balanced between the two arms. Median age was 65 years, ECOG was 0 (29%) or 1 (71%). As expected for squamous histology, the majority of subjects were male (81.4%) and former or current smokers (92% overall). According to international guidelines, patients with squamous NSCLC who are never or former light smokers should be considered for molecular testing (Planchard et al, 2018). It is acknowledged that the 2015 Guideline (College of American Pathologists (CAP)/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/Association for Molecular Pathology Guideline (AMP)) that was in place at the time of trial start did not recommend molecular testing for squamous histology (regardless of smoking status). Also a small number of patients with adenosquamous carcinomas have been included in KN407 study (13 patients, 2.3%). These patients are also recommended to undergo molecular analysis. Although EGFR and ALK analyses were recommended in 2015 Guidelines in the presence of an adenocarcinoma component in the tumour specimen, no data on molecular testing was available for those 13 subjects.

According to PDL1 status, approximately 63% of patients in both arms were PD -L1 positive (i.e. TPS≥1%, which was a stratification factor) and 35% PD -L1 negative, only 2% were PD -L1 unknown. Patients remained well balanced in both arms also in each PDL1 expression subgroup TPS&lt;1% (35%), 1 -49% (37%) and ≥50% (26%).

Paclitaxel and nabpaclitaxel were used overall by 60% and 40% of the subjects in each arm, respectively. Overall, subjects with prior radiation were 13.1%, with no meaningful imbalances between the two arms: prior thoracic radiation was reported only in 7%.

This application is based on the results of the IA2 with a data cut-off date 3 April 2018, at which time the overall median duration of follow-up time was 7.8 months (range 0.1, 19.1). A statistically significant improvement in both PFS and OS was shown for pembrolizumab combination vs chemotherapy alone at the IA2. With a total of 349 PFS events (62% of the overall population), a reduction in disease progression by 44% (HR=0.56; 95%CI 0.45, 0.70; p&lt;0.0001) was shown for pembrolizumab combination vs control arm, for a med ian PFS of 6.4 vs 4.8 months. OS HR was 0.64 (95%CI 0.49, 0.85; p=0.0008) in favour of pembrolizumab combination, with a gain of about 4.6 months in median survival over chemotherapy alone (15.9 vs 11.3 months). However, maturity level of OS (i.e. number of OS events at IA2/number of OS events planned at final analysis) is 5 7%, (corresponding to 37% of the ov erall population experiencing an OS event) at this analysis and due to the high rate of censoring curves are hardly interpretable after month 3. A subsequent database lock for the prespecified IA3 was not available or planned in the near future, as along with statistically significant results for ORR at the IA1, all alpha-controlled analyses as specified in the protocol were completed at IA2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, a consistent treatment benefit could be observed across all endpoints at the time of the interim analysis. However more mature OS data are needed. The MAH will submit the final CSR for KEYNOTE-407 as an Annex II condition by September 2021 in order to confirm the survival advantage of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in 1L squamous NSCLC with longer follow-up.

To assess the impact of cross-over on OS, proper statistical methods have been applied (e.g. analysis censoring at time of cross-over, Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW), Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time models (RPSFT), and two-stage methods) taking into account the assumptions required by the methods. The results were consistent with the primary OS analysis.

Results from PFS sensitivity analysis 1 and 2, as well as PFS based on investigator assessment, were consistent with the primary analysis.

The advantage of pembro combo over chemotherapy alone is also observed in terms of response rate (confirmed ORR base d on BICR per RECIST 1.1: 57.9% vs 38.4%), although there was a similar number of complete responses in the two arms (1.4% vs 2.1%). Median DOR was also longer for pembro combo (7.7 vs 4.8 months).

With regards to subgroup analyses, it appears that the advantage of pembro combo is maintained in most of the subgroups analysed. For all subgroups except the PD-L1 subgroups, OS, PFS and ORR results were presented based on unstratified analyses. Results of the stratified subgroup analyses were overall comparable with unstratified data.

Clinically meaningful improvement in outcomes from treatment with the combination in previously untreated patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC was observed in patients from both East Asia and non-East-Asia regions. However, the treatment effect was more pronounced in the East Asia population and no satisfying explanation could be given by the MAH. No meaningful differences in OS could be detected for never smokers vs smokers and patients with or without liver metastasis compared to the control group. Nevertheless, only limited data are available.

In the KEYNOTE-189 combination study in non-squamous NSCLC, a clear relation between efficacy and increasing PD-L1 tumour expression was noted in all endpoints. In KEYNOTE-407, a trend for a better PFS HR of pembro combo vs chemo the higher the PD-L1 score has been observed. Differently, this trend is not evident in OS or ORR. OS HR appeared similar across all three subgroups. By looking at the KM curves, in the PD-L1 negative population (TPS&lt;1%), curves of the two treatment arms appeared overlapping up to about month 6 before dividing in favour of pembro combo. Updated analyses will be provided with the final CSR (see Annex II).

The available efficacy results of pembro combo in the different subgroups (TPS&lt;1%, 1 -49%, ≥50%) have been included in the SmPC. Unfortunately we can observe a crossing of the OS KM-curves at 3 month in patients with TPS&lt;1%. The baseline characteristics for subjects with TPS&lt;1% and early death within the first 3 months from randomization in both treatment arms were submitted, however due to the small number of patients, no relevant conclusion could be drawn from this data.

KEYNOTE-407 study started before the approval of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in first line metastatic NSCLC  (including  squamous  histology)  with  TPS≥50%.  At  the  time  of  approval  of  pembrolizumab  in combination  with  pemetrexed  and  platinum  chemotherapy  in  non-squamous  NSCLC,  a  wording  was introduced  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC    for    stating  that in  patients  whose  tumours  have  high  PD-L1 expression, the risk of adverse reactions with combination therapy relative to pembrolizumab monotherapy should be considered and the benefit/risk ratio of the combined therapy evaluated on an individual basis of the combination regimen , along with a warning in section 4.4 underlining the lack of direct comparison between pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and pembrolizumab alone . Both statements are considered  applicable  to  the  sought  indication  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in squamous disease. Furthermore, as pembrolizumab monotherapy could be regarded as SOC in first line for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the PD-L1 high subpopulation, the MAH was requested to present a comparison of efficacy between the combination  therapy  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  the  squamous  histology  and  provide  a  B/R discussion for subjects with TPS ≥50% considering the higher toxicity of the combination therapy. Since no trials provide a direct comparison between chemotherapy + pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in 1L NSCLC with PDL1 expression TPS ≥50%, it is unclear whether patients with high PD -L1 expression would benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. In the absence of a clinical trial that would allow  direct,  definitive  analysis  comparing  efficacy  for  pembrolizumab  combined  with  chemotherapy  to pembrolizumab monotherapy, the observed differences in efficacy should be interpreted with caution.

An advantage of the combination with pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy alone was shown regardless the drug used (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel). It was however noted that the number of both OS and PFS events was higher in paclitaxel-based treatment compared to nab-paclitaxel-based subgroup.

A trend toward reduced PFS and OS performance of pembro combo vs chemotherapy according with increase in age was noted. The MAH was asked to provide a summary of efficacy endpoints by age (&lt;65, 65-74, 75-84) for KN407 and for KN407 with the pooled data of KN189 and KN21G. Efficacy data for NSCLC patients ≥75 years receiving combination therapy in KEYNOTE -407 (squamous) and KEYNOTE-189 (non-squamous) are reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to better guide physicians in the choice of treatment in elderly population. Furthermore, a warning that efficacy and safety data from patients ≥ 75 years are limited, and that pembrolizumab combination therapy should be used with caution after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis, was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC based on the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy data in 1 st  line non-squamous NSCLC (KEYNOTE-189). Such wording is considered applicable also to the applied indication.

The analysis of PRO/HRQoL was included among exploratory endpoints, with no pre-specified hypotheses. Health-related QoL appeared to be maintained for the pembro combo arm.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The results of the Interim Analysis 2 of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-407 showed a consistent treatment benefit  in  all  efficacy  endpoints  for  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin/paclitaxel  or nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

In addition to the individual analysis of study KEYNOTE-407, data on clinical safety were derived from the following datasets:

- -KEYNOTE-407 Combo + KEYNOTE-021-A Combo Safety Dataset (N = 303): Pooled data from 278 participants with previously untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC who received pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (or nab-paclitaxel) in KEYNOTE-407 (data from IA2), and 25 participants with NSCLC of any histology type in Cohort A of KEYNOTE-021 and were treated with pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel.
- -KEYNOTE-407 Chemo Dataset (N = 280): Data from participants with metastatic squamous NSCLC who

received carboplatin/paclitaxel (or nab-paclitaxel) in KEYNOTE-407 (data from IA2).

- -KEYNOTE-189  Combo  +  KEYNOTE-021-G/C  Combo  Safety  Dataset  (N  =  488):  Pooled  data  from participants with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who participated in KEYNOTE-189 or KEYNOTE-021 (Cohorts G and C) who received a combination of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin.
- -KEYNOTE-189  Chemo  +  KEYNOTE-021-G  Chemo  Safety  Dataset  (N  =  264):  Pooled  data  from participants with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who participated in KEYNOTE-189 or KEYNOTE-021 (Cohort G) and were treated with pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin.
- -Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  RSD  (N  =  3830):  Participants  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3 (NSCLC, melanoma), KEYNOTE-002 (original phase, melanoma), KEYNOTE-006 (melanoma), KEYNOTE-010 (NSCLC), KEYNOTE-013 Cohort 3 (Hodgkin's lymphoma), KEYNOTE-024 (NSCLC), KEYNOTE-045 and KEYNOTE-052 (urothelial cancer), and  KEYNOTE-087  (classical  Hodgkin's  lymphoma).  This  dataset  represents  the  established  safety profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy based on the currently approved indications in the European Union.

Safety analysis used a tiered approach as illustrated below:

Every subject is couwted a single time for each applicable row and colhmmm.

A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columms meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after roumding.

For subjects who crossed over to pembrolizumab from the Control Group, adverse events that occiured after the first dose of crossover phase are excluded.

Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included.

MedDRA 20.1 preferred terms \"Neoplasm progression\",\"Maliguant neoplasm progression\" and \"Disease progression\" not related to the dnug are excluded.

Grades are based on NCI CTCAE version 4.03.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable specific adverse event. A subject with multiple adverse events within a system organ class is counted a single time for that system organ class.

A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

Only the highest reported grade of a given adverse event is counted for the individual subject.

Grades are based on NCI CTCAE version 4.03.

Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included.

## Post marketing experience

The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the period 04-SEP-2017 through 03-MAR-2018.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety data in support of this application were derived from the individual analysis of the pivotal Phase III study KN-407 (n=278 in pembro combo and 280 in control), in addition to a pooled dataset of patients with  squamous  NSCLC  who  received  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  (nab)/paclitaxel-carboplatin (including patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (or nab-paclitaxel) from Study KN-407 (n=278) and in patients from Study KN-021-A (n=25, including 9 with NSCLC of squamous histology). Data were compared to prior databases comprising non-squamous NSCLC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  as  add-on  therapy  to  platinum/pemetrexed-based  doublets (KN-189+KN-021-G/C pooled; n=488) and a reference database (RSD; n=3830) including all pembrolizumab monotherapy indications currently approved in the EU.

The KN-407 showed a median exposure of 8 cycles in the experimental arm vs 6 cycles in the control group. Length of treatment with pembrolizumab was independent of the combination regimen (8 administrations in median  in  both  the  paclitaxel  and  nab-paclitaxel  subgroup).  Exposure  to  carboplatin/paclitaxel  (or nab-paclitaxel) was similar between treatment arms.

Compared with the other safety datasets, KN-407+KN-021-A pooled combo showed a shorter exposure to pembrolizumab than KN-189 +KN-021-G/C pooled combo (8 vs 11 administrations in median; exposure to chemotherapy is not directly comparable considering the different therapeutic schemes used in the two clinical settings). This is likely explained by the shorter follow-up of KN-407 at data cut-off (7.8 months) compared to the 10.5 month follow-up in KN-189 at the time of dossier submission.

In study KN407, the frequency of overall AEs was generally similar between treatment arms (98.2% vs 97.2% in  pembro  combo  vs  control,  respectively),  with  the  exception  of drugrelated  AEs  (95.3%  vs 88.9%), serious drug -related AEs (25.2% vs 18.2%) and discontinuation of any drug due to either AEs (23.4% vs 11.8%) or drug -related AEs (18% vs 7.1%) that occurred more frequently on combined therapy than chemotherapy alone. Mor eover, more patients died in the combo arm than chemo group (8.3% vs 6.4%), including those for whom fatalities were subsequent to drug -related AEs (3.6% vs 2.1%). This is in line with what has been previously reported in the non-squamous histology (KN-189+KN-021-G/C pooled group).  As  expected,  the  combined  regimen  compares  unfavourably  with  the  RSD  for  pembrolizumab monotherapy across all different AE categories.

Most  common  AEs  (incidence ≥ 30%)  were  those  characteristic  for  chemotherapy  (anaemia,  alopeci a, neutropenia,  nausea,  and  thrombocytopenia  in  the  Pembro  combo  group).  Some  of  these  incidences typically attributable to chemotherapy were reported with higher incidences in the Pembro combo group than in the control group (such as thrombocytopenia 30.6 % vs. 23.2%, neutropenia 37.8% vs. 32.9%, and alopecia 46% vs. 36.4%).

Exposure-adjusted analysis by observation period revealed that the majority of AEs in KN-407 occurred during the first 3 months of therapy in both arms, with a progressive and similar decline in incidence rate up to 6-12-month follow-up between groups; this is expected given that exposure to chemotherapy, either alone or in combination, was limited to the first 4 cycles of therapy. A higher frequency of AEs beyond 12 months was observed in the pembrolizumab arm likely due to the maintenance therapy not administered in the control group.

In terms of SOC categories, the two treatments displayed a similar AEs pattern with blood and lymphatic system disorders as the prevailing events, followed by gastrointestinal, skin disorders and neurotoxicity. However, their occurrence was higher in the pembro than control group, the majority of events being registered during the first 6 months of treatment. This temporal pattern suggests that events were mainly associated with cytotoxic agents with an additive effect of pembrolizumab co-treatment.  On the contrary, endocrine disorders were commonly reported in the combo group with a peak between 3-6 months but were rare in the control arm at all time points. Infections and infestations as well as respiratory and mediastinal disorders were generally similar between pembro combo and control up to 6-12 months; beyond 12 months, their incidence was higher in the experimental group (7.1% vs 2.4% and 4.3% vs 2.4% for infections and respiratory disorders, respectively) indicating a likely association with pembrolizumab maintenance therapy.

In  KN-407,  the  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  was  increased  in  the  combined  therapy  compared  to chemotherapy only (95.3% vs 88.9%). Blood and lymphatic system disorders were the most frequent events (68.7% vs 58.2%) with pembrolizumab increasing  the  rate  of  Grade  1,  Grade  2  and  Grade  4 toxicities. Among the most prominent differences, a higher incidence of drug-related AEs were reported in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the experimental arm within the SOCs endocrine disorders (11. 9% vs. 1.8%), nervous system disorders (51.1 % vs 41.1%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders ( 54.3 % vs 43.9%), gastrointestinal disorders (55.4 vs. 45.4%), general disorders ( 44.6 % vs. 39.3%), infections and infestations ( 12.2 % vs. 6.8%), musculoskeletal disorders (27.0 % vs 22.9%), renal and urinary disorders ( 4.7 % vs. 1.4%), and respiratory disorders (15.8 vs. 11.4%). The fact that subjects with drug-related AEs were more numerous in the pembro combo supports the concept that pembrolizumab has an additive effect on chemotherapy toxicity, as also previously observed in KN-189.

As expected, the comparison of the pooled KN-407+KN-021-A combo database with the clinical datasets of pembrolizumab used as monotherapy or in combination with platinum-pemetrexed in non-squamous NSCLC revealed an increased frequency of alopecia, myelosuppression and neuropathy that is consistent with the known  toxicity  profile  of  the  carboplatin-paclitaxel  association  and  that,  as  previously  mentioned,  is worsened by pembrolizumab co-treatment. Moreover, serious infusion-related reactions occurred with a common frequency in the pooled KN-407+KN-021-A group compared with no event reported in the pooled KN-187+KN-021-A database. A safety analysis in the AsAT as stratified by either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel use, revealed that IRR only occurred in patients who received paclitaxel, either with (2.4%) or without (1.8%) pembrolizumab co -administration, and that the majority of these events were causally related to the taxane. The remaining drug-related events as distinguished by the different PTs were overall in line with the prior experience of pembrolizumab including thyroid dysfunction, renal and liver function abnormalities.

While overall Grade 3-5 AEs occurred with a similar frequency between treatment arms, febrile neutropenia, hyponatraemia, diarrhoea, pneumonitis, colitis, autoimmune hepatitis and infusion-related reactions were more frequent in the combined therapy than control. Causality with treatment was reported in the majority of these events. All of these events were reported with increased frequency in the KN-407+KN-021-A pooled combo compared to the RSD but at a similar rate than KN-189+KN-021-G/C pooled combo, with the exception of colitis, autoimmune hepatitis and infusion-related reactions that occurred more often than previously observed in the combined therapy (0.6%, 0.2% and 0%, respectively). Colitis was reported for 4 (2.4%) subjects in the pembro/paclitaxel combination group and 2 subjects (1.8%) in the pembro/nab-paclitaxel  combination  group;  five  subjects  (1.8 %)  experienced  autoimmune  hepatitis  in KN-407, all in the pembro/nab-paclitaxel combination group. Of note, the incidence of these events in KN-407 was similar to the RSD. The SmPC currently list them among the AEOSI and correctly reports the need for patient monitoring with suggested dose modifications should they occur.

Febrile neutropenia, pneumonitis and colitis were also among the most frequent SAEs reported with a higher incidence in the pembro combo than control; also, infusion-related reactions were observed with a common frequency in the combined but not the control therapy (1.4 % vs 0.4%).

In KN407, more fatalities due to AEs were reported in the pembro combo than control group (8.3% vs 6.4%). With respect to the comparator, pembro combo increased the incidence of fatal respiratory failure (1.1% vs 0%), cardiac arrest (0.7% vs 0.4%) and sepsis (1.1% vs 0.4%). The pooled KN -407+KN-021-A dataset  comparison  with  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  was  unfavourabl e  (7.6%  vs  4.1%),  although  a similar rate of deaths was reported in the pembrolizumab combination with platinumpemetrexed (6.1%) which is consistent with the expected increased rate of toxicities in combined regimens.

In  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab,  AEOSIs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the experimental arm than control. Their incidence in the KN-407 pooled combo was overall comparable with the RSD, except for colitis (3%  vs 1.9%), hepatitis (1.7%  vs 0.6%), hyperthyroidism (6.6%  vs 3. 5%)hypophysitis (1% vs 0.5%) and pneumonitis (6.3% vs 3.7%). To better evaluate the clinical relevance of these differences, incidence rates in a pooled data set comprising all pembro combination studies (KN189, KN407, KN021) compared to an updated RSD were requested and confirmed these trends although with an attenuation of differences between the combined therapy in the NSCLC setting and monotherapy in the overall  pembrolizumab  indications  as  regards  colitis  (2.9%  vs  1.9%),  hepatitis  (1.3%  vs  0.9%),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hyper thyroidism (5.2% vs 4.2%), hypophysitis (0.8% vs 0.6%) and pneumonitis (5.2% vs 4.2%). The SmPC has been amended accordingly with the new updated RSD rates for all AEOSIs.

The MAH provided analyses of pneumonitis in NSCLC indicating a small, but numerically higher rate of pneumonitis  compared  with  the  currently  reported  ones  for  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  across  all approved indications. The updated rates of pneumonitis in NSCLC have been reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

As regards the other AEOSIs as listed above, their frequency is overall within the same range as previously observed in  KN-189,  showing  that  cytotoxic  agents  increase  the  toxicity  associated  to  pembrolizumab therapy.  Indeed,  a  worse  safety  profile  of  the  combined  regimen  compared  to  monotherapy  can  be recognised and this needs to be considered by physicians in treatment-decision making (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). No differences in deaths due to AEOSIs were reported across datasets.

In terms of laboratory abnormalities, differences between pembro combo and control were observed in leukocyte and platelet count decrease, and liver function tests with a more unfavourable profile in the experimental arm (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

Safety analysis by age category revealed a higher rate of drug discontinuation due to AEs in the pembro combo than control across  all  groups.  Of  note,  cardiovascular  events  occurred  more  frequently  in  the youngest patients, which is quite unexpected. However, the group of patients ≥7 5-year-old was constituted of 33 and 30 patients in the experimental and control arm, respectively. Moreover, only three patients were aged ≥ 85 years. Therefore, data in the very elderly population remain very limited, as already stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC. When analysing the population by the cut-off value of 65 years, a clear tendency towards worse tolerability to the combined therapy in ≥ 65 year -old than younger patients ( ≤ 65-year old) can  be  recognised.  Age-dependency  of  safety  emerges  across  all  datasets,  including  combo  and monotherapy  studies.  The  same  trend  can  be  observed,  as  expected,  within  the  chemotherapy  group although  the  association  of  pembrolizumab  to  the  cytotoxic  agents  clearly  enhances  the  rate  of  AEs compared to both chemotherapy only and pembrolizumab monotherapy. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the treatment decision making for elderly patients (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

To overcome the limitations of the small numbers and to better characterize the safety profile in the elderly patients, the MAH was asked to provide analysis by age (&lt; 65 vs. ≥ 65 years and using additional age categories (65 to 74 years old, 75 to 84 years old, and ≥ 85 years old)) in the pooled data set for pembro /chemotherapy combination therapy in 1L NSCLC. It emerged that 17% of deaths were due to an AE, 34.2% of discontinuations were AE-related, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were reported with a frequency of 31.6% and 9.2%, respectively, in patients ≥75 -year-old. These rates are of concern, since they are notably higher compared to the same age group of the chemotherapy arms.

Further analyses of pooled dataset showed that the proportion of patients with AEs in each AE category was mostly higher for the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy arms compared with the chemo arms and among subjects ≥65 years compared with &lt;65 years. However the differences between both age categories were generally similar in both treatment groups apart from SAEs and discontinuations that were more pronounced in the elderly patients of the pembrolizumab combination arm. The analysis of AE categories of particular interest in the elderly population did not reveal categories with a notably larger difference in the elderly compared to the &lt;65 years age category. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Overall similar incidences for the age category of 75-84 years are seen between both treatment arms; however rates of serious drug-related SAEs, discontinuations due to an AE and death due to an AE were higher in the pembrolizumab combination arm compared to chemotherapy arm. Nevertheless pooled NSCLC combination therapy data in the age group beyond 75 years are still considered too small to draw reliable conclusions or to provide more detailed information in the SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Unexpectedly and unlike the control therapy, the combined regimen seemed to be associated with an apparent lower tolerability in men than female, specifically with regard to dose modifications due to AEs, discontinuations due to AEs. The rate of drug modifications and discontinuations were also influenced by ECOG score, as expected. Overall, from the additional analyses submitted by the MAH, no significant clinical findings emerged in terms of sex-related tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination to chemotherapy.

It was also investigated whether the use of nab-paclitaxel vs paclitaxel differed between region groups and, if it is the case, to what extent this could explain the region-dependent difference observed between EU and ex-EU. No major differences were observed in terms of baseline characteristics between treatment arms in both EU and ex-EU. The choice of the taxane was similar between regions. A few disparities could be recognised in the incidence of certain AE categories between regions (i.e. discontinuation of pembrolizumab due to adverse drug reactions in the group of carbo/paclitaxel; discontinuation of any drug due to adverse drug reactions in the group of carbo/nab-paclitaxel). However it is agreed that specific subgroups of patients were numerically very limited to plausibly be indicative of region-dependent differences in tolerability of the combined therapy.

Finally, common AEs leading to pembrolizumab discontinuation in the combined therapy group included au toimmune hepatitis and pneumonitis (both with an incidence of 1.7%), colitis, respiratory failure and sepsis (1%) as well as cardiovascular events (including cardiac arrest 0.7%, cardiac failure 0.3%, cerebrovascular accident 0.3%). All of these events wer e deemed drug-related and occurred with a higher incidence than previously reported in KN-189+KN-021-G/C pooled combo and RSD , with the exception of pneumonitis . Neutropenia (1.7%), infusion -related reactions and sepsis (1%) and cardiovascular events (car diac arrest 0.7%, cardiac failure 0.3%, cerebrovascular accident 0.3%) were also among the main reasons for AE-related chemotherapy discontinuation in the experimental arm, their rate being higher than the other safety datasets.

As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to ameliorate potential side effects, the potential for a pharmacokinetic DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was assessed as part of the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No relationship was observed between prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. Systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressants, can be used during pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-related adverse reactions. Similarly, the potential of DDI between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy agents is expected to be low. No impact of co-administered chemotherapy on pembrolizumab PK was observed in KN-021-G.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Pembrolizumab  in  combination  to  (nab)/paclitaxel-carboplatin  therapy  for  squamous  NSCLC  compared unfavourable with chemotherapy  alone. The increased toxicity of pembrolizumab  as  add-on  to chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in the intended population is consistent with the prior experience and already  authorised  indication  of  pembrolizumab  co-treatment  with  cytotoxic  agents  in  non-squamous NSCLC patients. Moreover, a worse safety profile of the combined regimen emerged in comparison with pembrolizumab  monotherapy  that  should  be  considered  for  treatment  decision  making,  particularly  in elderly patients for whom data remain limited. The proposed SmPC reflects the available data and warnings. No changes to the RMP have been considered necessary as part of this procedure.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

The MAH also took the opportunity to introduce two minor editorial corrections to section 5.1 of the SmPC regarding the procedure EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0052, in relation to KEYNOTE-052 (urothelial carcinoma indication) which obtained a Commission Decision on the 6th of July 2018.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

The only change in the leaflet is the addition of one paragraph regarding the combination products in section 1 'What KEYTRUDA is and what it is used for'. There are no other proposed changes to the content of the package leaflet. In particular the key messages for the safe use of the medicinal product are not impacted. Furthermore the design, layout and format of the package leaflet is not affected by the proposed revisions.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for KEYTRUDA in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults, based on the interim results of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-407.

Squamous NSCLC is a malignant epithelial tumour comprising approximately 3040% of the NSCLC that shows either keratinisation and/or intercellular bridges, which is strongly associated with cigarette smoking.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

In advanced squamous NSCLC disease, molecular testing (EGFR, ALK) is not usually recommended due to the very low incidence of mutation, unless subject is a never or former light smokers (&lt;15 pack/years). In case of mixed adenosquamous tumours, the adenocarcinoma component should trigger molecular analysis. Four to six cycles of platinum-based doublets chemotherapy with the addition of a third-generation cytotoxic agent (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, taxanes) are recommended in first line advanced squamous cell cancer patients without major comorbidities and PS 0-2 according to the ESMO guideline (Planchard et al, 2018). Albumine-bound  paclitaxel  (nab-paclitaxel)  is  an  option  particularly  in  patients  with  greater  risk  of neurotoxicity,  pre-existing  hypersensitivity  to  paclitaxel  or  contraindications  for  standard  paclitaxel

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

premedication (i.e. dexamethasone, H1 and H2 blockers). Nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen response rate was shown to be non-inferior to that of the paclitaxel/carboplatin (Socinski et al, 2012).

Pembrolizumab as monotherapy is currently indicated in first-line NSCLC with PDL1 TPS≥50% expression, including squamous histology.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The application is based upon results of KEYNOTE-407 trial, an international, randomized, double-blind, phase III study, placebo-controlled with active treatment of carboplatin-paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab in first line metastatic squamous NSCLC subjects.

A total of 559 patients with previously untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC were randomized. This study is ongoing and data presented are coming from the IA2 with data cut-off date 3 April 2018. OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by BICR were dual primary endpoints. The secondary endpoints included ORR and DOR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

- Statistically significant advantage of pembrolizumab combination over chemotherapy alone in the ITT population in OS (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.49, 0.85, p&lt;0.0008) a s well as in PFS per BICR by RECIST 1.1 (HR 0.56, 95%CI 0.45, 0.70, p&lt;0.0001).
- Higher  confirmed  ORR  by  RECIST  1.1  according  to  BICR  in  the  pembro  combo  arm  compared  to chemotherapy (57.9% vs 38.4%, p&lt;0.0001) with longer median DOR (7.7 vs 4.8 months).
- Overall consistent results across subgroups, including PD-L1 subgroups.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

- Immaturity of OS data ( OS events occurred account for 57% of that planned for the final analysis ) and limited follow-up time (median 7.8 months). Due to the short follow-up, there is a need to confirm the efficacy of the combination also on later events. The MAH will submit the final study report for study KN-407 in order to confirm the benefit of the combination vs chemotherapy with longer FU (annex II condition).
- Lack of comparison with pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC patients with TPS ≥50% is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.
- Due to the limited sample size, the magnitude of the benefit of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy patients aged ≥ 75 years is difficult to characterise (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

- In  study  KN-407,  the  safety  of  pembrolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  compared unfavourably against chemotherapy alone. Drug-related AEs, serious drug-related AEs, discontinuations due to either AEs or drug-related AEs and deaths, including those for whom fatalities were subsequent to  drugrelated  AEs  (3.6%  vs  2.1%),  were  more  frequently  reported  on  combined  therapy  than chemotherapy alone.
- While overall Grade 35 AEs occurred with a similar frequency between treatment arms (69.8% vs 68.2%) febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs 3.9%), hyponatremia (3.6% vs 1.8%), diarrhoea (4% vs 2.1%), pneumonitis  (2.5%  vs  0.4%),  colitis  (2.2%  vs  0.7%),  autoimmune  hepatitis  (1.8%  vs  0%)  and infusionrelated reactions (1.1% vs 0.4%) were more frequent in the combined therapy than control.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs 3.6%), pneumonitis (2.5% vs 0.7%) and colitis (2.2% vs 0.4%) were also among the most frequent SAEs reported with a higher incidence in the pembro combo than control.

- With respect to the comparator, pembro combo slightly increased the incidence of fatal respiratory failure (1.1% vs 0%), cardiac arrest (0.7% vs 0.4%) and sepsis (1.1% vs 0.4%).
- The indirect comparison with the reference safety database also showed a worse toxicity profile than pembrolizumab in monotherapy.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

- The combination therapy appears less tolerable in elderly ( ≥ 75 years); however final conclusions are limited by the small patient numbers (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

KEYNOTE-407  study  interim  results  have  shown  a  relevant  clinical  advantage  of  the  addition  of pembrolizumab to carboplatin+paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel compared to chemotherapy alone in all efficacy endpoints OS, PFS ORR and DOR.

Compared with chemotherapy alone, the combined therapy was associated with a worse tolerability profile, particularly in terms of increased rate of certain drug-related events, including fatalities, although the incidence of grade 3-5 ADRs was similar across treatment groups. As expected, an additive effect of pembrolizumab has been observed on myelosuppression, neurotoxicity and alopecia which are known toxicities associated with carboplatin-paclitaxel combination; additionally, a higher frequency of infections (including sepsis), infusion-related reactions and gastrointestinal disorders were observed in pembro combo compared to control. The increased toxicity of pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in the intended population is consistent with the prior experience and already authorised indication of pembrolizumab co-treatment with cytotoxic agents in non-squamous NSCLC patients, although some specific ADRs were noted to occur with increased frequency in KN-407 than KN-187 in relation to the different therapeutic association. AEOSIs, with particular reference to thyroid dysfunctions, hepatitis and pneumonitis were common events in the experimental, but not in the control arm. The indirect comparison with pembrolizumab monotherapy showed that the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy combination carries an increased toxicity across all AE categories. Therefore, careful consideration is recommended in treatment-decision making, particularly in the elderly patients considering that age-dependent tolerability has been observed as reflected in the SmPC.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Although OS data are not yet fully mature, there is a statistically significant survival advantage and increased PFS of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone (4.6 months and 1.6 month difference respectively). This is considered to outweigh the worse tolerability profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy.

Results from KEYNOTE-407 study are considered sufficient to establish a positive B/R in the sought indication for the first line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in combination with carboplatin/(nab)paclitaxel. The MAH is expected to submit the final CSR of study KN-407 to further characterise the OS benefit from the combination treatment.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Keytruda in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults is positive.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

- in order to confirm the advantage of the combination compared to chemotherapy alone, including primary and secondary outcomes by ITT and subgroups, the MAH should submit the final CSR of KEYNOTE-407 study post-approval (Annex II) (projected by September 2021).

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC in adults for Keytruda; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Additionally, editorial corrections to section 5.1 of the SmPC are introduced (concerning the procedure EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0052). The RMP version 23 has also been submitted.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following new condition:

## Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Due date   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): The MAH should submit the final study report for study P407: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Study of Carboplatin - Paclitaxel/Nab-Paclitaxel Chemotherapy with or without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in First Line Metastatic Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects - Final Study Report | 3Q 2021    |

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope
