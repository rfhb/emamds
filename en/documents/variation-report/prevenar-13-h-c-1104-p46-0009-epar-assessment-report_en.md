## 2. Clinical studies

6096A1-3021 A phase 3, open-label study to evaluate persistence of the antibody response elicited by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy children who have been previously immunized with a 4dose  series  of  a  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  during  infancy  in  study  6096a1-008-eu  and  the safety  and  immunogenicity  of  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  administered  at  least  24 months after the last toddler dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

-  Description
-  Methods
-  Objective(s)

The primary objectives of the study were:

-  To evaluate the antibody levels to the 13 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes not earlier than 24 months  after  the  administration  of  the  toddler  dose  in  study  6096A1-008,  as  measured  by serotype-specific (immunoglobulin G) IgG concentrations.
-  To evaluate the immune response to 13 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes 1 month after a dose of  the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) administered not earlier than 24 months  after  the  toddler  dose  in  study  6096A1-008,  as  measured  by  serotype-specific  IgG concentrations.

The secondary objectives of the study were:

-  To evaluate the antibody levels to the 13 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes not earlier than 24 months  after  the  administration  of  the  toddler  dose  in  study  6096A1-008,  as  measured  by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To evaluate the immune response to 13 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes 1 month after a dose of  13vPnC administered not earlier than 24 months after the toddler dose in study 6096A1008, as measured by serotype-specific OPA antibody titers.

The safety objective of the study was:

-  To  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  1  dose  of  13vPnC  administered  to  children  previously vaccinated at least 24 months earlier with the toddler dose in study 6096A1-008, as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic reactions, and adverse events (AEs).

An exploratory objective of the study was:

-  To evaluate the immune response to 13 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes in children previously vaccinated in study 6096A1-008, 4 to 7 days after a dose of 13vPnC administered not earlier than 24 months after the toddler dose, as measured by serotype-specific IgG concentrations.
-  Study design

Study 6096A1-3021 was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label study in France, including eligible healthy children who had received a 4-dose vaccination series of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as part of study 6096A1-008. In study 6096A1-008, vaccine groups were 13vPnC infant series/13vPnC toddler dose (13vPnC/13vPnC); 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) infant series/7vPnC toddler dose (7vPnC/7vPnC); or 7vPnC infant series/13vPnC toddler dose (7vPnC/13vPnC). In this study, all subjects were to receive a fifth dose of 13vPnC at visit 2.

Blood samples were to be taken at visit 1 (prevaccination; &gt;730 days after the toddler dose in study 6096A1-008 and &gt;3 years of age), within 7 days prior to receiving the study vaccine (13vPnC; visit 2) and 1 month after (visit 4; 28 to 42 days after visit 2). In a subset of subjects whose parents/legal guardians consented to it, an additional blood sample was to be collected 4 to 7 days after vaccination with 1 dose of 13vPnC (visit 3).

-  Study population /Sample size

Approximately  500  subjects  were  to  be  enrolled  in  the  study.  The  sample  size  was  not  determined based  on  a  power  calculation,  but  on  the  number  of  subjects  who  could  be  enrolled  from  study 6096A1-008. A total of 262 eligible subjects from study 6096A1-008 consented to participate, were enrolled, and given a single dose

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects were enrolled in the study if they satisfied all of the following inclusion criteria: received all 4 assigned doses of the PnC vaccine as randomized and completed study 6096A1-008; were at least 24 months posttoddler dose and at least 3 years of age at visit 1; were healthy; and were available for the entire study period.

Subjects  were  excluded  from  participation  in  the  study  if  they  met  any  of  the  following  criteria: vaccination  with  any  licensed  or  investigational  pneumococcal  vaccine  since  completion  of  study 6096A1-008; history of culture-proven invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae since the completion  of  study  6096A1-008,  previous  anaphylactic  reaction  to  any  vaccine  or  vaccine-related component;  contraindication  to  vaccination  with  a  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (PnC);  bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time; known or suspected immune deficiency or  suppression  since  participation  in  study  6096A1-008;  major  known  congenital  malformation  or serious  chronic  disorder;  significant  neurological  disorder  or  history  of  seizure;  receipt  of  any  blood products, including immunoglobulin, within 90 days before the study; current participation in another investigational or interventional study; received any live vaccine within 28 days before administration of the first study vaccine.

##  Treatments

In this study, all subjects were to receive 1 dose of 13vPnC at visit 2.

-  Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity Assessment Methods:

Blood  samples  for  immunogenicity  assessments  were  to  be  obtained  up  to  7  days  before  visit  2 (vaccination visit) and at visit 4 (28 to 42 days after the vaccination at visit 2). In a subset of subjects whose parents/legal guardians consented to it, an additional optional 5-mL blood sample was to be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

collected 4 to 7 days after vaccination with 1 dose of 13vPnC  (visit 3). Serotype-specific immunogenicity to the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) was to be assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and OPA assays.

## Safety Assessment Methods:

Safety parameters included physical examination, reactogenicity (solicited local reactions and systemic events  including  fever  and  the  use  of  antipyretic  medication);  and  unsolicited  AEs  and  SAEs.  Local reactions  (redness  [erythema],  swelling  [induration],  and  pain)  at  the  site  of  the  13vPnC  vaccine injection were monitored daily for 7 days (day 1 to day 7) after vaccination. Systemic events (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue) were monitored daily and recorded in the e-diary for 7 days after each vaccination  (day  1  to  day  7).  In  addition,  the  use  of  antipyretic  medications  to  prevent  or  treat symptoms was collected daily in the e-diary during the active safety observation periods (day 1 to day 7) after the vaccination. A subject's AEs and SAEs were recorded from the signing of the ICF to visit 4 (1 month after the vaccination).

##  Statistical Methods

## Analysis Populations:

Immunogenicity analyses were performed for 2 populations, the evaluable immunogenicity population (primary  immunogenicity  population)  and  the  all-available  immunogenicity  population.  The  primary immunogenicity population was the evaluable immunogenicity population, defined

As:

1. Eligible subjects who were randomized.
2. Had blood drawn within required time frames (within 7 days prior to 13vPnC vaccination, 3 to 9 days after the vaccination, 27 to 56 days after the vaccination).
3. Had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result for the proposed analysis.
4. Received no prohibited vaccines.
5. Had  no  major  protocol  violations  as  determined  by  the  global  trial  leader  or  global  medical monitor.

Protocol violations were identified before any immunogenicity analysis was carried out.

The all-available immunogenicity population consisted of subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result for the proposed analysis.

## Immunogenicity:

The primary endpoint was the serotype-specific IgG concentration 1 month after  the single dose of 13vPnC.

The secondary endpoints included: the serotype-specific IgG concentration prior to the 13vPnC dose, 4 to 7 days after the 13vPnC dose; OPA titers collected on all available samples of study 6096A1-008, prior to the 13vPnC dose, 1 month after the 13vPnC dose; the proportion of subjects with OPA titer ≥ the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for each of the 13 serotypes 1 month after the 13vPnC dose. This analysis was changed; instead of the proportion of subjects with an OPA titer  ≥1:8 one month after  the 13vPnC dose (for serotype 7F, the proportion of subjects with an OPA titer ≥1:2048), the proportion of subjects with an OPA titer ≥LLOQ 1 month after the 13vPnC dose was presented in this CSR .

The pneumococcal IgG serotype concentrations were logarithmically transformed for analysis. Within each  group  and  for  each  antibody  concentration  separately,  geometric  means  of  the  antibody concentrations from each of the blood draws were calculated. Two (2)-sided, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)  were  constructed  by  back  transformation  of  the  CIs  for  the  mean  of  the  logarithmically transformed  assay  results  computed  using  the  Student  t  distribution.  To  assess  the  within-subject post-13vPnC and pre-13vPnC differences in concentration, the fold rise in geometric  mean concentration (GMC) from pre-13vPnC to post-13vPnC and 95% 2-sided CI were estimated for each group using the logarithmically transformed assay results.

The antibody concentrations over time were described for each serotype and each group by GMCs and corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs: pre-13vPnC dose, 4 to 7 days post-13vPnC dose, and 1 month post13vPnC  dose.  All  pairwise  comparisons  among  the  3  groups  were  made  at  each  time  point  using geometric mean ratios and 95% CIs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Serotype-specific fold rise in antibody concentration from the pre-13vPnC dose to the 4 to 7 days post13vPnC dose were derived for each subject and summarized using geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) along with 2-sided 95% CI. The fold rise from the pre-13vPnC dose to 1 month after the 13vPnC dose was  summarized  similarly.  All  pairwise  comparisons  of  GMFR  among  the  3  groups  were  made  by computing the ratios of the GMFR of the 2 corresponding groups, along with 2-sided 95% CIs. The empirical reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) of pneumococcal IgG concentrations prior to the 13vPnC dose and 1 month after the 13vPnC dose from all 3 groups were presented graphically for each serotype.

For  each  of  the  13  serotypes  and  for  each  group,  OPA  geometric  mean  titers  (GMTs)  and corresponding  95%  CIs  were  calculated  for  the  post-toddler  dose,  prior  to  the  13vPnC  dose  and  1 month after the 13vPnC dose. All pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups were made at each time point using geometric mean ratios and 95% CIs.

Fold  rises  in  OPA  assay  results  from  the  pre-13vPnC  dose  to  1  month  after  13vPnC  dose  were summarized and all pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups were made in the same manner as with IgG concentrations.

In addition, the proportion of subjects with an OPA titer ≥LLOQ 1 month after the 13vPnC dose, along with exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% CIs, were to be provided for each of the 13 serotypes and each group. All pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups were made by providing differences in proportion along with exact, 2-sided 95% CIs.

Serum OPA for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were determined for all subjects in the immunogenicity subset for each blood sample. Results were reported as antibody titers.

Assessor's  comment:  There  were  two  primary  objectives,  IgG  responses  before  and  after  the  fifth vaccination given not less than 24 months after the toddler dose. However, there is only one primary endpoint,  serotype  specific  IgG  1  month  after  the  fifth  dose.    As  all  data  are  presented,  this  is considered of minor importance.

The change of OPA analysis is explained as follows (summarised): 'The OPA assay method to be used was not specified in the protocol. In study 6096A1-008, the dribble OPA (dOPA) was used. To increase the relatively low throughput of the dOPAs, the assays were simplified and automated The modified OPA assays are referred to as mcOPAs. Precision of the mcOPA assays was also improved by instituting replicate testing of each clinical serum sample. In the current study, all sera were assayed using the mcOPA assay (available sera from study 6096A1-008 were reassayed using the mcOPA assay).

The lowest titer that can be determined in OPA assays is a titer of 1:8 (limit of detection, LOD) and is the same for each serotype-specific OPA assay. However, to quantify functional antibodies in the OPA assays with appropriate precision and accuracy, the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was determined for each serotype-specific OPA assay during assay validation. The LLOQ for each serotype-specific OPA assay was used as a cutoff to determine serum response for the immunogenicity subjects. Previously, an OPA serum response was determined using an OPA titer cutoff of 1:8 for all serotype-specific dOPA assays in exploratory analyses for 13vPnC assessments in support of an infant/young child indication.

However,  the  additional,  more  stringent  qualification  and  validation  of  the  improved  mcOPA  assays used in this study did not support 1:8 for the quantitation of a serum response and thus the following established  cutoffs  (LLOQs)  were  used  for  the  mcOPA  assay:  serotype  1,  1:18;  serotype  3,  1:12; serotype  4,  1:21;  serotype  5,  1:29;  serotype  6A,  1:37;  serotype  6B,  1:43;  serotype  7F,  1:210; serotype 9V, 1:345; serotype l4, 1:35; serotype 18C, 1:31; serotype 19A, 1:18; serotype 19F, 1:48; and serotype 23F, 1:13.

Therefore, based on the new LLOQs determined for the mcOPAs, instead of the proportion of subjects with an OPA titer ≥1:8 one month after the 13vPnC dose (for serotype 7F, the proportion of subjects with an OPA titer ≥1:2048), the proportion of subjects with an OPA titer ≥LLOQ 1 month after the 13vPnC dose is presented.'

The change of OPA methodology has been assessed previously, and is considered acceptable, and thus the chosen analysis is endorsed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety:

The safety variables collected for this study were local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the site of  the  13vPnC  injection),  systemic  events  (fever,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  fatigue,  and  use  of  antipyretic medications), and AEs. Fever was defined as a temperature of ≥38.0°C (100.4°F). The proportion of subjects with local reactions and systemic events reported on any day within the 7-day period after the vaccination was summarized for each vaccine group. Use of antipyretic medication was reported with systemic events, but these were analyzed separately.

AEs  were  categorized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  and summarized  by  vaccine  group  for  each  vaccination  separately.  All  summaries  showed,  by  vaccine group, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 event and the number of events. Pairwise  differences  in  incidence  rates  of  local  reactions,  systemic  events,  and  AEs  among  the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC, 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC, and 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC groups were reported.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

According to the protocol, approximately 500  subjects were  to participate in this study at approximately 39 sites. This was based on the previous study (6096A1-008) data. Enrollment at each site  was  to  be  based  upon  the  ability  of  the  site  personnel  to  recruit  eligible  subjects  who  had completed study 6096A1-008. All investigators who participated in study 6096A1-008 had been offered participation in this study and those who agreed were to recruit subjects. Some investigators declined participation, thereby decreasing the number of participating sites and potential subjects. Participating investigators were to offer participation to study 6096A1-3021 to all subjects enrolled at their site in study  6096A1-008  and  who  fulfilled  the  eligibility  criteria  for  the  current  study,  6096A1-3021.  A subject eligibility list was prepared by programming and provided to the participating investigators in the previous study.

A total of 262 eligible subjects from study 6096A1-008 consented to participate, were enrolled, and given a single dose of 13vPnC. The distribution of subjects across the 3 treatment groups followed the randomization ratio of 2:1:1 from study 6096A1-008. The disposition of subjects is presented in Table 8-1.

Of the 262 enrolled subjects, 260 subjects completed the study. Two (2) subjects (1 subject in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group and 1 subject in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group) were withdrawn from the study as they were lost to follow-up.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of  the  262  enrolled  subjects  who  received  13vPnC,  257  subjects  (98.1%)  were  included  in  the  allavailable immunogenicity population, 235 subjects (89.7%) were included in the evaluable immunogenicity population, and 84 subjects (32.1%) were included in the visit 3 optional blood sample evaluable immunogenicity population.

Four  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  all-available  immunogenicity  population  because  they  were misdosed in Study 6096A1-008.  One  additional subject was  excluded from the all-available immunogenicity  population  because  no  original  informed  consent  form  was  available  at  the  site. Twenty-seven subjects were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population. Most frequently subjects were excluded from this analysis set based on blood being drawn more than 56 days after vaccination at visit 4 or no valid or determinate assay result at visit 4. All subjects excluded from the all-available  immunogenicity  population  were  also  excluded  from  the  evaluable  immunogenicity population.

Pneumococcal IgG GMCs before vaccination ('predose' in the tables; up to 7 days prior to visit 2, ie after the 4-dose infant and toddler vaccination series but prior to the fifth vaccine dose at &gt;3 years of age) are presented for the evaluable immunogenicity population in Table 9-3.

b. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were calculated using all subjects with available data for the specified blood draw.

a. n =Number of subjects with a determinateIgG antibody concentration to thegiven serotype.

C. Confidence intervals (CIs) are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the concentrations.

e. CIs for the ratio are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the logarithms of the measures (13v/13v/13v - 7v/7v/13v) or (13v/13v/13v - 7v/13v/13v) or (7v/7v/13v - 7v/13v/13v)).

d. Ratio of GMCs.

Before vaccination, GMCs for the 7 common serotypes were generally comparable for the 3 groups. In all 3 groups, the lowest GMCs were determined for serotype 4 and the highest GMCs were determined for serotype 6B. For the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison, all GMC ratios were &gt;1.0 for the 7 common serotypes. GMC ratios with 95% CIs excluding 1 were only seen for serotype 18C. For this serotype the GMC in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group was significantly higher than in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC or 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC groups.

For the 6 additional serotypes, most GMCs before vaccination were lower in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group compared to the other 2 vaccine groups. In all 3 groups, the lowest GMCs were determined for serotype 1, and the highest GMCs were determined for serotype 19A. The GMC ratios were &gt;1 for all 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparisons, with 95% CIs excluding 1 for serotypes 1, 6A, 7F, 19A. Statistically significantly higher GMCs  were also shown in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group  compared  to  the  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  for  serotype  6A  and  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group compared to the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group for serotypes 1 and 7F. GMCs for serotypes 3 and 5 were essentially comparable across all 3 study groups.

The  GMCs  and  GMC  ratios  before  vaccination  for  the  all-available  immunogenicity  population  were overall comparable to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

For the 7 common serotypes, the GMCs in each group had decreased from the values after the toddler dose (presented in CSR for study 008) to before the 13vPnC dose. Generally, for the 6 additional serotypes, the GMCs had decreased from the values after the toddler dose  in  the  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  and  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  groups  (exception:  serotype  5  and serotype 6A in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group), ie the groups that had received 13vPnC as toddler dose, but had slightly increased in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group (exception: serotype 19A).

Pneumococcal  IgG  GMCs  and  95%  CIs  at  the  postinfant,  pretoddler,  and  posttoddler  visits  (study 6096A1-008), and at the visit before vaccination in study 6096A1-008 are presented graphically by serotype for the evaluable immunogenicity population, examples in Figures 16.1, 16.2 and 16.3. Note that postinfant assays were only performed in infants who received 13vPnC during the infant series; 7vPnC sera were not assayed for pneumococcal responses.

## Pneumococcal IgG Concentration Response - Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves

Examples of RCDCs are shown by antibody concentration and serotype in Supportive Figures 16.27 and 16.29. For all 3 groups at all concentration levels, the percentage of subjects achieving any given level  of  response  was  generally  higher  at  1  month  after  vaccination  than  before  vaccination.  Both before vaccination and 1 month after the 13vPnC dose, the RCDCs were comparable for the 7 common serotypes and higher for the 6 additional serotypes for the vaccine groups who received 13vPnC at the toddler dose (exception: serotype 3).

## Pneumococcal OPA Geometric Mean Titers

Pneumococcal  OPA  GMTs  before  vaccination  (up  to  7  days  prior  to  visit  2)  are  presented  for  the evaluable immunogenicity population in Table 9-4.

Before  vaccination,  OPA  GMTs  for  the  7  common  serotypes  were  generally  comparable  for  the  3 groups. In all 3 groups, the highest OPA GMTs were determined for serotype 6B. OPA GMT ratios with 95% CIs excluding 1 (upper limit of the CI &lt;1) were seen for serotype 4 in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC and to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparisons and  additionally  for  serotype  18C  in  the  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  to  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  pairwise comparison.

For the 6 additional serotypes, OPA  GMTs  before vaccination were generally lower in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group  compared  to  the  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  and  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC groups, and comparable or higher in the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group compared to the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group, with the exception of serotype 6A. In all 3 groups, the lowest GMTs were determined for serotype 5, with OPA GMTs to serotype 5 of 4 in each study group. The OPA GMT ratios were &gt;1 for all 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparisons (except for serotype 5), reaching statistical significance for serotypes 6A and 19A. OPA GMT ratios were &lt;1 for all  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparisons. GMT ratios with the upper limit  of  the  95%  CI  &lt;1  were  shown  for  group  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  compared  to  group 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC for serotypes 1 and 7F, and for group 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC compared to group 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group for serotypes 1, 6A, 7F and 19A.

a. n = Number of subjects with a determinate OPA antibody titer to the given serotype.

Abbreviation:NE=Not estimable.

b. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were calculated using all subjects with available data for the specified blood draw.

e. CIsfor theratio areback transfonmations ofa confidence interval based ontheStudent tdistributionforthemeandifference of the logarithms ofthe measures ((13v/13v/13v - 7v/7v/13v) or (13v/13v/13v - 7v/13v/13v) or (7v/7v/13v - 7v/13v/13v).

C. Confidence intervals (CIs)are back transfonmations of a confidence interval based onthe Student t distribution forthe mean logarithm of the titers. d. Ratio of GMTs.

The OPA GMTs and GMT ratios before vaccination (up to 7 days prior to visit 2) for the all-available immunogenicity population were overall comparable to those observed for the evaluable immunogenicity population.

For the 7 common serotypes, the OPA GMTs in each group had decreased from the values after the toddler dose (presented in CSR for study 008) to before the 13vPnC dose in study 6096A1-3021 (up to 7 days prior to visit 2). For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMTs had generally decreased from the values after the toddler dose in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC and 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC groups, ie the groups that had received 13vPnC as toddler dose, but had slightly increased in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group  (exception  serotypes  5  and  6A).  Refer  to  Supportive  Table  15.14  for additional details on posttoddler OPA GMT analyses.

## Antibody Response To Vaccination

## Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations

Four (4) to 7 days after vaccination

The pneumococcal IgG GMCs at 4 to 7 days after vaccination ('postdose' in tables) are presented for the evaluable immunogenicity population in Table 9-5.

At day 4 to 7 after 13vPnC administration, GMCs for the 7 common serotypes were all increased as compared to the GMCs before vaccination and were generally comparable in the 3 vaccine groups.

For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMCs were generally comparable in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC and  the  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  groups,  but  lower  in  the  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  with  the exception of GMCs for serotype 3 which remained essentially comparable across all 3 study groups.

All of the 95% CIs on the GMC ratios for the

13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison included 1. However, 95% CIs for the ratios in all of the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC and 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC to  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  pairwise  comparisons  excluded  1,  indicating  that  GMC  mean  values  were consistently lower in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC than in the other vaccine groups (exception: serotype 3 for the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison, and serotypes 3 and 6A for the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison) .

## One (1) month after vaccination

One  of  the  primary  objectives  was  to  evaluate  the  immune  response  to  13  pneumococcal  vaccine serotypes 1 month after a dose of 13vPnC administered not earlier than 24 months after the toddler dose in study 6096A1-008, as measured by serotype-specific IgG concentrations. The pneumococcal IgG  GMCs  approximately  1  month  after  vaccination  (visit  4)  are  presented  for  the  evaluable immunogenicity population in Table 9-6.

For  the  7  common  serotypes,  GMCs  measured at visit  4  (27  through  56  days  after  13vPnC)  in  the evaluable immunogenicity population were generally comparable for the 3 groups. In all 3 groups, the lowest GMCs were determined for serotype 18C, and the highest GMCs were determined for serotype 6B.  Overall,  the  GMC  ratios  ranged  from  0.62  (serotype  6B  in  the  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  pairwise  comparison)  to  1.44  (serotype  6B  in  the  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison), with the upper limit of the 95% CI for the ratio &lt;1 only for serotypes 6B and  18C for the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  pairwise comparison, and with the lower CI limit &gt;1 for serotypes 4 and 6B for the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison.

For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMCs  were higher in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC and 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC groups than in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group, with the exception of GMCs for serotype 3 which remained comparable across all 3 study groups.

The GMC ratios were &gt;1.0 for all serotypes for the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC pairwise  comparison  and  &lt;1.0  for  all  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  to  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  pairwise comparisons, indicating that GMC mean values were consistently higher for the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC and 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC groups than for the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group. The 95% CIs for the ratios excluded 1 for serotypes 1 and 5 (all 3 pairwise comparisons); for serotype 6A (13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison only); and for serotypes 7F and 19A (13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison and 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC to  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  pairwise  comparison).  The  95%  CIs  for  GMC  ratios

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

also excluded 1 (upper limits &lt;1) for the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC to 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison for serotypes 1 and 5.

In all groups and all serotypes, GMCs further increased from 4 to 7 days after vaccination to 1 month after vaccination.

a. n = Number of subjects with a determinate IgG antibody concentration to the given serotype.

b. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were calculated using all subjects with available data for the specified blood draw.

C. Confidence intervals (CIs) are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Stuident t distribution for the mean logarithm of the concentrations.

d. Ratio of GMCs.

e. CIs for the ratio are back transfommations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the logarithms of the measures ((13v/13v/13v - 7v/7v/13v) or (13v/13v/13v - 7v/13v/13v) or (7v/7v/13v - 7v/13v/13v)).

## Pneumococcal OPA Geometric Mean Titers

A comparison of pneumococcal OPA GMTs measured approximately 1 month after vaccination (visit 4) is shown in Table 9-11.

For the 7 common serotypes, OPA GMTs measured at visit 4 (27 through 56 days after 13vPnC) in the evaluable immunogenicity population were generally comparable for the 3 groups. In all 3 groups, the lowest  OPA  GMTs  were  determined  for  serotype  19F.  The  highest  OPA  GMTs  were  determined  for serotype 18 in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group and for serotype 6B in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC, and 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC groups. The GMT ratios ranged from 0.7

to  1.3,  with  the  95%  CI  for  the  ratio  excluding  1  only  for  serotype  6B  (13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  to 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC pairwise comparison).

OPA GMTs for serotype 3 were clearly higher in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC and 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC groups as compared to the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group, which contrasts with the comparable IgG response to serotype 3 that was described in all 3 study groups.

At  1  month  after  vaccination,  OPA  GMTs  in  all  vaccine  groups  were  generally  higher  than  before vaccination and for the majority of serotypes also higher than at the posttoddler visit.

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving Pneumococcal OPA Antibody Titers ≥ LLOQ

For the 7 common serotypes, the proportions of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥LLOQ at 1 month after vaccination were comparable for all 3 groups. The percentage of responders to all 7 common serotypes was 100% in all 3 study groups except for serotype 19F (98.3% in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group and 98.2% in the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group).

For  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  OPA  titers  ≥LLOQ  at  1  month after vaccination were comparable for all 3 groups. The percentage of responders to serotypes 1, 6A, 7F, and 19A was 100% in all 3 study groups, the percentage of responders to serotype 3 ranged from 98.2%  (7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group)  to  100%  in  the  2  other  groups,  and  the  percentage  of responders  to  serotype  5  ranged  from  96.4%  (7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group)  to  100%  in  the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group.

Assessor's comment: The results of this study provide new data on antibody persistence and responses to  a  fifth  dose  of  Prevenar  13.  IgG  GMCs  were  presented,  but  not  proportion  of  subjects  obtaining antibody  levels  ≥0.35  µg/mL.  From  the  RCDCs  it  is  evident  that  for  all  serotypes  except  serotype

3 100% of the subjects achieved this threshold after the fifth booster dose, in all three groups.

The antibody persistence data showed that the GMC point estimates for the 7 common serotypes were higher  for  in  the  7v/7v/13v  group  compared  to  the  two  other  groups,  especially  the  13v/13v/13v group.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  difference  is  unknown.  There  was  good  evidence  of  a  memory response to the fifth dose in all groups for all serotypes, with responses that exceeded those to the toddler dose, except serotype 3 (see fig 16.2).

-  Safety results

## Local Reactions:

Local reactions (pain, swelling, and redness) at the site of the pneumococcal conjugate injection were monitored  daily  for  a  total  of  7  days  after  the  vaccination.  The  frequencies  of  local  reactions  were comparable for the 3 groups, with 70.1% of subjects in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group, 66.7% of subjects  in  the  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  and  72.2%  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group reporting at least 1 local reaction during the 7 days after vaccination.

The local reaction most frequently reported after 13vPnC administration was pain at the injection site, reported  for  55.4%  of  subjects  in  the  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group,  55.8%  of  subjects  in  the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group, and 64.2% of subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group. Most local reactions  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Severe  pain  at  the  injection  site  (ie,  prevented  daily activities)  was  reported  for  1)  subject  in  each  group,  (1.1%,    2.3%  and  2.2%).  There  were  no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidences of mild, moderate, and severe occurrences of pain, swelling, and redness.

## Systemic Events:

The percentage of subjects reporting 1 or more systemic event was 50.5% in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group,  58.9%  in  the  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  and  42.9%  in  the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group.

Fever was defined as a temperature of greater than or equal to 38.0°C. Most subjects with fever had a temperature of ≤39.0°C, only 1 subject (2.2% of subjects) in the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group had fever &gt;40.0°C.

The systemic event reported most frequently was fatigue. It was reported for 40.8% of subjects in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group, 51.9% of subjects in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group, and 31.3% of subjects  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group.  The  severity  of  fatigue  was  mild  or  moderate  for  the majority of subjects. Severe fatigue was reported for 3.3% of subjects in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group, 2.3% in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group, and 2.2% of subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group.

The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  any  systemic  events,  fever,  vomiting,  and  diarrhea  were generally  comparable  for  the  3  groups.  Fatigue  occurred  with  a  statistically  significantly  higher incidence in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group (51.9% of subjects) compared with the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group  (31.3%  of  subjects).  A  statistically  significantly  higher  number  of subjects used antipyretic medication in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group (44.2%) compared to subjects in  the  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group  (19.8%)  and  subjects  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(21.3%).  Although  a  higher  number  of  subjects  reported  fever  ≤40°C  in  the  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group compared with the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group and the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group, this difference was not statistically significant.

## Adverse Events:

At  least  1  AE  was  reported  for  13.1%  of  subjects  in  the  13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC  group,  9.4%  of subjects  in  the  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  and  7.8%  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group.

The AEs reported were consistent with childhood illnesses considered common in this age group.

The system organ class 'infections and infestations' was reported most frequently in all 3 groups: for 12.3% of subjects in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group, 7.8% of subjects in the 7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC group, and 6.3% of subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group AEs in this category were reported. The only AE (preferred term) reported by more than 2% of subjects in any group was nasopharyngitis which was reported by 2.3% of subjects in the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group. The incidence of AEs was not statistically significantly different between the groups overall or for any individual AE.

## Serious adverse events

No death occurred during the course of the study. No subjects reported SAEs during the course of the study. No subjects were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events

Assessor's comment. No new safety signal was detected in study 3021. The adverse reactions were similar to what has been reported for Prevenar 13 in other studies.

## MAH's Overall Conclusions of the Study:

At least 2 years after a toddler dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, antibody persistence for the 7 common serotypes was generally comparable regardless of the vaccination regimen received during the infant series and toddler dose. Antibody levels for the 6 additional serotypes were comparable or higher in the 7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group compared to the 13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC group, with the exception  of  serotype  6A,  and  higher  than  in  the  7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC  subjects  that  had  not previously received 13vPnC.

One  dose  of  13vPnC  was  immunogenic  when  given  in  children  at  approximately  3.4  years  of  age regardless  of  previous  PnC  vaccination  regimen.  The  immunogenicity  response  to  the  7  common serotypes  was  similar  in  all  three  groups.  The  antibody  response  to  the  6  additional  serotypes  was higher  in  subjects  who  had  previously  received  at  least  1  dose  of  13vPnC.  Additionally,  the  rapid increase  in  pneumococcal  immunogenicity  response  observed  at  4  to  7  days  after  vaccination  is indicative of a memory response induced by previous 13vPnC vaccination.

In this study, a fifth dose of PnC vaccine administered in children of approximately 3 years of age who had previously received a 4-dose series of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as infants and toddlers, showed an acceptable safety profile.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In general the MAH's conclusions are endorsed. The submitted study is of interest as it demonstrates the extent of persistence and memory up to 24 months after the toddler dose, which has not been shown previously. The MAH has stated that a type II variation will be submitted to update section 4.2 of the SPC, though the exact content of the change has not been stated. The data demonstrate that 24 months after the toddler dose, the antibody levels have declined to levels similar to before the toddler dose.  The  immune  responses  following  an  additional  dose  24  months  after  the  toddler  dose  clearly demonstrate the presence of immunological memory, regardless of whether Prevenar or Prevenar 13 was used for priming. The results of the study have been described according to the protocol, and in that sense this submission is considered fulfilled. The information obtained from this study is clearly relevant to the prescribers, and the proposal to submit a type II variation in endorsed. Further details regarding this study, e.g. proportion of subjects achieving ≥0.35µg/mL IgG as measured by ELISA or OPA titres above the defined LLOQs, may be required during the assessment of the type II variation.

## MS comments:

Comments were submitted by BE. They are partly endorsed.

1. BE  did not accept  the MAH's  conclusion  that  the  antibody  persistence  was  generally comparable  between  the  groups,  and  specifically  refer  to  statistically  significant  differences between the groups.

The Rapporteur agrees that there are slight but statistically significant differences between the groups, and  the  MAH  has  also  clearly  stated  these  differences  (serogroup  18C  for  ELISA  IgG  GMCs  and serogroups  4  and  18C  for  OPA  GMTs).  Thus,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Rapporteur  no  further  action regarding this question is necessary at this stage.

2. BE did not endorse the Rapporteur's comment that the GMC point estimates for the 7 common serotypes were higher for the 7v/7v/13v group compared to the other two groups, especially the 13v/13v/13v group. The BE assessor comments that the point estimates were in fact lower for two serotypes.

The  Rapporteur  agrees  that  the  point  estimates  were  in  fact  slightly  lower  in  two  cases,  but  the differences were very small and not statistically significant and it is therefore not correct to state that the GMCs were in fact lower in one group or the other. The only significantly different results between the groups point in the direction of lower titres in the 13v/13v/13v group. This can also be expected, as it is reasonable that there is some immune interference with increasing number of serotypes. This has been described previously for Prevenar 13 vs Prevenar, and for Synflorix vs Prevenar. It is also a well known phenomenon when increasing the number of antigens using concomitant vaccinations with several different vaccines.

3. BE  did  not  endorse  the  comment  that  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  difference  between  the groups  is  unknown,  as  differences  in  clinical  protection  are  only  expected  to  occur  when differences in efficacy parameters are statistically significant.

The Rapporteur does not agree with this comment. A small difference in GMC or GMT is unlikely to have an impact on the clinical protection but it may very well be statistically significant if the study is adequately  powered  to  detect  small  differences.  Likewise,  a  difference  between  groups  that  is  not statistically  significant  may  in  fact  prove  to  be  important,  if  the  difference  is  large.  The  lack  of statistical  significance  may  be  the  result  of  an  underpowered  study,  rather  than  a  true  lack  of difference  between  the  groups.  The  Rapporteur  still  consider  the  clinical  relevance  of  differences  in GMCs  and  GMTs  unknown,  as  it  is  currently  not  known  if  high  antibody  levels  are  required  for protection, or if the presence of immunological memory provides sufficient protection.

4. BE  commented  that  the  persistence  of  antibody  to  the  additional  serotypes  was  not commented in the PVAR. The following comment was given:

When considering persistence of IgG against serotypes 3 and 5 (Table 9-3), it should be noted that pre-dose GMC are strictly comparable across the three vaccine groups. In other words, priming and boosting with the 13v vaccine (or priming with the 7v and boosting with the 13v) results in GMC that are comparable to the GMC obtained after priming and boosting with the 7 valent Prevenar vaccine that does not provide any protection against these serotypes. When considering  functional  antibody  (Table  9-4),  comparable  pre-dose  GMT  are  observed  for serotypes 1, 3, 5 and 7F between the 13v/13v/13v and the 7v/7v/13v schedule.

The  rapporteur  agrees  with  this  comment.  However,  regarding  serogroup  3,  several  previously reported studies have noted relatively poor memory responses to this serogroup, and the responses are very often similar to the primary responses. The rapporteur would like to emphasise that it is not possible  to  conclude  that  7v  Prevenar  is  able  to  prime  against  any  additional  serogroups  based  on these results.

5. BE proposed the two following requests for supplementary information:
1. The proportion of subjects showing GMT ≥ LLOQ for serotypes 4 and 18C at the pre-dose time point in the 13v/13v/13v, 7v/7v/13v and 7v/13v/13v groups should be submitted.
2. 2.  No  clinical  protection  at  the  pre-dose  time  point  (=24  months  after  the  toddler  dose)  is expected for additional serotypes 1, 3 and 5 in the 13v/13v/13v group since GMT were very low and strictly comparable with those of the 7v/7v/13v group, not expected to provide any clinical protection. The proportion of subjects showing GMT ≥ LLOQ for serotypes 1, 3 and 5 at the  pre-dose  time  point  in  the  13v/13v/13v,  7v/7v/13v  and  7v/13v/13v  groups  should  be submitted and the need for a fifth vaccine dose should be discussed.

The Rapporteur prefers not to prolong this procedure with additional questions, as a type II variation is proposed by the MAH. As stated above, the MAH has submitted the results of the study according to the  study  protocol,  and  by  that  the  FUM  is  considered  fulfilled.  The  additional  information  will  be requested in the upcoming type II variation.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

This  procedure  is  considered  fulfilled  as  the  MAH  has  submitted  the  full  report  for  paediatric  study 6096A1-3021, and has committed to submission of a type II variation.

##  Recommendation

## Fulfilled: X

Type II variation to be requested from the MAH by 2011-11-18

## Not fulfilled:

## IV. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED
