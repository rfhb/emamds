## INTRODUCTION

Prepandemic  influenza  vaccine  (H5N1)  (split  virion,  inactivated,  adjuvanted)  GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (further referred to as Prepandemic influenza vaccine) was granted Marketing Authorisations in the EU in September 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data outside of this age range.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from the A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG14). This strain was produced by reverse genetics at NIBSC.

The  vaccine  also  contains  the  marketing  authorisation  holder's  (MAH)  proprietary  adjuvant  AS03, which is composed of squalene, DLα -tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The MAH applied to update sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC to extend the use of Prepandemic influenza vaccine in adults above 60 years of age. The annex II and package leaflet (PL) were updated accordingly. In support of this variation the MAH initially submitted new clinical data from Study 010 (for more details see below under the 'clinical aspects' section) which included safety and immunogenicity data to Day 51. The MAH further submitted immunogenicity and safety data up to Day 180 in answers to questions. In  submitting  the  above  mentioned  data  from  study  010  the  MAH  also  fulfilled  the  commitments 20 (initial report of study 010), 24.1 (cell mediated immunity (CMI) data from study 010) and 20.1 (D180 data from study 010). CLINICAL ASPECTS CLINICAL IMMUNOGENICITY Study 010 The study commenced 15 November 2006 and was conducted at 7 sites in Belgium and 5 sites in Italy. This open label study compared administration of two single or two double doses on D0 and on D21. Double doses were given as two injections of the licensed vaccine i.e . one injection into each arm. The comparative  groups  received  single  or  double  doses  of  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  of  the  same  HA content. Randomisation (by the MAH's automated system) was arranged such that the ratio of subjects receiving  adjuvanted:non-adjuvanted  vaccine  was  3:1  regardless  of  the  HA  dose.  After  D180  there would  be  an  extended  follow-up  for  subjects  enrolled  in  Belgium  with  visits  at  Month  12  and  at Month 24. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Chronic administration of immune-modifying  drugs within 6 months of D0  or any immunodeficiency

The  study  planned  to  enrol  480  subjects  aged  61  years  and  above  (no  upper  age  limit).  At randomisation  subjects  in  each  group  were  stratified  by  age  group:  61-65  years,  66-70  years  and &gt;70 years with the allocation ratio 1:1:1. A  breakdown  of  subjects  by  age  subgroups  (60-65,  66-70,  71-75,  76-80  and  &gt;80  year-old)  was requested. The number of subjects was low in each of the age strata above 71 years of age (see below). Subjects were not eligible for the study if any of the following applied: · Administration of licensed MF59-containing vaccines or virosome-based influenza vaccines during the 2006-2007 influenza season · Administration of licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrolment or planned administration of another vaccine before D51 Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Alcohol or drug abuse
- History of hypersensitivity to vaccines, allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine
- Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality
- Acute disease at the time of enrolment
- Serious chronic disease
- Administration of immunoglobulin and/or any blood products within 3 months of D0
- Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) within 30 days of D0

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects were randomised to the groups shown in the diagram with a ratio 3:1:3:1.

All subjects not previously vaccinated with an influenza vaccine for the 2006-2007 season received Fluarix (a split virion, inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine) at least 3 weeks before D0 in order to help standardise any effect of prior seasonal influenza vaccination on responses to H5N1 vaccine.

Blood samples were to be collected at D0, 21, 42 and 180 for all subjects, and at visits Month 12 and Month 24 for subjects in Belgium. In addition, blood and urine was collected for safety assessments (biochemistry and haematology) at Day 0, 2, 21 and 23.

## The primary objectives were:

- To evaluate immune responses to single or double doses at D21 and D42 for haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and at D42 for NA (neutralising antibodies).

· To assess antibody persistence at D180, Month 12 and Month 24 The secondary objectives were: · To evaluate safety/reactogenicity of the dosing regimens studied · To measure percentage, intensity  and  relationship  to  vaccination  of  solicited  local  and  general signs and symptoms during a 7-Day follow-up period after each dose of vaccine and overall · To measure percentage, intensity and relationship to vaccination of unsolicited local and general signs and symptoms during 21 days after the first and 30 days after the second dose · To record SAEs (serious adverse events) during the entire study period · To evaluate haematological and biochemical parameters · To  evaluate  CMI  at  D0,  21,  42  and  180  for  all  subjects  and  at  Month  12  and  24  for  Belgian subjects The target sample size of 480 (180 subjects in each adjuvanted group and 60 in each non-adjuvanted group) was expected to provide 456 evaluable subjects taking into account a 5% drop out rate. Based on HI GMTs (geometric mean titres) 170 evaluable subjects would provide 86% power to detect a 1.7fold difference between the two adjuvanted vaccine groups assuming standard deviations of 0.738 and 0.656 (log10 unit) for the double and single adjuvanted vaccine dose groups (based on results from study 007 results) and using a t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level (PASS, 2005). To address the FDA CBER criteria it was calculated that 85 evaluable subjects in the geriatric age range  (&gt;  65  years)  in  the  7.5/AS03  and  3.8/AS03  vaccine  groups  would  provide  the  following estimates for probabilities of success: · If the true seroconversion rate observed in the adjuvanted AS03 group was 82.0%, the probability of obtaining an observed lower limit ≥ 30% was larger than 99%. · If  the  true  seroprotection  rate  observed  in  the  adjuvanted  AS03  group  was  84.0%,  then  the probability of obtaining an observed lower limit ≥ 60% was larger than 99%. The protocol defined the following populations (using the MAH's standard definitions): · Total Vaccinated cohort · According-To-Protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of safety · According To Protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of immunogenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

An interim analysis on the first 100 enrolled subjects was planned at Day 7 in order to provide a safety evaluation and was conducted by a GSK Internal Safety Monitoring Board. Data collected up to Day 21  after  the  first  vaccination  was  also  made  available  to  the  Board  to  detect  potential  early  safety signals (and stop enrolment at this point until the safety analysis was performed). This interim analysis actually concerned review of Grade 3 solicited symptoms in 20% per study group at Day 7.

The decision whether to stop or continue was to be postponed until the analysis at Day 7 for those subjects who had already been vaccinated had been carried out. After the analysis at Day 7 the Board could halt further enrolment and/or vaccination in a given group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main analysis was to be performed when all data on HI immune responses and safety up to D51 became available.  A  further  analysis  would  be  performed  on  immune  responses  and  safety  (SAEs) obtained  between  Day  51  and  Day  180.  Additional  analyses  will  be  performed  on  safety  and immunogenicity data obtained at Month 12 and Month 24 from subjects in Belgium.

## Results

There were 437 subjects enrolled and vaccinated as shown below:

The overall range of ages at the time of vaccination was 61-89 years. The mean age was similar across all  four  groups  ranging  from  69.7  and  70.8  years.  The  overall  male-female  subject  ratio  was  1.18 (54.2%:45.8%) and 97% (424 subjects) were of Caucasian/European heritage with 3% (13 subjects) of Arabic/north African heritage.

Of the 12 subjects eliminated from the ATP safety cohort (one other was erroneously eliminated but was  counted  as  eliminated  in  the  table,  which  counts  13  eliminated),  3  received  concomitant vaccination forbidden by the protocol and 9 did not receive vaccine doses according to protocol. Of the 29 subjects eliminated from the ATP immunogenicity cohort (some had more than one reason to  be  eliminated),  15  had  unknown  pre-vaccination  antibody  status,  4  did  not  comply  with  the vaccination schedule and 15 were non-compliant with the blood sampling schedule. As the percentage of subjects excluded from the ATP cohort for immunogenicity was &gt; 5% ( i.e. 9.6%) the analyses for immunogenicity were also performed on the Total Vaccinated Cohort. However, the results  were  very  similar  to  those  for  the  ATP  Immunogenicity Cohort  and  therefore  only  the  ATP cohort data are presented and discussed in this assessment report.

## HI responses

Prior  to  vaccination,  151/395  (38.2%)  subjects  were  seropositive  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  but only 8/395 (2%) subjects were seropositive against A/Indonesia/5/2005. Pre-vaccination GMTs were low (8.8-11.3 and 5.0-5.2 against respective strains).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam increased significantly at D21 and at D42 compared to D0 in the adjuvanted vaccine groups and at D42 compared to Day 0 in the group that received 7.5 µg HA alone. At D42 the seropositivity rates were significantly higher in the adjuvanted groups (93.4% and  97.9%)  compared  to  the  non-adjuvanted  groups  (72.7%  and  66.7%).  The GMTs increased significantly in the adjuvanted groups at D21 (50.0-69.4) and at D42 (126.8-237.3) but there were only small  increments  in  the  non-adjuvanted  groups.  At  D42  the  GMT  was  significantly  higher  in  the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group.

The seropositivity  rates against A/Indonesia at  D21  were  higher  in  the  adjuvanted  groups  (23.7% and 33.1% versus 3.7% and 11.4% in the non-adjuvanted groups). At D42 the rates in the adjuvanted groups increased significantly compared to D21 (54.6% and 74.5%) and were significantly higher than in the non-adjuvanted groups (13.0% and 18.2%). The GMTs increased significantly compared to Day 0 after each vaccination dose only in the adjuvanted groups. At D42 the GMT and the seropositivity rate were significantly higher in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group.

Based  on GMTs a  clear  adjuvant  effect  was  demonstrated  at  D42  for  HI  responses  in  the  single injection  and  double  injection  groups  against  A/Vietnam  and  A/Indonesia.  There  was  also  a  dose effect between the two adjuvanted groups at D42 for HI responses to both strains. In contrast there was no significant dose effect between the two non-adjuvanted groups. Study 010 extended into study 021 to assess the persistence of the immune response and rates of SAEs up to D180. The MAH  provided HI antibody responses against A/Indonesia/2005/05 and A/Vietnam/1194/2004  in  all  groups  at  Day  180.  At  6  months  after  the  primary  vaccination  the proportion  of  subjects  seropositive  for  HI  antibody  against  both  strains  was  still  higher  in  the adjuvanted vaccine groups compared to the unadjuvanted HA groups. However, the difference was notable only for antibody against A/Vietnam. By  D180  the  GMT  values  had  decreased  compared  to  Day  42  but  were  higher  in  the  adjuvanted vaccine groups (see below). Again, the difference was notable only for antibody against A/Vietnam. In addition, the GMT for HI against A/Vietnam was higher in the group that had received a double dose of vaccine at each of D0 and D21 although the 95% CI overlapped.

The seroconversion  rates (SCR)  against A/Vietnam were  &gt;30%  in  the  two  adjuvanted  vaccine groups at D21 (45.4% and 52.4%) and increased significantly again at D42 (72.4% and 88.3%) with an advantage in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group. The 30% SCR threshold was not reached in the non-adjuvanted groups. Against A/Indonesia the threshold was reached only in the group that received 7.5 µg HA + AS03 and only at D42. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As  seen  with  GMTs,  the  SCRs  showed  a  clear  adjuvant  effect  and  a  dose  effect  between  the  two adjuvanted groups at D42 for HI responses to both strains. Higher response against A/Vietnam/194/2004 was also observed in the adjuvanted groups at Day 180. The CHMP criteria for SCR was met in the 3.8/AS and 7.5/AS groups at D180. In contrast there was no dose effect between the two non-adjuvanted groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since 38% of subjects in this older population were seropositive against A/Vietnam at D0 the SCRs were analysed according to baseline serostatus. As shown in the figure below the SCR was &gt;30% in the adjuvanted vaccine groups at D21 (44.4% and 55.8%) regardless of the pre-vaccination immune status. The SCR increased significantly further (to reach 73.3% and 94.6%) at D42 for subjects in the adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  who  were  seronegative  to  A/Vietnam  before  vaccination  and  was significantly higher in the group that received the double dose. In the non-adjuvanted groups the 30% threshold was only reached by initially seropositive subjects in the double dose group at D42.

The seroconversion factors (SCF) exceeded 2.0 against A/Vietnam in three of the four groups at D21 and  by  all  groups  at  D42.  Values  were  higher  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  and  significantly higher in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group. The threshold was only reached against A/Indonesia in the adjuvanted groups at D42 and again there was an advantage for the higher HA dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As for SCR, higher responses were observed against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the adjuvanted groups. The CHMP criteria for SCF was still met in the 3.8/AS and 7.5/AS groups at D180. In contrast there was no dose effect between the two non-adjuvanted groups.

As shown in the first figure below, the seroprotection rates (SPRs) were &gt;60% against A/Vietnam at D21 in both adjuvanted groups (61.2% and 62.1%) with further significant increases at D42 (83.6% and 95.9%). The threshold was not met in the non-adjuvanted groups. The SPRs against A/Indonesia were low at D21 in the adjuvanted groups (3.3% - 9.0%) and increased to 23% - 41% at D42.

The second figure below shows the SPRs against A/Vietnam according to initial sero-status.

In the initially seropositive subset there were significant increases at D21 in the adjuvanted groups and the  double  dose  non-adjuvanted  group  (85.5%,  82.7%  and  68.8%,  respectively).  In  the  single  dose non-adjuvanted group the rate reached 42.9%. There were only modest increments between D21 and D42 in these groups. In  the  initially  seronegative  subset  the  D21  SPRs  were  14.3%  -  50.5%.  At  D42  the  threshold  was reached in the two adjuvanted vaccine groups (73.3% and 94.6%) and the rate was significantly higher in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group.

At Day 180, the criterion for SPR for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was met for the 7.5/AS group (69.5% compared to 52.9% in the single dose group). The criterion was not met in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising antibody responses Neutralising antibody titres were measured at D0 and D42 against A/Indonesia/5/2005 only and in a subset of subjects from the adjuvanted groups. In this older population a high proportion of subjects were already seropositive for NA to A/Indonesia before  vaccination  (65.5%  and  58.5%).  Nevertheless  at  D42  the  rates  had  increased  to  94.3%  and 100%). The D0 GMTs were similar and increased significantly at D42 as shown below.

At D42 the SCR was higher in the double dose group. The NA response against A/Indonesia/5/2005 observed six months after the primary vaccination series paralleled the HI responses in the adjuvanted groups. Cell-mediated immune response Antigen-specific  Th1  CD4  T-cell  responses  were  elicited  in  all  study  groups  but  were  of  lower amplitude in the two non-adjuvanted groups compared to the adjuvanted groups. There were marked increases at D42 in the adjuvanted groups only. CD8 T-cells responses were nearly absent in all the study groups. At Day 180, the level of Th1 CD4 T-cell response against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 had decreased from D42 but was higher in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. No CD8 T cell response was observed in any group at this time-point. Stratified analysis (61-70, 71-80, &gt;80 years of age) A breakdown of subjects by age in the entire study was provided covering pre- and post-vaccination serological findings by age sub-groups. The impact of age on immunogenicity was evaluated in terms of the HI antibody response against both A/Vietnam/1194/2007 and A/Indonesia/05/2005. The breakdown of HI responses by age analysis was further stratified by serostatus, especially in the above 80 years, to account for seropositivity for HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/2004. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A trend of increased seropositivity with age against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was observed, especially for subjects aged above 80 years where about 60% of subjects were seropositive at baseline in each treatment group, noting that the denominators were small. In contrast the pre-vaccination seropositivity rates for HI against A/Indonesia/05/2005 were negligible across the different groups and no effect of age was evident.

## Geometric mean titres

The  pre-vaccination  GMTs  of  HI  antibody  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  were  low  and  were  not different across age groups (range from 7.0 - 14.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At  Day  42  HI  GMTs  for  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  did  not  vary  much  across  age  groups  in  subjects vaccinated with 1x3.8AD and aged up to 80 years but a much lower GMT was observed in those aged &gt; 80 years. The age-related effect was more apparent in the groups that received two doses of vaccine at each of D0 and D21, for whom GMTs were anyway higher as was noted previously for the entire study population.

As already observed for the whole study population, higher GMTs levels were observed in all age groups at Day 42 in those who received 2x3.8AD (101.9 - 305.9). In addition in subjects vaccinated with 2x3.8AD there was a clear trend for decreasing GMTs from 65 years of age onwards.

The HI GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 at Day 42 were much lower. Nevertheless, there was a trend for a decrease with age irrespective of the vaccination schedule.

A  stratified  analysis  showed  that  subjects  which  were  seropositive  before  vaccination  developed higher  GMTs  against  A/Vietnam/1094/2004  after  vaccination.  There  were  too  few  subjects  in  the A/Indonesia/05/2005 arm to interpret the findings. Seroprotection rates The CHMP criterion for SPR in this age group (&gt;60%) was met in the two adjuvanted groups against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in every age group at Day 42 irrespective of the HA dose injected. However, the  60%  rate  was  only  just  exceeded  by  subjects  aged  &gt;  80  years  who  received  a  single  dose  of vaccine at D0 and D21. In  general  baseline  serostatus  did  not  have  major  impact  on  the  percentages  that  met  the  SPR threshold. Nevertheless, in most of the age groups, subjects who were seropositive before vaccination achieved  higher  SPRs  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  after  vaccination  with  either  1x3.8AD  or 2x3.8AD. All age sub-groups meet the CHMP criterion at Day 42 regardless of baseline serostatus except for those aged &gt; 80 years who were seronegative at baseline and received a single dose at D0 and at D21. None of these five subjects was seroprotected even at D42. In  line  with  the  overall  analysis  of  the  study  already  presented  the  &gt;60%  SPR  threshold  for  HI antibody  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  was  not  met  by  any  of  the  sub-groups  at  Day  42.  The  SPRs tended  to  decrease  with  age  from  70  years  onwards  and  were  slightly  higher  at  Day  42  after vaccination with 2x3.8AD compared to 1x3.8AD Seroconversion rates The  CHMP criterion  for  SCR  in  this  age  group  (&gt;30%)  was  met  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  in every  age  group  at  Day  42  irrespective  of  the  HA  dose  injected.  However,  rates  were  lowest  in subjects aged &gt; 80 years whether one or two doses were given at each of D0 and D42. This suggests a reduced ability to respond to vaccination with increasing age. Baseline serostatus did not seem to have much impact on the ability to meet the SCR threshold. All age sub-groups meet the criterion at Day 42 regardless of baseline with the exception that none of the five  subjects  aged  &gt;  80  years  who  were  seronegative  before  vaccination  and  received  1x3.8AD seroconverted.

The &gt;30% SCR threshold for HI antibody against A/Indonesia/05/2005 was met at Day 42 in subjects aged up to 80 years who were vaccinated with 2x3.8AD while no subject in the 1x3.8AD sub-groups met the SCR criterion.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Study 010 demonstrated overall that the current vaccine (i.e. 3.8 µg HA + AS03) administered at D0 and again at D21 elicited HI antibody responses directed against homologous virus at D42 that met the three  CHMP criteria  applicable  to  subjects  aged  &gt;  60  years  and  also  met  the  criteria  applicable  to subjects aged from 18-60 years. In addition, all three criteria were met at D42 regardless of baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

serostatus and two were met at D21 in the subset that was seronegative at baseline (the exception was the SPR).

However, the data obtained at D42 indicated a numerical advantage for administration of two doses at D0  and  another  two  doses  at  D21  when  compared  to  the  recommended  regimen.  This  overall advantage  for  double  doses  was  mainly  driven  by  results  in  the  previously  seronegative  subpopulation.

It was also noted that:

- o Two administrations  of  adjuvanted  vaccine  (whether  a  single  or  double  dose  was  given)  were necessary to fully meet the CHMP criteria in previously seronegative subjects aged &gt; 60 years

o Two administrations of 3.8 µg HA + AS03 at D0 and D21 gave responses at D42 that were better than seen at D21 after administration of 7.5 µg HA + AS03 o Comparison of the D21 results between the two adjuvanted vaccine dose groups did not show a significant advantage for a double dose at D0 versus a single dose at D0. The additional analyses of HI data to D42 by age strata and by baseline serostatus demonstrated that: ¾ The pre-vaccination seropositivity rate increased with age for HI antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 particularly in the subjects aged &gt; 80 years whereas baseline seropositivity rates were low in each age stratum against A/Indonesia/05/2005. ¾ Overall HI antibody responses against A/Vietnam at D42 in each age sub-group met all CHMP criteria for subjects aged &gt; 60 years regardless whether or not a double dose of HA was given. However, there was a clear trend for lower HI responses with increasing age, especially in those aged &gt; 80 years. ¾ Further analyses by baseline serostatus showed an almost complete lack of response to a single dose at each of D0 and at D21 in the very few subjects aged &gt; 80 years who were seronegative at baseline and in sharp contrast with the results for those aged &gt; 80 years who were seropositive at baseline. ¾ The risk of being seronegative at baseline decreases with increasing age and baseline serostatus would not  be  determined  either  in  a  pre-pandemic  or  pandemic  situation.  Based  on  study  010 about half of subjects aged &gt; 80 years are at high risk of failing to develop a seroprotective HI response when vaccinated according to the current SPC. ¾ In subjects aged &lt; 80 years the seroprotection rates by age sub-groups were slightly lower with a single dose compared to a double dose at D42 but the SPR criterion even for younger subjects was met (i.e. rates exceeded 70%) regardless of baseline serostatus. ¾ NA against A/Vietnam to D42 showed very high baseline antibody levels but there was a good response to vaccination. At Day 42, a trend for a higher SCR was observed in the 7.5/AS group compared to the 3.8/AS group. However, percentages of subjects that reached NA titres of 1:40 and 1:80 were comparable between adjuvanted dose groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The additional data on HI and NA at D180 showed a continued advantage for adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted vaccine and a numerical advantage for a double dose of adjuvanted vaccine versus a single dose  based  on  application  of  the  CHMP  criteria  to  the  HI  data  and  on  comparison  of  NA  data generated  in  a  subset.  However,  the  SCR  and  SCF  criteria  were  still  met  in  both  adjuvanted  dose groups and the only appreciable difference was that the double dose group still met (just) the SPR criterion while the single dose group did not.

## CLINICAL SAFETY

## Study 010

The  H5N1-010  experimental  design  included  four  groups:  3.8/AS  (180  subjects),  3.8/NoAS:  (60 subjects),  7.5/AS  (180  subjects)  and  7.5/NoAS'  (60  subjects).  One  hundred  and  sixty  five  (165) subjects  &gt;  60  years  received  the  proposed  dose  of  3.8 μ g/AS03,  whereas  159  subjects  received  a double dose of 7.5 μ g/AS03 in the safety cohort.

The  incidence  of  symptoms,  and  especially  local  symptoms,  was  higher  in  groups  that  received adjuvanted  vaccine  compared  to  those  given  non-adjuvanted  vaccine.  There  were  also  more  local solicited symptoms causally related to vaccination in the adjuvanted groups than the non-adjuvanted groups following each dose and overall. Subjects in the non-adjuvanted groups reported more general than  local  symptoms  whereas  the  reverse  reporting  pattern  applied  in  the  two  adjuvanted  vaccine groups.  However,  there  were  few  Grade  3  local  and  general  solicited  symptoms  reported  and  no significant difference in reporting of grade 3 symptoms was observed between groups.

Rates  of  reporting  local  symptoms  of  pain,  redness  and  swelling  were  significantly  higher  in  the 3.8 µg  HA + AS03 group than in the 3.8 µg HA alone group. Pain and redness also occurred at a significantly higher rate in the group given 7.5 µg HA + AS03 compared to the group that received 7.5 µg HA alone. Between the adjuvanted groups the effect of dose of HA on rates of local symptoms was not consistent  although  slightly  higher  rates  of  pain  and  redness  were  seen  in  the  double  dose group. Up to D51 there were no Grade 3 local solicited symptoms reported in the non-adjuvanted groups and there  were  only  three  subjects  with  grade  3  local  solicited  symptoms  in  the  adjuvanted  groups  (all were in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group; 2 with Grade 3 pain, 1 with grade 3 redness). Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local symptom in the adjuvanted vaccine groups after each administration, followed by redness, swelling, induration and ecchymosis. However, there  was  no  consistent  increase  in  the  incidence  of  local  solicited  symptoms  of  any  type  or  grade between Dose 1 and Dose 2. As shown in the figure below: · Fatigue was the most frequently reported general symptom in the adjuvanted vaccine groups (12.9% to 17.3% compared to 7-8% in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups) but rates of Grade 3 fatigue were &lt; 2%. · Headache was reported in 10.8% to 14.4% compared to 2-7% in respective groups but the rates for Grade 3 headache were &lt; 1%. · Myalgia was also more frequently reported in the adjuvanted vaccine groups (8.6% to 11.5% compared to 4-5%) but rates of Grade 3 myalgia were &lt; 1.5%. · Rates  of  other  general  symptoms,  including  fever,  were  low  but  usually  higher  in  the adjuvanted vaccine groups.

There  were  no  new  concerns  or  unexpected  findings  in  the  safety  data  obtained  from  this  older population.

Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were reported by 88/437 subjects of which 11 reported at least one grade 3 unsolicited AE and 22 reported at least one unsolicited AE considered to be causally related to vaccination.  The  overall  incidences  of  unsolicited  AEs  and  unsolicited  AEs  considered  related  to vaccination  were  not  different  between  the  adjuvanted  and  non-adjuvanted  groups  (based  on overlapping 95% CIs). There were 5 SAEs reported by 4 subjects up to the initial D51 data lock point. These were clearly intercurrent  illnesses  unrelated  to  vaccination,  none  was  fatal  and  all  were  resolved.  SAEs  were reported  between  Day  52  and  Day  180  with  a  data  lock  point  of  15  December,  2008.  During  this period 13 subjects reported a total of 13 SAEs up to the data lock point. Of these SAEs; two were unresolved,  six  were  resolved  and  five  were  fatal.  The  five  fatalities  concerned  a  cerebrovascular accident (2), congestive cardiac failure (2) and ventricular fibrillation. Overall (from D0 onwards) 18 SAEs were reported by 16 subjects in this study. In  general,  the  results  of  the  biochemical  analysis  were  within  the  normal  range  except  that  up  to 28.2% showed elevated blood urea nitrogen values. There were eight non-fatal adverse events during the extended safety follow-up period. None of these SAEs were assessed by the investigators as related to the vaccination. Discussion on clinical safety There were very few Grade 3 solicited and unsolicited AEs reported and no differences were observed between groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As expected from previous studies in younger adults the incidence of symptoms (local in particular) was higher in the adjuvanted vaccine groups than in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. The effect of dose was relatively unimportant or not detectable. There were no new concerns or unexpected findings in the safety data obtained from this older population up to D180.

## RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN

The risk management plan (RMP) for Prepandemic influenza vaccine had been previously assessed through a follow-up measure. A revised version (version 6) was  provided to incorporate additional information relevant to use in subjects aged &gt; 60 years. However, the revised RMP differed from the previous  versions  submitted  in  October  2008  only  in  minor  textual  amendments.  Data  from  study H5N1-010 relevant to the elderly variation were included in the previous versions of the RMPs and the discussion of these data remains the same in the new versions with no new safety concerns identified.

## BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT

Benefits The immunogenicity data are sufficient to support approval of Prepandemic influenza vaccine for use from  the  age  of  18 years  onwards.  This  conclusion  reflects  CHMP's  previous  discussion  on extrapolation  of  data  generated  with  A/Vietnam  vaccine  in  the  elderly  to  Prepandemic  influenza vaccine containing A/Indonesia. In this regard, while baseline seropositivity rates are lower against A/Indonesia study 010 clearly demonstrated that the CHMP criteria were met regardless of baseline serostatus except for subjects aged &gt; 80 years. Risks The assessment has to be made based on safety and immunogenicity data, including fulfilment of the three  CHMP  criteria  that  are  applied  to  seasonal  influenza  vaccines.  The  data  cannot  necessarily predict protection against pandemic influenza. The  additional  safety  data  do  not  raise  any  new  concerns  for  use  of  AS03-adjuvanted  vaccine  in subjects aged &gt; 60 years. The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine is commonly or very commonly associated with a range of local and systemic adverse reactions but these are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile does not preclude the use of the vaccine in subjects aged &gt; 60 years. Balance The data specific to use in subjects aged &gt; 60 years support a favourable risk-benefit relationship. Conclusion The benefit-risk relationship is favourable for use in subjects aged &gt; 60 years. CONCLUSION Medicinal product no longer authorised

On 29 May 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable  and  agreed  on  the amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics, annex II and package leaflet, subject to the additional commitments undertaken.
