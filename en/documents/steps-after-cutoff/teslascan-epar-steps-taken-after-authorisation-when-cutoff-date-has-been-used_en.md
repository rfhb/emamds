Medicinal product no longer authorise · In  March  1998,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  a  request  to  the  European Commission to change the spelling and wording of the Spanish labels and package leaflet to bring  them  more  into  line  with  the  English  text  as  adopted  in  the  CPMP  Opinion.  The Commission approved the changes by means of a Corrigendum adopted on 26 March 1998. · Pursuant  to  Article  10(3)  of  Council  Directive  92/27/EEC  of  31  March  1992,  the  Marketing Authorisation Holder notified the EMEA on 18 February 1999 of their intention to introduce changes  to  aspects  of  the  labelling  not  connected  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics (changes  in  contact  details  of  locan  representatives  in  the  Package  Leaflet).    The  EMEA approved this Notification on 24 February 1999. · On  3  March  1999,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  to  the  EMEA  three applications for Type I variations. The EMEA approved these variations on 31 March 1999. The applications related to: 1. A change in the name of a contract manufacturer of the finished product. 2. A minor change of manufacturing process of the active substance. 3. Minor changes in the manufacture of the medicinal product. Subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications agreed upon are summarised in the table below: 1 In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 of 10 March 1995, as amended: I refers to a minor variation (Type I variation); II refers to a major variation (Type II variation); I/II refers to a minor variation following the procedure set out in Article 6, 7 and 8 of the Regulation; X refers to an Annex II application. T refers to a transfer of a Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2141/96 of 7 November 1996. N refers to a notification in accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Directive 92/27/EEC of 31 March 1992.

2 For Notifications and Type I variations, the date of entry into force of the change is the EMEA Notification date. The Commission Decision will be amended accordingly.
